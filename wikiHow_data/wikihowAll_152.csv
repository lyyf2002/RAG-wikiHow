Choose a nylon leash if you want variety.,
Select a leather leash to last over time.,
Consider a cotton leash.,
Stay away from chain leashes.,
Avoid rubber or bungee leashes.",How to Choose a Dog Leash1," Available in nearly every color of the rainbow, nylon leashes are also relatively inexpensive and strong. They are durable and good for rainy or humid environments. Since they are lightweight and easy to handle, nylon leashes are good to use when training a puppy.Nylon leashes can become slippery when wet, so do not use them while swimming with your dog.
If your dog tends to suddenly jerk away when a cat or squirrel is nearby, avoid nylon leashes. They can cause a painful leash burn on your hand when this happens.;
, Durable, high-quality leather leashes will last for years. As a natural material, leather has innate give and will soften over time. Keep in mind that you will need to treat your leather leash with a leather conditioner occasionally to keep it in good shape.A leather leash will not be harmful to your dog’s teeth if they bite it.
Leather leashes can be expensive. Check online retailers for variety and discounts.

, Although they can be difficult to find, cotton leashes offer benefits like being easy on your hands and slightly flexible. They are also excellent in water, such as for swimming.Online general and pet supply retailers are good sources for finding cotton leashes.
Cotton leashes are usually inexpensive, but they are prone to wear and tear., Although they are relatively inexpensive, chain leashes are heavy and ineffective for training purposes. They can also injure your dog's mouth or teeth if they chew on them.Another reason to avoid chain leashes is that they are heavy and can be very tough on your hands., Because it is so flexible, rubber is a tricky material for leashes. It allows the dog to pull you on every step, and it will be harder to correct your dog."

Use a rope.,
Use string.,
Use an old belt.,
Make a lead from a pair of old tights.",How to Improvise a Dog Lead1," Rope is one of the easiest things to improvise a dog lead out of. Just tie the rope or string through the clip of your dog’s harness. Make a simple knot by crossing the loose end of the rope over the long end, then pulling it through the loop. Your dog will never know the difference.The best rope will not be too thick. Rope with a diameter of about one centimeter (half an inch) is ideal.
Make a loop for the handle on an improvised lead of rope. Fold about 10 centimeters (four inches) of the lead over onto itself. Tie a loop in the rope or string, then cross the loose end over the main length once again, making a second loop. Pull it taut.;
, String, compared with rope, is thinner and therefore weaker. Select a thicker string if possible, especially if you have a strong dog who might break the improvised lead when they pull. If all you have is thin string, twine several equally-long pieces of it together.For instance, you might take three or four strings about eight feet (2.4 meters) long, then twist them along their lengths into a kind of rope-like braid.
With your string dog lead in hand, loop one end through the clip of your dog’s harness. Cross the loose end over the main length of the lead and pull it through the loop to secure it.

, If you have a belt that is sufficiently long (about six to eight feet, or about two to 2.5 meters), you could easily press it into service as a makeshift belt. Simply pull the end of the belt that has the clip or buckle on it through the dog’s harness, then fasten it.The best belts for this improvised dog lead will have a buckle the releases with a small button at the top, or those that snap closed.
The main disadvantage of using a belt is that you cannot make a looped handle. Wrap the end of the belt not attached to your dog’s harness around your hand if you need a better grip.

, An improvised dog lead made of nylon tights will probably not last long, but it will do in a pinch. Simply pull one leg of the tights through the clip on your dog’s harness, then tie the legs together at the ankles. The lead will essentially be just one big loop."

Assess the pros and cons of retractable leashes.,
Decide on length.,
Choose a long line leash for distance training.,
Select a coupler leash if you’re walking multiple dogs.,
Think about thickness.",How to Choose a Dog Leash2," These leashes, which are comprised of a long cord (15 – 30 feet or 4.6 – 9 meters) rolled around a spool inside a handle, allow you to lengthen, shorten, and lock them with the push of a button. They also allow your dog freedom, because the cord will release as they walk away and retract as they return. Because you will have little control over your pet when using these, they cannot be used for training.Trainers recommend that retractable leashes only be used with mature dogs who have already been trained on a regular leash.
They may teach your dog that it is okay to pull away.Sometimes the retractable cords are thin and snap easily, so they often are not as safe as conventional leashes.
If you drop the handle while the cord is extended, it may quickly retract to your dog's collar, which may harm or frighten your dog.

, If you live in the city, a 4-foot (1.2-meter) leash will give you enough length to let your dog wander a bit but also stay safe. Dog owners who live in the suburbs may be happy with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) lead, which is the most common length for leashes.Short pull tab leashes, ranging between 10 and 12 inches (25 and 30 cm), are useful for controlling your dog as you take them in and out of the car., Long line leashes are very long, up to 60 feet (18.3 meters), and are useful for training your dog to “come” from increasingly greater distances. You should only use these in a large field or yard.Remember to keep the long line rope to your dog’s side instead of between his legs.Loop the line around your hand and wear a glove to protect your skin. The loop will help serve as a break so that you can minimize rope burn if your dog suddenly takes off., You will be able to hold one leash in your hand that attaches to a ring on a coupler. Two short leashes will then extend from that and attach to each dog’s collar.If you are walking two dogs of different heights, choose an adjustable coupler, so your tall dog doesn’t drag your shorter one., Larger dogs require wider leashes than smaller ones. A 3/8” (.95 cm) leash is good for a smaller dog, as thick ones can be too heavy for them.Additionally, a thicker leash is good if your dog tends to chew on the leash or pull away often."

Measure and cut your rope.,
Unravel the rope’s strands.,
Create space in the rope with a fid.,
Splice the first unraveled strand into the rope.,
Splice the second strand into the rope.,
Splice the third strand into the rope.,
Continue splicing the strands into the rope.,
Add a clasp to the rope.,
Bind the clasp end.",How to Improvise a Dog Lead2," Most dog leads are about eight feet (2.4 meters) long, so cut your rope to that length. Use nylon rope ½ inch (one centimeter) thick., Separate about five inches (12 centimeters) of the strands at one end of the rope, lengthwise. You should have three separate strands. Wrap a piece of masking tape tightly around the end of each strand to prevent further fraying., Fold the unraveled end up about five or six inches (12 to 15 centimeters). Jam a fid through the rope at this about this five or six-inch point. A fid is a kind of stake-like implement used when working with rope. If you imagine the rope as a “J” at this point, with the frayed/cut end curved back up toward the rest of the rope, you should place the fid inside the rope at a point directly across from the lower tip of the “J”.Pushing the fid through the rope will open a gap between the rope and one of its strands.

, Lie the rope on its side so that it stretches from left to right before you. Slip one of the ends you cut through the loop created by the fid. Pull and twist it through to tighten., Remove the fid, then rotate the rope slightly. Shove the fid between the strand of rope located next to the first one you threaded and the strand directly below it. Slip another of the ends you cut through the loop created by the fid. Pull and twist it through to tighten., Remove the fid, then rotate the rope slightly. Shove the fid between the strand of rope located next to the second one you threaded and the strand directly below it. Pass the final strand through the opening you made with the fid., Repeat the splicing pattern three or four more times, gradually moving up the rope (and away from the end of the rope you cut). If you want a larger handle on your lead, weave the unraveled end into the main portion of the rope at a higher point along its length. If you want a smaller handle, weave the unraveled end into the main portion of the rope at a point that is further from the opposite end., Lay the opposite end of the rope on a flat surface and curl about three inches (eight centimeters) of it around toward the opposite end. Slip a small clasp of the sort used to attach leads to dog harnesses over the short end and position it at the low end of the curve in the rope. , Position the rope in such a way that the shorter end curves up and away from you in a “J” shape. Set two rope clamps beneath the end of the rope to which you’ve attached the harness clasp. The clamps should encompass both the shorter end of the rope (the one curving backwards toward the end you spliced together) and the longer portion of the rope (the right side of the “J”). Place one clamp closer to the clasp, and place the other closer to the loose tip on the short side of the “J”.Carefully hammer the clamps closed by smashing their prongs inward so that they cover the rope.
Give the clasp a tug once you’re done. The rope should not loosen or move if the clamps have been closed properly.
If the rope is not entirely secure within the clamps, hammer them with more force to ensure your dog lead won’t come apart.

Train your dog in basic obedience.,
Gather your supplies.,
Have your dog 'sit' or 'down.',
Reward your dog with a tiny treat.,
Show your dog the bandana.,
Lay the bandana around the dog's neck.,
Remove the bandana and repeat the last step until your dog is calm and accepting of the bandana.

,
End your practice session on a positive note.,
Practice in short sessions once or twice a day until your dog will calmly wear the bandana without shaking, scratching or biting.

,
Practice with a harder piece of clothing.,
Repeat the neck hole practice until your dog is calm and unconcerned about the tee-shirt around its neck.,
Train your dog to put its legs through the sleeves.,
Continue practicing until your dog calmly lets you dress it in a tee-shirt and wears it without fighting you or the tee-shirt.

,
Find that perfect outfit.

,
Make sure the size is right.,
Dress your dog in its new clothes and you can both enjoy the attention your dog gets.

",How to Get Your Dog Used to Wearing Clothes," No dog should be asked to wear clothes unless they trust you and respond calmly to the basic obedience commands: sit, down, stay, come, heel. Dogs trained to basic obedience with food rewards or a clicker respond well to learning to wear clothes.;
, Before you find the perfect outfit, a dress, tutu, shirt and pants, or just a hat, practice with small pieces of clothing and lots of treats. A bandana or oversize tee shirt (oversize for your dog, that is) is a good way to start.

,

, You will be using lots of treats. Dogs feel rewarded by just a taste of treat, so you can give many many rewards even if they are tiny.

, Let it sniff it and treat the dog.

, Say ""Get Dressed"" or a similar command that you will use in the future. Reward and praise for calm behavior.

,, If your dog is chewing at the bandana or shaking it off or resisting in some other way, go back to just showing the bandana and rewarding calm sniffing. Stop when you have calm behavior. Practice sessions should last only 5 or 6 minutes.

,, Once the dog is not concerned about wearing a bandana, practice with an over-sized pet tee-shirt. The shirt should be big enough that the dog's head fits easily through the neck. Using the same command, ""Get Dressed,"" show the tee-shirt to the pet, then gather up the sides of the shirt and gently slide just the neck over the dog's head. You should then have a dog wearing a tee-shirt like a big bunchy collar. No legs through arm holes yet!

, Remember, always end each practice session on a positive note. Go back a step if necessary.

, Using the same graduated training, put the tee-shirt around your pets neck as in the previous step (still using the ""Get Dressed"" command and treats.) Put one hand through one sleeve from the outside of the tee-shirt to the inside. Gently raise your pet's front paw and draw it through the sleeve. Stop if there is resistance and just practice to that point.

,,, You may need to measure your dog. It is better to have the clothes a little to big than too small.

Go to a store or shop online.,
Pick an appealing pattern or color.,
Pick the right size bandana.,
Place the bandana on a smooth, clean surface.,
Fold the bandana into a triangle.,
Try a more “dapper” fold.,
Tie the bandana on with a square knot.,
Make sure the bandana is fitted correctly on your dog.,
Adjust the placement of the bandana.",How to Tie a Bandana on a Dog," You can certainly go to the nearest discount store and pick up a pack of traditional red bandanas to use to dress up your dog. However, you can also find great bandanas online through pet retail stores or dog grooming supplies stores.;
, From your favorite sports team, a biker motif, or just a cute and funny pattern, bandanas come in a huge array of patterns. Pick a simple colored bandana or a wild multi-colored pattern, whatever you desire.


Many people enjoy purchasing various themed bandanas for the seasons or various holidays.
If you are handy with a sewing machine you can make a bandana from a square of fabric with the edges finished with a simple hem.

, For small dogs or puppies a 14 inch square of cloth is good. For medium sized dogs an 18” square of cloth is good. For large dogs you should get a 22” square and for giant breed dogs a 26” square is needed., It should be unfolded, with the printed side face down. You will need to give yourself enough room so that you can lay it out and fold it easily.

, Take one corner and fold it across to the corner diagonally opposite it. Smooth the cloth so you have a nice triangle free from wrinkles.


Form a crease along the folded edge you just made.
If the bandana will still be too big for the dog you can make another fold. Match together the corners of the longest (just creased) edges together. Smooth the bandana flat once again and crease the folded edge.

, Take the just folded bandana and fold the tip opposite the longest edge toward the longest edge of the triangle. Then fold the bandana in half again, so that the tip is concealed inside the fold. Keep folding the bandana until it is the desired size for your dog. Good sizes for dogs based on size include:1 inch wide for a small dog
1 ½ inch wide for a medium dog
2 inches wide for a large dog

, Place the bandana around the dog’s neck. Hold both ends of the bandana, one in each hand. Pass the right end over the left end and then back under the left. Pass the left end over the right end and back under the right.


Tighten the knot by pulling on both ends until they don't move any further.

, You need to be able to easily fit two or more of your fingers under the bandana after you’ve tied the knot. If not, untie and retie until it fits properly.

, Some people prefer the knot on top of the dog’s neck and some under and enjoy. There is no right way to style the bandana!

Mark the length and width of his paw on a piece of paper.,
Make a paw impression.,
Use a tape measure.,
Measure the marks left on the paper.,
Compare your measurements to a sizing chart.,
Use a pictorial paw size chart.",How to Measure Dogs for Shoes," One relatively simple way to measure your dog for shoes is to place his paw on a piece of paper and mark the size. Place a sheet of paper on a hard surface that your dog can stand on. You can encourage your dog to step onto the paper by feeding him a treat. Only the paw you are measuring needs to be on the paper.


When a dog puts pressure on a paw, the paw will splay so ensure that he is putting weight on the paw you are measuring. If you measure a paw that is not splayed, the shoes will be too small.
You can do this by gently holding the opposite paw in your hand so all the dog's weight is on the paw you are measuring.
Clearly mark each side at widest point, and front and back. Don't forget to include the toenails.;
, An alternative technique for marking your dog's paw size is to wet his paw in water, and then press it down on a piece of paper. The wetness will make a paw print on the paper which will indicate the size of his paw. As with the pencil marking technique, you need to ensure that his paw is fully splayed and that you take into account his toenails.Measure the length and width of the impression left by his paw print, and use this as the basis for sizing him. Always measure at the widest point of the paw.
Different paws may be different sizes. Be sure to measure each paw individually if you are getting boots for more than one paw.

, You can also use a tape measure to determine the length and width of your dogs paws directly. Hold his paw in your hand, ensuring that it is fully splayed, and then measure across it. You could try and get your dog to stand on the tape measure if this is easier. Measure the widest part of his paw.A ruler can also work if you don't have a tape measure. You can use a ruler to measure his paw, or get him to stand on it.
Don't forget to do separate measurements for length and width.

, Once you have marked the outer edges of his paw on a piece of paper, you can simply measure the length and width of each paw with a ruler or tape measure. Record these measurements. If you are uncertain about anything, or they look too dissimilar, do some repeat measurements to make sure you have been accurate.


It's worth double-checking the size. If you buy boots that don't fit, your dog will not be able to wear them and you will have to go through the whole process again.
Incorrectly sized shoes can rotate around the foot, which creates a tripping hazard.

, When you are happy with the measurements you have made, you should look at a dog paw sizing chart. You can compare your measurements to the size guides that different dog boot manufacturers provide for their customers.


If you are ordering boots online, you will most likely need to fit your measurements to one of the sizes offered by the company.
Often these will only require a measurement of the widest part of the paw.
These sizes can range from XXXSmall at 1 1/2 inches across the widest part, all the way to XLarge at 3 1/2 inches across the widest part., Some dog shoe manufacturers have pictorial paw charts available to download and print from their websites. Be sure to print them in real size.These charts have outlines of paws of different sizes which correspond to the size of dog boots they produce. You can hold your dog's paw down against the different images to find the size that is the best fit for him.


Bear in mind that there is a limited number of sizes.
After comparing his paw to the images on the pictorial chart, make sure that your original measurements correspond and give you the same result.

Slide the bow tie over the band.,
Put the bow tie on your dog.",How to Make a Dog Bow Tie," Gently wrap a soft tape measure around the base of your dog's neck, directly where its collar would usually sit. Slide two fingers beneath the tape measure and adjust the tape as needed. Make a note of this measurement.


Alternatively, you can measure the length of your dog's collar instead of the dog's neck as long as its collar fits well.
Dog collar sizes range from extra small through extra small, depending on neck circumference:Extra small: 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm)
Small: 10 to 14 inches (25 to 36 cm)
Medium: 14 to 20 inches (36 to 51 cm)
Large: 18 to 26 inches (46 to 66 cm)
Extra large: 22 to 30 inches (56 to 76 cm)

;
, The dimensions of this rectangle will need to vary depending on the size of the dog. You'll end up folding this rectangle by its width, so the final width of the bow tie will be about half the width of this initial rectangle.


For extra small and small dogs, cut out a 4-inch by 9-inch (10-cm by 23-cm) rectangle.
For medium dogs, cut out a 6-inch by 11-inch (15-cm by 28-cm) rectangle.
For large and extra large dogs, cut out an 8-inch by 14-inch (20-cm by 36-cm) rectangle.

, The size of this strip will also vary by the size of the dog. Its width should be about four times the size of your desired finished width for the bow center, and its length should be about the same size as the width of the bow body rectangle.


For extra small and small dogs, cut out a 2-inch by 4-inch (5-cm by 10-cm) strip.
For medium dogs, cut out a 3-inch by 6-inch (8-cm by 15-cm) strip.
For large and extra large dogs, cut out a 4-inch by 8-inch (10-cm by 20-cm) strip.

, Take the measured neck circumference of your dog and add a seam allowance of 1 inch (2.5) to the length, plus another 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) for flexibility. Vary the width of the strip by the size of the dog.


For extra small and small dogs, make the strip 2 inches (5 cm) wide.
For medium dogs, make the strip 3 inches (8 cm) wide.
For large and extra large dogs, make the strip 4 inches (10 cm) wide.

, Fold the bow body fabric in half crosswise, with the right sides facing in and facing each other. Use an iron to press the folded edge flat.


Note that the width of the body should be halved during this step, but the length should not be affected.
If desired, you can pin the open edges together to help hold them in place while you sew. This may not be necessary if the folded edge is securely pressed, however.

, Using a sewing machine, sew a straight stitch over the lengthwise edge of the body rectangle and along one width/short edge, working with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance for each. Leave the other short edge open.


You can hand sew the edges together, if desired, using a backstitch or similarly durable stitch.
If you don't want to utilize any sewing skills, you could use durable fabric glue. Note that the final bow tie won't be as durable as a sewn version, though, and you'll need to wait for the glue to dry before proceeding to the next step.

, Fold the open edge in by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) around, then top stitch it closed by machine or by hand.


If the top stitching is very visible, consider adding a row of top stitching along the opposite width edge of the bow to balance out the appearance. Doing so is not strictly necessary, however.
As before, you could perform the same step using fabric glue for a no-sew alternative.

, Iron the entire bow body flat, concentrating on the four edges.


This step is more important than it may seem. If you don't press the edges flat now, the bow tie can bunch up unevenly and won't look as sharp when placed around your dog's neck.
Temporarily set aside the bow body after pressing it.

, With the right sides facing out, fold the lengthwise edges in toward the center of the strip. Then, fold the strip in half down its lengthwise center, hiding the raw edges inside the fold.


The length of the strip should be unaffected, but the width should be reduced to a quarter of its original size.
Press the folded edges of the fabric after making each fold to flatten the material and hold the folds in place.

, Machine sew or hand sew down the lengthwise edge of the folded center strip, keeping the stitching as close to the open edge as possible.


You can use a straight machine stitch for this, or opt for a more decorative top stitch if desired. Choose a durable backstitch or hidden top stitch if sewing the strip by hand.
Apply fabric glue to the open edge for a no-sew alternative. Let the glue dry before continuing.

, Pinch the lengthwise center of the bow body together, then wrap the center strip around the pinched center to hold it in place. Pin the center strip ends together behind the bow body.


You can vary the tightness of the pinch by personal preference, but a tighter pinched center will create a more defined bow shape. As a general guideline, you should try to reduce the center width of the bow body to about half of the original width.
Note that you may not need the entire length of the center strip. Simply wrap as much of the strip as needed around the center of the bow to hold it in place, and allow the excess edges to hang off toward the back.

, Machine stitch or hand stitch the center strip together just behind the pinched body of the bow. Trim down any excess material from the center strip to approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Before stitching the center closed, make sure that you can fit one finger between the bow center and the body of the bow. You'll need to slide the bow onto the collar portion using this center strip, so there needs to be some extra space. For that reason, you should also avoid stitching the center strip to the body of the bow.

, Carefully turn the bow center strip around the center of the bow body, continuing until the raw edge of the center strip is hidden beneath and facing the bow body.


Note that the seam edge of the center will be the back of the bow and the smooth edge will be the front.
Set the finished bow aside until you're ready to assemble the collar.

, Use an iron to press the folds flat.


Note that each fold should only be about 1/4 inch (6 mm). If you make the folds much larger than that, the final band may become too tight around your dog's neck.

, Fold the long edges of the band strip in toward the center until they nearly meet. Then, fold the strip in half along the same lengthwise center, hiding the raw edges inside.


Press the folded edges after making each fold to hold them in place.
This step should reduce the width of the band to a quarter of its original size.
Note that the folded width edges should also be hidden inside this “tube” of material, as well.

, Using a machine or sewing by hand, top stitch the tube of material closed along the entire open length and both open widths.


You can use a straight stitch, decorative stitch, or any other suitable top stitch for this part of the project. Similarly, you can also use fabric glue for a no-sew alternative.
Place the top stitching as close to the open edges as possible.

, Wrap the band around your dog's neck. The ends should overlap by about 2 inches (5 cm), and you should be able to comfortably slide two fingers in between the band and your dog's neck.

,


Test the band again. When you wrap it around your dog's neck, both Velcro halves should meet and secure the band comfortably around your dog's neck. Reposition the Velcro as needed to get the correct fit.
You can also use sew-on Velcro instead of the self-adhesive kind, or place a few supportive rows of stitching along the Velcro to give it added durability.

, Slip the center loop of the bow over the end of the band. Slide the bow down the band until it rests at the center point of the band.


Ideally, there should be enough space between the center loop and the bow body for the bow tie to slide over the band without difficulty. If there isn't enough space, however, you could tie the bow tie onto the band using thread or ribbon.
If desired, you could stitch or glue the bow tie to the band to secure it. Leaving it loose gives you the option to adjust it later, though.

, Wrap the finished bow tie collar around your dog's neck and fasten it in place using the Velcro. Check the fit once more the make sure that it isn't too tight, then stand back and admire your work.

Consider how you want the coat to fit.",How to Measure Dogs for Coats," Since you'll be measuring the dog's girth and length, you'll need a measuring tape, pencil, and paper. It may also help to have someone assist you in holding the dog steady while you take the measurements.


Have plenty of treats available that you can use to reward your dog and encourage him to hold still.;
, Get your dog to stand up so that you can measure the circumference around his ribcage (the girth). Try to measure the widest part of the dog's chest, which is generally located just behind the points of the elbows.


Ask a friend to feed your dog treats by holding the treat just above your dog's nose. This will get your dog standing as tall as possible.

, Hold one end of the measuring tape on your dog's spine, just behind his shoulders. Roll the free end of the tape down along his side until it reaches the bottom of the widest point of the ribcage. Wrap the tape underneath the rib cage and back over the opposite side of the body to join the tape where you started. Make sure the tape is snug, but not tight against the skin.The widest point of the rib cage is just behind the front legs behind the points of the elbows. This is equivalent to the part of the elbow a person leans on, when resting her elbows on a desk.

, Once you've wrapped the measuring tape accurately around your dog's girth, write down the final measurement. Use the measurement you see at the point where the free end of the measuring tape touches the beginning edge.

, Get your dog to stand upright in order to measure the length of your dog's body between the base of the neck and beginning of the tail.


Your friend may want to feed treats to your dog to encourage him to stand upright.

, Place the beginning edge of the measuring tape at the base of the neck, where it joins the shoulders (the nape of the neck). Extend the free end of the measuring tape along the length of the spine until it reaches the base of the tail.If you are not certain where this is, it helps to visualise where you want the coat to sit around the dog's neck and measure from that point to the base of the tail, since this is the length of coat you wish to purchase.

, Once you've extended the measuring tape across your dog's spine, use the number you see where the free end of the measuring tape touches the base of the tail. This is your dog's length measurement.

, You should already know why you're buying the coat: to keep your dog warm, to keep him dry, or for stylish reasons. For example, if you're looking to keep your dog warm, you might want to buy a coat made of wool and cotton or acrylic. If you're trying to keep him dry, look for a slick rainproof material that will keep the moisture away from your dog's skin.If you're getting a coat for purely fashionable reasons, remember to check for any zippers, buttons, or laces that could trip or snag your dog. Don't sacrifice your dog's safety in the name of style.

, Once you've found a coat you like, look at the sizing guidelines on the package of the coat. You should be able to find a range of measurements that corresponds to a specific size. Check their sizes against the girth and length measurements you took of your dog. Some coats will even include sizing charts that list breeds that are typically that size.Since all dogs are individuals, the actual measurements are probably more reliable than simply going by breed. For example, if you have an unusually large border collie, then you would do better to choose a coat for a small Labrador rather than a standard sized border collie.

, If your dog is between sizes, you'll need to choose a size up or down. If the coat is simply a fashion accessory, you should probably choose the smaller size, but keep the fastenings loose. But, if you want to protect your dog against the weather, choose a larger size up so you can completely fasten your dog.As a rule of thumb, if your dog is broad and chunky, such as a well-padded Staffie, then go a size up. If the dog is slender and slim, such as a whippet, then go a size down.
If your dog has short legs, you might need to size down so that the coat doesn't drag on the ground. You may even need to look for coats specifically designed for long, low dogs, so that the coat clears the ground.

Find out what your dog can tolerate.,
Cut out 2 triangular pieces of green or red fabric, 7 inches (17.8 cm) on the sides and 5 inches (12.7 cm) on the bottom.,
Use Aleene's OK To Wash-It fabric glue or any fabric glue that is available and leave a trail of glue along the edges of the sides (including the tip), not the bottom.,
Press the two pieces of fabric together and let dry, which will take about 35 minutes.

,
After this has dried, take a jingle bell and thread some red thread through the hole.

,
Make a tiny hole with a needle in the tip of the triangle, enough to put the thread through, with the bell attached.

,
Tie the thread tightly (knot it as much as you can) on the inside of the hat, so you can see the bell on the outside.

,
If you want to have some trim, cut out 2 pieces of red or green fabric (red if you have a green hat, green if you have a red hat) so that it is spiky on the top, but flat on the bottom.

,
Glue or sew the edges of the fabric trim and put the trim, so the bottom of the trim is matching up with the edge of the hat.,
Finished.

Put the coat on your dog.",How to Make a Dog Coat," Wrap a soft cloth tape measure around the base of the dog's neck. Add 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) to this measurement to make space for the Velcro.


Position the tape measure directly beneath the dog's collar, if your dog wears one. Otherwise, wrap the tape around the lowest part of the neck.
Keep the tape measure fairly loose. You should be able to slide two fingers beneath the tape measure and the dog.
Adding an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) should work for most dogs, but if you have a very large dog or a dog that tends to wear down his collars, you might want to add 2 inches (5 cm) to allow for a larger piece of Velcro.;
, Get your dog to stand, sit, or lie with its back straight. Extend the tape measure from the base of the neck to the base of the tail.


If your dog has a collar, start the measurement 1 inch (2.5 cm) beneath the collar.Otherwise, start the measurement about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the point at which you measured your dog's neck circumference.
Extend the tape measure to a point roughly 2 inches (5 cm) away from the dog's tail.

, Starting at the midpoint between your dog's shoulder blades, wrap the tape measure around the dog's back, sides, and chest.


Keep the tape measure directly behind its front legs and perpendicular to the ground.
Note that this measurement is easiest to obtain when your dog is standing straight.

, Extend the tape measure down from the base of the dog's neck to the bottom of the chest. Keep the tape measure centered vertically along the dog's chest.


If your dog wears a collar, start this measurement about 1 inch (2.5 cm) beneath the collar. Otherwise, start this measurement about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the initial neck circumference measurement.

,


Essentially, this line will be a quarter-oval shape; it should look like a tall half shirt collar. The start and end points of this line should not meet in the same place.
Place this line near the top edge of the drafting paper, with the shorter, rounded portion facing away from the top edge.

, Draw a straight line down the length of the paper matching the previously measured back length. This line should connect to the lower end point of the neck circumference line.

, Sketch a straight line across the top width of the paper matching the previously measured chest length. This line should connect to the upper end point of the neck circumference line.

, Starting at the free end of the chest length line, draw a straight line down the length of the paper. It should run parallel to the back length line and end at the same point at the bottom of the paper.


Note that you will not use the chest circumference measurement when drafting the coat pattern. You'll only use that measurement when drafting the pattern for the stomach strap.

, Draw a curved line from the bottom point of the back length line up to a point higher up along the parallel length line.


This line will roughly follow the curve of the neck circumference, but the two won't be exactly parallel. Consider using a curved object, like a large dinner plate, to guide the direction of this line.
The back length line should not be altered during this step, but the parallel length line will be.

, Measure out 1/4 inch (6 mm) away from all sides of the coat pattern. Draw parallel lines around the entire perimeter at this distance, creating a seam allowance for the coat.


Note that you should not add the seam allowance to the back length line. This line will sit on a fold in the fabric when you cut out your pieces.

, Use sharp scissors to cut around the perimeter of the pattern piece along the outermost lines (the back length line and the seam allowance lines).

, Measure the distance between the back length line and the parallel length line on the coat pattern. Double this amount for use on the stomach strap.


Note that you should use the original parallel length line and not the seam allowance line.
This doubled value will indicate how much distance along your dogs back and sides the coat itself will cover. The remaining distance beneath your dog's torso will need to be covered by the length of the stomach strap.

, Subtract the doubled width from the original chest circumference measurement taken previously. The difference will be the length of the stomach strap.

, Sketch a rectangular stomach strap pattern pieces on an unused portion of drafting paper. The length of this strap should match the newly calculated stomach strap length.


Note that the width can vary by preference and the size of your dog. For a smaller dog, a width between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.5 cm) should suffice. For larger dogs, you may need a strap measuring 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) wide.

, Sketch parallel lines around the entire perimeter of the stomach strap, positioning these lines 1/4 inch (6 mm) away from the existing edges. This will be your seam allowance.

, Use sharp scissors to cut out the stomach strap pattern along the seam allowance line.


While there's only one stomach strap pattern piece, you'll end up using this pattern piece twice when making the actual coat.

, Before cutting into the material, it's a good idea to create a test pattern out of drafting paper or recycled paper bag material.


Fold the paper in half and lay the coat pattern piece on top so that the back length line sits directly on the fold of the paper. Trace around the perimeter of the pattern, then cut out the double layer of paper, leaving the fold intact. Unfold the paper only after cutting it out.
Open the remaining paper and trace two stomach strap rectangles onto the single layer. Cut these rectangles out.
You should have three pieces: two stomach straps and a full coat body.

, Tape the width edge of one stomach strap on each side of unfolded coat piece, positioning the straps about halfway down the sides. Try the test coat on for size.


The coat should fit comfortably over the back and sides of your dog, and the neck opening should close over the base of the dog's neck with a little overlap. The stomach straps should overlap beneath the dog's chest and sit comfortably behind the dog's front legs.
Make any necessary adjustments to the placement of the stomach straps and to the size and shape of the overall coat. Once you're satisfied with the way the coat fits, take the tester off your dog. Use these adjusted pattern pieces when cutting out the fabric for the real coat.

, Oilcloth and other types of coated cotton work well, but you can also recycle a thick vinyl tablecloth.If you plan to use this coat in wet weather, water-repellant fabrics are best for the outer portion of the coat. If your main concern is warmth, however, you could opt for something different. Popular options include cotton, wool, and fleece.

, Thin to medium-thickness fleece is soft, warm, and easy to work with. You can buy new fleece or recycle an old fleece blanket.


The purpose of this lining is to keep the dog warm. If you're mainly interested in keeping the dog dry without worrying about insulation, you could choose a thinner fabric, like a soft cotton. Make sure that this fabric will not be itchy or uncomfortable on your dog.
If you chose fleece for the outer coat, you may not need to include an inner lining at all., Use your altered pattern (if applicable) to cut out one body piece and two stomach strap pieces from the coated cotton; repeat with the fleece, as well.


Follow the same method used when cutting out the paper pattern.

Fold the fabric and lay the coat pattern on top, matching the fold to the back length line. Cut out the double layer and unfold the fabric when finished.
Trace two stomach strap rectangles out of a single layer of fabric.



, For each strap piece, place the outer fleece on top of the inner lining, matching the edges evenly. Pin the two layers together.


Keep the ""right sides"" together and the ""wrong sides"" facing out.

, Using a sewing machine, stitch around each strap piece using a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance. Sew both long sides and one short side closed; leave one short side open.


Consider clipping the corners to help the finished straps lie flat.

, Pull the strap material through the remaining opening so that they are now right-side out. Do this for both straps.


Press the strap pieces flat using an iron.
Do not sew the open end closed yet.

, Position both straps over the outer fabric of the coat. Keep the right sides of the material together, and align the open end of each strap to the sides of the coat piece.


Use the placement of your straps on the test coat to determine where to place the straps on the real coat.
Pin the straps in place once you're satisfied with the arrangement.

, Place the inner lining on top of the outer fleece, keeping the edges evenly aligned. Note that the ""right sides"" of the fabrics should face each other.Also note that the stomach straps will be sandwiched in between the two layers.
Pin these layers in place when ready.

, Working with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance, sew around nearly the entire perimeter of the coat, stitching the lining and outer fabrics together.


Leave a 3-inch (7.5-cm) opening at the bottom center of the coat. Do not stitch the layers completely closed.
Note that you should also sew over the previously open ends of both strap pieces during this step, thereby securing them to the coat body.
If desired, clip the corners of the material after you finish sewing the layers and before moving onto the next step.

, Pull all of the material through the bottom opening of the coat so that the coat is right-side out again. The straps should also be on the outside of the coat.


Press the edges flat using an iron before continuing.

, Fold the bottom opening under by 1/4 inch (6 mm) on both sides. Pin it in place, and stitch the opening closed.


Completing this step should complete the coat assembly. You can topstitch the edges for added security, if desired, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

, Lay the coat flat with the outer side facing up. Attach 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide Velcro to the horizontal edges surrounding the neck opening.You can use self-adhesive or sew-in Velcro, depending on your personal preference. The Velcro should be about as wide as the overlap in the neck circumference, and the same length as the horizontal neck edge.
Stitch the soft side to the inside left edge and the rough side to the outside right edge.

, Attach 1-inch or 2-inch (2.5-cm or 5-cm) Velcro to the stomach straps, centering them over the length of each strap piece.


Use the same type of Velcro used for the neck portion.
These strips of Velcro should be nearly as long as each strap piece.
Place the soft side on the inside left strap and the rough side on the outside right strap.

, Your dog's coat should be finished. Place the coat on your dog and secure the openings around the neck and beneath the stomach using the added Velcro.

Trim your dog’s nails.,
Gather your equipment.,
Place the paw on the paper.,
Spread out your dog’s toes.,
Mark the paper.,
Account for wiggle room.,
Use the wet paw method.",How to Fit a Dog for Winter Boots1," Before measuring, clip your dog’s nails to a comfortable length to assure the best fit.


Avoid cutting the quick, which is a vein that runs into your dog’s nail. It can be painful and bloody if you accidentally cut it. When you see the beginning of a circle on the nail surface, you’re approaching the quick.
Dogs typically do not like to have their paws handled too much or their nails clipped. Be sure to have some treats nearby to reward your dog while you’re clipping its nails.;
, You will need a pencil, a measuring tape, and plain white paper or a paper bag to mark on. Dog treats are an additional essential item, as your pup may need to be coaxed and bribed to participate in the measuring.

, Gently put your dog’s paw on the paper and try to get your dog to put all of its weight on that paw. This is a good time to offer treats and encouraging words.
Be sure to measure all four paws. Sometimes, there is variation in the sizes of a dog’s paws.

, Press down gently on your dog’s paw so that it spreads out, similar to how it lands when your dog is walking.

, Make a mark at the front (including toenail) and back of the paw for the length. Also mark the outermost edges of the left and right sides for width. Let your dog walk away, and then measure the distances between the lines. These measurements will give you an accurate sense of the length and width of your dog’s paw., Add ¼ inch to your measurements for both the length and width to allow extra room for your dog to spread his toes while walking., If your dog is not cooperative while you try to mark around its paw on paper, you can try to estimate a measurement by wetting your dog’s paw. Have your dog step with a wet paw onto a brown paper bag, then measure the paw print. This won’t be as accurate as the other method, but it will be a good guide to tell you which size would work for your dog."

Figure out how the manufacturer sizes the boots.,
Check for a measuring chart.,
Look at online reviews.",How to Fit a Dog for Winter Boots2," There is no standard for setting the size of dog boots. Some companies measure from the heel of the pad to the tip of the toe, while others include the length of the toenail as well. Other companies use the weight of the dog to gauge the size of the boot/foot. Check to see how the manufacturer you’re interested in sizes its product., Some manufacturers offer printable measuring charts on their websites. You just need to print the charts at 100 percent and then align your dog’s foot next to the measurements. Then, you know the size to order.


This would be particularly useful if the website you’re ordering from does not offer a return policy.

, Some brands consistently run large or small, which is usually noted in the reviews. Having this information handy will help you make a better selection for your dog once you’ve made your measurements.

Select some boots to try on your dog.,
Open the boot completely.,
Insert your dog’s paw gently.,
Have your dog put all of its weight on the boot.",How to Fit a Dog for Winter Boots3," Look for self-tightening straps to help the boots fit securely and leather soles for flexibility.You can also consider taking your dog directly to a big-box pet supply store (like Petsmart or Petco) to try on the boots in person instead of ordering a few sizes.


The ideal boot for your dog should be flexible enough to be comfortable, but tight and durable enough to stay on. It should also fit snugly at the ankle and have a bit of room at the toes for wiggle room., Once you’ve chosen a boot and selected an approximate size, loosen the straps or fasteners and open it completely before placing it on your dog.

, Carefully place the boot on your dog and tuck in all of its fur to make sure none is being pulled by the boot.You can use your finger as a shoehorn to help nudge your dog’s toes to the front of the boot.

, Once your dog’s paw is completely in the boot, fasten any straps. Gently press on the front of the boot to feel the clearance for your dog’s toes to see if there is any wiggle room.Try the boots on all four paws, since they may fit differently on each.
A properly fitting boot should be easy to slip on, but not so loose that it slips off.

Find a human hat that fits your dog’s head.,
Create a means for securing the hat to your dog's head.,
Design the hat theme.",How to Make a Hat for a Dog1," Check the size of the hat by placing it on your dog's head and seeing how it sits. If you're purchasing one, take Fido's measurements along with you, to be sure. Obviously, some hats have more give than others, so take this into account when assessing size. The type of hat is really up to what you need from it. If it's for a party or a photo shoot, almost anything goes, from cowboy to wizard hats, while if it's for sun protection or warmth, you'll need to check out brim sizes, durability, warm or cooling fabric, etc.


To measure your dog's head: Use a flexible tape measure and obtain the circumference and diameter of the dog's head. If your dog has any particular features such as a mop of hair in front or big ears, etc., be sure to take these into account for comfort fit.
Rummage through your closet for old hats––consider baby and children's hats as well when looking, as these will have a smaller size that might be more suited to your dog's head. Retailers of baby wear or children's wear might also have appropriate hats. Since these things tend to get chewed, muddy or lost, don't use anything sentimental or expensive.;
, The hat may look adorable for a few seconds on your dog’s head, until he turns to look at a passing jackrabbit and it goes flying into space. To secure the hat:


Design a chin band to keep the hat in place. Gather a few supplies including scissors, an elastic band and a needle and thread. Find a piece of flexible, comfortable elastic to use as the band—also one in a color that complements or matches the hat. You’ll also need scissors and a needle and thread to attach the elastic to the hat.
Size the hat strap to fit by placing the hat on the dog’s head and measuring from one side of the hat to the other. You may also want to place the hat on the pup’s head, hold one end of the elastic next to the end of the hat and then thread it underneath his chin for an accurate idea.
Cut and fit the elastic strap to customize the fit for your dog. Once you know how long your elastic strap should be, cut to size. Cut enough so that each end can be sewn into the cap and always cut the strap slightly longer than your original measurement, in case your calculations are off.
Sew each end of the hat strap to the inside of each end of the hat. Don’t leave the ends poking out––sew the ends inside the hat for a more professional finish. (Loose ends may be tempting for your pup to tug and rip from the hat.)
Put the hat back on the pup with the strap to ensure a tight but comfortable fit. Make adjustments if the fit is not ideal.

, Once the construction portion of the hat is complete, now it's time to get creative. You’ll need to consider materials required to design the hat (felt, fabric, small toys, etc.) and how you plan to keep those materials in place (hot glue gun, sewing, etc).


Consider different occasions where your pet can wear the hat. If you're going for strictly one look for one occasion (such as Halloween or Christmas) you won’t need to worry about making the hat design diverse. However, if this is more of a “dog around town” type of hat, consider the different occasions he’ll encounter such as a dog park, visits with friends or even window-shopping.
Design the hat to be indestructible if you have a rambunctious pooch. If the hat becomes an annoyance for your dog, chances are he’ll not only want to remove it from his head, he’ll be out to destroy it too. In the event this does occur, you’ll want to make sure you’ve done a good job constructing the hat to minimize the damage and ensure that nothing toxic is attached to the hat. Consider using the sewing method instead of building your hat with a hot glue gun or other types of glue. Sewing will provide for a more durable hat and design construction.
Redesign the existing hat to accommodate the doggie design or to fit his personality. If you're using a baseball cap and your dog appears to be clearly annoyed with the bill, remove it. There’s no reason to have it hanging down over his eyes if he can’t see or if he is becoming anxious.

Choose a small garbage sized plastic bag.,
Gather the rest of the supplies.,
Find an open area.,
Make one long horizontal line across the bottom of the bag.,
Call your dog over and command him to stay.,
Hold the plastic bag against your dog’s body.,
Cut the marked lines on the plastic bag.,
Place the poncho on your dog.",How to Make a Plastic Bag Poncho for Your Dog," The plastic bag will need to cover the entire length of your dog. Look for a garbage bag that will be the right size for your dog, depending on whether you have a small, medium, or large dog.


If possible, use a thicker garbage bag, such as a heavy duty garbage bag, for durability and to make the poncho more resistant to water.;
, To make the plastic poncho, you will need a pair of scissors and a marker that is a different color than the color of the plastic bag.


You will use the marker to note where you will cut the bag when you measure the bag against the shape and size of your dog.

, You will need to lay the bag down flat on the ground and cut it, so look for an area in your home or your backyard that is open and easy to move around in.


You will also need your dog to stay in one spot while you measure the bag against his body so you may want to choose a spot in your home that you dog is comfortable in or likes.

, This cut line will open the bag up on the long side so you can drape the bag over your dog’s body. The long strip of plastic will then act as the belt to keep the poncho attached to your dog.Using a cut line across the bag, starting from the closed end to the open end, will reduce the time it will take to get your dog's legs into the poncho. Rather than have to make four holes in the bag for his four legs, you can simply place the poncho over your dog so his body and legs are covered by the bag.

, To make sure the poncho fits your dog properly, you will need to get your dog to stay in one spot and remain still as you measure the bag against his body.If your dog doesn’t like to remain in one spot for an extended period of time, you can use small treats to encourage him to stay still for at least three to five minutes.

, This will help you measure the dimensions of the poncho so it fits your dog properly. Hold the marker in the other hand as you note where you are going to cut the plastic bag.Using your dog as a marker, draw a half circle shape on the top corner of the bag, along the closed part of the bag, so your dog’s neck and head can fit through the poncho. Make sure the circle is big enough to fit your dog’s head and neck comfortably.
You will then need to draw a longer half circle on the back end of the bag so there is enough room for your dog’s bum and tail. Use your dog’s body as a marker to ensure the longer half circle is big enough for your dog.

, Once you have your cut lines, place the plastic bag on the ground or on a table and cut along the marked lines., Once you have cut the poncho to fit your dog’s measurements, place it on your dog so your dog’s body is covered by the poncho. It should drape over him like a sheet. His tail, neck, and head should all remain outside of the poncho and go through the half circles you made on the bag.Take the long strip of plastic and wrap it around your dog’s belly, securing the poncho to your dog. Tie the strip several times so the strip is snug and not too tight around your dog.
Let your dog walk around to make sure the poncho is comfortable for him and easy to move in. You can then put on your own poncho and head out for a walk.

,Slide your dog's collar through the casing and then reattach the collar to your dog for display, identification, decoration, or just for fun.",How to Sew a Bandana for a Dog Collar," If you sew, you probably already have plenty of material available in your scrap pile, but you could purchase fabric specifically for this project if you wish. You will need a square of fabric approximately 14 inches (35.6 cm) square for a large dog and as small as 8 inches (20.3 cm) square for a bandanna for a smaller dog.
, The diagonal of the square will be two times the length of the bandana, so if you want a 5 inch (12.7 cm) long bandana, cut a square with a diagonal length of 11 inches (27.9 cm). (two x five inches + one inch to allow for the sewing seams),, This should leave a folded edge of approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) long at the corner.

Measure your dog.,
Choose the right type of collar.,
Gather your supplies.",How to Make a Dog Collar1," In order for a dog collar to function effectively, it needs to fit properly. To ensure that you make the right size of collar, your first step is to measure your dog's neck. The best method is to use a cloth tape measure.Measure around your dog's neck where the collar should sit. Then add 2 inches to the measurement. This is the size you should make the collar.
If you do not have a cloth tape measure, you can use a piece of string. Cut the string, and then use a ruler to measure it.
The width of the collar is also important. Large breeds should wear collars that are 1 inch in width. 3/4 inch is appropriate for medium dogs, and small dog collars should be approximately 1 inch in width.;
, When making a collar, you should be aware that different dogs have different needs. For example, if you have a large dog who has trouble obeying verbal commands, you will need a very sturdy collar. If you have a small dog, you will have a little more flexibility. Think about what you need this collar to do: is it to control your dog, or is it just to help guide him when you're out walking? Consider the needs of both you and your dog.Standard collars are known as ""flat"" collars. Typically, they will fasten with a buckle or snap. It should fit snugly, but you should be able to fit two fingers between the collar and your dog's neck.
Dogs with small heads do best with a Martingale collar. For example, if you have a greyhound, you will make a collar that has two metal rings with a length of material between them. The leash will fasten to the rings. This is useful for dogs who try to wiggle out of their collars.

, You will need several things in order to make a functional dog collar. You will need a sturdy piece of webbing material. Nylon works well. Purchase about 1 yard--this will be more than enough, but you want extra in case you make an error.You will also need to purchase dog collar hardware. You should get a clasp (also called a buckle), a D ring, and an adjuster. You can buy these items online and at many large superstores.
Purchase fabric to cover the webbing. Cotton works well, as it is easy to cut and clean. You will also need thread.
A sewing machine is very useful for this type of project. If you don't have one, ask a friend to borrow one. If that's not possible, a needle and strong thread will work fine. You will also need an iron.

"
"
Cut your materials.,
Attach the webbing.,
Load your thread into your sewing machine.,
Attach the hardware.,
Attach your buckle.,
Slide your D ring onto the collar.",How to Make a Dog Collar2," You want your fabric and the webbing to be the lengths that you measured. Note: you want to make sure that you cut the fabric one inch longer and one inch wider than the webbing. You need the fabric to be bigger so that you can wrap the webbing around it.Another general rule of thumb is that your webbing should be approximately 11 inches (27.9 cm) longer than the circumference of your dog's neck. But either 10 or 12 inches (25.4 or 30.5 cm) will work, too.
Using a general household lighter, lightly burn the ends of your webbing. This will keep them from fraying.

, Using a low heat setting on your iron, iron the fabric to the webbing. Then fold the extra fabric over the webbing, creating a nice crease. You have now created the base for your collar. You can go back over this again with the iron to deepen the crease.

, Sew your way around the edges of the collar. If you do not have a sewing machine, use a needle and thread for this step. Essentially, you just need to make sure that your fabric is securely attached to the webbing. Use a simple stitch pattern. Just make sure to sew in a straight line. Sew along each side of the collar, making sure the webbing and fabric are firmly attached to one another.Using a pair of fabric (or kitchen scissors) snip any stray threads that are lingering.

, Slide the strap adjuster through one end of the fabric, then pull through about an inch. It does not matter which end you choose. Sew the loose end of the fabric back onto the collar itself. Basically, you are sewing this piece of hardware onto a small loop.When you are attaching the end of the fabric onto the main part of the collar, sew in an hourglass shape. Example: stitch in a straight line across the bottom of the ""tail"" end. Then sew a diagonal line up, then sew a line across the top, then a diagonal line back down to your starting point.Clip your stray threads. Now your strap adjuster is neatly attached to the collar.

, There should be two pieces. Place the curved side of the clasp through the end of the collar. Slide the end up through your strap adjuster, which makes a loop. Secure each side of the clasp to the collar by sewing small, sturdy loops around the clasps. You should have a collar, with a longer tail at the end.

, Slide on the other piece of your buckle, and pull about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) of the collar through the buckle. Pull the end of the fabric through the adjuster and then sew the loose end to the back of the collar.


Use the hour glass stitch one the fabric on each side of your D ring. This will ensure that it does not slide around on your collar. Now your D ring is attached.
Clip any stray threads.

Have fun.,
Be seasonal.,
Try new materials.,
Be kind to your dog.",How to Make a Dog Collar3," Once you know the basic method of making a functional dog collar, you can let your imagination run wild! You can create a new collar wardrobe for your dog by creating collars in a variety of different collars and prints. If you enjoy sewing, you can also make these as gifts for your friends and family who have dogs.Dog collars are a fairly simple sewing project. If you have kids, this would be a fun crafts project for you to do together. This would make a great project to teach someone about the basics of sewing.

, We all know that it's fun to dress up for different holidays. Let your dog have a seasonal wardrobe, too. You can create different collars for different seasons. Think firework printed fabric for the Fourth of July and hearts for Valentine's day.


Look for materials during holiday off seasons. For example, you'll be able to find lower prices on Christmas prints during the early spring and summer.

, Some dog collars are intended to be more decorative than functional. If this is the case, you should feel free to experiment with a variety of materials. For example, consider ribbons. There are many specialty stores that sell beautiful colored and printed ribbons. This would work especially well for small dogs.Leather is also a great option for dog collars. While it is more expensive, it will also last longer.

, While it can be fun to make your dog look stylish, make sure that you are considering his comfort. For example, if you have a puppy, make sure that the collar you make is adjustable and allows him room to grow. You never want a collar to be to tight.Avoid using twine or any material that will chafe or irritate your dog's coat.

"
"
Consider important information.,
Learn about safety.,
Think of your dog's needs.",How to Make a Dog Collar4," One of the best reasons for your dog to wear a collar is that you need a collar in order for him to wear identification tags. I.D. tags are essential for your pet's safety. If your pet is lost or becomes separated from you, his tag's will help someone return him to your home.Your dog's tags should include his name and a phone number for you or your veterinarian's office.
Make sure your dog is wearing his collar and tags anytime he leaves the house.

, Even if your dog is well-behaved, the unexpected can happen when you are out for a walk. For your dog's safety, and the safety of others, you should also walk your dog with a collar and leash. This way you can control your dog. You don't want him to suddenly dash into traffic or get into an argument with another dog.If your dog has trouble walking on a leash, you may want to consider a training program. Obedience will make walks more enjoyable for both you and your dog.

, Remember that a collar should be both comfortable and effective. Ask your vet for recommendations about what kind of collar will work best for your dog. Your dog's safety and health are the most important factors to consider when making a collar.

Visit a pet store.,
Order a sweater online.,
Make your own dog sweater.,
Measure your dog.,
Order several sizes.,
Try the coat on your dog in the store.,
Pick the right style and pattern.,
Choose the right material.,
Dress your dog up for special occasions.,
Take the sweater off if your dog hates it.",How to Choose a Good Dog Sweater," Try to find a store specializing in pet products, ideally one that will allow you to take your dog in with you. If you can bring your dog in with you, then you can try various sweaters on (or at least hold them up to your dog’s body to guesstimate if it will fit). This will make choosing easier on you in the long run.Seeing the sweaters in person also allows you to determine if they’ll be flattering on your dog, if they’re made of durable material, and if you like the way it looks.
You want to find one that fits comfortably, while also complementing your dog’s physical characteristics.;
, There are many internet sites dedicated to pet supplies and apparel. Spend some time browsing the internet for different dog sweaters and find the one that is right for you. This means one that you like and that you think will suit your dog’s needs.Be sure to read the product information (and any product reviews available) to ensure that it is a high quality product.

, If you’re feeling a little crafty, try making a coat for your dog. You can try sewing together pieces of felt to create a handmade sweater that will keep your dog warm on cold days, while being so cute at the same time!


You can also try knitting a sweater for your dog.

, Check online for measurement charts that tell you what measurements correspond to what sizes for most dog sweaters. There may be a little fluctuation between various brands. But the chart will help give you a pretty good idea of what size your dog needs.Typically, a size small sweater works for a dog whose torso length is 12 in (30 cm), neck circumference is 12 in (30 cm), and chest circumference is 16 in (41 cm). This size typically works for Pomeranians and other similarly sized breeds.
A medium size sweater is for dogs whose torso length is 16 in (41 cm), neck circumference is 14 in (36 cm), and chest circumference is 20 in (51 cm). This size typically works for Cocker Spaniels and other similarly sized breeds.
A large size sweater is for dogs whose torso length is 20 in (51 cm), neck circumference is 18 in (46 cm), and chest circumference is 24 in (61 cm). This size typically works for Chows and other similarly sized breeds.
Most sweaters can also be purchased in extra small (XS) and extra large (XL) sizes.

, If you are unsure of exactly what size to get, try ordering several. If your budget allows, this can be a good way to help find one that fits your dog perfectly. Try on each sweater and keep the ones that fit and that you like. Return the rest, if possible.Most companies will let you return items that don’t fit as long as you keep your original receipt and the original packaging.

, The coat should cover the whole back to the base of the tail and should be comfortable around the neck. The fastening should be firm but not tight. Get an adjustable one if at all possible: dogs grow, just like humans.You want the sweater to be loose enough to allow for a full range of motion for your pup.
But make sure the sweater is not too tight – especially around your dog’s neck and armpits.

, Pick a color and pattern that suits your dog and your own personal sense of style. Make sure the sweater is something you enjoy looking at and that your dog seems to appreciate. The sweater should not make your dog uncomfortable in any way – aside from the initial dislike while your pet adjusts to wearing it.Get creative with patterns and materials. Try something bright and playful. Or maybe choose something made out of an interesting cloth – like leather or knit.
For example, Westies look great in plaid, but Labradors look best in plain coats.
You can even try getting a sweater with a cute or funny picture or phrase on it.

, Picking a sweater your dog will like should be an exercise in comfort and practicality. While a dog sweater should look cute, it should also be made of the kind of material that will benefit your dog the most.If your dog needs warmth, then go for a fleece lining; if you frequently take your dog out in the rain then a waterproof coat is probably a necessity.
Some coats are great at wicking away moisture from a soggy doggy – these are really useful after a wet walk.

, There are tons of options for dog sweaters that are holiday related. Costumes can be a fun way to keep your dog warm or to show your dog off if you take it out in public wearing its costume.


Choose a fun sweater with Santa Clause or a Christmas tree on it for the holiday season.
Find a hilarious outfit/costume for Halloween – consider choosing a dinosaur, ladybug, hot dog, or pumpkin dog costume.

, Don’t force your dog into doing something it clearly hates and that makes it uncomfortable. Yes, it may take your dog a few days to fully adjust to wearing its new sweater; but if your dog continues hating it after a few days, you may want to consider taking it off.You don’t want to make your dog unhappy even if the sweater looks incredibly cute.

Default to a standard flat collar.,
Fit a flat collar safely.,
Make sure flat collars have a D-ring.,
Use a head collar for dogs that jump and pull.,
Use a martingale collar with narrow-headed dogs.",How to Find the Right Collar for Your Dog1," Flat collars are the most popular types of collars for several reasons. They are strong, safe, inexpensive, often fully adjustable, and easy to take on and off. Most flat collars have either a buckle or a plastic clip. Nylon is the most common material used, though you can also get leather flat collars.Choose a flat width based on the size of your dog. Use a ½ inch collar for smalls dogs, a ¾ inch collar for most dogs, and a 1+ inch collar for large dogs. If in doubt, go with a collar with a slightly larger strap.
Get a nylon flat collar just to have for basic everyday use, such as walking. Nylon has the advantages of being machine-washable, and will hold up in water. They are the easiest to clean and maintain.
Nylon flat collars are the best choice for young puppies, as they are extremely safe and easy to adjust.
Go for a leather collar if your dog is especially rambunctious and needs a more resilient collar. Leather is durable and can last a very long time. It will soften naturally, and won’t damage the coat of long-haired dogs.;
, Use a cloth or paper measuring strip to measure around your dog’s neck. Measure when your dog is standing with his head up. The collar should be snug, but loose enough to fit two fingers between your dog’s neck and the collar.If you don’t have a cloth or paper measuring strip, find some string. Wind the string around your dog’s neck and mark the circumference. Then measure the string with a regular tape measure!
Add 2 inches to the circumference of your dog’s neck to find their flat collar size.

, D-rings are metal rings shaped like a half circle. They are often built into dog collars, and are vitally important. Hang your dog’s ID tag from the D-ring.Most importantly, always hook your dog’s leash or tie-out to the D-ring on their collar.

, Head collars will safely allow you to better control a strong or highly active dog. They feature a strap that goes around your dog’s neck, but sits high up, close to the ears. Another strap wraps around your dog’s muzzle, and is connected to the neck strap by strips on either side of your dog’s head.If your dog is especially strong or frequently jumps or pulls on walks, get a head collar. Since these collars sit higher, the dog has less leverage to pull with all of their weight.
Fitting is especially important for head collars. Since specific models vary slightly, closely follow the fitting directions that will come with the collar you choose.
Only use head collars for short periods of time. Put it on your dog to take them for a walk, and take it off when you get back home.
Never yank on a leash that is attached to a head collar. This can lead to a neck injury for your dog.

, Dogs that have naturally narrow heads, such as Greyhounds and other sighthounds, need limited-slip collars. These are less likely to allow for the collar to slip off. Martingale collars are strips of material with a length of chain and a metal ring at each end. Another loop links the metal rings, and includes a ring for leash attachment. This assembly disallows your dog from backing out of their leash.Sizing a martingale collar correctly is extremely important. When adjusted correctly, the collar will only tighten to the size of your dog’s neck to prevent choking.
Add 2 inches to the circumference of your dog’s neck to find the appropriate size of a martingale collar.

Decide how much money you want to spend.,
Check out the battery life.,
Determine the durability.,
Consider the range and accuracy of the GPS.,
Choose a collar that connects to your phone.",How to Choose a GPS Dog Collar1," When buying a GPS collar for you dog, you will need to consider both the cost of the collar itself, as well as the cost of the subscription fee. The cost of a collar can range from $100 to $800, and the subscription fee can range from $10 to $15 per month.Basic GPS collars usually range from $100 to $150 dollars.
More advanced collars that have a longer GPS range, that can measure your dog’s vitals like body temperature and heart rate, that can monitor your dog’s activities, and that have weather alerts, statistics, and history functions can range from $500 to $800 dollars.;
, Choose a collar with a pro-grade battery. Pro-grade batteries are known to last longer than regular batteries. However, the more features a collar has, the more battery power it will need to function.For example, if the collar sends regular “check-in” signals to your phone, the battery life will be shorter.
Choose a collar that has a battery life of at least 24 hours.

, Choose a collar that is waterproof and hit-resistant. You can’t keep your eye on your dog all the time. Therefore, you want a collar that will still work even if your dog suddenly decides to splash in a puddle, scratch its neck against a fence, roll in the dirt, or rough-house with other dogs., Some collars’ GPS range depends on your cellphone network coverage. This is fine if you only take your dog to the dog park, for a walk, or let it play in the backyard. However, other collars, specifically collars used for hunting dogs, have longer ranges. For example, the Garmin Astro 320 T5 collar has a nine-mile range limit.If you have a hunting dog or you frequently take your dog hunting, consider a collar with a longer range.
Also consider a collar with a longer range if you frequently bring your dog on hiking or camping trips.

, Collars that connect to your smart phone are convenient because you can instantly pull up the location of your dog in your phone's map application. However, some collars only employ a text-massaging system where the collar sends you a text with the location of your dog.Collars that work in conjunction with your phone can also have the ability to turn a light on the collar to find your dog in the dark.

Slip the collar over your dog’s nose and head.,
Pull the collar up just behind the dog’s ears.,
Pull up on the D ring.,
Test the fit with your fingers.,
Look to make sure the collar is properly fitted.,
Check the fit of the collar each time it is placed on your dog.",How to Fit a Martingale Collar," Measure the largest part of your dog’s head and the middle of their neck. If your dog’s head is larger than their neck, you’ll need a collar that can fit comfortably over their head. If their neck is larger than their head, you’ll need a collar that fits comfortably around their neck.Add 2” to the largest measurement to allow for growth.If you are purchasing a buckle Martingale you will only need a neck measurement.;
, Take your tape measure and measure the circumference of your dog’s head starting from under their jaw up around to the front-base of their ears., Measure, starting from where their neck meets their jaw, up around and over their ears. Both of these first two measurements should give you a complete measurement of their head.The Martingale collar only needs to fit over your dog’s head and will mostly be fitted around their neck.

, This will give you the size of their neck and will inform you as to what size Martingale you will need.


Choose a collar size where your measurement is in the middle of the size range. For example, if your dog’s neck is 15 inches, choose a size that is 13-18 inches rather than 15-20 inches., Understanding the design of the collar will help you make the best fitting for your dog. Locate the two loops of the collar, the large outer loop and the small control loop where the leash attaches to a D ring.


The larger loop is the adjustable part of the collar and should be adjusted to fit your hound correctly., Make sure the nylon adjuster is at its largest size before slipping the collar on your dog.If you have a buckle Martingale, you can simply place the collar around the neck and connect the buckle on the side release., It is crucial to adjust the collar here because this is the point at which the collar could slip off the dog’s head. The two metal rectangles should be at least two inches apart from one another., Pulling up on the D ring will test how well you’ve fitted the collar. If the hardware on the collar is touching (where the control loop meets the larger loop around your dog’s neck), the collar is too loose and needs to be tightened.The control loop should close when you pull up on the D ring., Be sure to leave around one to two fingers of room on the loop around the dog’s neck when the control loop is closed so that the collar isn’t too tight.Adjust the slide buckle on the outer loop so that the hardware is approximately 2"" apart.

, A properly fitted Martingale collar should rest around the middle of the dog's neck. If it is still tightened up behind their ears, the collar is too tight and might cause them discomfort., Martingale collars do stretch over time and need to be adjusted and occasionally completely refitted."

Consider using an aversive collar.,
Use a choke chain collar with especially aggressive dogs.,
Understand the drawbacks of shock collars.",How to Find the Right Collar for Your Dog2," Positive training methods should always be favored – in part because they show your dog what you want them to do. However, if your dog has a persistent bad habit, an aversive collar can remind them not to do something they aren’t supposed to. More directly, aversive collars suppress or punish unwanted behavior. While some aversive collars employ pain, some will simply annoy your dog as punishment for a particular behavior.Limit your use of aversion collars to situations of necessity or temporary training.
If you feel it is necessary to use one for training, discontinue use periodically to see if your dog has learned not to repeat poor behavior.

, Choke chain collars are made of metal chains that tighten around your dog’s neck when they pull against their leash or tie off. A choke collar should sit high on your dog’s neck, almost to their ears. It's also important to note that it's highly preferable to avoid using a choke chain if at possible. Much safer collars can be effective, and quality obedience training can quickly make this sort of collar unnecessary.Choke chain collars do not have built-in controls on how much they can be tightened, so they pose a risk to your dog. To put it bluntly: dogs have been injured and even strangled by choke chains. Even if they do not suffer an apparent injury, a choke chain may damage your dog’s trachea, esophagus, nerves, and blood vessels, leading to nerve issues.
If you do choose to use a choke chain, have an experienced dog trainer help your properly fit the collar. You will need to add 2-3 inches to the circumference of your dog’s neck to find a chock collar’s size.
Never use a choke chain as an everyday collar.
Some choke chains have blunt prongs that protrude inwards and add to the discomfort your dog feels when the collar is tightened. While these are designed so that the prongs are not positioned against your dog’s trachea, the collar may slip and pose considerable risk to your dog.

, Shock collars include metal contact points that shock your dog via electric current. The shock itself can range from mildly tickling to quite painful. Some use shock collars as a component of an invisible fence containment mechanism. Invisible fences can be installed in your yard to establish an electronic force field of sorts. If your dog attempts to cross the field, they will be shocked. Usually, a shock will be preceded by a sound that warns the dog not to proceed.Do not use shock collars as training device otherwise. Some shock collars allow for a human to shock the dog via remote control. This is not an effective training method, and can make a dog fearful or more aggressive. The dog may not even recognize that their behavior is associated with the shock.
Never leave a shock collar on your dog for a long time.

Weigh the benefits of an anti-bark collar.,
Use a vibrating collar for a deaf dog.,
Use a GPS-enabled collar instead of a chip.,
Use a reflective collar at night.",How to Find the Right Collar for Your Dog3," Bark-control collars will reduce excessive or unwanted barking by your dog. However, they do not address the reason your dog is barking, and will not help your dog understand that they do not need to bark. In other words, your dog will still feel the stress that leads to barking, whereas training to address fear or territorial behavior is a better way to reduce both your dog’s bark, as well as the discomfort they may be feelings.Use spray or ultrasonic collars temporarily. If you need relative silence for a specific period of time, an anti-bark collar can reduce your dog’s barking.
Spray collars will expel a burst of citronella when you dog barks, interrupting them and deterring continued barking. Similarly, ultrasonic collars will emit a sound that only your dog can hear.
Do not use these collars with dogs that have high-pitched barks, nor around other dogs.
Never use shock collars to inhibit barking, as this is inhumane.

, It can be hard to get the attention of a dog that is old or does not have full hearing. Fortunately, you can get a collar that can be made to gently vibrate by remote control. This can be used to train, or simply get the attention of a dog that cannot hear or see.It is not mandatory to get a vibrating collar is your dog is deaf, though it can greatly help with training and social interaction.
Options vary widely. Talk to a trainer about what type of collar and training are likely to work the best for your dog.

, While surgically implanted chips are an option to help ensure you never lose your dog, you can also get a collar with a chip in it. These collars use global positioning satellites to identify their position anywhere on the planet!There a various products and brands you can choose from. Make sure to opt for a collar that employs ""A-GPS"" which includes updated technology to improve GPS readings.
Expect to pay somewhere between $40 and $80 dollars for this sort of collar, depending on attributes such as battery life of the device.

, If you often take your dog on walks at night, get them a reflective collar. This will increase both their safety and your own. These are usually made of nylon, with various types of light-reflecting accents. Definitely get your dog a reflective collar if you ever let them off leash at night or in low-light areas."

Select a comfortable collar for your dog.,
Decide if you want a stand-alone collar or an attachment.,
Look for well-known established brands.",How to Choose a GPS Dog Collar2," When choosing a device, you need to consider the weight of your dog and the weight of the collar. Many GPS collars are too heavy for smaller breeds. If you have a smaller dog, choose a lightweight collar. Make sure the collar will not cause any discomfort or limitations to your dog’s movements., While some GPS collars are stand-alone devices, others attach to your dog’s original collar. GPS trackers that attach to collars can be at risk of detaching from your dog’s collar. On the other hand, stand-alone collars can be bulky, heavy, and uncomfortable. But, they do stay on your dog., Buy a dog collar from an established brand. The reason for this is that, if the company you bought the collar from goes out of business, then the collar becomes useless. Therefore, buy a collar from a well-known brand, but still consider the costs, accuracy and range of the GPS, and the battery life."

For example, if you bring your dog camping, hiking, or to the beach with you frequently, the likelihood that your dog will get lost or wander off increases significantly. Consider buying a GPS collar if this applies to you and your dog.

, If you live in a space or area where your dog is limited, like an apartment, this can cause your dog to want to escape, or wander away from your area. Or, if your dog is an inside dog, it could accidentally escape and become lost if someone leaves the door open. Consider getting a GPS collar for your dog if this applies to you., Breeds that are prone to escape or run away are Labrador retrievers, Jack Russell terriers, German shepherds, spaniel breeds, Staffordshire bull terriers, border collies, boxers, pugs, poodles, and Chihuahuas. Consider getting a GPS collar for your dog if you have one of these breeds, and if your dog has tried to escape or run-off at least once.If your dog is one of these breeds, but is well-trained, then a GPS collar might not be necessary.

Construct a simple wooden dog house in the back of the kennel where the dogs can get out of the weather.",How to Build an Indoor Dog Kennel," It is very important to choose the right place for an indoor kennel. The area must be warm, spacious, and comfortable. It should be a safe environment for your animals. Consider these criteria:


The area should be spacious enough. Consider dedicating at least 1 sq. m (11 sq. ft.) per pup, and no less than 5 sq. m (55 sq. ft.) for whole kennel.
A window is necessary. The bigger the better. Natural daylight causes proper development in growing dogs.
Make a kennel in the dogs' living area, if you're raising puppies. Pups may grow up more sensitive if they do not see people or their mother all the time. If the puppy kennel is located near the mother, the puppies may get more attention and socialize more.
The place should be warm and draft-free. The optimal temperature is 20-24 °C (68-75 °F).;
, Although concrete pads make it much easier to clean the kennel yard because you can simply hose it off with water, it is an added cost. If you are unsure of how to pour concrete yourself, get a quote from two or three concrete companies and choose the one that best suits your needs and budget.


Since concrete takes several days to cure once poured, you must take this into account when planning your kennel building activities.

, Establish the size of the kennel by measuring the height, length and width of your dog, then allow room for movement and growth. Record the measurements on the patterns for bottom and ends and allow a generous door height and width. Measure the width and length needed for the entire kennel perimeter.


If you poured a concrete pad, the kennel dimensions should be a few inches smaller than the pad so that the full kennel sits on the pad.
Metal fencing is typically sold in standard sizes. To prevent the tedious job of cutting fencing, opt for a kennel in a standard size such as 10 ft. (3.05 m) by 10 ft. (3.05 m). The most common metal fencing is chain link, which is sold in a continuous roll.

, You want to keep your floor and walls nice and clean after the dogs are gone. So you need to make sure you have protected them well before installing the kennel. The pen walls should be covered by wooden or plastic boards. Boards must be firmly installed, because puppies will jump on and scratch them. Consider these steps to protect the floor:


Clear the space were the kennel is planned. It should not contain any items such as furniture or other household things. Otherwise the puppies will try to taste everything what is in.
Protect the floor from moisture. Try using a semi-thick plastic film.
If there is a need for protection against the sound, a second layer can be an old carpet. Carpet not only absorbs the sound but takes the moisture in.
The third layer is an irreplaceable linoleum. The best is to choose linoleum with a surface texture, so it will be less slippery.

, Sink them approximately 1 ft. (.3 m) deep and pour concrete mix into the hole. Add water, stir slightly, and hold until set. Attach the fencing to the posts using brackets nailed or screwed in firmly. Repeat on the other two sides, leaving the back open.

, Lay the panel of plywood on a pair of saw horses with the good side facing upwards. Mark out each component with a rafter square, ensuring the wood grain runs vertically on the end panels and horizontally on the side ones. Ensure the front and rear panels conceal the end grains of the side panels.

, Mark the desired bevel or angle on one side. The intersection between this angle and the vertical center line will provide the angle for the opposite side.

, Then use these as patterns for cutting the opposite end and side panels. Mark out and cut the floor. Ensure it is slightly oversized so it can be dressed down later using a plane. It is best to fix the sides to the top surface of the floor rather than to its edges to prevent moisture rising up the end grain of the sides.


Alternatively the sides could overlap the bottom if you can ensure the end grains will be kept dry.

, Cut the panels to shape with either a fine toothed circular saw or panel saw.

, Nails can be partially driven beforehand to allow a free hand for holding the components. Fasten the nails about 4 in. (100mm) apart or apply four galvanised screws to each side.

, Using a saw or plane, bevel the edges of the roof to form a mitre join. Under cut the overhanging edges to help drain water off and avoid excessive moisture on the end grain. These will need to be rounded off for safety. Then glue and fasten the roof panels to the kennel.


Ensure plenty of adhesive is applied to the apex joint.

, To ensure longer life for the plywood, mount the kennel above the ground on treated timber. Three lengths of 3 x 4 in. (75x50mm) laid flat would be ideal.

, A simple box that is approximately 2 feet (.6 m) taller and longer than the animal will be sufficient. Cut the door just large enough for the dog to get in and out, but not so large that rain and cold air easily blows in. Paint or stain it if desired, and then nail on a roof made with tin sheeting or plywood so the rain stays out and the dog stays in.

Bedazzle with rhinestones.,
Loop on hair ties.,
Add charms.,
Illuminate it with lights.,
Decorate with fabric paint.",How to Decorate a Dog's Collar1," Add some sparkle to your dog’s collar with rhinestones. Pick the colors and sizes you’d like, then adhere them to your dog’s collar using an extra-strong craft glue that’s appropriate for its material.To ensure that the glue doesn’t show around the edges, use a toothpick to apply a small dot of it onto the back of each rhinestone before pressing the stone down where you'd like it on the collar.
Be sure to let your dog’s collar dry overnight before you put it on them.;
, For a really simple DIY decoration, pick up some hair ties that have come pre-decorated with things like flowers, stars, or butterflies. Twist the bands two or three times around your dog’s collar until they fit snugly, and then adjust them to where you’d like them to be positioned., Your dog already should have an identification tag on their collar, but why not add some bling with a charm or two? Get a dangling charm of your choice (from festive holiday symbols to sports team logos to skulls and crossbones), and loop it securely into the metal ring or buckle on your dog’s collar., Clip-on lights offer a practical and fun addition to your dog’s collar. Get them in multiple colors and/or with flashing bulbs to make your dog stand out, even on the darkest nights.Be sure that you get LED lights that are designed to be wearable. They should have plastic casings to protect your dog from the bulbs and prevent the lights from overheating.

, Use a permanent, nontoxic fabric paint with a fine-point applicator to write words (like your dog’s name) and draw pictures (like bones) on your dog’s fabric collar.Pick a color or colors that will stand out against the color of your dog’s collar. For instance, if your dog’s collar is dark, choose light and bright colors like white or neon yellow. If your dog’s collar is a light or bright shade, pick dark colors like navy or black for your paint.
Be sure to protect your work surface with plastic or newspaper. Let your decorated collar dry for at least 24 hours before you put it on your dog.

Measure your dog to see the minimum size your dog house needs to be. Always make it larger than your dog.
Add at least half a foot above your dog’s height.
Plan to make your entrance half a foot wider than your dog.
For simplicity, try to round the measurements of your house to the nearest half foot. This will help not only in sketching, but also in measuring and buying materials.;
, Before you can start constructing the dog house, you need to spend a little time sketching it so you’ll have a plan to work with. Sketching your doghouse will enable you to start the construction process with confidence that what you're building will turn out as a well-crafted product.


When sketching your dog house, use one inch to represent a foot. Use half an inch to represent half of a foot. Since you rounded to the nearest half foot in an earlier step, this should be relatively easy.
Draw the base (perimeter) of your dog house with all four sides having a measured value.
Draw each face of the dog house with all four sides having a measured value. Include a measured value for the entrance.
Sketch the roof outline for each face, and from the top looking down. Include a measured value for all sides.
Make sure each piece of your frame is labeled and has a measured value.
Make sure each piece of plywood siding that will go over the frame has a measured value., You also need to pick a spot in your yard to place the doghouse once it’s built. Picking a safe and convenient spot is extremely important as your dog will likely be spending a good bit of time there. When picking a spot, consider:


Proximity to the house. You might want it to be close in case you need to feed or check on your dog.
The contours of the ground. Make sure to pick a spot that is high and flat. You don’t want water pooling around the dog house.
An area with shade. If you’re dog will be out during the summer, you probably need to make sure the dog house is in a shaded area. Otherwise, the sun will beat down on its roof all day and heat up your poor pup., After you’ve chosen a place to put your dog house, you need to prepare the ground. You’ll need to even any uneven areas and remove any grass or organic material. This is important, as the floor of your dog house is going to be the ground on which it sits.


Use a shovel to dig up any grass or plants from the spot.
Get some soil from nearby or from the store to fill in any holes that might be left.
Use the backside of a rack to flatten and even out the soil., There are a wide variety of tools you’re going to need to build your simple dog house. Make sure you get all of them before you start any aspect of your construction. If you don’t, you’ll have to pause construction to run over the neighbor’s house or to the hardware store. You’ll need:


A saw. A table saw or a hand saw will work just fine.
A hammer.
An electric drill.
A paintbrush.
Small roofing tacks.
1.5-inch screws, 2-inch screws, and 1-inch nails., To build your dog house, you’ll have to buy a decent amount of wood. The amount of wood depends on the size of the house and on your sketch. Make sure you buy enough wood.


Consider buying at least 10% more wood than you think you’ll need. This will provide you with extra material if you make any mistakes or make any unplanned additions.Buy 2x4s for the frame and support.
Buy plywood (your choice of gauge) for the siding of the dog house.
Use waterproof wood for the house if you plan to store the house outdoors.
Have your wood pre-cut at the store if this works for you.

, In addition to plywood and 2x4s, you’ll also need to decide on roofing material. Roofing material is important because it will protect your dog house from rain and snow and help prolong the life of your creation.


Consider 3-tab roofing tiles.
If you have old roofing supplies from previous projects, feel free to use them.
If you want to put tar paper, felt, or other roofing paper underneath the roofing tiles, you can., You also need to buy some paint. Painting your dog house will both help protect it from the elements and it will add a measure of style to your new creation.


Consider a color that matches your house.
For almost all projects, one gallon of exterior paint will work fine.
Avoid interior paint. Only use exterior paint as it provides a measure of weatherproofing.
Feel free to use extra paint if you have some laying around from another project.

, The first step you need to take when building the dog house is to cut all of the wood you’ll need to use in the construction process. Pre-cutting your wood will make sure you have all of your materials ready to go once you’ve started the construction process.


Make sure to cut with precision and remember that you used one inch to represent one foot on your sketch.
Cut 2x4s to use for your base. You should have four base pieces (two long and two short).
Cut 2x4s to use for your framing. Your framing will include four corner posts. It will also include four pieces to use as the top of your frame (these will match the dimensions of your base pieces). If your dog house is longer than three feet, consider adding extra support frames.
Cut plywood to use for your siding., Take the four base pieces and the bottom plywood piece and attach them to each other. The base will create the foundation of the house, so make sure to do it correctly.


Turn the 2x4s up so the 2 inch sides are on the ground.
Make sure you’re working on a level surface.
Take one short piece and one long piece and attach them (2 inch side on the ground) by screwing a two inch nail into the wood with an electric drill.
Take the now L shaped foundation and attach the other short 2x4 to the opposite side of the original short 2x4.
Take your final long piece and complete the rectangle by screwing another 1.5 inch screw into the corner of the rectangle.
Use a square to make sure the side pieces are attached at a right angle., After you’ve got the base together, you need to consult your sketch and complete the frame of the dog house. Since the frame is the most important, you need to do this slow and carefully.


Take the corner posts and use an electric drill to screw (and attach) them to the base. Make sure the long face of the 2x4s are parallel to the long side of the dog house.
If you have extra support 2x4s, place them equal distance between the corner posts on the long side of the dog house.
Top off the frame with the four pieces that were measured the same as the base. Use your electric drill to screw them into the corner posts. In addition, make sure to use two inch screws to screw them into each other.
Use a square to make sure the side pieces are attached at a right angle., After you’ve framed the house, you need to frame the roof. Your roof frame and shape will follow whatever you chose in your sketch, so make sure to follow it.


If you chose a gable roof (a roof that has two sides that slope and a triangle-shaped ""gable"" wall at each end), make sure to frame your “A” shape well. Use an electric drill to screw 1.5 inch screws into your roof frame. Use more 1.5 inch screws to attach the roof frame into the main frame of the dog house.
If you choose a flat roof when you made your sketch, you can move on to the next step., After you’ve framed the roof, it’s time to move on to attaching your plywood siding to the dog house. Your plywood siding will create the walls of your dog house and serve as a stabilizing force.


Take your pre-measured plywood and attach it to the long sides of the dog house. Use 1-inch nails and hammer them into the frame. Use 3 nails for each corner post, spacing them evenly. Use another 2 sets of 3 nails to secure the plywood to the base and to the top 2x4 of the frame. If you used an extra piece of 2x4 for support, use 3 more nails to secure the plywood to it.
Take your pre-measured plywood and attach it to the short sides of the dog house. You should have cut special wood (based on your sketch) for the dog house door. Use 3 1-inch nails to secure each side of the plywood into each corner post.
If you chose a flat roof, simply attach your pre-measured plywood to the main frame of the dog house., After you’ve secured the plywood to the frame, it’s time to attach your roofing material. Attaching your roofing material is important as you’ll want to protect the dog house from rain and snow.


If you’ve chosen to put down tar paper or other material underneath shingles, put it down.
Use ½ inch tacks or nails to secure the paper.
Lay your 3-tab or other roofing material on the roof of the dog house.
Use ½ inch tacks or nails to secure the 3-tab., Coat it with some paint of your choice. Coating it with paint will help preserve it. It will also add to the aesthetics of your yard.


Take your paint brush and apply a thin and quick coat of paint to the dog house.
After the first coat has dried, apply another coat of paint.
If you want, you can flip the dog house upside down and paint inside. This might help the wood stand up to the elements longer., After you’ve finished the roof and painted the dog house, it will be time to inspect the dog house. Inspecting the dog house is important, as you want to make sure it is safe for your dog. Put as much time as is needed to inspect the dog house thoroughly.


Look for any nails or screws that are protruding from wood. Pay special attention to nails that might be coming through the roof or frame of the roof.
Make sure each piece of the dog house is attach to each other and to the frame.
Do a soft shake test. Rattle the dog house a little to see how stable it is. This will give you an idea of how it will stand up to your dog moving around in it.

Add studs.,
Tool your collar.,
Punch holes.",How to Decorate a Dog's Collar2," This classic decoration will make your dog look stylish and tough. You can simply add a row of them, arrange them in a pattern, or even spell out your dog’s name.Start by marking your design onto the top of the collar with scratches using an X-Acto blade. Then, use the X-Acto blade to cut parallel holes wherever you’d like your studs to go.
Push each stud through its hole, and screw the tails in securely using a screwdriver or pliers. To ensure it’s snugly attached to the collar, tap each side of the stud with a hammer.
Studs are available for purchase online and at most craft stores. Be sure to get ones that match the thickness of your dog’s leather collar.
Remember not to add too much metal to your dog's collar. You don't want to weigh your dog's neck down with studs.

, Tooling allows you to add durable designs and lettering to leather collars. You’ll need to get leather tools with letters and/or patterns that will give you the desired design. Then, soften the leather by using a spray bottle to mist it with water a few times. After you let it sit for two minutes, arrange the tool where you’d like it to be on top of the collar, and strike it firmly using a leather crafting mallet to imprint your design.Remember that the tool pattern is the mirror opposite of what will appear on your dog's collar.
Be sure to strike the tools against a hard surface.
You can decorate the imprints with craft paint to add color.
Let your freshly tooled collar rest overnight, and then apply a coat of leather stain that matches the collar’s color before putting it on your dog.

, Create cut-out designs on your dog’s leather collar using a leather hole punch. You can use this method to decorate without adding extra weight or potentially dangerous metal to your dog’s collar.Mark where you’d like your holes on the collar first, using a piece of chalk. If you’re going for a precise design, use a gridded paper or ruler to ensure that your placement is accurate.
Set the size and shape of hole you’d like on your leather hole puncher. Place the point where you’d like your hole to be on the leather, and compress the handles of the pliers to punch the hole by hand.
If you don’t want to invest in a leather hole punch, you can also create holes using an awl (or, alternatively, a large nail) and a mallet. Position your collar over a scrap piece of wood. Then, place the awl’s point where you’d like your hole to go, and strike it firmly with a mallet to slowly drive a hole through the collar.

Recycle a collared shirt.,
Add a fabric flower.,
Wrap with fabric.,
Add a bow tie.",How to Decorate a Dog's Collar3," Measure your dog’s neck, and find an old shirt with a collar that’s about the same size or a bit bigger. Use a seam ripper to pick apart the stitches holding the collar to the body of the shirt. Button the collar over your dog’s existing collar.You can also use a scissors to cut the collar away, but this method is not preferable since you’ll have to seam the cut edge to keep it from fraying.
If you don’t have a collared shirt from your own wardrobe that’ll work, it’s easy to track a cheap one down at a thrift store where they’ll have multiple styles and sizes available.

, Attach a fabric flower to your dog’s collar with a button snap closure. Sew one side of the closure to the base of the flower, and one side to your dog’s collar wherever you would like it to go. Then, simply snap the two together!It’s best to use a flower made from a fairly durable fabric. However, the nice part about this decoration method is that you can always change up the flower according to the occasion or as the old one wears out.

, Add a splash of color and/or pattern to your dog’s collar by giving it a cloth makeover.Cut a rectangular piece of fabric that is the length of your dog’s collar, and a centimeter more than twice its width. Fold and hem the short outside edges of your fabric so that it is the length of your dog’s collar minus the buckle and holes.
With the back-side of the fabric facing out, fold your fabric in half along the long edge, and sew the two edges together to create a loop. Trim your thread, and flip the loop right-side out so that the seam is on the inside of the loop.
Slip your dog’s collar through the tube of fabric with the seam at the back, and you’re done! If the shape isn't looking right, try pressing it with an iron to flatten the fabric and hold the folds.

, Give your dog a bit of hip or fancy flare by sewing them a bow tie. Use colorful, patterned fabrics to make their tie pop.Cut two rectangular pieces of fabric, one for your bow that’s twice as long as it is wide (for instance, 9” x 4.5”) and one for the tie with a proportion of about 4x5 (for instance, 2” x 2.5”).
Fold over the long edges of both rectangles so that the patterned front-side of the fabric overlaps in the back. Press the folds into place using an iron on a setting appropriate to your fabric.
Next, fold each piece in half with the overlapping back-side out and sew together along the short edges of the fabric to create two loops. Flip the fabric the right-side out to hide the seams inside the loops.
Press your longer rectangular loop into a bow with the seam at the center. Slip your bow through the smaller ""tie"" loop to hold it in place in the center. Press your tie with an iron to encourage it to hold its shape.
To attach your bow tie to your dog’s collar, simply slide the collar through the back of the tie loop, between it and the bow, and adjust it to the position you’d like on your dog’s neck.

Provide a comfortable dog bed.,
Maintain a comfortable temperature.,
Crate train your dog.,
Block off rooms you don’t want your dog to enter.",How to Keep Your Dog Comfortable Indoors1," Keep your dog cozy indoors with a great dog bed suited for its particular needs. If your dog is shorthaired and often shivers, get it a cave-like bed with a fluffy overhang. If your longhaired dog is prone to getting hot, use a cot-style bed without any fluff.Consider getting an orthopedic memory foam bed for your older dog with joint problems.;
, A good rule of thumb is to let your own comfort guide your sensibilities when it comes to your dog. Dogs are a lot like humans in that they don't handle wide swings in body temperature very well. While there's no specific temperature that's right for all dogs, most will start to overheat when the temperature reaches the mid-80s Fahrenheit.When you feel hot, keep in mind that your long-haired dog has a fur coat that doesn't lose heat as well as your perspiring skin. During hot spells, air conditioning is best. Cold water and wet towels are also helpful.
Like humans, most dogs are comfortable in the high 60s to low 70s. Try to maintain this temperature in your home.
If you take your short-haired dog for a walk, give it a sweater when the outdoor wind chill or feel like temperature is below 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Since dogs are den animals, crate training can be an effective way of offering them a safe, comfortable space. It’s best to start crate training early when the dog is a puppy, but older dogs can also be crate trained. The key to crate training is to avoid using the crate as a form of punishment.


If your dog misbehaves, don’t immediately pick it up or grab it by the collar and throw it in the crate. Crate training is only successful when the dog comes to associate the crate with security.
Some dogs enjoy a crate with a blanket draped over it for a little extra security and coziness.
If your crate trained dog associates the crate with security, it can be among the most comfortable options for leaving your dog alone. Your dog will feel safe in its den. As a bonus, it won't get into anything it shouldn't while you're away from the house.
If you want to keep it cozy and out of trouble while you're away but your dog resists crates, a blocked off room with a window is a good substitute.

, Your dog won’t be comfortable inside if you find yourself constantly yelling at it for getting into things it shouldn’t. If your dog consistently gets into bathrooms, areas in the kitchen, or jumps onto bedroom furniture, consider using baby gates or closing doors to prevent it from entering areas.


Try to be consistent about all house rules. Your dog wants to obey rules and will be most comfortable when rules are consistent. If you don’t want it to jump on furniture, don’t make any exceptions. If you don’t want to it beg for food or nip at you when you’re making food, never give it anything except dog food and treats.

Pick a space that can be permanently or semi-permanently set up for your dog.Choose a space that your dog will be able to consistently access.
If you want to create a private space for your dog because they get nervous when you have company over, consider placing the space somewhere more secluded such as a bedroom.
If you are trying to create a space where your dog can rest, keep it away from areas where there is a lot of noise and activity like the living room or kitchen.;
, Decide on what you will use to mark the space for your dog. This may be as simple as a bed, or it may be a full crate. Other options include a dog house, a pet tent, or a playpen.Whatever you choose, make sure it is something you are comfortable consistently having in the same space. Moving the space around or collapsing it too frequently make cause unease with your dog and make it difficult for them to get comfortable there.
If you get a crate, house, playpen, or tent make sure it is large enough for your dog to stand in and turn around completely with no extra effort.

, It is important to ensure that your pet will be safe in their private space. This means removing any hazards in the area, such as cables that your dog may chew or getting safety locks for nearby cabinets so that your dog cannot get into them.If you have a small dog, ensure that other people know where the space is and what the space is for. This will help people know to not step in the space and reduce your dog’s chance of accidental injury.
If the space is under an area such as a desk or counter, make sure that the dog has enough clearance to be able to get in and out of the space without hitting themselves on what is above them or knocking anything over.

, Whether the space is for your dog to rest or just for them to have a comfortable place, a bed will help designate it as theirs. Get a comfortable dog bed that is big enough to fit your dog.Consider your dog’s specific needs when picking out a dog bed. If your dog has arthritis problems, for example, consider getting a soft bed with low edges so that they can get in and out easily.
If you live in a cold climate or want your dog to have extra comfort, consider adding a blanket to the bed. This can provide your dog with extra warmth, or simply give them extra cushioning to sleep on.

, Make sure that your dog always has easy to clean, fresh water. Keep a bowl of water in or near your dog’s space, or make sure they have easy, unobstructed access to where you regularly store their normal food and water.Change the dog’s water daily to keep it fresh and help keep your dog happy and healthy.

, Toys help offer your dog stimulation as well as emotional comfort. Provide your dog with a few plushie-type toys for their private space, as well as other treats they may enjoy such as rawhides or chew stick.If you intend for the private space to be where your dog sleeps, avoid toys that squeak or produce other loud noises, as this may be distracting to your dog.

, If you get a crate or small playpen for your dog, you may consider setting up a cover to drape over the top and back of the space. This isn’t necessary for all dogs, but for dogs that are easily distracted or dogs that are prone to nervous or shy behavior, the added privacy may be helpful.Make sure to keep the cover lifted enough for your dog to be able to easily get in and out of the space.

, If your dog is going to spend extended time in the space when you are not home, prepare for potential bathroom accidents. This is especially likely at the beginning of the crate training process. If you get a crate, find one with a removable plastic floor pan that you can easily clean.Consider setting up a puppy training pad in your dog’s space to help limit the amount of damage done and make clean-up easier.

, The first step in getting your dog to use their new space is to show it to them. Place your dog directly in the crate or on the bed so that they know it is acceptable for them to be in that space.If your dog leaves the space immediately after being introduced, try to gently guide them back to the space. Avoid getting angry or using substantial force, though. This could discourage your dog from wanting to return to the space.

, When it comes time for your dog to use the space, such as when you go to work or at bedtime, gently guide your dog to the space by calling them over to it or walking them over there. This will help them build a routine and start to think of the space as their space.If your dog is particularly reluctant to use their new private space in the beginning, it is acceptable to gently pick them up and place them there. Try to encourage them going of their own accord as much as possible, though.

, Help your dog get familiar with the space early on by calling them to come get a treat from you when you are in the space. Offer up your dog's favorite treat as a reward for coming into their new space.


Once your dog is in the space, reward them not only with the treat, but with praise and physical attention.

, If you have a crate or playpen, make sure the dog is easily able to get out and get to you. You may choose to keep the crate locked at certain points such as at bedtime or when you are away from home, but make sure your dog can come and go freely at other times.If you are using an outdoor dog house, make sure your dog has access back into the home at any point through a doggy door, and never let your dog sleep outside at night. This is dangerous for your pet and may lead to attack, injury, or death.

, If you have other dogs that you don’t want using the space, discourage them by gently leading them away. If space is designated for one dog, try to ensure that they are the only one using it.


If you have multiple dogs, try to set up a private space for all of them. This will discourage them from invading one another’s private spaces.

Consider what you'll be using the base for.,
Use a framing square and a pencil to begin reproducing the diagram you created on the wood itself.,
Place the 23” side pieces inside the 22-1/2” front and back pieces to create a rectangle with the 2"" side resting on the ground.,
Transfer the floor plans by using a pencil and a framing square to a single sheet of 3/4"" plywood.,
Using 1-1/4” galvanized wood screws, attach the floor panel to the base by drilling one screw into each corner of the of the base.

,
Again, use real wood for added insulation and versatility.,
Transfer the plans for the sides of the house to the same piece of plywood used for the floor.,
Leave an opening on the front wall of the house about 10"" wide and 13"" high.,
Cut out eight pieces of framing.,
Fasten one 15” corner framing piece to each edge of the side frames using three 1-1/4” galvanized wood screws.,
Attach the front and back panels.,
Try building a triangular, sloping roof.,
Draw the plans for the roof panels on the 2x2 piece of wood, with the dimensions at 32"" long and 20"" wide.,
Attach the 13” 2x2 roof framing piece to the inside edges of the front and back panels, halfway between the top and bottom of the angled side of each panel.,
Place the roof panels on top of the sides, making sure that the peak is tight and panels hang over each side.,
Personalize your dog house with paint.,
Create a sturdier roof.,
Furnishing the inside.,
Add fun accessories to make your pup's house a home.",How to Build a Dog House," Different dogs have different needs, but almost every dog will need the following: an insulated, dry space that he can call home whether it's hot or cold. Pay attention to these factors when building a dog house:


Think about insulation. Remember that the base builds the foundation for the whole house and creates a space of air between the ground and the floor that acts as insulation for the house. A house without a base is cooler during the cold months and warmer during the hot months.
Consider the specific elements that might affect the base in your outdoor environment. If it rains often in your area, make sure to use a non-toxic, water-resistant material and build the base high enough off of the ground to prevent flooding.;
, Cut 2x4 wood boards into four pieces, with two at 22-1/2"" long and two at 23"" long for a medium-sized dog.

, Use a countersink drill bit to pre-drill pilot holes. Then attach the base pieces together using two 3” galvanized wood screws in each end.

, The dimensions are 26"" by 22-1/2"" for the above sized frame.

,, Using wood for the dog house will help keep the house insulated, even if the wood is rather thin. For the front wall of the house, make the opening for your dog as small as possible (although still comfortable) in order to allow the house to retain heat.

, Each side should be 26"" long and 16"" wide, while the front and back should be a 24"" by 16"" rectangle with an attached 12"" high and 24"" wide triangle on top of the rectangle. Cut out this shape in one piece for both the front and the back of the house.

, Leave a 3"" tall space at the bottom of the opening to cover the base. To create the round arch at the top of the opening, use any round object you have handy, such as a mixing bowl.

, Using a piece of 2x2 fir or cedar wood, cut out eight pieces to use as framing to secure the walls and roof. You will need four corner framing pieces 15” long and four roof framing pieces 13” long.

, Then place the side panels on the base and screw galvanized wood screws every 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) around the perimeter.

, Place the front and back panels on the floor base and attach to the framing with galvanized wood screws every 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) around the perimeter.

, This not only allows rain and snow to slide off of the dog house, but also gives your dog more room to stretch out in his humble abode.

, These pieces will rest on top of the side panels to form a triangular sloping roof.

, Screw three 1-1/4” galvanized wood screws into each panel.

, Secure the roof panels to the framing pieces using 1-1/4” galvanized wood screws at 3"" intervals.

, Using only non-toxic paints that won't harm your dog, you can paint the outside of the house to match your own, or pick a fun theme like an underwater scene. If you have small children, it can be fun to allow them to paint the dog house as an art project.

, To keep the dog house extra dry, you can cover the entire roof with asphalt-impregnated roofing paper, or tar paper. Once you've covered the house, you can then add shingles for a traditional, sophisticated look.

, Keep your pup comfy by adding a blanket, dog bed, or piece of carpet inside. To add carpet, simply cut a piece of carpet to dimensions one inch smaller than the floor panel and secure it to the floor. Use wood glue if you want the carpet to be permanent, or duct tape if you want to be able to replace the carpet at a later time.

,


Hang a name plate with your pooch's name over the front of the opening using a small nail and any type of material sturdy enough to withstand the elements. You can get personalized plates made of metal, make and paint a plate out of wood, or even hang spare dog tags. Make sure that the nail does not poke out to the inside of the house.
Attach small hooks to the outside of the dog house to serve as a place to keep your dog's leash or any other toys.

Determine the size of the doghouse: Measure your dogs length, then add 12” to determine the width of the doghouse.,
Once you have determined the size the doghouse, begin by cutting the floor joists using the 2x4's.,
Cut ¾ plywood to fit over floor frame.,
Now to build the sidewalls.,
Screw sidewall to the floor using 1 ¼ “ exterior screws.,
Following the manufactures instructions for cutting hole for the dog door.,
Cut 1” and ½ “ foam insulation board to fit inside walls, The 1” and ½ “ foam should be flush with the 2x2's on the interior.,
Build the roof.,
Shingle the roof.,
Drill a hole in the back of the doghouse in the corner, down near the floor.",How to Build an Insulated or Heated Doghouse," Add 18” to determine the length of the doghouse. Measure your dog's height, and then add 9” to determine the front of the doghouse and add 3” to determine the height of the back of the doghouse.;
, You will need to cut two joists for the length of the doghouse and three for the width. Butt the length parts up to the width parts making a rectangle. Screw ends together using 3” exterior screws. Center the third width part in the rectangle and screw to secure it. Now you have the frame of the floor of the doghouse.

, Screw down to floor frame using 1 ¼ exterior screws. Flip floor over to expose floor framing. Cut 1” foam insulation board to fit between floor joists. Use liquid nails to secure foam insulation board.

, Cut ¾ plywood to the width of the doghouse. Measure along the left side, using the measurement determined in step 1 for the front of the doghouse and add 3 ½” to allow coverage of the floor 2x4. Make a mark on the measurement. Then, measure the left side using the measurement determined in step 1 for the back of the doghouse. Be sure to add 3 ½” for coverage of floor 2x4. Mark on the measurement. Next, take a straight edge, line it up to the two marks, and draw a line. Cut along line. This determined the angle of the sidewall. Trace the sidewall on the ¾"" plywood and cut to make the other sidewall. This making both sidewalls the same.

, Cut a 2x2 for each corner, the same angle as sidewall. Attach 2x2's to each corner. Cut front and back panels using the ¾” plywood. Attach only the back panels using 1 ¼"" exterior screws. Now cut 2x2 for the top and bottom of the front and back panels. Attach to the back only, this will give you a place to screw the interior plywood to the walls.

, Screw front panel on doghouse and install dog door.

, Now cut ¾"" plywood to fit all four of the interior walls. Screw the plywood to the 2x2's using 1 ¼"" screws.

, Cut roof out of ¾ “plywood. Be sure to leave an overhang to keep rain away from walls. You will need to cut two the same size to insulate it. Cut 2x2 for edge, this will give a place to put the foam insulation and screw the two peaces together. A piano hinge can be installed on the back and roof to make the doghouse easier to clean.

, Apply water-resistant felt paper and drip edge. Now, nail asphalt shingles on making sure the shingles do not line up.

, This hole needs to be just big enough for the end of the cord to the heated mat to go through. Lay the mat down on the floor and put the cord through the wall. Be sure the cord is all the way outside to prevent dog from chewing it. There you have an insulated and heated doghouse.

Practice command training.,
Play tug of war.,
Give it puzzle toys.,
Hide treats and toys.,
Train it to do physically demanding tricks.,
Create an obstacle course.",How to Keep Your Dog Comfortable Indoors2," Teaching your dog command words, like sit and come, gives it mental stimulation and helps it develop discipline. Say the command word, physically guide it into the correct position if necessary, then offer a treat as soon as it follows the command.


For example, say “Sit!” and guide its rear into a seated position if you’re just starting out, then give it a treat. Repeat the process up to twenty times, and be sure to offer a small treat the exact moment it sits so it makes the connection between sitting and getting a reward.

, When you play tug of war, be sure to keep an eye on how rowdy your dog gets. If it becomes too excited, stop the game and take a break for a few minutes, then move on to another game.It’s best to play tug of war if your dog understands “drop it” and “leave it” commands. Use command word training to teach it how to drop a toy when told.

, Puzzle and dispenser toys, such as toys that hide a treat inside, offer both mental and physical exercise. They can also keep your dog busy, typically for around a half hour depending on your dog’s attention span.If your dog gets used to a toy with a treat inside, hiding a frozen treat in it makes the game more challenging.

, Try hiding treats and toys in areas of the house where you’re okay with your dog snooping. Have it stay and when it’s not looking, hide treats or toys under lightweight boxes or other opaque containers throughout the house.If your dog has trouble at first, try doing the activity in one room, then gradually make it more challenging by expanding to other rooms.

, If your dog is fairly active and appropriately sized, try teaching it to jump on a chair, foot stool, or up and down a step ladder. Choose an object that’s safe for your dog to play on, but that will require it to exert lots of energy.Tricks like these are great for small, agile breeds like Italian Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers.

, Try assembling an agility course using objects like a box with two open ends, a hula hoop, a kitchen chair, and a pole leaned on two stools. Teach it to crawl through the box, crawl under the chair, and jump through the hoop and over the pole.Try working on each trick individually using reward-based training. Physically guide it through each motion as best you can and offer a treat. When it masters a trick, train it to do a new one and gradually combine them into the obstacle course.

Choose a good breed to keep indoors.,
Keep your dog safe from extreme weather.,
Keep your older dog inside.,
House train your dog.",How to Keep Your Dog Comfortable Indoors3," Not every breed is well suited to spending most of its time indoors. You might want to avoid a larger, more active breed if you have an apartment in a high rise building, don’t want to spend lots of time outside, don’t have a yard, or have any other reason for wanting an indoor dog.Go with a smaller breed or mix of breeds that requires less exercise. Consider getting a Beagle, Chihuahua, Boston Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, or an Affenpinscher.
Keep in mind that even if your dog spends most of its time inside, going on a daily walk is still one of the best ways to get exercise and mental stimulation. Any dog might get bored if it isn’t exposed to different sights and smells.

, One of the best reasons to keep a dog inside is to protect it from the heat or cold. During hot weather, it’s best to keep your dog in an air conditioned environment with access to plenty of water.During the cold, your dog is safest inside, and if it’s a shorthair breed, consider dressing it in a sweater for warmth.Be aware of the humidity during hot spells, since dogs cool themselves through panting and evaporation. If you don’t have air conditioning inside, a fan might not be enough to keep your dog cool. Make sure its water is always cold and put a cold, wet towel over its shoulders if it seems too hot. Take it to the vet if it seems disoriented or has trouble breathing.

, Older dogs often suffer from joint pain and stiffness, and keeping them warm helps to relieve their discomfort. Your older dog will be happy spending most of its time inside. Make it extra comfortable by giving it a warm blanket or heating pad.If you use a heating pad or electric blanket, make sure it doesn’t get too hot. Keep it on a low setting and check it frequently to be sure it’s warm and not hot.
Older dogs don’t need as much exercise, so keeping it active indoors isn’t too much of a concern.

, If you live in a high rise, in an extremely cold area, or just don’t want to go outside every few hours, indoor toilet training will be essential. Use potty pads in a designated area, and keep your dog on a strict eating and potty schedule.Get your dog used to a routine by feeding it at the same time in the morning and at night.
Take it to its potty pad 15 minutes after eating, and consider keeping it leashed so it doesn’t wander. Say, “Go potty!” and give it some time to go. When it uses the pad correctly, give it lots of verbal praise, pet it, and consider giving it a small food treat when you’re just starting with training.
If you see the dog going to the bathroom where it’s not supposed to, say “No!” and bring it to its pad. Don’t punish the dog or rub its nose in an accident area after the fact. If you react negatively even a few minutes after it’s gone to the bathroom, it won’t make the connection between the accident and your response.

Ask your parents why they want to give away your dog.,
Evaluate your dog’s recent behavior.,
Talk to a vet about your dog’s issues.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Keep Your Dog1," Before you can fix the problem, you need to know what it is. Since your parents are the ones who want to give away your dog, they’ll probably be able to tell you what your dog is doing wrong. Be respectful when you bring up the issue. Your parents will be more likely to hear you out if you appear mature.Approach your parents at a time when they’re free to talk, such as during dinner. Say, “I know you’ve been wanting to give away my dog and I was hoping we could talk about it.”
Be specific with your questions. For example, instead of asking, “Why don’t you love my dog?”, ask, “What problems are my dog causing that makes you think we need to get rid of her?”;
, If you spend a lot of time with your dog, you’re in a good position to notice any issues your dog has been having. Chances are, if you notice the problem, others have too. It’s also possible that your dog only acts badly in specific situations, such as when it’s around other dogs.Ask yourself whether your dog has been acting differently lately.
Think of how many times your dog has been aggressive or pooped in the house.
You can also evaluate your dog’s behavior by putting your dog in potentially stressful situations, like being around other dogs. Take your dog to the park and see how it reacts to other dogs.

, If your dog has been acting out of sorts, they might be sick or have some other problem. A vet will be able to tell you exactly what is wrong and what you need to do to fix it.Bring up the possibility of a visit to a vet with your parents. Tell your parents that you’re concerned that your dog might be sick or injured in some way.
If your parents think going to the vet is an unnecessary expense, tell them you’ll pay for it out of your allowance. This will show them how important your dog is to you.

Provide sources of shade.,
Keep your dog hydrated.,
Set up a kiddie pool.,
Let your dog inside occasionally.",How to Air Condition Your Dog's House1," One of the best things you can do to help your dog stay cool outside is to make sure there is plenty of shade outside for it to rest under. Temperatures are much cooler in the shade, so it’s important to provide some shady spaces for your dog to use when it’s hot outside.Some good ways to create shady spots in your yard are by planting plenty of trees and bushes, by creating some kind of deck or porch space for your dog to get under, or by giving your dog a doghouse.;
, For humans and dogs alike, hydration is essential to staying cool in the summer. Make sure your dog has several sources of water available to it at all times so that it can drink and stay hydrated whenever it wants.Making more than one water source available is important because your dog might knock over one of them. So you need to have at least one backup in place so your dog doesn’t go thirsty.

, Get a kiddie pool and fill it up with cold water – this could be water from the hose in your yard, which is usually quite cold. This will give your pup a place to relax and cool off during the hot summer days.You can usually find a cheap plastic kiddie pool for under $20 at most larger general supply stores – like Walmart or Target.

, No matter how well you try to keep your dog cool outside, you should consider letting them inside during extreme weather conditions. They can overheat easily, but the cool air inside will help keep them safe and healthy.This is especially important during the hottest summer months when you need to take extra care about keeping your dog cool.

Observe your puppy's habits.,
Try changing its diet.,
Visit the vet.",How to Cope with Owning a Restless Puppy1," While a bit of unruliness and excess energy is normal for puppies, restlessness can be a symptom of health ailments as well. Monitor your puppy's eating, eliminating, and sleeping patterns to look for any red flags. For instance, if your puppy has not had a bowel movement in over 24 hours, its restlessness is likely due to constipation.To stay organized, keep a journal to track your puppy's health. Note any other irregularities that may occur (e.g. skin irritation).;
, Food allergies are very common in dogs, and often due to a diet of highly processed dog food. If your puppy demonstrates other signs of an allergy (e.g. a lack of appetite, poor weight gain, skin irritations) its restlessness might also be a symptom. Try changing to a better quality pet food (with no preservatives and additives) over the course of several days to avoid shocking your puppy's digestive system, and see if the restlessness subsides.Introduce a bit of the new food in with your puppy's regular food, reducing the regular food accordingly. Over the next few days, increase the portion of the new food until you replace the old food completely.

, If your puppy's restlessness is intense enough to cause concern, bring it to the vet immediately. Unusual or aggressive behaviour can be a sign of serious health ailments like tumors, parasites, or diabetes. A veterinarian will be able to determine if the underlying cause of your puppy's restlessness is a physiological issue, and suggest other options if it isn't (e.g. changes to diet, exercise, and living environment)."

Take your pet on a short trial run.",How to Choose a Boarding Kennel," Find out if any of your friends who also own pets have ever used any of the boarding facilities in the area. This can be a great way to get the inside scoop on what the kennels are like and what experiences people have had with them in the past.Be sure to ask if the staff was friendly, whether or not the facility seemed clean and sanitary, and if their pet seemed to enjoy the experience.
Also ask if they plan on using the kennel again in the future. This will be a good indication for how they feel about their experience with the place.;
, Many veterinarian offices offer in-house kennel boarding services. Ask your vet if they provide this service and about some of the specifics. Inquire about cost, services offered, capacity of the kennel, and availability for the specific dates you need.You can also ask your vet if they recommend any other kennels in the area. They will probably have a good idea about what other animal-related services are provided in your area.

, Try doing an online search for boarding kennels in your area. You should be able to find many options available online – and you may even be able to check availability dates on the facility’s website.Be sure to read any reviews you can find online for each boarding kennel you are considering.

, Local pet shops should be able to give you some information regarding what places you can use to board your pets in your area.


Smaller, locally owned pet shops will probably be the best place to look for kennel information.
But even larger chain pet shops should be able to make some recommendations. They may even offer boarding services themselves. For example, PetSmart offers overnight boarding services., Some boarding kennels keep the animals in rows of small cages with very little room to move around in. Other kennels may be more like a pet resort and provide your animal with more room and a more luxurious setting. Think about how you want your pet to live while you’re away and find a kennel that suits those needs.But remember, especially if cost is a factor for you, that the more luxurious the environment, the higher the price tag will probably be.

, Never take your pet to a boarding kennel you haven’t first visited in person. An online search is just a jumping off point. You really need to go do some site visits after you’ve found some places you like online.


During your visit, take notice of how clean the place seems. You want to choose a place with clean facilities so your pet will be in a safe, healthy environment.
Notice how the place smells. Of course any boarding kennel will probably smell a little bit like animals. But if the smell is too strong, or feels overpowering, this is not a good sign for the level of cleanliness they maintain.

, There is no governing body in the pet care field that accredits boarding kennel facilities. If you want a professional stamp of approval regarding the kennel you choose, be sure to consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.If your boarding kennel has received the prestigious Pet Care Services Association (PCSA) “Voluntary Facilities Accreditation” Award, you can be confident in the level of quality care your pet will receive at this facility. Less than 1% of kennels in the United States have received this recognition, so it is a testament to the excellent cleanliness, attentiveness of staff, and exceptional medical attention your pet will receive at this kennel., A good kennel should be associated with a reputable veterinarian who can consistently oversee the animals and provide any kind of medical care that may be needed. A quality boarding kennel must offer some kind of vet services or availability, especially in case of emergency.They should also be able to administer medication to your pet and monitor your pet’s health while it is in their care.

, It’s important to understand what kind of care your pet will receive while at your chosen boarding kennel facility. When deciding on which kennel to choose, you should ask questions about how much attention and interaction your pet will receive each day. You don’t want your pet just stuck in a crate all day for the whole time you’re gone.Inquire about how often your pet will be bathed, how frequently they’ll be taken out to the bathroom, if your pet is allowed to interact with other animals, and if there will be any play time for your pet.

, Find out what services each location offers. Usually, there will be a variety of packages to choose from beginning with the most basic amenities for your pet and branching out to more luxurious offerings. Ask what services are available and consider which options you want and how they compare to your budget.


Some boarding kennels even offer 24 hour video surveillance of your pet through a smartphone app., Obviously, prices will vary from location to location – depending on the services provided and how much care your pet will receive. Keep your budget in mind and be sure to ask about the cost per night (and for any additional services) as you are considering potential locations to board your pet.On average, depending on the size of your pet and services requested, boarding your pet can cost between $15 and $90 per day.

, Most boarding kennels will require that your pet’s vaccination records be up-to-date before they will allow your pet to come stay with them. This is important for your own pet’s health as well as maintaining the health of other animals your pet may interact with.The kennel will probably require an official copy of your pet’s vaccination records from your veterinarian’s office. Or they may call your vet for verification.

, Being boarded away from home and away from its family can be very stressful for a pet, but you want your pet to feel as comfortable as possible while you are gone. If the boarding facility will allow it, try to bring some things from home that will help put your pet at ease.Consider bringing your pet’s bed or its favorite toy. Maybe even consider bringing some of your pet’s favorite treats.
Definitely bring your pet’s food if they have special dietary needs.
This also includes any medication your pet may need while being boarded at the kennel – medication it takes every day, or even meds that your pet only needs occasionally. You want to make sure your pet is reasonably prepared for every situation while you are gone.
But always ask the kennel what they do and do not allow to be brought from home before you take the time to bring something they might not allow.

, Make sure you bring the kennel’s contact information with you after you take your pet to the facility. Ask them about any special instructions they may have for contacting them, especially after hours.


Be sure to leave accurate contact information for yourself with the kennel so they can reach you if they need to. Remember to give them your cell phone number if you’re going to be away from home.
Ask if the kennel staff is available by phone 24 hours per day, or if you can only call at certain times.

, If at any point you have questions about boarding your pet, call the facility. They should be happy to answer any questions you may have to help ease your mind and make sure you’re prepared for the visit.Be sure to remind the kennel employees about any special needs your pet may have when you arrive to drop your pet off.

, Leaving your pet can be stressful, especially for the first time at a new place. Consider taking your pet to the kennel for a short time to see how they do before you commit to leaving them for a longer period of time.


You should be able to tell how your pet will react to being boarded at the kennel if you leave it there for one overnight stay.
Be sure to discuss how your pet reacted with the staff and ask them if they have any advice on what you might need to do differently before bringing your pet in for a longer visit.

Throughout the process, reward your puppy with treats for good behavior.;
, Before cleaning your puppy’s ears, check the hair on the top of the earflap, as well as the hair under the earflap. Dirty or matted hair should be removed from the outside of the ear, as well as near the ear canal.Heavy, matted, or moist hair surrounding the ear can obstruct airflow to the ear canal, which can lead to an infection.
Excess, dirty, or matted hair inside the ear canal should be removed by a veterinarian.

, Once the hair is groomed around your puppy’s ears, fold your puppy’s ear back. Dampen a cotton ball or a piece of gauze with mineral oil and hydrogen peroxide.Do not use alcohol to clean your puppy’s ears.

, Gently wipe away any debris or earwax you see on the underside of the earflap. Make sure to lift debris and earwax up and away from the ear canal. Do not rub it into the ear canal.Do not use cotton-tipped applicators, i.e., Q-tips, to clean your puppy’s ears. These applicators will push dirt and debris deeper into your puppy’s ear.
Be careful not to insert anything into your puppy’s ear canal. This can cause ear damage, or lead to an infection.

Promise to spend more time with your dog.,
Agree to pay for obedience school.,
Tell your parents you’ll clean up after your dog.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Keep Your Dog2," If your parents complain that the dog doesn’t get enough attention, tell them you will devote more time to care for your dog. If they believe you will do it, this will assuage their concerns.Your parents want to see that you’re serious, so instead of saying, “I’ll spend more time with my dog,” lay out specifics. Tell them, “I promise to walk my dog every morning and spend at least twenty minutes playing with him when I get home from school.”
If you know you’re going to be away for a day or two, tell your parents you’ll arrange for someone to either care for your dog while you’re away or at least come by the house and walk the dog every day.

, If your dog is aggressive with other animals, doesn’t respond to commands, or barks whenever someone knocks on the door, your dog probably needs to learn obedience. The best way to teach a dog obedience is for the dog to attend obedience school. Obedience school will teach your dog that it will only get attention when it displays good behaviors.Call obedience schools in your area and find out how much they charge and what their schedules are.
Tell your parents you’ll pay for the schooling out of your allowance and you’ll use your own time to take your dog to school.
If you can’t afford to pay for obedience school, try bargaining with your parents by promising to find the school and keep up with your dog’s training at home.

, If your dog causes a lot of mess around the house, either by pooping inside or tearing things apart, you need to take responsibility for your dog’s behavior. If you promise that you’ll clean up after your dog, your parents won’t have to worry about being stuck taking care of your dog’s messes.Promise to clean up after your dog every time your dog makes a mess.
Also promise to repair or replace anything your dog damages.
It’s important that your parents know you’ll do these things without them having to pester you. So make it clear that you take the responsibility seriously.
For example, tell your parents, “I know I haven’t been very good about cleaning up after my dog. But it’s my responsibility and I promise to do a better job from now on. You won’t even have to remind me!”

Tell your parents that you’re learning to be responsible.,
Show your parents that you’re getting more exercise.,
Let your parents know that your dog is your friend.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Keep Your Dog3," Your parents want you to learn the value of responsibility. If you can show them that caring for a dog is making you a more responsible person, they’ll be less likely to give away your dog.Make a list of the responsibilities you’ve taken on since you got the dog. List the daily chores you do to clean up after your dog and the scheduled walks and playtimes you engage in.
If you have siblings or other relatives who have seen you care for your dog, have them chip in on your behalf and express how responsible you are in caring for your dog.
For example, you might ask your sister to tell your parents that having a dog has made you more aware of your actions affect others.

, Most kids spend a lot of time on their phones or computers, so any time spent outside exercising is seen as a good thing by most parents. If your parents think having a dog is making your more physically healthy, they’ll be less likely to want to give the dog away.Tell your parents how often and how far you walk your dog. If you run with your dog, highlight how your dog keeps you motivated to keep going.
For example, you might tell your parents that since you’ve had a dog you’ve been running three miles a day.
Highlight the benefits of exercise. Tell your parents that walking and playing with your dog makes you feel energized and better able to complete your schoolwork.

, Your parents might not know how much your dog means to you. If they understand that you think of your dog as your friend, they might think twice about giving away your dog. The best way to let your parents know you love your dog is to show it.Spend time with your dog and show your dog affection.
If your parents don’t see you playing with your dog or they don’t understand that your dog is your friend, tell them. Try saying, “I love my dog and she’s like my best friend. If I were to lose her I would be really sad.”
Tell your parents that you’d be lonely without your dog. For example, you might say, “My dog helps me feel less alone when you guys are gone or when I’m alone at night.”

Buy a doghouse.,
Purchase a doghouse air conditioning unit.,
Install the air conditioner.,
Ready the doghouse.",How to Air Condition Your Dog's House2," You’ll need a sturdy wood doghouse if you want to install a useable, sustainable air conditioning system inside of it. Most pet shops, outdoor stores, and supercenter stores sell doghouses.Spend some time finding one you like that will last for quite a while.
You can also consider building a doghouse yourself out of sturdy wood.

, For the doghouse project, an air conditioning unit specifically designed for doghouses is probably your best option. These are designed for outdoor use and will be much less hazardous for your dog.Check your local pet store or even an appliance store for this special kind of unit. But you may need to search online for a specific retailer that sells this product.
Regardless, you will have to be mindful about keeping the electrical parts protected from exposure to the elements by keeping it covered and out of the open.

, Since this is a complicated mechanical system, it is best to let a licensed professional install it for you. Most companies who sell doghouse air conditioners will come out and install the equipment for you, making sure that it is done properly.You’ll have to pay for installation, but it is often included in the price of the air conditioning unit.

, Once the air conditioner is installed and secured to the doghouse, you’ll need to make sure it runs properly. Give it a test run before letting your dog use the doghouse.Put your dog’s bed inside the doghouse and let the dog go inside. Then your dog will be all set.
Make sure the electrical elements are not positioned near any water sources to avoid damage or possible electrocution.

Get the necessary tools.,
Choose the doghouse.,
Purchase a small air conditioning unit.,
Make sure the doghouse is safe.,
Cut a hole for the air conditioner.,
Install the air conditioner.",How to Air Condition Your Dog's House3," As with any project, it’s important to have the right tools needed to complete the job. You will be sawing and cutting wood, as well as securing the air conditioning into place. So you will need quite a variety of tools for this job.For this project, you’ll need a saw, hammer, nails, and an old shed or other doghouse structure.

, It can be quite unsafe for your dog if you attempt to install an air conditioner in a small doghouse. So it is a better idea to air condition a more stable structure instead.Consider installing an air conditioning unit inside an existing shed in your yard. This will be a safer way to help keep your dog cool in the summer.

, For the doghouse project, a small window unit is probably your best option. Try to find a nice used one (on Craigslist or in the newspaper classifieds), or go to an appliance store to buy a new one.


You can usually find a nice, small air conditioning window unit for less than $200.If you don’t want to cut into the side of the doghouse, you could consider getting a portable air conditioning unit. However, you’d have to consider how to keep it from being overexposed to the elements by covering it.

, Keep the air conditioning unit (along with all related plugs, cords, and electrical outlets) out of your dog’s reach. You don’t want your dog to gnaw on the cords and get electrocuted, or for the air conditioner to short out because it got rained on.


You might also consider insulating the doghouse to add an extra measure of protection from the elements. This will help the doghouse maintain its cool interior during the summer months.

, Just as you would to make room for any window air conditioning unit, cut a hole in the side of the shed. Saw a square hole where the air conditioner will go on the back side of the shed.You may want to use a pencil to trace the outline of the air conditioner onto the wood so that you know exactly where to cut to make a hole that is the correct size.

, After you have sawed the square, take the air conditioner and put it in the square. Carefully slide the air conditioner into the open space, making sure to avoid scraping the edges. And you don’t want to push the air conditioner too far into the shed. Make sure the front of the unit is fully inserted and then stop.Use the accordion side panels on the window unit to adjust the unit more closely to the size of the hole. This will help it stay in place more securely.
Use the securing brackets that came with the air conditioning unit to firmly mount the unit in place. If the unit didn't come with mounting brackets, purchase or fashion a support system that will hold the air conditioner securely in place. You’ll need to use a screwdriver and/or hammer and nails to mount the safety brackets to the wall and to the unit.

Give it plenty of exercise.,
Play games.,
Teach it basic commands.,
Groom your puppy.,
Socialize your puppy.",How to Cope with Owning a Restless Puppy2," At its young age, your puppy should be exercising regularly and consistently, but not too vigorously. Exercise provides mental stimulation and helps your dog avoid arthritis and joint problems later in life, and will usually result in calmer behavior afterwards. Ideally, your dog should be getting 5 minutes of low-impact exercise for each month of age, twice a day (i.e. a 3 month old dog will need 15 minutes of exercise, twice a day).Low-impact exercise may include going for short walks, playing in the yard, or supervised swimming.

, Your puppy's restlessness may be due to boredom, so try playing games with it to keep it occupied. Basic games like tug of war, fetch, and hide and seek are simple enough to play with a puppy. To play hide and seek, for instance, tell your puppy to sit and stay, show it a treat, then hide in another room and call it to you. The game relies on and improves your puppy's sense of smell and develops its ability to come when called.

, At around 12-16 weeks old, try teaching your puppy basic commands using the correction and reward method. Correction should only involve speaking firmly (never physical punishment or yelling) and rewards should be anything that your puppy enjoys (e.g. treats, favorite toys). Initial training should happen in short, 10-15 minute sessions and be an enjoyable process for you and your puppy.Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for a detailed guide and instructional videos on how to teach your puppy five basic commands:""Sit”,""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here”.

, Grooming your puppy from an early age is important to get it used to being handled (as it will be by veterinarians and groomers in the future, for instance). It also keeps your puppy clean and helps to forge a bond with its owner(s). Grooming can include baths, brushing, nail trimming, and ear cleaning, and it should happen in some form as often as once a day., Socialization shapes and improves your dog's temperament, and is a positive way for it to exert energy and build trust and respect for people. Socialization with other dogs is just as important, and your puppy's early experiences will shape its social skills as a grown dog. Invite friends over with their pets for ""puppy play dates"", and when your puppy is older than three months, bring it out for walks in the park to meet new people and animals.Having your restless puppy socialize with other people can be an excellent opportunity to take a break (e.g. having friends or family play with it or take it for a walk).

Massage the base of the ear.,
Let your puppy shake.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.",How to Clean Puppy Ears2," Your puppy’s ear canals are L-shaped, and dirt and debris accumulate easily in the corner of the L. Therefore, you might want to clean your puppy’s ears with a solution once a month. Tilt your puppy’s head downward, and squirt a small amount of the solution into your puppy’s ear canal.Fill the ear canal with the solution, but do not overfill it. The ear should not be overflowing with solution.
Clean your puppy’s ears with a solution that is recommended by your veterinarian.

, For 20 to 30 seconds, gently massage the base of your puppy’s ear. This will help loosen any debris inside the ear canal. You may hear the solution swish around as you massage your puppy’s ear.Calm your puppy by petting and praising it in a soothing voice such as, ""That's a good girl (or boy).""
Reward good behavior with a treat.

, Once you are done massaging, stand back and let your puppy shake the solution out of its ears. This will bring the softened wax and debris up and out of its ears. Then, use cotton balls to gently wipe away any debris and earwax.


Remember to wipe the earwax up and out of the ear., If your dog exhibits any signs of pain, i.e., whimpering or rubbing its ears, while you are cleaning, then stop cleaning and take it to the vet immediately. Take your puppy to the vet if it, or its ears, show any signs or symptoms of an ear infection, such as:Ear scratching, pawing at the ears, or wiping the ear on the floor or the furniture.
Brown, black, or bloody discharge.
Redness and/or swelling.
Head shaking or a head tilt.
Loss of balance, unusual eye movements, and/or walking around in circles.

Consult your vet.,
Inspect your puppy’s ear.,
Smell your puppy’s ear.",How to Clean Puppy Ears3," How often you clean your puppy’s ears depends upon your puppy’s breed, coat, level of activity, age, and earwax production. Therefore, you should consult your veterinarian before cleaning your puppy’s ears. Your veterinarian will be able to recommend an appropriate ear cleaning regimen for your puppy., Inspect your puppy’s ears on a weekly basis to see if they appear dirty.

Purchase a crate.,
Get your puppy comfortable with its crate.,
Close the door.,
Leave the house.,
Crate your puppy overnight.",How to Cope with Owning a Restless Puppy3," Crate training works with a dog’s natural denning instinct and is not meant as a punishment, though it can help to curb restless or disruptive behavior. Your dog’s crate should become its refuge, a place to feel safe and comfortable in and to call its own. With this in mind, purchase a crate that will accommodate your puppy when it reaches adult size. While it is still a puppy, use a divider to block off part of the crate, allowing it enough space to stand up, lie down and turn around comfortably in.For a list of dog breeds and the sizes of crate that are appropriate for them, visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers website at https://apdt.com/pet-owners/crate-size/.

, Line the crate with a blanket and a few toys and leave it open to be explored at your puppy’s will. Feed it treats while it is inside and encourage it to take naps in the crate by leading it there when it is sleepy. Start feeding your puppy meals inside the crate to increase its comfort and positive associations with it., Start closing the door with your puppy inside of it for a few seconds at a time while your puppy is eating. Remain near the crate until your puppy seems comfortable with being inside with the door closed (i.e. doesn’t whine to be let out). Try leaving the room for a few minutes while your puppy is inside, then rewarding it with praise and treats once you return and let it out.As your puppy grows more comfortable with this happening, leave the room for longer periods of time.

, Once your puppy is comfortable with being left in its crate for up to 30 minutes, try leaving the house with it inside. Crating your puppy while you are out can reduce its anxiety about being on its own in a big space. Crate your puppy for about 15-20 minutes before you step out to avoid having it associate the crate with you leaving. Keep your departure and arrival home low-key to avoid getting your dog overexcited.Continue crating your puppy while you are home as well, in short periods – puppies younger than 6 months old should not be left in their crate for more than 3-4 hours at a time since they need to relieve themselves more often than older dogs.

, If your puppy is older than 6 months and restless at night, try crating it overnight. Start by keeping the crate in your bedroom, so that you can let your puppy out if it needs to relieve itself during the night. As your puppy grows more comfortable with sleeping in there, try moving it out of your room to a location you prefer."

Add some crunch.,
Add carrot.,
Warm your dog’s food.,
Address your dog's stubborn behavior if you need to.",How to Make a Dog's Dry Food Tastier So He Will Eat It All," Some dogs just can’t stand the texture and the toughness of dry food. If this is the case, you can just add a little water to the food to soften it up. You want to add enough water to soften the food, but not to drown it. For every cup of dog food, try using about 1/6 cup of water. Let the food sit for a minute before you give it to your dog. This way, the food will absorb the water., This tactic works like water, but with the bonus of added taste. Try low salt stock gravy cubes, meat drippings, or fish broth. Avoid adding anything with a high salt content — like most yeast-based products like vegemite. Dogs cannot process a lot of salt in their diet and when they are forced to, it strains their kidneys.Do not substitute gravy for a meal. It doesn't have the same nutrients as dry dog food., Purchase some Swanson or other brand low-sodium natural chicken, beef, or vegetable broth. Look for broth that contains no onion which is toxic to dogs.

Pour approximately 1 tablespoon for each cup of dry food, and mix/shake the bowl so the pellets to soak in broth and soften up. Your dog will like them much better. You can warm the broth in the microwave dish, but avoid overheating it. , Not all dogs will like bananas, but some love them, and bananas are high in potassium, fiber, and magnesium., Dogs have taste buds like humans, so why not “spice” up your dog food with a handful of dried herbs. This adds an intriguing scent, which might be enough to entice your furry friend into feasting on its dry food.

Oregano is loaded with antioxidants. Rosemary has iron, calcium and vitamin B6. Peppermint extract has powerful properties that'll help your dog's digestive system. And basil and parsley are also great antioxidants. Just give a couple shakes of the spice shaker over your dog's food and you'll have your own canine cuisine masterpiece., A suggestion is to purchase Bil-Jac dog snack, which is available at most pet stores.

Crumble the two pieces and sprinkle over the dry food. Add liver and you'll have any dog 'inhaling' their food. This is a win-win situation. You get a healthier dog and your dog gets a treat. Liver is filled with vitamins B, A, and K. It is also a great source of iron. And your dog will inhale it. However, be aware that it is possible to give too much of a good thing. In the long term the high levels of vitamin A in liver can cause a condition where bones fuse together. Avoid giving liver on a daily basis in the long term. You will be fine for a week, but after that it's not a good habit to get into.

, Eggs are a great source of protein that your dog will enjoy immensely. Egg whites are more easily digested when cooked, while yolks retain more of their nutritional value if fed raw. Most dogs have no trouble with bacteria in raw eggs, but it’s fine to feed soft-cooked, hard-cooked, or scrambled eggs.

One egg is around 70 calories. This is sufficient for a medium-sized or large adult dog. If you have a small dog, only give them 1/2 egg., For an easier and tastier approach, use canned products, but be sure to drain any liquid prior to adding it to the dog food. Use low sodium green beans. High sodium food is bad for any dog.For starters, fill approximately 1 tablespoon with beans (no water) and mix with pellets.
If they like the beans, you can add 1/2 more tablespoon.

, Try mixing 6-7 small soup crackers with the pellets. It will add the crunchiness to the meal and dogs love it.


For a similar effect, get a small piece of white bread, lightly toast it, and crumble over your dog's dry food and mix lightly. He will eat the bread with the dry food, but may leave some on the plate. Most likely he will finish it later because the smell of bread stays there.

, Cook a carrot, or buy can of carrots and add small pieces to your dog's dry food, mixing them in thoroughly. Grated carrots can work well too. Carrots are sweet and appeal to many dogs. They are filled with beta keratin and vitamins C, A, and K. , In some cases, senior dog’s lose their appetite because their sense of smell is fading. That delicious kibble doesn’t entice them because they cannot smell it. If this is the case, try warming your dog’s food up in the microwave — for only 15 seconds or so. This will amplify the food’s natural aroma so your dog can catch a whiff of it., Despite the popular idiom, you can teach both young and old dogs new tricks, even if you didn't mean to. Imagine, for example, that your dog was reluctant to eat one day. This caused you to worry, so you rained attention down on your dog. You fed him tasty morsels from the table, hand fed him, and praised him whenever he decided to take a bite. Now your dog has equated not eating their normal dry kibble with tasty “human” food and extra attention.If you know your dog is healthy and you suspect that your dog is duping you into getting better food and more attention, condition them out of it intentionally. Place their food bowl down for 30 minutes and leave the room. When you come back, take the food away completely until the next meal. Don’t give them treats, and don’t make a fuss. It might be hard for both of you, but eventually, your dog will wise up and start eating normally again. "

Look for the cause.,
Cut back on treats and table scraps.,
Exercise the dog.",How to Increase Appetite in Dogs1," There are many relatively minor reasons the dog might be eating less. These may clear up on their own, but you can still try to help them through it. If none of these issues fit your dog's situation, you may need to contact a vet or consider medical causes.


Some dogs get motion sick when traveling. Others have trouble eating in new surroundings following a move.
Some dogs dislike being fed in an uncomfortable situation. Try to keep the dog's bowl in the same place, at a comfortable height, and away from other pets that try to eat the dog's food.
Dogs may react to the departure or arrival of another pet or a family member.
The cause may even be something small, like changing furniture or having house work done.
The dog may simply happen to be picky about the type of food he eats.;
, Most dogs would much rather eat that piece of steak and mashed potatoes than dog food. He'll love you for giving it to him, but over time it can make him a finicky eater and a beggar at the table.


Keep careful watch on your kids — they aren't always the best about cooperating with this rule.

, Regular exercise will stimulate your dog's appetite and encourage him to eat more. To really boost the appetite-improving effects of exercise, take him for a walk before each meal. It won't take him long to associate the walk with mealtime, giving him a positive association for both activities.


Although some types of dogs require more activity than others, ideally, your dog should be getting exercise every day or at least several times a week.
If you aren't capable of participating in physical activity, there are plenty of other ways to have your dog exercised for you. Take him to a doggie day care center, hire a dog walker, or go to a dog park and let the other dogs tire him out.

Choose a puppy with a balanced personality.,
Avoid suspicious or skittish puppies.,
Refrain from immediately choosing the most enthusiastic puppy.",How to Choose a Puppy to Keep from Your Litter1," Often, the best pets are the ones that have balanced personalities. You may not want the bossy, strongest puppy who seems to be the leader or the shy runt who gets left behind. Instead, you may want to look for a puppy who falls in the middle of the personality scale. This puppy may be energetic, but also knows how to be calm and mind. You might want to consider:


How well does the puppy play with their littermates? Are they rough and assertive, or do they run and hide?
Is the puppy very loud and boisterous or soft and quiet?
Does the puppy like to be touched and handled?;
, When choosing a puppy from your litter, you may want to pass on the puppies that seem distrustful of strangers or who shy away when you approach. These puppies may become shy and easily startled dogs.Check to see if the dog is skittish by clapping your hands, dropping your keys, or making any other loud sound. If the dog reacts in a scared way, they may be a skittish, fearful dog.
If you have children, skittish and shy puppies are probably not the best choice. They may snap at your children.

, Many people believe you should choose the puppy who is the most energetic or the one who runs up to you. While you may end up liking this puppy best in the end, you shouldn’t choose this puppy before you evaluate all of the puppies. Many great potential pets may be the puppies who are hanging back patiently. Don’t overlook those puppies. Instead, look at each puppy carefully and decide if you want the most energetic or a calmer, shier puppy.Carefully hold the puppy in your arms. Does it stay there calmly for you, or does it wiggle around? Place the puppy on its back on your lap. Does it lay there, or does it squirm and try to flip back around? If the puppy squirms or tries to get out of your grasp in either of these positions, you may have an enthusiastic, willful puppy.
Energetic puppies may be too much for you after a few days. An energetic puppy will continue to be energetic after you take it home.

Keep food fresh.",How to Increase Appetite in Dogs2," Feed your pet twice a day at regular times, or as recommended by your vet. Some dogs prefer eating later in the day.


If the dog is healthy and energetic, but gets distracted before finishing, set his food down and walk away. Come back in a half hour and pick his dish up, even if he hasn't eaten all of his food. It won't take him long to realize he needs to eat when he has the chance.

, Have the dog play with a toy with food hidden inside. Teach your dog new tricks and offer healthy treats or food as a reward.

, To make the dog's food more palatable, you can stir in a few spoonfuls of canned dog food or pour a little warm water or broth over the top.


Alternatively, use dog gravy. You can buy this from pet stores. These are just granules that you mix with dry food and warm water that can make the food far more tasty for the dog.

, If the dog still won't eat, try these variations. It may take a little time for your dog to adjust to the change, but they may help in the long run:


Feed your dog away from other pets.
Use a different bowl or place it at a more comfortable height.
Feed directly on the floor instead of in a bowl.
Some dogs get distracted by activity and have trouble focusing on their meal. Make sure your dog's food and water dishes are in a quiet spot where he can eat in peace.

, Try a different brand, or switch from dry food to wet food. Make the change gradually over a week: mix 1/4 new to 3/4 old for a few days, then half and half for a few days and so on. This will be much easier on his digestion.


Changing a dog's brand of food suddenly can cause obnoxious gas and diarrhea.

, Make sure all food products are fresh and stored in a closed container to keep moisture and pests out. Check the expiration date on foods when you purchase them and check often when they are stored.

Talk to the vet if nothing works.",How to Increase Appetite in Dogs3," If your dog usually eats well and decides to stop, it is imperative that you seek vet attention. Problem teeth, sores in the mouth, or more serious health issues can affect your dog's appetite.


Your veterinarian can also weigh your dog and give you a goal weight to aim for.

, If the dog is acting tired, lethargic, in pain, or if he has an distended belly, dull coat, or rumbling noises from his stomach, take him to a vet. Seeing worms in the dog's stool is an obvious sign of parasites, which require vet attention.

, Torsion is when a dog's stomach twists into a knot. This is very serious and can lead to the death of your dog within hours. If you suspect torsion, roll your dog on his side and gently palpate (push) his abdomen in several places. Any unnecessary agitation on the dog's part may indicate torsion and should be checked with a vet immediately.


Do not play rough, go for a run, or do strenuous activity for at least an hour after eating. Doing so can lead to torsion.

, Another reason a dog may be refusing to eat (or not even acknowledging the fact you have provided food) is if they have had a recent vaccination. Although these injections save many pets every year, they may also have an adverse effect. This is usually minor, lasting for about 2-3 days at the absolute most. If it lasts longer, contact a vet right away as it may be a serious illness.

, Pull the dog's lip up gently to check his teeth, if any are missing, or if they look very brown, stink, or have visible buildup, he is probably in too much pain to eat well. Take him to a vet if any teeth are loose, badly chipped, missing, or falling out.


The vet can teach you how to clean your dog's teeth regularly.

, Your veterinarian may prescribe a special diet to address your dog's health issues. Your dog may not enjoy the diet, but it's important to make sure it eats enough to meet its nutritional needs.

, If the dog refuses to eat its special diet, or its health declines further, visit the vet right away. Your dog may need further medication or a liquid diet.

Watch the puppies interact with their littermates.,
Interact with the puppy away from the littermates.,
Take your time choosing a puppy.",How to Choose a Puppy to Keep from Your Litter2," Puppies are all inquisitive and like to chew or crawl on you. But each puppy has a different personality, which can be easily figured out by watching the puppies interact with each other.You can tell by watching the interaction which puppies are strong, bossy, or noisy, which are quiet or gentle, and which seem like they get picked on.

, After watching the puppies with their littermates, separate them. The puppy may change their behavior when not around others. You can get a better sense of what they will be like as your pet if you separate them.Play with the puppy, call it to you, hold it, and interact in ways you believe you would interact with it at your home. This can give you a sense of what the puppy will be like when you get it home.
For example, quiet, gentle dogs may be more energetic when not around others, and energetic puppies may calm down when not influenced by the other puppies.

, Since you are choosing a puppy from your own litter, you can take the time to really watch the puppies and interact with them. Play with them. Study how they react to you and your family. Watching the puppies for a few days to a few weeks can help you determine which dog is right for you.Get down on the floor and call the puppies to you. Do this multiple days to see how they react each time you interact with them.
Encourage your family to interact with the puppies to get a sense of how they will fit into your home.
You should spend at least 30 minutes a day with each puppy once they are three weeks old. This can be broken up into short handling sessions throughout the day. This will help you get to know each puppy."

Determine if you want a male or female.,
Wait until the puppy is at least six weeks old.,
Choose a puppy that is healthy.",How to Choose a Puppy to Keep from Your Litter3," This decision is important for many people. Females are generally smaller in size than males, and they tend to be less dominant and don't roam away from their home as often. By getting your puppy spayed or neutered, you won’t have to worry about pregnancy or reproductive diseases. This decision will be personal and up to you.Some people may choose the sex of their dog based on other dogs they have. For example, you may want a female dog because you have a male dog and don't want another. Others prefer female dogs who don’t mark their territory.

, Puppies need to be at least eight weeks old before they leave the litter. While you should be searching for potential homes once the puppies are born, you shouldn’t try to sell or give away puppies in your litter until they are at least eight weeks old. While you may have become attached to all the puppies, you shouldn’t choose one for yourself until around six to eight weeks of age.By this age, the puppies begin to look like they will when they become an adult. This is the age they start to show their individual characteristics and their temperaments.

, It is extremely important to choose a healthy puppy so it will grow into a healthy dog. Even if you’ve done everything you can to keep the puppies healthy, there may be weaker ones in the litter. Evaluate them carefully to make sure your choice is healthy.Make sure your choice has a smooth, healthy coat and that their eyes are clear without discharge. Make sure the ears don’t have an infection.
Every puppy in the litter needs to visit the vet to be evaluated for health issues, dewormed, and vaccinated. It is also highly recommended that you spay and neuter all puppies to prevent unwanted litters.

However, make sure you completely mix the wet and dry food or else the dog will only consume the wet food, leaving the dry food in its bowl. Each week, feed your dog less and less wet food until you are completely feeding him dry dog food. Your dog should get used to this and will soon be eating the dry dog food without any complaint., Odor, taste, temperature or texture can all be manipulated to tempt your reluctant dog to eat. Dogs prefer the taste and odor of meat over grains. Check the ingredient labels on the dog food brand you've been feeding your dog. If meat (not meat by-product) is not the first ingredient listed, try another brand.In addition, keep away from dog foods that list corn as one of main ingredients. A diet with corn listed as a main ingredient is less suited to a canine digestion than a meat-rich diet. It is a sign of cost-cutting by the manufacturer as corn is often used a cheap bulking agent.

, Warming dog food will intensifies its smell and will hopefully entice your dog to eat the food. This works best with canned food. If you are trying to feed dry food, add some warm water to the food to soften it.

, Add a small amount of meat broth (which can be warmed first) or a tablespoon of pureed banana or pumpkin to the food. You can also add cottage cheese or a bit of cooked egg. These are all foods that dogs typically enjoy and their addition to the dog food may incentivize your dog to eat it.None of these additions should be more than 10% of the total daily food allowance.

, In fact, try to discontinue treats altogether and only feed your dog twice a day until he is regularly eating dog food. After your dog has successfully become a normal eater, do not use human food as a treat—only dog treats or dog foods.If you are trying to work out if the dog is ill and this is reason he's not eating, then try him with a favorite food. If he wolfs it down then he's being picky, but if he doesn't eat even that then he may be ill and should see a vet.
Avoid chopping and changing foods as this gives the dog the message that if he doesn't eat he gets offered an alternative.
If you try three brands and both wet and dry food, it may be time to talk to your vet.

, If you suspect that the problem is that you've been trying out a new brand and your dog doesn't seem to be taking to it, try mixing the old and new food together first. Start out by mixing a small amount of the new food in with the old and, over the course of one to two weeks, gradually increase the ratio of the new food and decrease the ratio of the old food until your dog is only consuming the new food., To help encourage your pet to eat, consider making feeding times more fun and exciting for him. For example, try playing with a dog toy that dispenses food. Alternately, make food the reward for when your dog does a trick, such as shaking a paw or rolling over. If done repeatedly, your dog may come to associate that food he previously did not like as a reward and be more inclined to eat it., Try taking your dog for a walk before giving him his food or playing fetch with him for a while in your backyard. As he burns energy and calories and hopefully builds up an appetite through this exercise, your dog might be more willing to eat when his food is put in front of him., Make some adjustments to mealtimes to see if any of these make your dog more willing to eat his food:If you usually feed him alongside your other pets, try feeding him alone. Put his dish in another, separate room. Try the opposite if you tend to feed him alone.
Use a different food dish for his food.
Place the food dish in a different location in the room or at a different height.
Put some of the food beside his dish as well as in it.

, If your dog is healthy otherwise, don’t stress right away if he refuses to eat for several days. Some dogs can be quite stubborn when being forced to eat a dog food diet. While it is not desirable that your dog starves himself, he will not come to any harm if he doesn't eat for a couple of days, though he might lose a little weight. Indeed, dogs that starve themselves for weeks to months do not come to harm, although they will obviously become very thin. After a week or so, you then may want to consult your vet for other strategies.Leave the food out for 15 minutes in the room and leave the room yourself so the dog has no audience to play to. If he doesn't eat it within that time-frame, take it away. Throw uneaten food away, as wet food tends to dry out once it's been opened and so will lose it's appeal. Your dog will eventually choose dog food over no food. You just have to wait him out.
It is only by resisting the urge to switch foods and give your dog what he wants when he doesn't eat that he will learn that you mean business.

, In a few cases, you may decide to cook a home-made special diet for your dog. This can make a perfectly acceptable diet for your dog, provided you work closely with a pet nutritionist to formulate a well-balanced diet.There are some veterinarians who have training in pet diet formulations. Otherwise, veterinary colleges generally have a nutritionist on staff or can direct you to reliable online resources to help you come up with an acceptable diet which is affordable for you and palatable to your dog.

Feed your dog twice a day.,
Wait ten minutes.,
Remove any leftover food.",How to Keep Birds Away from Dog Food1," Dogs stay in the best shape if they eat two meals a day. Feed your dog only as much food as it will eat in ten minutes. That way, it'll all be eaten and leftovers won't remain to entice the birds., Allow your dog ten, supervised minutes for mealtime. In general, birds will not bother your dog while it is eating. If any birds should show up, you can scare them away yourself.

, After ten minutes, pick up the dog's bowl and wait until the next scheduled feeding time. Your dog will adjust his eating patterns to get all the nutrition he needs in two ten-minute feedings.After a period of one to two weeks your dog should be adjusted to this new feeding regimen.
If your dog has not adjusted after two weeks, consult your vet for advice.

Pay attention to your dog’s bathroom habits.,
Watch for changes in your dog's eating habits.,
Notice if your dog’s demeanor changes as they get older.",How to Know if Your Dog Needs a Diet Change1," Maybe you notice your dog appears more tired or worn out than usual. They may not be as excited about going for walks or seem less enthusiastic about playing with you than they usually are. You may also notice your dog spends a lot of time sleeping or lying down. These may all be behavioral signs that your dog may be due for a change in diet.If your dog appears very low energy, they may have a medical issue that needs to be addressed. Lethargy is a symptom of many diseases and conditions, including parvovirus, ticks, and hypothyroidism.Take your dog to the vet for an exam immediately if they are not able to perk up.;
, You should also check your dog for any signs of illness, such as vomiting, nausea, or irritability. These may be signs that your dog is having an allergic reaction to their diet or that they may be suffering from other medical issues.If your dog is vomiting, take them to the vet immediately. They will be able to tell you if your dog's diet is causing the problem or if there is another underlying medical issue, such as a viral infection.
It can be hard to tell if a dog is nauseous or not. If you notice that the dog is drooling excessively or if they start chewing and licking obsessively, they may be feeling queasy., Notice if your dog is urinating too often or not enough. You should also watch your dog for any difficulties defecating or if they have instances of diarrhea. These could all be signs that your dog is not responding well to their food or is experiencing another medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection or a kidney problem.If your dog does go to the bathroom, you may notice that their feces smell foul or very strong. This could be a sign that your dog has a disease such as pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal parasites like giardia. Take your dog to the vet immediately.

, You should also take notice if your dog's interest in or consumption of food have changed. Maybe they do not eat as much of their food as they usually do or you notice your dog is leaving a lot of food left over in their bowl. Perhaps you observe your dog eating less and less of their food over time.


You may also notice that your dog seems disinterested in their food when you take it out and put it in their food bowl.
Both weight loss and gain can be a sign that you need to change your dog's diet. Your dog may not enjoy the taste of their food, leading them to eat less of it, or they may be gaining too much weight from a high-caloric dog food.

, Dogs seven years and older are often more prone to digestive issues as well as other health issues. If you notice your older dog moves much slower than they used to and appears less energetic, you should take them in for a checkup with your vet. Your senior dog may need a change in diet to ensure they can digest their food properly and get the nutrients they need.Many vets will recommend putting senior dogs on a particular diet to ensure they stay healthy.
Your vet may also recommend that you give your senior dog anti-aging nutrients to keep them active and healthy. Some common supplements given to older dogs include essential fatty acids like Omega-3 and Omega-6, glucosamine with chondroitin sulfate, and probiotics."

Hold treats near your dog’s chest.,
Teach your dog to take treats gently.,
Use small, aromatic treats to train your dog.,
Combine varied treats with petting to train your dog.,
Teach your dog command words.,
Socialize your dog using treats.",How to Give Your Dog a Treat1," When you offer your dog a treat, be sure to hold it at the dog’s chest or under its mouth and eye level. Holding a treat too high or waving it above the dog’s head encourages jumping and over excitement . If your dog jumps at a treat outside of its visual range, it’ll have less control over its teeth and might nip your finger.If you toss your dog a treat, toss it gently on the ground in front of your dog instead of in the air to discourage jumping.;
, If you find that your dog impatiently grabs treats from you, you should train it to be patient and gentle. First, hold a treat in front of your dog with a closed fist. If it paws or bites to get the treat, keep your fist closed. Wait for your dog to calm down or softly touch your fist with its nose, then completely open your hand to allow it to eat the treat off your palm.Repeat this sequence to reinforce your dog’s association of calm, gentle touching with a reward.
Try using a garden glove to protect your hand, especially if you have sensitive or thin skin.

, You should break up treats into pea-sized pieces when training your dog, since training sessions will typically involve 10 to 20 repetitions of a command. Use aromatic treats, like bits of hot dog, cooked meat, cheese, or a favorite store bought treat.Go for soft treats that can be eaten quickly when training your dog commands and tricks.

, Switch up the type of treat you use when training your dog in order to keep its interest. When training your dog, you’ll want to avoid just being a treat dispenser. As you offer a treat, pet your dog and give it verbal praise so it learns to value touch and praise as rewards.Your goal should be to eventually substitute food treats for petting and praise completely. Otherwise, your dog will always expect a food treat when you give a command. The treat will then become more of a bribe than a reward.

, To teach your dog a command, first say the command word, like “Sit.” Show your dog the treat, and if necessary, physically guide your dog into the appropriate position. Give your dog the treat as soon as it’s in the correct position to teach it to associate that action with a reward.It’s essential to give the treat within a second or two of the proper action so your dog understands the connection between the action and the reward.
Keep command words short and use words and tones of voice consistently whenever you give commands.
Once you’ve taught it a few basic commands, like sit and come, you can use the same method to teach it other tricks, like shake or high five.

, Use small treats to reward your dog when it’s calm around new people, other animals, and unfamiliar objects or sounds. When someone visits your home, have them give your dog a command, like sit, and reward it with a small treat.Be sure not to use treats to unintentionally reward bad behavior. If your dog barks at someone new, don’t use a treat as a distraction or it’ll interpret the treat as a reward for barking. Ignore the barking and try offering a treat or praise as soon as it becomes calm and quiet.

Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Consider when the picky eating started.,
Be aware that many problems may result from picky eating habits.",How to Get Your Dog to Eat Dry Food1," There are two main reasons a dog may be a picky eater. The first reason is that your dog may be sick. The second reason is that your dog is a picky eater because he has often had the luxury of wet food or human food.To find out the cause of your dog's picky eating, you will need to take him to the veterinarian for a checkup.


If your dog is well, then he may be a picky eater due to conditioning. In this case, you will need to work with your dog to change his habits.;
, Be sure to tell your veterinarian when the picky eating started. A dog that is sick may become a picky eater overnight. You may notice that your dog only nibbles at his food or that he is not eating at all. This may be because he is nauseated or has lost his appetite.


Medical conditions such as heart, kidney or liver disease, digestive problems, tumors, or dental problems can all be a cause of picky eating., Even if your dog is healthy, being picky eater may cause health and behavior problems ranging from mild to severe and even life-threatening. These problems may include:Obesity
Pancreatitis
Nutrient deficiencies
Difficulty treating a chronic disease later in life
Diarrhea
Behavioral problems, such as begging

"
"
Determine if your older dog is suffering from an illness.,
Check for dental disease.,
Consider any recent or sudden changes.",How to Improve the Appetite of an Older Dog1," One of the primary causes of a lack of appetite in older dogs is illness. Dogs in their senior years suffer from a variety of health conditions that can affect their appetite. Kidney disease, cancer, liver problems, and systemic infections can all cause an older dog to lose its appetite., All dogs should have a professional dental exam every year. Dental disease is common in older dogs, and can contribute to a decreased appetite. Gingivitis, broken or loose teeth, and oral tumors can cause extreme pain in dogs. If your older dog is in pain, it might not want to eat., Dogs’ appetites can suffer when they are removed from their day-to-day routines. Your older dog might be eating less if you have recently traveled with your pet, or moved to a new location. The sudden departure of a family member or roommate can also affect your older dog’s appetite."
"
Realize that your dog may be a picky eater by choice.,
Consider whether a medical reason might be at work.,
Understand the impact of picky eating.",How to Get Your Dog to Eat the Dog Food It Does Not Like2," Picky eaters by choice know there is something better out there than dog food, especially dry food, and will hold out for that better alternative, whether that means wet dog food or pieces of bacon from their owner's plate.The type of picky eater is usually created by owners that spoil the dog with tasty table tidbits or reward the dog's picky eating by hand-feeding or offering an even more tasty alternative. These dogs are typically smaller breed dogs who have been pampered with human food by their owners. Their weight is may remain within normal weight range for their size or they may become obese due to overindulgence in delicacies and high-fat foods.

, This would be a dog that was previously eating dog food without a problem who now suddenly nibbles at the food or leaves it in its dish. You may notice your dog losing weight or exhibiting signs of illness, such as lethargy or slowness.If your previously normal eater doesn't return to his normal eating pattern within two days, bring this issue to your vet's attention as it could be related to a more serious underlying medical condition. Dental disease, gastrointestinal upset, tumors, or liver, kidney, and heart disease are all medical conditions which may cause a formerly good eater to become a picky eater.

, Your dog will eventually become nutritionally deficient if he is not eating a well-balanced diet. Dog food is formulated to meet all the nutritional needs of dogs. They are not humans and thus cannot thrive on a human diet. Dogs have different requirements than humans for fat, protein, minerals and vitamins. Here are some of the potential implications of a poor diet:Poor teeth: The dog's teeth will suffer, especially small breed dogs, if he doesn't eat properly. Dry dog food (kibble) helps to “grind” off some of the plaque that eventually collects on the teeth. In addition, a nutritionally imbalanced diet will eventually make the dog deficient in minerals like calcium which helps build strong teeth and bones.

Obesity: Generally, picky eaters will only eat the tastiest human foods which typically contain a lot of fat. Fat is what gives the most flavor to food. Too much fat in the diet equals an expanding waistline, even in dogs. At present, obesity is the biggest nutritional problem facing our pet dogs.

Future health concerns and lower quality of life: Many of the common illnesses facing aging dogs are treated with special foods which help prolong life and increase quality of life. Unfortunately, some of these foods aren’t as flavorful as regular dog food and may be rejected by a picky eater. Failure to eat these foods could limit the treatments available for aging illnesses and hasten a dog's physical decline.

Store food in animal-proof containers.,
Retain original packaging.,
Keep dog food indoors.",How to Keep Birds Away from Dog Food2," In addition to keeping birds from stealing the food in your dog’s dish, you must keep birds from getting into your dog food supply. A great way to do this is to invest in an animal-proof dog food storage container.One option is the Vittles Vault.
Such storage containers are available at pet stores and online.

, The bag that dog food comes in helps protect the food from oxygen and humidity. Rather than dumping the contents of the bag into a pet food storage container, place the entire bag inside. This will further protect your dog’s food from birds and other animals while helping to keep the food fresh., If birds (or other wildlife) getting into your dog’s food is a serious problem for you, you might consider keeping your dog’s food inside your home. It might also be helpful to feed your dog inside, at least for a period of time, to allow the birds to move on."
"
Hang chimes or bells.,
Put up “flashy” décor.,
Play audio recordings.",How to Keep Birds Away from Dog Food3," If you want birds to stay out of your dog’s food, one course of action is to repel them from your yard altogether. A simple and inexpensive way to deter birds is to hang noise-making chimes and bells. Most birds dislike the sounds of these ornaments and stay away., Anything shiny or flashy can also help to keep away birds. This includes Mylar balloons, spheres that flash when they turn in the sun, shiny pinwheels, and/or strips of foil that catch the light. These objects are annoying to birds and help keep them out of your yard (and away from your dog’s food)., If you are a fan of more high-tech gadgets, you can purchase sonic devises that mimic bird distress sounds and/or the sounds of predator birds (like owls). Although these products are a bit more expensive (around $110), they have been shown to be very effective at keeping birds away."

Check your dog’s coat for any dullness or flakiness.,
Notice if your dog’s abdominal area is swollen or enlarged.,
Look for any signs of rash or skin irritation.,
Keep track of your dog's weight.,
Score their body condition.",How to Know if Your Dog Needs a Diet Change2," Look over your dog’s coat and notice if it looks duller than usual. The color of their coat may not be as vibrant or not as bright. You may also notice if your dog’s skin is flaking under their coat and if their coat appears less healthy than usual. These are possible signs that your dog’s food is not providing the nutrients they need to maintain a shiny, healthy coat.You may try brushing your dog’s coat to get a sense of whether it looks duller than usual. You may also feel your dog’s coat to see if it feels brittle or dry.

, You may notice that your dog is developing a rounded middle or an enlarged abdominal area. Look at your dog from behind and see if you notice they are developing a rounder belly. This could be a sign that your dog is overweight due to their diet.If your dog’s abdominal area appears swollen or enlarged, this could also be a symptom of a medical issue such as a torsion, Cushing's disease, or cancer.You should bring your dog to the vet right away, especially if your dog appears to be in pain.

, You should check if your dog has any irritated patches of skin on their coat or any signs of a rash. These could be symptoms of an allergy or an allergic reaction to the food they are eating as part of their diet.Many dogs will develop allergies to certain ingredients in their food over time. Switching their diet or adding a different food source to their diet can help to reduce their allergic reaction.

, You should observe your dog's weight and pay attention to any signs that they are losing weight too fast or becoming too skinny. If you notice your dog appears much skinnier than usual, it may be a sign that your dog is due for a diet change. You can determine your dog's ideal weight by considering their breed, their age, and their gender. Often, your dog is at their ideal weight if their rib bones are visible and easy to feel on their body.You can look up your dog's ideal weight by searching their weight range based on their breed.Your vet can also help you determine if your dog is at a healthy weight.

, Body condition scoring is a scale from one to nine that provides a rough idea of your dog's physical health. A score of four or five is ideal. Under four, your dog may be malnourished. Over five and your dog may be overweight. To judge the dog's body condition, both examine and feel your dog's ribs, vertebra, pelvic bones, and waist.

Under ideal (Score 1-3): the dog's ribs, vertebra, and bones are visible. You may be able to feel their hips protruding. The dog appears starved, and there may be few or no signs of muscle.
Ideal (Score 4-5): you can feel the dog's ribs, but you may not be able to see them clearly. The ribs may even be covered by a thin layer of fat. The dog has an apparent waist.
Over ideal (Score 6 and over): the dog's waist is not visible. There is a layer of fat covering the ribs, and in extreme cases, you may not be able to feel the ribs. You can feel fat covering the dog's spine, thorax, and the base of the tail."

Look for dog treats with nutritional or dental benefits.,
Experiment with treats to find your dog’s favorites.,
Make your own treats.,
Offer aggressive chewers knotted rawhides.,
Consult with your dog’s veterinarian.",How to Give Your Dog a Treat2," When you purchase store bought treats, be sure to go for varieties marked specifically for dogs. Check labels to see if they have any added nutrients or dental benefits.Most dog foods completely meet dietary needs, but you should ask the vet about offering treats with added nutrients if your dog has a dull or brittle coat, dry skin, shifts in weight, or a low energy level.Regularly offering harder chew treats that remove plaque will help prevent tartar buildup and oral disease., Try switching up the types of treat you offer your dog. Observe its reaction to various treats so you can identify its favorites. You can use the highest value treats in locations where there are lots of distracting sights and smells.Try taking notes to record your observations. That way, it'll be easier to remember which treats your dog prefers.

, In addition to store bought treats, you can make easy treats for your dog at home. When you make homemade treats and food, it’s always a good idea to check with your dog’s vet to rule out potential allergies and other complications.Try simmering chicken and water in a slow cooker on low for eight hours. Shred large pieces and stir the pot, then ladle the mixture into cups or an ice cube tray. Freeze overnight to create a hydrating summertime treat.
Combine two parts apple pulp, one part peanut butter, one part brown sugar, and a spoonful of ground flax in a mixing bowl. Knead and add water to form dough, three spoonfuls or so. Portion out treat-sized bits, place them on a cookie sheet, and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes.

, If your dog is a power chewer, you should offer it rawhide or pork hide treats to prevent it from chewing your belongings. Go for knotted varieties over flat rawhides. Knotted rawhides will keep your dog’s attention (and keep from becoming a soggy, disgusting mess!) longer than flat ones., If you have any questions or concerns about offering your dog a treat, talk to your dog’s vet. Your vet can let you know how much your dog weighs and its daily caloric needs. This information will help you better estimate the right amount of calories from treats to offer your dog daily.Ask your vet, ""How many calories does my dog need every day? Does the food I give it provide all of its nutritional needs? Do you suggest any nutritional supplements?""
The vet can also help you rule out any food allergies your dog might have. Say, for example, ""I made my dog a treat at home last night, and chicken was an ingredient. He liked it, but seems to be itchy and have irritated skin. I know dogs can be allergic to chicken, so would you recommend an allergy test?""

"
"
Limit treats to less than 10% of your dog’s diet.,
Try using fresh veggies.,
Avoid offering your dog cooked bones.,
Keep an eye on your dog after you offer a treat.",How to Give Your Dog a Treat3," Giving your dog too many treats a day can lead to weight gain and obesity-related health issues. Check labels so you know how many calories one treat contains, and ask your dog’s vet what its daily caloric intake should be.For example, suppose your 20 pound dog should ingest 700 calories a day and you have treats that are each 100 calories. You should break the treats in smaller pieces and try to offer a daily total that’s about a third less than one full treat.
Table scraps can skyrocket your dog’s treat calories and add lots of unnecessary fat and sugar to its diet, so limit its consumption of scraps from your plate.

, Carrots, broccoli, and green beans can be excellent, healthy treat options. These fresh veggies are low in calories and high in fiber, and most dogs enjoy them as treats.Consider dipping veggies in a bit of peanut butter for a higher value treat.

, Cooked bones, particularly cooked chicken bones, can splinter when your dog chews on them. These small shards present a choking hazard and can damage the throat or intestines.If you want to offer your dog bones, choose marrow bones cut to at least two inches in length to prevent choking. Freezing them beforehand will make them harder. They’ll be more appealing that way and will also clean your dog’s teeth.

, Supervise your dog when you offer it a new treat or a hard chew treat, like bones or rawhides. Look out for small, splintered pieces that might present a choking or digestion hazard.When offering a new kind of food or treat, look for allergic reactions, like itching, rashes, vomiting, or diarrhea. Your dog’s vet can offer an allergy elimination test if it exhibits any of these symptoms.

Understand the importance of feeding your dog a high quality dog food.,
Make sure that meat is the main ingredient in your dog’s food.,
Adjust your dog’s food slowly.,
Mix wet food with human food.",How to Get Your Dog to Eat Dry Food2," Dog food is formulated to meet all the nutritional needs of dogs. Dogs have different requirements than humans for fat and protein and particularly for minerals and vitamins. They cannot thrive for long on human food.Dry dog food helps to remove some of the bacteria and plaque that collects daily on your dog's teeth.
Nutrients in dog food, like calcium, help to build strong teeth and bones.

, The most desirable ingredient in dry dog food is meat. Examine the ingredient labels on a few brands of dry dog food. If meat (not meat by-product) is the first ingredient (or the first two or three) there is a good chance that it will be a better tasting dry food.


Steer clear of any dog food that lists corn as a top ingredient., If you are trying to switch your dog from one brand of food to another, begin by mixing a small amount of the new food in with the old food. Over the a course of one to two weeks feed more and more of the new food and less and less of the old food until it is only eating the new food.

, If your dog is hooked on human foods, then you can start the conversion to dry food by giving your dog wet food that is the same brand as the dry food that you want him to eat. Mix some of the wet food in with the human food that your dog likes to eat. Then, reduce the amount of human food and increase the wet food over the course of a week or two until you aren’t feeding any human food.


After your dog is eating the wet food, then start mixing in dry kibble with the wet food over a two week period gradually feeding less and less wet food until the dog is only eating dry food.

"
"
Provide small amounts of human food to keep your dog happy.,
Cut out treats.,
Place a time limit on feeding times.,
Try hand feeding.",How to Get Your Dog to Eat Dry Food3," If the picky eater is just not able to break the human food habit you can add a small amount of meat broth (can be warmed) or a tablespoon of pureed banana or pumpkin to the dry food. You can also add cottage cheese or a little bit of a hard-boiled egg. Just remember that human food should not be more than 10% of the total daily food fed to your dog., While you are making the switch to dry food, stop feeding your dog treats all together. You should also only feed your dog twice a day until your dog is regularly eating dry dog food. After the dog is regularly eating dry food you can begin giving treats again, but never use human food as treats or the dog may relapse.


It is especially important to be consistent with your dog. Make sure that everyone in your household is aware of the rules and does not break them., Having a regular schedule for your dog’s mealtimes and taking the food away when meal time is over will encourage your dog to eat when the food is offered. It is a good idea to put food out at the same times each day and to leave the food out for your dog for 15 minutes. After this time, pick the food up and discard any leftovers. Then, feed your dog again in 12 hours and follow the same protocol. Do not give your dog anything to eat between mealtimes.If after 2 days your dog still refuses to eat give him a little of the food he is used to eating (about ½ the normal amount). Then, try again. You may also want to doctor up the dry food with a small amount of human food (no more than 10%) to increase the chances that your dog will eat., You can also try hand feeding your dog. Sit with your dog and place a few pieces of kibble in your hand. Then, offer it to your dog to see if he will eat it. If your dog is used to you handing him human food, then he may accept the kibble from your hand as well.

Set a regular feeding schedule.,
Cut back on snacks.,
Don’t feed your dog around other pets.",How to Improve the Appetite of an Older Dog2," You can improve your older dog’s appetite by feeding it at the same time every day. Most senior dogs should eat twice a day, or as recommended by your veterinarian. For example, try feeding your older dog at 8:00 in the morning and again at 5:00 in the evening.


If your dog doesn't consume all its food right away, you can leave it out for the dog to eat as it desires.

, One way to increase your senior dog’s appetite is to reduce snacking. Cut back on the amount of treats you feed your dog. If you feed your dog table scraps, you can also try cutting back on scraps. If reducing the amount of snacks your dog eats doesn’t increase its appetite, try eliminating these treats altogether., Sometimes an older dog will refuse to eat due to an uncomfortable feeding situation, such as the presence of other pets. This is especially true if there is another dog that is aggressive. Try feeding your dog in a space free from other dogs and distractions, such as a comfortable, closed off room.

Try a senior dog food.,
Make your dog’s food more appealing.,
Cook dinner for your dog.",How to Improve the Appetite of an Older Dog3," As your dog ages, it might have more trouble digesting food. Try feeding your dog a food that is specially formulated for seniors. These age-appropriate formulations are generally higher in fiber, which will improve gastrointestinal health. This can help improve your dog’s appetite.Switch to the new food gradually over five days, with a mixture of 20% new food and 80% old food on the first day.
Feed your dog 40% new food and 60% old food on the second day, and 60% new food with 40% old food on the third day.
On the fourth day, feed your dog 80% new food and 20% old food.
By day five, you should be feeding your dog 100% new food.

, One way to get a senior dog to eat more is to add something tasty to your dog’s food. For example, you might try pouring a little chicken broth on top of dry dog food. You can also try adding a small amount of canned dog food to the dry food., Cooking a meal for your dog can entice it to eat. The smell of food cooking in the kitchen can improve a senior dog’s appetite. Try giving your dog a home-cooked meal of chicken breast and rice. You can also feed your senior dog a homemade meal of cooked lamb and barley."

Try taking your dog out for a walk before mealtime. You can also engage in other types of activities with your dog, such as fetch or Frisbee., If you cannot determine why your dog isn’t eating, or if none of the suggestions above are successful, make an appointment with your veterinarian. Senior dogs should have a checkup with the veterinarian every 6 months. Call your veterinarian, explain that your older dog has a decreased appetite, and set up an appointment for a checkup as soon as possible.Ask your vet for suggestions regarding human foods that might be appropriate to help stimulate your dog's appetite.

, If you have exhausted your options, a prescribed appetite stimulant can help improve your older dog’s appetite. Before giving your dog an appetite stimulant, you should rule out all medical causes of your dog’s decreased appetite. These supplements should only be used as a last resort, and with a prescription from your vet."

Bring your dog to the vet.,
Discuss adjusting your dog’s diet.,
Put your dog on a new diet plan.",How to Know if Your Dog Needs a Diet Change3," If you suspect your dog may be in need of a change to their diet, make an appointment with your vet. Bringing your dog into the vet will ensure you determine exactly what is causing your dog’s changes in behavior or physical appearance. Depending on your dog’s condition, your vet will do a physical exam and may run tests on your dog to determine the cause of the issue.


During the appointment, your vet may ask you about your dog’s medical history. They may also ask you about your dog’s changes in behavior and demeanor. You may need to answer questions such as, “When did you notice your dog acting lethargic or ill?” or “How long has your dog’s coat been dull and flaky?”

, Once your vet examines your dog, they may recommend a change in your dog’s diet. Speak to your vet about what your dog’s new diet needs to contain to ensure they remain healthy. Your vet may recommend a specific type of food, such as high quality dry dog food, or specific nutrients in your dog’s new diet.Work with your vet to develop a new diet plan for your dog based on their needs. Your vet should be able to help you select food to add to your dog’s diet and suggest foods you can try removing from their diet to see if it addresses your dog’s health conditions and nutritional requirements.

, Switch your dog over to their new diet plan gradually, as doing it too quickly can lead to digestive issues for your pup. Start with 25% of the new food and 75% of the old food for the first two to three days. Then, move to 50% of the new food and 50% of the old food. Finally, move to 75% new food and 25% old food. Moving over to your dog’s new diet gradually will ensure they do not get upset stomach and can digest their new food properly.Your vet may also recommend adjusting the amount of food you feed your dog and how often you feed your dog on a daily basis. You should follow your vet's instructions to ensure your dog remains healthy.
You should monitor your dog’s physical appearance and general demeanor while they are on their new diet plan. If you notice your dog is not improving, you may need to speak to your vet again about further adjustments to their diet so they remain healthy.

Open the bag carefully.,
Use a bin.,
Take note of expiration.,
Keep food cool and dry.",How to Keep Dog Food Fresh1," Many dog food bags are made to have food stored directly in them. Open the bag carefully along the top seam or dotted line so that you can fold and roll the bag later. If the bag comes with a zipped top, open carefully above the seal to keep it intact for later.Use scissors or a knife to get a clean, consistent opening from the bag.
Once you have poured food from the open bag, fold in the corners in, compressing out all of the air and roll down the top of the bag until you cannot roll any further. Then, seal with a clip.;
, Plastic and metal bins or storage containers can also work to keep dog food fresh. Find a bin with an air-tight lid large enough to store a full bag of your preferred dog food.


Pour the dog food directly from the bag into the bin, and ensure the lid is latched on whenever you are not refilling the bowl.To keep excess bacteria from entering the bin, use a scoop to transfer food from the bin to the bowl, instead of scooping directly with the bowl, itself.
Wash the bin with soap and hot water and dry completely between every bag of food.

, Dog food has a shelf life just like most any other food. Always check the printed expiration date on your dog’s food bag to ensure the food is fresh. Generally speaking, dry food should be consumed within six weeks after opening.Once in the bowl, the food should be left for no longer than about 24 hours. Try to feed your dog roughly what they can eat in a day and no more.

, Dry food is meant to be kept in a dry environment. Keep your food in a cool, dry area to prevent bacteria and mold growth. If your food does get wet, it should be thrown out and replaced.Dog food should be stored at a temperature of around 100°F (38°C). If the ambient temperature in your usual storage area is above this, try moving the food to the refrigerator or freezer.

Use a portion-control or timed feeding method.,
Clean up dog poop immediately.,
Remove any fly breeding areas.,
Fix screens in your windows and doors.",How to Get Rid of Flies Around Your Dog's Water and Food Bowls1," Portion-control feeding means to measure out the exact amount of food your dog should have per meal, and only giving your dog that amount. If you’re feeding based on meals, you should feed your dog twice per day, about 8-12 hours apart. Timed feeding means that you put out your dog’s meal for a certain period of time, and then take the food away once that time is up, even if there’s some left over. Over time your dog will realize it has limited time to eat, and will consume its entire meal during that time.Either method will help ensure there isn’t left over dog food sitting in a bowl that may attract flies.


If you decide to use a method whereby your dog can graze on food throughout the day, you may wish to keep the food and waters bowls quite separate to prevent dry dog food from getting wet. The dampness of the food may attract flies.;
, Flies are attracted to dog poop like they are to dog food. Obviously the dog food has to stay, but there’s no reason why the dog poop has to be left in the yard for any period of time. Clean-up and dispose of dog waste immediately after your dog has done its business and you should start to see the number of flies in the area decrease., Flies breed in moist or semi-liquid areas where they have access to vegetable or animal waste, including garbage, feces, compost piles and more. It only takes a maggot about 2-3 weeks to become a fly, and once hatched, flies tend to stick close to where they were born. Therefore cleaning up any breeding areas, and keeping them clean, will help ensure no new flies are born in the area.For dogs that are primarily outdoors, such as working dogs, another possibly breeding place for flies is the dog itself. Keeping your dog clean and dry, and making sure any open wounds are taken care of immediately, will also help remove possible fly breeding areas., Most flies that you find inside your house got there because they found an opening somewhere - such as a rip in a screen. The best way to keep flies out of the house is to make sure they don’t have a way to get inside. Fixing or replacing screens with holes or rips in them is a great start.When entering and exiting your home, be sure to open and close doors quickly to prevent any flies from getting inside. It is also a good idea not to prop doors open if at all possible, as that would create an open invitation to any flies, and other insects, to go right in.

Check out local pet food banks.,
Ask a regular food bank if they have any dog food on hand.,
Visit your local shelter.,
Contact non-profit groups.,
Call your veterinarian’s office.",How to Get Free Dog Food1," Some major cities have pet food banks to provide free dog food to people who cannot afford it. Some of these organizations are geared towards specific populations. For example, PAWS NY offers free pet food to seniors and people with disabilities who may struggle to provide for their pets.Try calling your local shelter to see if they know of any pet food banks in your area.;
, Some regular food banks also have pet food available.If you are eligible to receive food from a food bank in your area, then try asking if they have any dog food available.


Try saying something like, “I am also having trouble affording food for my dog. Do you have any dog food available?”

, Some shelters have enough food on hand that they can share with pet owners in need. In fact, a shelter may be happy to share with you if it will help you to continue to care for your dog. Otherwise, surrendering your dog may be the alternative.


If you cannot afford your dog’s food, then try calling your local shelter and saying something like, “I am having a hard time affording my dog’s food right now. Do you have any extra dog food that I could have?”

, There are many local and national non-profit groups that provide food and veterinary care for pet owners who cannot afford the costs of these items. Some examples include Pets of the Homeless, Onyx and Breezy, and the Mosby FoundationCheck to see what groups are in your area and ask about the resources that they offer.Keep in mind that most of these organizations require you to complete an application and provide documentation to show that you are experiencing a financial hardship.

, Although your veterinarian may not have food available to give you, they might be able to steer you towards some good local resources for free dog food. Give them a call and ask.


For example, you could call and say something like, “I am having trouble affording my dog’s food. Do you know about any local organizations that can help me?”

Cover the can.,
Freeze the food.,
Keep unopened cans cool.",How to Keep Dog Food Fresh2," If you are left with a partial can of wet dog food, the easiest way to keep it fresh is to cover the can and refrigerate it immediately. Use a purpose-made silicone can cover, available at any pet store, to fit over the open can and place in the fridge immediately after opening.An open can should be used within 2 days after opening. Any food not consumed by that point should be discarded.
Do not use aluminum foil or plastic wrap to cover the can, as this does not provide the same seal as a purpose-made can cover.

, If you do not think your dog can go through an entire can of dog food in two to three days, freeze individual portions. Portion out individual servings in freezer-safe plastic containers, and thaw individual portions in the refrigerator as necessary.Freezing your dog’s wet food is perfectly safe, but it may change the texture somewhat. If your dog is a picky eater, freezing your wet food might not be the right option.

, Unopened cans of dog food should be stored in a cool, dry place in a temperature under 85°F (30°C). Always be sure to take note of the best-by date and try not to used canned food that is over a year old, regardless of date.Try to use the oldest food first to keep food from expiring.
Temperatures above 100°F (38°C) can damage cans. If your normal storage area is above this temperature, relocate the cans to the refrigerator or another cool area.

Hang up a ziplock bag with water.,
Repel flies with lavender oil.,
Repel flies with cloves and lemon.,
Spray lemongrass water.,
Grow herbs and flowers that flies don’t like.,
Lay out cucumber slices.",How to Get Rid of Flies Around Your Dog's Water and Food Bowls2," Any decent-sized ziplock, or medium, clear plastic bag will do. Fill it halfway with water. Tie or zip the bag closed so that most, if not all, the air is removed. Hang the bag near your dog’s food and water bowls..The water in the plastic bag refracts light and, based on the way a fly’s eyes work, this refracted light causes confusion and the fly tends to leave the area.Hang as many of these around the house, and outside, as you’d like. They should stop the flies from hanging around almost immediately.

, Obtain a sponge or a small cloth. Dip the sponge or cloth into undiluted lavender oil - approximately ½-1 cup - and allow the sponge or cloth to soak up the oil. Then place the sponge or cloth into a tin can with a lid and set it aside for a day. After a day has gone by, remove the lid from the can and place the open can near your dog’s food and water bowls, out of their reach. You will need to replenish the lavender oil periodically as it looses its intensity.


Do not allow undiluted lavender oil to come into contact with bare skin.
Alternatively, you can use citronella, eucalyptus, pennyroyal, peppermint or lemongrass oil instead of lavender, but these oils must be diluted with water or alcohol at a ratio of 1:3.

, Cut 2 lemons into halves. Poke 6-12 cloves into each lemon section. Make sure the bud of the clove is facing up, out of the lemon. Place the lemon sections near your dog’s food and water bowls, out of their reach of course.


If you do not have lemons, or would prefer not to use them, you can place the cloves, by themselves, in a cheesecloth or muslin bag and place the bag near the dog’s bowls. This is just as effective, just not as pretty!

, Combine 10-12 drops of lemongrass oil with ¼ cup of hot water into a spray bottle. Shake, then spray the water around areas frequented by flies, such as doors and windows.You can spray around the area where you feed your dog, but don’t spray directly on their bowls, or any surface they might lick.


Lemongrass water can also be used like an instant fly spray, and sprayed directly at a fly when you see one.
If you don’t want to spend the money to buy lemongrass oil, which can be expensive, use plain dish soap instead. It won’t have the same nice smell, but it’s just as effective at repelling the flies.

, Basil, lavender, bay leaves, tansy, mint, rue, wormwood and marigolds are not favourites of flies. Plant these herbs and flowers outside your home, near to where your dog’s food and water bowls are, to help repel flies. You can also plant them in pots to keep indoors near your dog’s bowls., Place cucumber slices (inside or outside) near your dog’s food and water bowls.Since you don’t want to replace the cucumbers several times a day as your dog eats them, place the slices somewhere your dog can’t get to them!

Make your own flypaper strips.,
Trap fruit flies with apple cider vinegar.,
Trap flies with honey or jam.,
Buy and install a bug zapper.",How to Get Rid of Flies Around Your Dog's Water and Food Bowls3," Instead of using store-bought, commercially-made flypaper, make your own using ingredients that aren’t poisonous. Use any type of paper cut into 2” strips of any length. Punch a hole in one end of the strip to put string through for hanging. Combine ½ cup of corn syrup and ¼ cup of sugar to make a sticky mixture. Apply the mixture to both sides of each paper strip. Hang the strips near your dog’s food and water bowls (high enough so the dog cannot grab them). Replace the strips when they have several dead flies on them., Pour apple cider vinegar into a bowl, cup, glass, etc. Place plastic wrap over the top of the bowl, cup, glass, etc., and attach it using an elastic. Make sure the plastic is pulled tight over the opening, like the surface of a drum. Using a toothpick, stab a bunch of holes into the plastic wrap. Place the whole contraption near your dog’s food and water bowls, but not in a location where the dog can get to it. Empty and refill as often as needed.An alternative to apple cider vinegar is wine. Wine can be used in the exact same fashion to attract and kill flies. You can also add dish soap to the wine to help ensure the flies cannot escape. Of course, you’d have to waste wine in order to do this, so your problem would probably have to be rather severe to use this method!

, Cut an individual-sized pop/soda/juice bottle in half, making the bottom half larger than the top half. Fill half the bottom half with water and a put in a couple drops of dish soap. Place the top half of the bottle into the bottom half, inverted (i.e. the opening of the bottle goes towards the water, without the cap on). Spread honey or jam near the mouth of the bottle that’s facing the water. Place the whole contraption near your dog’s food and water bowls - but still out of their reach (as it’ll probably attract dogs as well as flies!)., A bug zapper is designed more for outdoor use than indoor use and requires an electrical outlet. The zapper emits a light that attracts many insects and when they get close enough zaps them with an electrical discharge that kills them.


Note that flies, in general, are not attracted to light and a bug zapper may not be as effective on them as other methods.

Clip coupons out of the newspaper.,
Search for coupons online.,
Contact dog food companies to ask for coupons and samples.,
Watch for sales to maximize coupons.,
Ask local pet stores for samples.",How to Get Free Dog Food2," Dog food manufacturers will provide coupons in the coupon section of your Sunday newspaper. Try picking up a newspaper each week and clip out any dog food coupons that are included.Make sure that you check the expiration date on any coupons that you collect. Some may only be good for a couple of weeks while others may be good for several months.

, Some manufacturers may also make coupons for their products available online. Try searching the brand name of a dog food that you normally feed your dog and the word “coupons.”Keep in mind that some manufacturers may require you to provide an email or other personal information in exchange for a coupon.

, Another option for getting coupons and even some samples of your dog’s favorite food is to write to the company. Visit the company’s website to find out how to contact them and compose an email or letter to the company to request coupons and samples. Try writing something like:


“My dog really loves (name of dog food, be specific about the type and flavor)! However, I am having some trouble affording the cost of his food right now. Would you be willing to send me some coupons and/or samples?”

, The best way to maximize your coupons is to use them in conjunction with a sale.This will ensure that you pay the least amount of money for your dog’s food. Watch the ads for your local grocery and pet food stores to find out when your dog’s food will be on sale.


Sometimes you can even use a manufacturer’s coupon with a store coupon to save even more money. Try to collect as many coupons for your dog’s food as possible to maximize your savings.Watch for fine print. In some situations, you may not be able to use a coupon if the item is already on sale. Try to avoid these kinds of coupons because they will not save you as much., Pet food stores often have samples of pet food on hand to give to customers. These samples might only be enough for one portion, but you will still save a bit of money if you get a sample every time you go to the store.


Try asking for samples at local pet food stores. For example, you can say something like, “I am really interested in this product, but I’d like to see if my dog will eat it first. Do you have any samples available?”

Identify your reasons for needing the food.,
Mention the reason for your need when requesting free dog food.,
Compliment the agency after making a request.,
Look into local pet-based social media groups.",How to Get Free Dog Food3," One good way to increase your chances of getting free dog food is to think about why you need the food. By identifying the reason for your need, you can include this reason in your request and this may help to sway people in your favor. Identify your reason so that you can work it into your requests. For example:


Are you fostering a dog who was abused or homeless?
Have you recently fallen on hard times financially?
Is your pet having medical issues that have increased his overall expenses?

, After you have identified the reason for your need, you will need to figure out the best way to work it into your request. You should not lie or exaggerate the truth. Just be honest about your reason for needing the food when you make your request.


If you are fostering a dog, then you might say something like, “I am currently caring for a dog that was neglected by his previous owners. I am happy to help him, but the cost of food is more than I expected and I am struggling a bit.”
If you are having personal finance problems, then you might say something like, “I recently lost my job and that has made it even harder to afford important necessities like food for myself and my dog.
If your pet is having medical issues, then you might say something like, “Rufus had to have surgery last month and the cost of that has put a strain on my finances. I would really appreciate any help that I can get right now.”

, Putting your request first and then offering some praise to the agency that you are requesting food from may improve your chances.For example, you might say something like:


“I am calling to request a dog food donation for myself and my dog. I am struggling to afford my dog’s food and I thought it would be a good idea to call your organization because of all of the wonderful things that you do for animals in our community.”

, There are many pet-based social media groups that may also be happy to help you with the cost of food for your pet. Try joining one of these groups and posting a request for help. Keep your request short, simple, and straightforward to increase your odds.Make sure that you include:


your dog’s name
a few details about your dog (breed, personality, etc.)
a picture of your dog
a direct request for dog food donations
a brief explanation of the reason for your need

Start the conversation.,
Continue the conversation.,
Let your relative say their point of view.,
Ask your relative to stop feeding the table food.,
Watch your relative’s behavior afterwards.",How to Get a Relative to Stop Feeding Your Dog Table Food," Before talking with your relative, write down what types of food they give your dog. They may forget what food they gave your dog, but it will be important for you to know. Examples of table food to watch out for are:Bits of meat
Leftover bones
Junk food, like fries or potato chips;
, Your relative may think that feeding your dog table food only occasionally won’t do any harm. Even if your dog doesn’t get sick from the occasional morsel of table food, it will encourage the dog to beg for table food.


When you write down what table food your relative gave your dog, record how often they gave it (for example, once a day or at each meal).

, Because table food is richer in flavor than your dog’s regular food, it can upset your dog’s digestive system and cause diarrhea and vomiting.Write down if your dog becomes sick after your relative gives it table food.

, You may be very unhappy with your relative feeding your dog table food; however, you should not talk with your relative when you’re feeling upset. Your emotions could get the best of you and the conversation could turn into an argument.


Talk with your relative when you feel calm and your emotions are under control.
Find a time when you and your relative can talk in private, rather than when other people are around.

, Your relative may not understand that table food can make your dog sick. Also, they may not realize you have a rule against feeding your dog table food. To get your relative to stop feeding your dog table food, you will need to clearly explain why they should stop doing it. Plan out the conversation by thinking about these points:


The importance of keeping your dog healthy
What can happen (or does happen) when your dog eats table food
Your ‘no table food’ rule

, When you feel confident and calm, let your relative know you’d like to speak with them. To start the conversation, explain why you want to talk your relative. Some possible conversation starters are:


""Do you have some time to talk? I'm concerned about my dog eating table food.""
""It looks like my dog loves getting table food from you; however, that food can make him sick. Can we talk one-on-one about this?""
""My vet said that table food isn't good for dogs. Can you and I talk about not feeding my dog table food anymore?""

, Once you have your relative's attention, continue talking about the problem of feeding your dog table food. Discuss what table food can do to your dog's health:


""Although table food tastes really good to my dog, it can upset his stomach and cause him to throw up or have diarrhea. That's such a mess to clean up!""
""Table food can make a dog gain weight and possibly become obese. I don't feed my dog table food because I want him to stay at a healthy weight.""
""Dogs that eat a lot of table food can become so sick that they need to be treated by a vet. I don't want my dog getting that sick.""

, Don't do all of the talking during the conversation. Allow your relative some time to say why they feed your dog table food. They may something like:


""It's really hard to ignore your dog when he's begging at the table. I give him food to keep him quiet.""
""I didn't know table food was so bad for dogs. Thanks for letting me know.""

, After your relative has said what they want to say about the problem, ask them to stop feeding the table food. Here are a few ways to be direct, yet polite, with your request:


""If my dog is begging you for table food, simply ignore him and continue eating. You don't even have to feel guilty about it.""
""Cleaning up after my dog when he gets sick from eating table food is no fun. I'd appreciate if you could stop feeding him table food.""
""My dog will be just fine without eating table food. Please stop feeding from your plate.""

, Ideally, your relative will no longer give your dog table food. The next time you are all at the table, watch their behavior. If they give in to your dog’s begging, you may need to talk with them again.

Purchase a dog collar and leash.,
Buy your dog an ID tag.,
Give your dog some toys.,
Buy your dog a bed.,
Consider crate training.",How to Give Dogs What They Need1," Your dog needs a collar, so you can attach an ID tag that will help identify your dog if it ever gets lost. This is a preventative measure that is necessary for the safety and well-being of your dog. The collar also allows you to easily attach a leash so that you can take your dog on walks.Getting your dog used to a collar early (around 6 weeks or so) will be good training that makes walks and taking your dog places easier later on.
Remember that leashes are necessary any time you take your dog out of the house – for walks, trips to the vet, outings to the dog park, etc. This will help keep your dog safe by minimizing the chance it will be able to run away.;
, You should buy a personalized identification tag with the dog’s name and address on it at a local pet store or veterinarian office. Most pet stores have machines that allow you to insert the information you want engraved on the ID tag and have it personalized as you watch.


On the ID tag, you should include your pet’s name, your phone number, and (optionally) your home address.

, Dogs typically have a lot of energy. They need things to keep themselves occupied so they don’t become restless or destructive towards your furniture or other things in your home. Purchase some toys for your dog that are just for the dog. Let it play with them and keep them in a place where the dog can access the toys when it wants.Your dog needs to stay active and healthy, so buying toys for your pup like boomerangs, frisbees, and tennis balls can help them stay active.
Make sure you find out the dog's favorite types of toys from the previous owner if you acquired your dog at an older age. Some dogs like soft toys (like plush teddy bears) whereas others may like toys that they can chew and work their teeth into (like rubber bones, Kongs, or rawhide bones).

, Your dog will need a dedicated space in your home that it knows is his and that it can feel comfortable in, especially if the dog sleeps in the house at night. Purchase a comfortable dog bed for your pup and put it in the room where you spend the most time. Make sure that the bed is comfortable enough and not too hard for the dog.Just like us, dogs need a bed too, They need a regular place to sleep, so they know where to go when they want to sleep.
You can even purchase several dog beds – like one for the living room for during the day and one for your bedroom for the dog to sleep in at night.
Be certain that you are buying the right size. If it is too small, the dog may sleep somewhere else and it may develop a habit of sleeping there. If that happens, then it can be hard to get the dog to sleep where you want it to afterwards.

, If you plan on leaving your dog home alone for longer periods of time – like when you go to work or school – you may want to consider crate training your dog. Purchase a crate for your dog that is big enough for it to stand up and turn around in.Dogs can get bored or anxious when they are home alone and often expend this extra energy by chewing on your furniture or other things in your house.
This destructive behavior can be frustrating, but dogs usually grow out of it after the first couple of years, especially if you begin crate training them.
Be sure not to leave your dog in the crate unattended for more than a few hours at a time.

Make small batches.,
Refrigerate the food.,
Use air-tight containers.",How to Keep Dog Food Fresh3," If you make your own food for your dog, make it in small batches or portions. This prevents older food from becoming stale or rotten.If you have the ability, make your dog’s food fresh daily. Otherwise, prepare food for no more than three days at a time.

, Whether you use raw or cooked food, if you make your dog’s meals ahead of time, refrigerate the food to keep it fresh. If you make more than three day’s worth of food at a time, freeze excess food as individual servings.For ease in serving, refrigerate individual portions of food at a time.
Always freeze individual portions, as constant thawing and refreezing could damage fresh food.

, Whether you are storing in the fridge or the freezer, try to use air-tight, freezer-safe containers for all servings of homemade dog food. This offers greater protection than plastic bags for your dog’s food.Find freezer-safe, air-tight storage containers at your local grocery store, storage and organization store, or from an online merchant.
Always wash a container with soap and hot water between uses.

Consult a veterinary nutritionist first.,
Cook easy meals for your dog.,
Prepare and freeze meals.,
Use appropriate quantities of necessary nutrients.,
Add oils, herbs, and supplements.,
Vary your dog’s meals.,
Consider having fasting days.",How to Feed Your Dog Naturally1," Before you dive into cooking for your dog, it is essential that you talk with your dog's veterinarian and ask for a referral to a veterinary nutritionist for advice. A veterinary nutritionist can help you to understand your dog's nutritional needs and develop a healthy diet for your dog.

Do not begin cooking for your dog without consulting a veterinary nutritionist first! This may be detrimental to your dog's health. For example, dogs can easily develop weak bones and teeth if they do not get the proper ratio of calcium phosphate in their food.;
, This may sound time consuming or difficult, but there are a number of quick, easy recipes you can use to ensure your dog gets all the nutrients it needs from safe, natural sources. Remember to talk to a veterinary nutritionist before you start preparing your dog's meals. It is important to ensure that you are preparing meals that include the proper ratios of nutrients.


A quick, easy option that you can discuss with a veterinary nutritionist is a beef stew. You’ll need a pound of stew meat, a sweet potato, and half a cup each of diced carrots, diced green beans, flour, and water or vegetable oil. Cook the stew meat and sweet potato in advance. Then, combine the cooked items with the uncooked in a pot. Simmer on medium low heat until carrots are soft. Makes about four servings of one cup each.
Beef and rice is a recipe that provides a larger quantity of food at a lower cost. You’ll need two and half pounds of ground beef, one and half cups of brown rice, one fifteen ounce can of drained and rinsed kidney beans, one and half cup of chopped seasonal squash, one and a half cups of chopped carrots, and half a cup of frozen peas. Stir all ingredients together with about four cups of water. Cook in a crockpot on low heat for about five hours or high heat for two. Provides eleven one cup servings.
You can also make snacks for your dog. Chicken jerky is a great option. Slice boneless, skinless chicken breasts into strips that are an eighth of an inch thick. Then, bake for two hours at 200 degrees.
Always cool food to room temperature or lower before serving it to your dog., Save even more time on meal prep by cooking several weeks or even months’ worth of food at one time. Then, portion the meals out and store them in the refrigerator or freezer. Date everything you make, and only thaw a week’s worth of food at a time. A good rule of thumb is to store enough meals for one month in the freezer and enough for a week in the refrigerator., Not every meal you eat has exactly the right proportion of nutrients, but over time, we consume what we need from a variety of sources or supplements. Your dog’s nutritional needs are the same. They may not get every nutrient they need from every single meal, but you can help them meet all of their nutritional needs over time, if you understand what nutrients they need in what quantities.


Quality protein should make up at least 18% of an adult dog’s diet.
Fats should comprise at least 5% of the dog’s diet.
Additionally, linoleic acid, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and vitamins should make up at least an additional 5% of the dog’s nutrition.
The remaining 70 to 75% of the dog’s nutrition should include water, healthy sources of fiber, minerals, and carbohydrates., If you take a multivitamin every day, fish oil supplements, or glucosamine for your joints, you know how effective and beneficial nutritional supplements can be for maintain optimal health. Your dog can also benefit from the addition of nutritional supplements to their daily meals. You may want to include and rotate a variety of oils, herbs, and supplements, to help balance your pup’s diet. Typically, you’ll only want to add a very small amount of these supplements, and while the initial investment can be substantial, the supplements will usually last for many months.


Oils provide healthy omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids that help immune function and digestion. You may want to include fish oil, cod liver oil specifically, or plant oils.
Calcium is especially important as dogs are growing, but a good rule of thumb is to include about 1000 mg of calcium per pound of food. This can be added with a supplement or by grinding non-treated egg shells.
Your dog also needs vitamins A, D, and E as well as appropriate amounts of Iodine and phosphorous. Look into the vitamin content of your oils, and supplement these vitamins and minerals as necessary. Most vitamins need to be included in very minimal amounts, so read supplement instructions carefully and talk to your veterinarian for additional guidance., You wouldn’t want to eat the same thing every day, and your dog appreciates variety in their foods too. Feel free to switch it up. Adding in different types of meat is an easy way to do this. Substitute ground turkey for ground beef, and feed your pet fish once or twice a week., In the wild, dogs eat mainly meat, and they have to hunt for their foods. This means they go through periods of satiation and periods of fasting. This is healthy. Enzymes in the stomach are a necessary part of digestion. However, they are also what fuels your pet’s immune system, so allowing a break from constant food digestion may actually be beneficial to your pet. Only fast one day a week or every other week, and make sure your dog has plenty of water on these days.


You can give your pup a few low calorie treats throughout the fasting day.
Do not fast puppies, pregnant or lactating mothers, or older dogs as this lack of nutrients can be harmful in these developmental stages."

Take a trip to the vet.,
Examine your dog's mouth.,
Switch foods gradually.,
Feed your dog two small meals a day.",How to Feed Picky Chihuahuas1," If your Chihuahua is a normal, regular eater and stops eating within a short period of time, i.e., a week, this can indicate a problem. Inappetence is a symptom of many dog illnesses. If this is your dog, then you need to take it to the vet immediately, especially if it is coupled with weight loss, and/or vomiting and diarrhea.Hormonal changes, such as females in heat, could also be a reason for why your dog is eating less. For example, cramping and mood swings can cause a decrease in appetite. However, eating less during a few weeks twice per year is not something to be concerned about.;
, Teeth, gum, and mouth problems can also decrease your dog’s appetite. Check your dog’s mouth for bad teeth, foreign objects, sores, or growths. If this applies to your dog, take it to the vet immediately.Pawing at the mouth, as well as refusing to eat are signs that your dog might have a toothache or an infection in its mouth.

, Have you switched dog food brands recently? If so, this could be the cause of your dog’s picky eating habits. It is certainly ok to switch your dog’s food, but you must do so gradually. If not, it can cause digestive issues, which can cause your dog to eat less or skip meals. Gradually switch your dog’s food by:Mixing ¾ of the old food with ¼ of the new food the first week.
Mixing ½ of the old food with ½ of the new food the second week.
Mixing ¼ of the old food with ¾ of the new food the third week.
Mixing 1/8 of the old food with 7/8 of the new food the fourth week.
Feeding it 100% new food the fifth week and on.

, Because Chihuahuas are small dogs, feed your adult Chihuahua two small meals spaced apart, i.e., one in the morning and one in the evening. A healthy, adult Chihuahua typically needs 35 to 40 calories per pound of body weight.For example, if your Chihuahua weighs 15 pounds, it will need to consume 525 to 600 calories per day. If a cup of dry dog food contains 200 calories, then you will need to feed it 1.25 to 1.5 cups of dog food twice a day.

Make meat the primary ingredient.,
Add vegetables and starch.,
Create a stew.,
Make a raw food mixture.,
Include only small pieces of food.",How to Feed Chihuahua Dogs1," Making your Chihuahua’s food yourself is the best way to ensure they are getting food that is free of chemical preservatives, fillers, coloring, and animal by-products. Meat should be the most prominent ingredient in your Chihuahua’s food. As a general rule, your dog’s diet should be 40 percent meat, 30 percent vegetables, and 30 percent starch.


The best meats to include are lean ones like chicken and hamburger, as well as fish.
You can also include organs like liver, kidney, and brain.;
, Round out your Chihuahua’s meals with vegetables and starches. Each should comprise approximately 30 percent of your dog’s diet.


Vegetables can include spinach, carrots, broccoli, and zucchini.
Fruits like blueberries, raspberries, and apples (without the core) provide vitamins and anti-oxidants.
Also incorporate carbohydrates like rice (brown or white) and pasta.
Stay away from corn, onions, raisins, grapes, avocado, macadamia nuts, and coffee as these can all be very detrimental to your Chihuahua’s health., One of the most popular methods for cooking your Chihuahua’s food is to make it into a stew. This is a simple way to create a meal that is nutritious and easy for your dog to digest. While specific recipes may vary, you will generally boil the meats for this stew. Next, add rice to the boiling water for it to cook. Finally, stir in your vegetables at the end.If you don’t want to cook for your Chihuahua every day, you can make a surplus of their food and refrigerate or freeze it until you need it., Some nutrients in food are lost during preparation, so many people like making a raw food mixture for their Chihuahua as well. Dogs’ bodies are equipped to process raw foods so this is also a safe, healthy option for your pet. You will want to keep in mind the same ratio of proteins, vegetables, and starches mentioned above.


Ensure the ingredients you are using are fresh and clean.
You can also make larger quantities of your raw food mixture and freeze some for later meals.
There are some risks with serving your dog raw food, like salmonella, so check with your veterinarian before you include raw foods in your Chihuahua’s diet., Keep in mind that your Chihuahua is small, and therefore, can only digest small pieces of food. Ensure any meats you serve them are minced or very finely chopped. Also be sure to finely chop or grate any vegetables you add. You can also puree your dog’s food.


Chihuahuas can be finicky eaters so there may be a lot of trial and error when making homemade food for your dog. Try different methods and stick with whichever method your dog enjoys most."

Provide supplemental feeding.",How to Feed Newborn Puppies," To feed a newborn puppy, you’ll need a bottle and some commercial canine milk replacer. You should be able to find both items at any pet store in your area, though your veterinarian will also be able to provide you with some (not for free, of course) if you have any difficulty finding them on your own.Do not feed your puppy cow’s milk from the grocery store as this could cause diarrhea and/or sinus problems.
It is also dangerous to feed a newborn puppy anything refrigerated or chilled because puppies have a hard time regulating their body temperature. Because of this, they need to be fed room temperature milk.
Some high quality brands of canine milk replacer include Pet-Lac, Farnam, GNC Pets Ultra Mega Premium Milk Replacer, and All Star.
Use a bottle designed for premature babies. These work for most newborn puppies.
You can also use a small syringe (3ml) for small newborn puppies who seem to be struggling with the bottle.;
, If you are using canine milk replacer formula, you’ll need to combine one part powdered milk replacer with two parts warm water. Stir the mixture together (or shake it up in the bottle) until the milk replacer is completely dissolved.Be careful not to mix more formula than your puppy can consume in a 24 hour period.
Refrigerate any leftover formula for the next feeding. But remember to heat it up a bit before the next feeding. Don’t give your puppy cold formula.

, Make sure your puppy is lying flat on its stomach when you feed it. Insert the nipple of the bottle gently into the puppy’s mouth. If they don’t want to take the nipple at first, try applying a bit of pressure to the side of its mouth and releasing a drop or two of milk for them to taste.Never feed a puppy when it is upright or upside down on its back like you might with a human baby.

, Your puppy has a small belly, so it will need to eat small amounts at regular, frequent intervals. For newborn puppies, you should try to feed them once every 2-3 hours.How much a puppy should eat obviously depends on the weight, size, and breed of your dog. But a good rule of thumb is that your puppy should eat about 25-35 milliliters of formula for every 3.5 ounces of body weight each day.
Divide that number by the number of feedings per day and that will give you the correct amount of formula to provide at each feeding.

, Most puppies need to continue nursing from their mothers or being bottle-fed canine milk replacer for the first four weeks of their lives. After that, you can start transitioning them to dry food. The transition period should take 3-4 weeks.By the time your puppy is 7-8 weeks old it should be able to eat a diet comprised completely of solid, dry puppy food.

, Make a mixture of dry food with water added. You can grind up some of the kibbles if your puppy is still relatively small. But otherwise the water should soften the dry food enough for your puppy to eat it.For the first week or so of the transition process, feel free to supplement bottle feedings. Try giving the puppy a bottle for every other meal, with very soggy, soft dry food during the other feedings. After the week is up, stop giving the puppy the bottle at all and just give it the dry food mixture.
Once a puppy is 4-6 weeks old, they should be able to eat just four times each day.

, Put the mixture in a shallow dish like a baking pan and bring to your puppy. Put your puppy’s chin in the food so that it can smell it. It will automatically lick its chin if you stick it in the food dish. This will encourage it to eat the mixture.You will also need to start introducing your puppy to a water dish so that it learns to drink the water at an early age. Do the same thing with the water bowl – put it in a shallow dish and gently stick your puppy’s chin in it.

, The transition process should take approximately 3-4 weeks. Over the course of this time period, start adding less and less water to the food mixture. This will allow your puppy to gradually get used to eating more solid foods.You can try mixing in a little wet puppy food as well so that your puppy can become accustomed to this type of food too.

, Most dogs have strong maternal instincts that kick in immediately after birth. This means that the mother will usually want to stay with her pups to watch them, keep them warm, and help them nurse whenever they are hungry. This is usually enough care for most puppies.You may even have some difficulty encouraging the mother to leave her puppies briefly to go to the bathroom outside. However, it is still important that she do so.

, Sometimes mother dogs aren’t able to provide enough milk for their litter. Maybe she has an exceptionally large litter and her body just can’t keep up with the necessary milk production. Or maybe her maternal instincts aren’t kicking in and she isn’t very interested in her pups. Either way, you’ll need to make sure the puppies are getting enough to eat so that they can continue to grow and develop. A major sign that your puppy isn’t getting enough to eat while nursing is the size of its belly – if your puppy’s stomach is not fat and full of milk, you may need to supplement with some bottle feeding.Another sign that your puppy may need supplemental feeding is if it crying and restless all the time. Newborn puppies should generally be content and quiet. If they are making a lot of noise, it’s a good sign they aren’t getting enough to eat.

, If you think your puppy is not getting enough milk from its mother, you may need to supplement its nursing with some canine milk replacer formula several times per day. Combine one part powder with two parts warm water to make the formula and feed it to the puppy in a bottle designed for premature human babies.Be sure to feed the puppy formula that is room temperature. Cold formula can be dangerous for a puppy’s body temperature.

Choose a dog food.,
Feed your dog on a regular schedule.,
Provide a constant supply of clean water.,
Provide healthy treats.",How to Give Dogs What They Need2," There are many varieties and types of dog food to choose from. You should spend some time deciding which kind is right for you and your dog. Look for a dog food that has quality ingredients listed as the first several ingredients – like real meat products rather than cornmeal, grains, or other carby fillers.Typically it’s not necessary to purchase the most expensive brands of dog food, as they usually cater to fad diets and have little to no scientific backing for the health benefits to justify the additional cost.

, Most dogs need to be fed several times each day. How much you feed your dog depends on the dog’s age, size, weight, breed, and overall health. You should consult with your veterinarian about how much is the right amount to feed your particular dog, but you can begin by consulting the package the food comes in for a chart on approximately how much to feed your dog. Typically, an average sized dog should be fed around one cup of food twice per day.You should give your pup smaller portions of food two or three times per day instead of one big meal. A larger meal will make them too full and then leave them hungry later.
Dogs also typically can’t self-regulate their food, meaning that you can’t just refill their bowl as it empties and expect them to eat only as much as they need throughout the day. Instead, you need to actually measure out the correct amount at each individual feeding.

, One of the most vital things your dog needs access to is clean, potable water. Just like humans, dogs need to drink clean water every day in order to survive. Make sure your dog has a bowl of water in the same place every day so that it can always locate the water when it is thirsty.


You may want to consider a backup source of water in cases where you’ll be gone for several hours in case your dog accidentally knocks over one of the bowls.

, In addition to the food that you choose, you’ll need to give your dog some treats on occasion, especially during training sessions or as a reward for good behavior. Try to choose treats that indicate some health benefits on the package, rather than just some fatty, gravy covered mess.Many treats are specially formulated to also act as teeth cleaning agents. So try to find dog bones or hard biscuit treats that mention canine dental benefits as well.
Try to avoid giving your dog human food too often unless it is something simple like rice or grilled chicken (which can actually be good for an upset doggy tummy).

Determine when to begin a senior diet.,
Look for fewer calories for overweight dogs.,
Encourage reluctant dogs.,
Keep change to a minimum.",How to Feed Your Senior Dog a Healthy Diet1," Consider your dog as an individual when deciding if it might be time to switch to a senior diet. Different dogs may benefit from senior diets at different ages. Additionally, there is no formal definition for what constitutes a senior diet, so these diets will vary by manufacturer. Generally, a senior diet will have altered protein content, lower phosphorus, and reduced caloric content.If you think your dog might benefit from a senior diet, talk to your vet.;
, Like humans, most dogs burn fewer calories as they get older. That means that they need to eat fewer calories overall, or they will gain weight. You can compensate by feeding your dog less adult dog food. Senior dog foods can help because they can keep your dog feeling fuller while maintaining a lower-calorie diet., While many older dogs gain weight as they age, some become more reluctant to eat. If that's the case with your dog, you may need to make some small changes to encourage your dog to eat.It's always best to have your dog checked out by a vet if it becomes reluctant to eat, particularly if the loss of appetite comes on suddenly.
You may need to buy smaller kibble to make it easier to chew or add a bit of warm water to make it softer.
If your dog has lost interest, you can try adding a bit of wet dog food to their diet to help encourage eating.

, Older dogs don't take to change as well as younger dogs. When introducing a big change, try to do it gradually. If you make drastic changes in a dog's routine, you may find your dog is not as interested in eating."

Check the label for recognizable ingredients.,
Learn to read the nutrition label.,
Avoid certain preservatives and fillers.,
Count the calories.,
Talk to your vet or pet food supplier.,
Include additives with store bought foods.",How to Feed Your Dog Naturally2," You want to find natural foods for your pet that are created from real meat, vegetables, grains, vitamins, and minerals rather than just a variety of preservatives and chemicals. If you can read the ingredient list without a dictionary, chances are the food is healthy and nutritious.Look for labels that say the food is “fit for human consumption.” If you can’t eat your dog’s food safely, it is much more likely to harm your dog’s digestive system.

, Many advertisements tout meat as the first ingredient, but this doesn’t always mean that your pet will receive high quality protein. In some cases, this may not even mean your dog is receiving more meat. Ingredient lists on nutrition labels are ordered by the weight of each ingredient as it is added to the recipe. Once cooked, this weight can change, so these lists can be misleading. In order to select a pet food with the best quality, natural ingredient, you'll need to understand how to accurately read these ingredient lists.


Check for the percentages of protein, fat, and other nutrients in addition to reading the ingredient list.
Different foods may offer the same amounts of key nutrients, but they can vary dramatically in price. This is generally because the more affordable foods use lower quality protein sources. Purchase the best quality food you can afford., This can include salt, sugar, artificial colors, and added flavoring. These unnatural nutrient sources do not add to your dog’s nutrition in any way, but they are designed to make the food last longer without spoiling, look more appealing, or taste more like foods that your pet enjoys. While some dogs never show signs of digestive or other health concerns caused by consuming these unnatural food additives, others show significant negative response like decreased energy and elevated risk for diseases common among their breed., This is especially important as your dog ages or for younger dogs who are less active. Many prepackaged pet foods, even natural ones, include large amounts of sugar that make the food very high in calories without increasing nutritional value. In order to feed your pup the right number of calories, you’ll have to feed them a less than satisfying amount of food. Ideally, your dog’s food should be between 300 and 350 calories per cup, but most store bought pet foods are between 400 and 500 calories (or more) per cup. Count calories to make sure you’re not overfeeding., Most major, commercial pet foods, canned, dry, or refrigerated, are manufactured months before they reach the store. This means they’re high in preservatives that can decrease the nutritional value. However, many pet stores offer natural foods prepared in smaller batches or by local pet food manufacturers that have a much shorter shelf life because they use fewer preservatives. You can also purchase these more naturally derived foods from online directly from the manufacturer. Talk to your veterinarian or local pet store to get recommendations for natural, preservative free, and locally sourced dog foods.

, If you want to naturally boost the nutrition of any type of dog food, include some nutritional extras with every meal. Canned meats like chicken and salmon can dramatically improve your pup’s protein and vitamin intake when mixed with store bought food. Another great, low fat treat that packs a heavy vitamin punch is canned pumpkin. Add a few scoops to your dog’s meal once or twice a week to boost digestive function and deliver a number of necessary vitamins and minerals."
"
Develop a feeding routine.,
Find out about breed-specific health requirements.,
Learn how age affects your dog’s food needs.,
Keep a list of foods that are unsafe for dog consumption.",How to Feed Your Dog Naturally3," It’s rarely advisable to leave large amounts of food out for your dog to eat throughout the day, but naturally derived foods have the added concern that the meal will rot. Typically, adult dogs need to be given food weighing two to three percent of the ideal weight for their breed split between two feedings a day.If you have an active dog, you may want to feed them more or higher calorie food, and for your “couch potato” pup, less is more., Most dogs need about the same amount of key nutrients. However, certain breeds need higher or lower levels of nutrients than others. For instance, large dogs are prone to joint and muscle issues, so low calorie foods to keep them at a healthy weight are essential. Additionally, foods that include inflammation reducing, joint health supporting supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin may be a good option.


Ask your veterinarian if there are any breed-specific nutritional requirements you should know about.
Find information online about your dog’s breed, and use that to make a more informed dog food purchase or to make a well-rounded meal at home., If your dog has just been weaned, you’ll need to feed them specially formulated puppy foods and feed them much more frequently than adult dogs. For senior dogs, those who are age seven and up, the converse is true. They will need far fewer calories, and may only eat once a day. Pregnant or nursing dogs will need to eat higher calorie foods, and may need to eat more frequently. Typical adult dogs should be fed a low calorie, high protein diet twice a day.


Puppies need to take in food equivalent to two to three percent of their ideal adult weight, and they need to be fed four to six times a day in the first six months.
From six months to a year, continue to feed them the same quantity of food and gradually reduce feeding times to twice a day.
By one year, your puppy should be ready for adult food and feeding guidelines. Continue to offer them the same quantity of food (two to three percent of ideal body weight) over two feedings.
From age and seven and up, reduce the calorie content of your dog’s food and consider adding more supplements that support immune function and joint health include prebiotics and glucosamine., While most foods that are fit for humans to eat can be digested by dogs, there are some that will make your pup sick. These foods include raisins, grapes, onions, garlic, chocolate, macadamia nuts, coffee, and tea. Talk to your veterinarian about other foods that may be harmful, and make sure you exclude these from your pup’s diet."
"
Feed your dog high-quality commercial brands.,
Make homemade meals.,
Ensure food is not expired.",How to Feed Picky Chihuahuas2," Chihuahuas have a low tolerance for food that is high in preservatives, by products, and artificial coloring. Many low-quality, cheap commercial brands contain these elements. Artificial coloring and preservatives can trigger allergies and cause digestive issues.Instead, choose a high-quality commercial brand that is a little more expensive. These brands are less likely to have fillers, such as by products, and preservatives. They are more likely to have ingredients that promote health, such as chicken, fish, eggs, vegetables, and fruits.

, Another option is to make your dog homemade meals. This way, you can control what your dog eats and you can offer your Chihuahua a nutritious diet. When cooking home meals, meat should be the priority at 40%, followed by vegetables and fruit at 30%, and carbohydrates at 30%. Some of the best ingredients to use are:Organs: kidney, liver, and brain organs.
Lean meats: hamburger, white breast chicken, and fish.
Vegetables: potatoes, baby carrots, broccoli, spinach, and zucchini.
Fruits: blueberries, raspberries, and apples (make sure to remove the core).
Carbohydrates: white or brown rice, and pasta.

, Expired food could also be a reason for why your Chihuahua is being a picky eater. Therefore, always be aware of the expiration date of your dog’s food. If the dog food is expired, it is time to buy a new bag of food.Stale food is also unappealing. If your dog is not finishing its meal, decrease the amount of food you put out."
"
Stop feeding your dog human food.,
Limit treats.,
Stick to a feeding schedule.,
Create a quiet place to eat.",How to Feed Picky Chihuahuas3," One of the most common causes of picky eating in dogs is feeding your dog human food, especially from your plate. This means you will need to stop feeding your dog table scraps and restrict your dog’s diet to its proper food.To make your dog’s food more appetizing, pour warm broth over your dog’s dry food before serving. You can also mix in some wet food with the dry food, as well.
Always re-heat any homemade meals before serving them to your dog.

, Indulging your Chihuahua with an excessive amount of treats is also another common reason why dogs become picky eaters. Treats are a lot tastier than regular dog food. Your dog will learn to wait for the treats instead of eating its regular food. Too many treats can also lead to weight issues.Keep a treat jar in your kitchen so you can monitor you many treats are given per week. Give treats only as specific behavioral rewards.

, Stop feeding your dog table scraps and treats, and stick to a daily, scheduled feeding routine instead. Help your dog understand that no options exist. Create a scheduled, feeding routine by:Putting down the proper amount of food at a regular time each day. For example, 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.
Setting out your dog’s food for 30 minutes. If your dog does not eat it, take it away.
Setting out the food again for the next mealtime. Whether it has been eaten or not, take it away after 30 minutes.
Not giving in. Your dog is not starving. If it is hungry, it will eat.

, Make sure your dog’s feeding area is in a quiet, traffic-free area in your house or yard. If your dog’s water and food bowls are in a noisy area, where you and your family members frequently walk, this could be the cause of the picky eating.Place your dog’s bowl in a quiet corner in the kitchen or the laundry room. Also, feed your dog during times that are quiet and calm, like early in the morning or after dinner.

"
Look for at least 25 percent protein.,
Look for named fats.,
Choose dry kibble over wet food.,
Research recommended brands.",How to Feed Chihuahua Dogs2," If making your Chihuahua homemade meals is not a feasible option, you can still find a healthy manufactured food. Protein from meat should be the number one ingredient in your Chihuahua’s diet, so look for one in which ingredients like chicken, lamb, beef, or fish are listed first on the nutrition label. Dog food companies are required to list ingredients in descending order, so this will ensure meat is the main ingredient. Meat meals are also acceptable as the main ingredient as they are a concentrated form of meat.


Stay away from any products that contain “digest” or animal by-products., Your Chihuahua also needs fat in their diet. But they need to be good sources of fat. Look for ingredients like chicken fat, fish oil, and omega-3 fatty acids on commercial dog food labels., If you decide to feed your dog a manufactured food, opt for kibble instead of wet food. Though your Chihuahua may prefer wet food, it can affect your dog’s bowels and cause runny bowel movements.Try drizzling some low-salt broth over your dog’s dry kibble if you’re having trouble getting them to eat their meal.If your dog is already eating wet food, plan to slowly switch them to dry kibble by mixing the wet and dry food. Begin with an 80/20 ratio of wet to dry food, making sure to cover the kibbles completely with the wet food. Add less and less wet food over an eight to ten day period until you end up with only dry kibble., Not all dog foods are created equal. Some brands are more committed to producing high quality dog food than others. Some highly recommended commercial brands for Chihuahuas include Orijen and Whole Earth Farms.Royal Canin and Eukanuba each offer a line of Chihuahua-specific dog foods.
In addition, many brands, including Wellness and Blue Buffalo, offer dog foods formulated especially for small breeds."
"
Feed them the right amount.,
Feed them twice a day.,
Give snacks sparingly.",How to Feed Chihuahua Dogs3," The amount of food, or number of calories, your Chihuahua needs to eat in a day is dependent on its age and activity level. Your dog’s individual metabolism is also a factor, but since it is very difficult to determine, it is best to calculate the amount of food your dog should receive on the first two factors.


Adult Chihuahuas (1 to 7 years old) that are healthy and exercise daily need approximately 35 to 40 calories per pound of body weight daily.
Senior dogs (8 years and older), which likely have some health issues, need roughly 30 calories per pound of body weight a day. , Ideally, you want to feed your Chihuahua dog twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. You can adjust the exact times you feed your dog to create a schedule that works best for you as far as food and bathroom trips. For instance, the timing of their evening meal will affect when you dog needs to use the bathroom the next morning.


You can also choose to feed your Chihuahua only once a day, feeding them one meal at dinner time. However, this breed does best when they are fed twice a day., Generally, adult Chihuahuas should only be given snacks in limited amounts, and occasionally. It is best to use them to reinforce good behavior.


When looking for a manufactured snack, stay away from brightly-colored ones. Rawhides are also known to cause severe digestive problems.For homemade treats, offer baby carrots, blueberries, and raspberries. You can also give them plain white yogurt (regular, not low-fat) or mix some fruit in with the yogurt."
"
Give your dog plenty of exercise.,
Take your dog for yearly vet checkups.,
Get your dog vaccinated.,
Provide proper shelter from weather.,
Remove household dangers.",How to Give Dogs What They Need3," Dogs typically have a lot of energy that they need to expend on a daily basis. So in order to have a happy, healthy life, your dog will need daily exercise. The amount of exercise necessary varies from breed to breed, but most dogs need between 30 minutes to an hour of exercise every day.You could take your dog on walks around the neighborhood, play with your dog in the backyard, or bring your dog to the dog park to run around with some other dogs.
If you don’t have much time for regular daily activity with your pup, you might want to consider taking your dog to a doggie daycare during the day while you’re at work. That way your dog can run around and interact with other dogs while you’re busy at work.

, One of the most important things that your dog needs from you is regular medical attention, including preventative care. This means that you should take your dog to the vet for annual checkups. Even if your dog is not sick, this is still a recommended part of pet ownership.At an annual visit your vet will weigh your dog, listen to its heartbeat, ask you questions about its behavior, and administer vaccinations if you request them.

, Vaccinations are important for dogs, especially if they spend a lot of time outside or around other animals. They can protect your dog against dangerous infections and diseases like rabies, parvovirus, distemper, and hepatitis.Some vaccinations are performed annually, while others are administered once every two to three years.

, If your dog spends much time outside, you need to make sure it has something to protect itself from the elements. Your dog should have a place to go to get out of the rain or to cool off in the shade in the hot summer months.


This is especially important during extreme heat and extreme cold weather.
Build (or purchase) your dog a sturdy doghouse it can use as a retreat when it is outside. Or consider giving your dog access to the space under the deck in your yard, if you have one.

, Dogs have a tendency to get into things they shouldn’t. If you want to keep your dog safe in your home, you need to spend some time getting rid of some of the normal household items you might have around that could harm it. This includes potentially poisonous household plants, chemicals (cleaning supplies, automotive supplies, hair products, etc.), and human foods that can be harmful to dogs.


Some common household plants that are poisonous to dogs include azaleas, wisteria, holly, irises, daffodils, poinsettias, and Easter lilies.Human foods that your dog should not eat include chocolate, coconut, grapes, raisins, nuts, onions, and garlic."
"
Spend quality time with your dog.,
Praise your dog.,
Train your dog properly.,
Use positive rewards instead of negative punishments.,
Watch for signs of unhappiness or illness.",How to Give Dogs What They Need4," Another thing your dog needs from you is quality time. In order to build a lasting bond with your dog, you need to spend some time with it each day when possible. This will help your dog learn to trust you and rely on you for the things it needs in life.Spend time with your dog by playing with it, taking it with you places, and letting it sit next to you when you’re relaxing at home.

, Let your dog know that you love and care for it by praising it when it behaves the way you want it to. Shower your dog with praise so that it loves you instead of developing a sense of fear toward you.Say things like, “Good boy” or “Good girl” to your dog and pet it affectionately.

, Spend some time training your dog so that it learns to behave the way you expect it to. You’ll need to practice some basic commands and focus on rewarding the dog with praise (and occasionally a small treat) whenever they get the behavior right.


The most important thing to remember when training a dog is to always be consistent. If you don’t want your dog to get on the furniture, don’t give in and let it on the couch with you occasionally when you want to cuddle. This will be confusing to your dog.

, Negative reinforcement is using pain or other forms of punishment to get your dog to behave a certain way. But this builds relationships based on fear rather than love and a desire to please. When your dog does what you want it to do, praise it and give it a treat. This reinforces the behavior in a positive way.This is especially important when you are training your dog, teaching your dog new tricks, or trying to house train the dog.

, One of the most important parts of providing your dog with what it needs is being a mindful guardian and pet owner. This means that you should be diligent in monitoring your dog for any signs of discomfort, illness, or anxiety. If your dog starts vomiting, has diarrhea, or seems depressed for more than a couple of days, you should take it to the veterinarian for a checkup.


If there is something that is making your dog anxious, you should try to lessen your dog’s anxiety in any way you can. For example, if your dog has separation anxiety when you leave the house, you can try using desensitization training to make your dog more comfortable.

Make sure your dog is getting enough fiber.,
Make sure the food doesn't reduce protein.,
Watch out for ""meat-by-products."",
Add healthy treats.",How to Feed Your Senior Dog a Healthy Diet2," Older dogs need a bit more fiber than younger dog. Just like humans, older dogs are more likely to become constipated. Look for a dog food that is at least three to five percent fiber.If you still need to feed your dog ""regular"" adult dog food, you can add a sprinkle of wheat bran on top to increase the fiber.

, While senior dog foods should have fewer calories, they should have at least the same amount of protein as ""regular"" adult dog food. The calories should come out of the fat or carbohydrate content, not the protein content.There is no evidence to suggest that reducing protein content is beneficial to older dogs, and reduced protein can contribute to muscle loss. As long as your dog’s kidney function is good, a senior diet with higher protein levels than adult food may be beneficial.

, ""Meat-by-products,"" which include things like bone, hide, and beak, are not harmful in themselves to your dog. However, though they can provide some protein, they are not as easy to break down as proteins like eggs, muscle meat, and organ meat.Because older dogs have a bit harder time digesting foods, you need to make it as easy as possible for them to get the protein from their foods, so try to pick foods that have high-quality proteins., Dogs can eat many fruits and vegetables as an occasional treat. In addition to adding fiber, they are lower in sodium than most dog treats. Try carrots or apple slices, for instance. Never feed your dog raisins, grapes, onions, and garlic because these are toxic to dogs."
"
Check for gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).,
Look for fructooligosaccharides (FOS).,
Pay attention to antioxidants.,
Consider a special diet for specific health problems.",How to Feed Your Senior Dog a Healthy Diet3," This acid is a type of omega-3 fatty acid. It's important for all dogs, but younger dogs produce enough in their livers. Older dogs may not produce enough, which is why you need to make sure it's added to their food.Other fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA, can also be helpful to your dog, particularly if your dog has joint problems. Talk to your vet about adding supplements if your dog's food doesn't provide these nutrients already.

, Like humans, dogs sometimes need a little help growing helpful bacteria in their bodies. FOS is a substance that can help encourage that growth, which is particularly important in older dogs., You've probably heard that antioxidants are an important part of your diet. Unsurprisingly, they're an important part of your dog's diet, too. They reduce free radicals in the body, which helps your dog look and feel younger, plus it can help your dog fight off disease., For example, if your dog has kidney problems, they will likely require a diet with lower phosphorus, protein, and altered sodium. Other issues that may require a special diet include heart disease and diabetes. There are many diets available that are formulated specifically for dogs with health problems. If you think your dog may benefit from one of these diets, talk to your vet.

Provide adequate entertainment.,
Feed the dog a proper diet.,
Allow your dog to exercise.",How to Work With Dominant Dogs1," A bored dog is often a destructive or naughty dog. A bored dog will investigate his environment and provide his own amusement, often by chewing or destroying household items. Destruction due to boredom is not an act of defiance.Stuff a hard rubber toy with a hole in it (such as a Kong) with treats for the dog to work out. You can try embedding several treats in a wad of peanut butter and smearing it inside the toy.
In hot weather, you can even freeze the treats inside the toy to make them harder to get out.;
, Dog foods high in protein (such as those specifically formulated for puppies or very active dogs) provide the dog with increased energy. Ask your vet if it would be appropriate to switch your dog to a high-fiber diet or a regular adult food.

, Ensure that your dog gets plenty of exercise that is appropriate to his breed and size.Most dogs show more appropriate behavior when taken for a brisk walk twice a day.


Dogs that are naturally more energetic or breeds that are accustomed to being working dogs may require more physical activity.
Some activities that will encourage your dog to exercise include playing fetch, hiking, jogging (use caution when attempting to acclimate your dog to long jogs), and swimming.Allowing a dog to fetch a Frisbee or ball in a large (preferably fenced) open area where he can run can give him good exercise for both his body and his brain.
Talk to your vet about how to safely incorporate new exercise into your dog's routine, particularly if the dog has not had much exercise in the past.

Read the instructions that come with the collar.,
Put the batteries in the collar and in the transmitter.,
Attach the collar to your dog's neck.,
Have the collar on your dog for a week before turning it on.Do not use the collar right away.,
Begin using your electronic remote training collar.,
Reinforce commands your dog understands.,
Control bad behavior.",How to Use an Electronic Dog Training Collar1," Do this before you put it on your dog. There are many different kinds of electronic remote training collars available and you need to know how to operate the collar before trying it on your dog.;
, Make sure both function before you put them on your dog. Also make sure that the system is turned off and set to the lowest setting before attaching it to a dog. This will assure that you don't shock the dog on accident.

, Some collars have small prongs that need to touch the skin of the dog, but you don't want them to cause discomfort. Make sure that the collar is tight enough that it won't fall off and that the prongs touch the dog's neck, but don't make it so tight that it is uncomfortable for the dog or restricts its breathing.

, Instead, let your dog get used to it. This way, the dog will associate the collar with good times and fun, instead of punishment.


The goal behind using an electronic collar is to make the dog think that the negative behavior you are trying to stop is causing the shock, not the collar. If you put the collar on the dog and immediately start shocking it, the dog may quickly figure out that the problem is with the collar., Start at the lowest level of stimulation and observe your dog when you activate it. The dog's ear might twitch or it may move its head as if trying to get away from the collar.


If your dog doesn't respond at the lowest stimulation, slowly turn the transmitter to the next level and try again.

, When you train your dog with an electronic collar, begin with commands the dog is familiar with. Say the command, such as sit or stay, and wait for your dog to respond. If your dog is not paying attention, press the button on your transmitter and repeat the command.


Set the transmitter to the lowest level of stimulation your dog reacts to. When you use an electronic collar, you want to train your dog, not hurt him.
Praise your dog as soon as it responds. Reward it with a pat, by saying ""good dog,"" or with a special treat. When you train dogs, you want to reinforce their good behavior with a reward.

, You may use an electronic collar to manage annoying or aggressive behavior. For instance, if your dog digs holes in the backyard whenever you let him outside, be ready to use an electronic collar to train him when you let him out. When the dog begins to dig, or engage in whatever behavior you want to control, activate the transmitter. Do not hold the button down for more than 3 seconds and do not punch it repeatedly. The object is to train your dog, not injure him.


Don't let your dog see you. You don't want your dog to know you are causing the unpleasant sensation around its neck when it starts digging. Rather, you want your dog to associate the sensation with the bad behavior.

"

Do not bully your dog.,
Use clicker training.,
Be vigilant in public situations.,
Train your dog to stop acting aggressive toward other dogs.",How to Work With Dominant Dogs2," Advocates of the more outdated pack theory believe that an owner should assert dominance over a dog using physical force and reprimands to communicate that the owner is the pack leader. However, what the dog really needs is discipline through effective training., Clicker training is a reward-based training method that teaches a dog to associate the “click-clack” of a clicker with getting a reward.The “click-clack” marks the exact moment of the good behavior, so the dog understands exactly what he has done right, and is rewarded with a treat.Begin with basic commands such as “sit,” “stay,” and “here,” then move on to commands like “fetch” and “give.”
Eventually, your dog will become habituated to looking to you for commands and guidance even without the clicker., A dog often shows signs associated with dominance in public situations. This is often because the dog is under greater pressure, is being challenged by other dogs, or feels the need to protect himself or you. Maintaining control of your dog by reminding him of his obedience training can help you avoid unwanted situations.

, If your dog exhibits aggressive or inappropriate behavior when meeting another dog in public, you should neither reward nor punish his behavior. Petting your dog to comfort him rewards the behavior, while punishing him may increase his anxiety or confusion. Instead, you should retrain the habit by using a friend with an amiable dog.Have your friend stand with her dog at the end of your street, and gradually begin to walk towards them.
When your dog sees the other dog in the distance, have him sit and reward him for sitting nicely.
Signal for your friend to bring her dog a bit closer. Reward your dog for continuing to sit nicely. Repeat the signal and allow your friend’s dog to come closer and closer while your dog continues to sit. Work for 5-10 minutes, and then give your dog a rest for the day.
The next day, begin the 5-10 minute session at the distance that the previous day left off. Eventually, your dog should become desensitized to the closeness of other dogs.If your dog reacts to your friend’s dog inappropriately (by leaving the sit command and beginning to bark or growl, for instance), walk him the other direction and resume the training a little further apart.

"
Stop thinking of dogs as “pack animals.” It is more accurate to think of dogs as group- or family- oriented.,
Acknowledge individual personalities.,
Recognize effective training techniques.,
Know when to chastise your dog.",How to Work With Dominant Dogs3," Individual members of a family often fill certain roles; similarly, dogs like to know their position in a group., Like humans, dogs’ personalities can vary widely among individuals. Some dogs are naturally easy-going, happy, and agreeable. These dogs are often labeled “submissive.” Other dogs are higher maintenance and often experiment to see what they can get away with. These dogs are often thought of as “dominant,” but they may be more accurately thought of as badly behaved and in need of training.Dogs who seem dominant are seeing what behavior they can get away with, not challenging the authority of their owner or pack leader.

, Older theories of dog training often advised an owner to punish or physically dominate a dog to teach him his place in the “pack.” More modern theories advocate reward-based training to reinforce good behavior. In most cases, rewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior., Your default position should be one of praising good behavior, not punishing bad behavior. However, if your dog is about to harm himself or another creature and it is happening right now, it may be appropriate to punish the dog.For example, if your dog jumps on your pet cat, you may want to give him a sharp “no!” rebuke accompanied with a loud clap to startle the dog.
Be aware of the limitations of this approach; your dog may learn to only attack the cat when you are not in the room.
Dogs do not understand punishment for behaviors that were performed in the past, even if it has only been a few minutes. Chastisement is only effective in the exact moment of the behavior.

Understand arguments in favor of using electronic collars.,
Understand arguments against using electronic collars.,
Decide if using an electronic collar on your dog is right for you and your dog.",How to Use an Electronic Dog Training Collar2," Advocates for the use of electronic collars state that the collars give a small electrical shock, similar to a shock from static build up, that does not hurt the dog.They also argue that these collars can actually give dogs quite a bit of freedom, as you will have a way to control your dog when it is off leash.There is some debate among those that use electronic collars about what the collars should be used for. Some argue that the collars should only be used on dogs that have severe behavior problems, for instance to change behavior that could get a dog put down. There are others that use the collars for correcting behavior, such as if a dog gets into a garden bed the owner will turn on the collar to teach the dog that this behavior is bad. There are others still that use the collar to signal a dog to do positive behaviors, such as sitting, staying, or lying down., Those opposed to the use of these collars state that there is a great chance of misuse and abuse when using a shock collar.In addition, opponents argue that other training systems, such as simple positive reinforcement of behavior, can be just as effective.While positive reinforcement makes the training about the dog's choice of behavior, positive punishment with a shock collar forces a dog to choose between pain and behavior.

, Make the decision for yourself whether you think an electronic collar will help your dog learn what they shouldn't do. If you do decide to use it, make sure to follow the manufactures instructions and use the collar properly, not as punishment but to reinforce behavior.

Reward at Source.,
Shuffle Boxes.,
Make the puzzle harder.,
Add odor.,
Rinse and Repeat.",How to Train Your Dog in Nosework," It should be an extra special treat, something your dog LOVES.;
, Small cardboard boxes are ideal but any container will work. Place the boxes on the ground. The environment should be free of other dogs or distractions.

, Having a friend here is helpful, they are going to hold your dog on leash. Or if you are alone, you can tie the dog back. Pick up one of the boxes and make a show of putting the treats in there, once the dog shows interest, put the box down among the other boxes.

, Because you made it clear that the hide (treat) is in one of the boxes, your dog should check the containers. As a handler, your biggest job is to stay out of the dogs' way and let them search.

, Once your dog finds the correct box, reward with more food. Feed right next to 'source', where the odor/food is.

, Once your dog has eaten all of their food, you are going to restrain them again, add more treats to the box and shuffle the boxes around (like a shell game). Release your dog to search again.

, After the dog starts to understand the game, add a level of difficulty. You can try stacking the boxes, adding a few boxes, moving to a new location or closing the containers part of the way (making sure the dog can still get to the treats in the box). Be creative!

, Once the dog really starts to understand the game and is hunting independently, you can progress to adding a target odor. This is clove (Syzygium Aromaticum) essential oil on a q-tip, an odor used in the sport of K9 Nose work. But you can use any scent you want your dog to find! Put the odor in the box and tape it down, pair the odor with treats (this is to create a positive association).

, Follow steps 1-8 again with the paired odor.

Walk your puppy regularly.,
Play with your puppy.,
Give your puppy toys to play with.",How to Train or Help a Puppy Stop Crying when Locked up or Outside1," Aim for at least two daily walks with your puppy. They don't need to be long but they should reasonably tire out your pup. Just make sure the puppy is getting enough daily exercise based on its size and energy level.


Be kind to your puppy and be sure to give it exercise on a daily basis.;
, A bored dog will take out its energy in some other (undesirable) form, from whining, to crying, to destruction of property. Try to have two active play times each day, with you playing fetch, keep away, or tug of war, or any other active game your puppy loves to play.


In addition to getting necessary exercise, the puppy will love the attention it gets from you. The younger the dog is the shorter your play and exercise sessions have to be but remember to increase the frequency of play or walk time as the puppy gets older.

, You want your puppy to be able to amuse itself when it is alone in the yard. Supplying plenty of toys will hopefully distract your pup from the fact that it is alone.


Supply a variety of types of toys. Balls, squeaky toys, and treat-dispensing toys are all favorites for puppy playtime. These types of toys can help to distract a puppy from being sad it is alone while stimulating its natural inquisitiveness and desire to chew. "

Consider taking your puppy to training classes.",How to Train Your Puppy," While it is incredibly exciting to bring a new puppy home, it is also very important that you decide the different duties each family member will play in training your puppy, and the rules you will have for you puppy. Discipline is key-and not just for your pup.


For example, if you have decided that your puppy should sleep in a crate until house trained, do not let anyone allow the puppy to sleep in its bed the first few nights.;
, The puppy needs clear rules from the first day it arrives at your home. You’ll want to make the rules easy to follow. For example, if you don't want the puppy upstairs, put up a stair gate. If you don’t want a dog begging for food at the table, never feed a puppy food from your plate. Remember not to scold the puppy too much or his/her trust in you will go down

, It is nearly impossible to train a puppy without some kind of reward involved. Most puppies respond well to food rewards. However, be aware that when training with food rewards, or ""treats,"" you should use small treats, even pieces of regular dog food work!


Feeding large treats each time you give a reward will soon make your dog unhealthy and overweight. Use high value treats for new work, for example turkey is very healthy for dogs, and lower value foods, like a piece of dog food, when doing re-training work.
Some puppies respond better to toys. You can reward a dog that loves fetching by throwing the ball each time he does something correct, or another dog by playing a quick game of tug-of-war. However, toy rewards take up more time, can get the puppy too excited and wound up to train, or may get boring after a while. Toys work especially well for agility training, although agility cannot be trained until 18 months of age because puppy joints and bones can’t handle this type of training.

, Different breeds of dogs are very different, so it would be a good idea to read up on your breed to know what to expect. Each breed needs specific training in order to thrive, so make sure you know what the specific needs of your dog are.

, In combination with any other reward you choose to give your pup, you must also use verbal praise. When your puppy responds correctly, praise it in a high-pitched, kind voice. Puppies respond to a pleased and happy tone.


Clicker training is also very helpful. In this training, you purchase a clicker and each time you say the command you immediately use the clicker.
On the other hand, when your puppy disobeys, you should use a stern voice to reprimand your pup. It is important that puppy learns the difference between your pleased voice and your voice that tells her she did something wrong. Always make up with a dog after you need to scold them.

, Also try to keep the sessions full of new, fun things, like little games you make up yourself. If you see the dog begin to get bored, distracted, or frustrated, end the session and take a break.


If you begin to get frustrated, end the session. However, try to end on a good note, with praise and rewards. This way the puppy will look forward to the next training session.
Try to stay committed to a 10- 15 minute session every day, so the puppy will learn new commands faster.

, Keep in mind that puppies 12 weeks or under do not have full control of their bladder or bowels. Even if they wanted to “hold-it” they simply cannot do that, so do not harshly reprimand them when they eliminate in your house. Most puppies are not fully house trained until they are six months old, and in some cases even older than that.


When house training your pup, it is important to keep a positive attitude even when you encounter an accident.

, Puppies can generally only hold their waste in for the number of months they are old. So if your puppy is four months old, he should not be left without access to the outside for longer than four hours.It is different at night, as puppies shut down the way we do at night. By the time your puppy is four months old, he should be able to go the entire night without needing to go potty.

, As you may be able to guess, a big part of when a puppy goes potty is when it is fed. In order to speed up the house training process, establish a regular feeding schedule and stick with it. Unless advised by a vet, do not “free feed” (leaving a filled food bowl out at all times.)


Free feeding will give your puppy a random elimination cycle (when she pees or poops) and will not establish you as the provider of the food (which is important in teaching your puppy that you are the pack leader and in charge.)Do not feed your puppy anything in between meals.

, Young puppies generally need to potty every 30 to 45 minutes. You should create a consistent schedule for when you take your puppy out. Puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals, naps, and playtime. You should always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, before you and the puppy go to bed at night, and before you leave the puppy alone for any extended period of time.

, Give your puppy a treat and verbally praise it when it pees or poops outside. Try to bring your puppy to the same spot each time to teach her that this is where she is meant to go potty. When you bring her to the spot, say “go potty” and wait for her to go.Bringing the puppy to the same spot will help it associate the smells of the spot with going potty. Smells can often prompt a puppy to eliminate.
Stay with your puppy outside while it is potty training so you can immediately praise it when she goes potty. Keep in mind that some puppies will go potty as soon as your take them outside, while others may need to sniff around or play a bit before they can eliminate.

, Common signs are sniffing, circling, whining, leaving the room and pacing. Take your puppy outside as soon as possible when you see these signs. You must watch your puppy carefully.


If you see your puppy begin to eliminate in an inappropriate spot indoors, clap twice sharply. Your clapping will startle your pup, stopping it in midstream. Quickly run with your puppy outside, either by leading it with its collar, or encouraging it to run beside you.
Once outside, keep the puppy in one place and allow it to eliminate. When it does, verbally praise it and give it a treat. If the puppy doesn’t have anything to eliminate, don’t worry, just make sure to try to be there the next time it does so that you can bring it outside.
Don’t scold the puppy and never rub its nose in an accident. Just clean up the mess and try to get the puppy outside next time.

, This is especially important to do when you are not home. Choose a crate or area that you can block off with a pen or baby gate and ‘puppy proof’ the area. Lay down newspapers and put its bed, toys, water and food bowls in the space. Over the course of a few weeks, you will notice that your puppy begins to pee or poop in one particular spot in the area.You can begin reducing the amount of newspaper you use in the space, so that eventually only the place the puppy has designated as her elimination spot is covered with newspaper. You will then be able to slowly start moving the newspaper to other locations closer and closer to the outside door and the puppy will continue to eliminate on them.
If your puppy eliminates somewhere other than the designated spot, you may have reduced the amount of newspaper too much, or moved the newspaper away from the original spot too quickly. Potty training a puppy takes a long time, just remember to be patient.
Praise your puppy when it eliminates in the designated spot. If your puppy has an accident but you do not catch her in the act, you should not reprimand her. She will not understand why you are reprimanding her for something she did an hour ago. If you do catch her right after she has had an accident, hold her near the accident and firmly say “no.”

, When your puppy has become generally reliable in using its ‘potty area’, you can begin to let the puppy explore more of your house. Its best to open the house up to your puppy one room at a time. Only do this when your puppy can be supervised--any time your puppy cannot be supervised, but her back in her ‘den.’Put your puppy on a leash when it is exploring a new room. It is much more difficult for your puppy to get into trouble when you are attached to the other end of the leash.

, Puppies explore their new world through their mouths. So they will probably bite you during their exploration or when they are playing. Puppies don’t know that their teeth can feel like razors piercing our skin when they gnaw on us, which is why it’s important to train your puppy not to bite at an early age.

, Puppies don’t know how hard their biting can be. When you are playing with your puppy, allow it to mouth on you if it is doing so already. When it bites too hard, yelp or let out a loud ‘ow!’ Doing this will startle your puppy and make it stop biting you. Ignore your puppy for 10 to 20 seconds after it has bitten you, or walk away for 10 to 20 seconds. Then go back and resume playing. When it bites too hard again, say “ow!” again and ignore it for another 20 or so seconds. Doing this teaches your puppy that gentle play continues, while painful play stops.
Once your puppy has stopped biting you very hard, you can begin to teach it to not bite even moderately hard. Repeat the steps listed above when it bites you moderately hard. Continue this process until your puppy only mouths on you gently or doesn’t mouth on you at all.

, If you puppy likes to ambush your feet while you walk, carry a toy in your pocket. When you puppy begins nipping at your foot, freeze, take out the toy and wave it so that it gets his attention. When your puppy has started chewing on the toy, begin walking again. Eventually your puppy will learn that chewing on toys is better than chewing on feet.If you don’t have a toy, freeze when your puppy begins nipping at your feet. When it stops, praise it and go get it a toy.

, When you see your puppy chewing on something like a shoe, furniture, or sock, take the object away from him and scold him verbally. Direct its attention to something it can chew on, such as a favorite toy, and praise it when it begins chewing on that instead. Doing this teaches your puppy what objects to chew on and what not to.


If your puppy continues to chew on things it shouldn’t be, you can use a taste deterrent, like bitter apple, to get it to stop chewing on those objects. You can buy taste deterrents at your local pet store. Bitter apple works well, as the bad taste will cause your puppy to stop chewing on the object immediately.

, Every dog should know the sit command. If you want your dog to be obedient, safe, and able to learn more complicated tricks, you must teach the sit command first.Have a treat ready to go. You should use a treat to teach this command, unless your dog doesn't like food rewards.
Your puppy should be on a leash. The leash will help you to guide your pup’s movements.
Hold the treat in front of your puppy's nose. While gently pulling the leash up, move the treat upwards, keeping it by your puppy's nose.
Your puppy will most likely follow the treat up, automatically landing in a sit. If not, gently push your puppy's rear down. As soon as your dog lands in a sitting position, say ""Sit!"" Then give a treat and praise.
Repeat the steps frequently and be patient. Some dogs take longer to learn than others. Once your puppy begins to recognize the word ""sit,"" say it just before your dog actually sits. With time, patience, and practice, your dog should eventually learn to sit on command.

, Once your puppy learns to sit, it needs to learn to lay down on command. Start with your puppy in the sitting position. Once again, have a treat ready. Your puppy should be on a leash so you can control its movements.Hold the treat where your puppy can see it, in front of its nose. You may want to kneel so you are lower to the ground.
Keeping a little pressure on the leash, so the puppy can't get the treat, move the treat slowly onto the ground. The puppy should lay down to get a little closer to the treat.
If this doesn't work, apply slightly more pressure to the leash. Pull the collar downwards, while moving the treat. Once your puppy is laying down, say ""down"" and give the reward.
Eventually say ""down"" right before the puppy lays down. Continue to practice these steps eventually your puppy will learn how to lay down when he hears the command.

, This is another important safety command. You need to have control over your dog and know that it will come to you when asked.


Keep your puppy on a leash. Tell it to either sit or lay down. Take a few steps away and kneel down. Have a favorite toy with you.
Encourage your puppy by saying its name in an excited voice. Do not apply pressure to the leash. Show the puppy its toy. Pat your knees. Continue to talk in an encouraging voice.
When the puppy begins to come to you, say “Come!” When it gets to you, praise and reward it.
Continue to practice this, gradually doing these steps from further away.
Once your puppy knows the command, try calling it while it’s playing.

, This is one of the most important safety commands. Your puppy must know how to stay in one spot. This is important when taking walks, playing outside, greeting other people and dogs, etc.Keep your puppy on a leash. This time, do not show it the treat, but keep it ready to reward the puppy when the time comes.
Have your puppy sit. Firmly, say ""Stay."" Hold your hand in front of the puppy just above its head. Your hand should be where the puppy can easily see it. Until your puppy has learned the command, do not move your hand. It will help it stay focused and get the message.
Very slowly, while maintaining eye contact with the puppy, take a small step backwards. If the puppy begins to move, say in a sharp, loud voice, ""Ah ah!"" That will get the pup's attention and let it know it has done something wrong. Do not be upset, it does not yet know the command. Instead, firmly but gently put the puppy back in the same place, once again in a sit. The puppy must be in the same place or it will think that it can get away with moving forward even in a stay. Repeat the command and try again.
When the puppy stays, say ""Okay!"" and let it get up and come to you. Praise the puppy and give it a reward.
Continue practicing the command. Once the puppy has learned the command, gradually move farther away from it and have it wait longer until you give the command to break the stay.

, After your puppy has learned the basic commands, and is following your commands consistently and promptly, you can work on “trick” types of training. There are many good books and internet articles around that can help you find out the best tricks for your puppy to learn and the best way to teach these types of commands.


Teach your dog how to roll over. Your friends will be impressed and overwhelmed with how cute your dog is when it rolls over.

Teach your puppy how to high five. Its important to get your kids involved in the training process of your puppy, so why not have them train your puppy to do something both the dog and child will both enjoy?

Teach your dog how to do the doggie dance. Can you think of anything cuter than a puppy doing a little dog dance?

Teach your puppy how to shake hands. Shaking hands is a classic trick that all dogs should learn.

Teach your puppy to play fetch. Puppies have a lot of energy. Why not teach your dog a trick that will burn off some of that puppy energy?

, Join in a puppy training class so your puppy can learn from other puppies, and their owners, and learn in a more distracting environment. Your local veterinarian, extension service, or pet store can help you find a good puppy training class in your area."

Practice letting the puppy be alone.,
Give your dog praise for good behavior.,
Slowly increase the puppy's alone time.,
Consider use of a calming product.",How to Train or Help a Puppy Stop Crying when Locked up or Outside2," Whether inside or outside, you'll need to get your puppy used to the fact that you won't be around all the time. You can practice indoors by leaving your puppy in one room and leaving for a few minutes, then returning. Then begin putting the dog outside for short periods of time, one to five minutes to start. You need to accept that the dog will probably cry and make a fuss while it is outside.


Only leave a dog outside if you have a safe and secured fenced-in area.
You must train the dog that nothing good will happen when they cry. Only let the puppy in when it is quiet and (preferably) lying quietly. If you give in and go out with the dog or allow it to return inside when it is whining, then you are giving positive reinforcement to the unwanted behavior (i.e. the dog ""gets satisfaction"" by your acknowledging the whining).
Leave your puppy with a distraction, like a Kong toy stuffed with wet food, to keep them occupied and to help them associate the yard with positive things.

, This is a big key to training a dog. Once an allotted amount of time is up (remember to start with small time increments) go outside and praise the dog profusely with attention and petting. Maybe even give the pup a treat. The dog will eventually make a connection that if it is quiet and well behaved outside, it will be rewarded for that behavior.

, Continue the training by lengthening the time outside until the dog remains quiet outdoors for at least an hour (as long as the weather is nice). Now the dog should be able to better deal with the separation anxiety when left outside or alone. Hopefully the pup will just quiet down and take a nap instead.


Make sure the puppy always has fresh water available.

, There are calming products available to help puppies with being alone.Pheromones are chemicals released by dogs, which help ease puppies’ anxiety. The dog appeasing pheromone (D.A.P.) have been shown to calm puppies in dog obedience classes.These come in collars, sprays, wipes or diffusers.

Begin crate training your puppy.,
Entice your puppy into the crate.,
Repeat the crate enticement.,
Treat the crate nonchalantly when you put the dog in it.,
Never use the crate or kennel for punishment or the puppy will resent the crate.",How to Train or Help a Puppy Stop Crying when Locked up or Outside3," It is very important to use a crate inside the house or a dog house, igloo, or some warm, comfortable shelter outside where the dog can rest and feel secure. Put the pup’s bed or blankets, as well as its toys, into the shelter so the puppy will recognize the space as its own.


Recognize that it may take some time for this new place to seem like home to your dog. Take some time to gently teach them to go inside it.
Any crate or kennel needs to be big enough for the dog to stand normal without a hunched back and to allow it to turn in a circle without being cramped.

, Start by leaving the door open and putting a few of its favorite treats inside toward the back of the crate or kennel.As as the puppy goes inside to eat the treats, say “kennel” and shut the door gently behind it. After the dog has finished the treats, open the door and give it praise.


When you shut the crate and the puppy is quiet, make sure give them lots of praise. This helps the pup learn that being quiet and not whining is a positive way to get attention.
Put the puppy's food and favorite toys in the crate, making it a fun environment with positive associations.

, Do this a few more time over the course of a couple of days gradually lengthening the amount of time the puppy is in there with the door closed. Never let him out if he starts to whine or cry; otherwise he will think that is what gets him out of the crate. Wait for him to be quiet before you spring him from the crate.

, When you crate or kennel your puppy when you leave the home, never make a big deal out of it. Give the pup the usual crate or kennel command and walk away as normal. This way the dog won’t associate a bunch of fuss with you leaving the house.


Remember to leave them with distraction like a food-stuffed Kong to divert their attention away from being crated.
When you return, don't let the puppy out of the crate right away. Do a few things first, and wait until the puppy is being quiet to let them out. This teaches them to be patient as well as removing the direct link between the crate and you leaving the house.

, Never leave a puppy under two months of age in a crate longer than two hours or under six months of age in a crate or kennel for longer than four hours.They can’t fully control their bladders for more than that time period. As for older dogs, aim to only keep them in their crate for 4 hours. Its cruel to keep them confined for much longer than that time.

Exercise your dog every day.,
Take a deep breath.,
Take your dog different places.,
Encourage the dog to meet a variety of people.,
Introduce your dog to other dogs.,
Pay attention to warning signs.",How to Train Teenager Stage Dogs," If you wait to start training your dog as a teenager, it will already have developed some bad behaviors. What's cute in a puppy isn't cute in a full-grown dog, even in a small breed. Jumping up on people and biting or nipping, for instance, shouldn't be left uncorrected when your dog is still a puppy.However, if you get your dog as a teenager, you can still work on good behaviors. It may just take a bit more work than it did if you started with a puppy.;
, A clicker is a way to reinforce good behavior. In the beginning, you use a clicker with a treat to teach the dog that it's a good sound. Eventually, though, the clicker can become its own reward. Because it is an immediate, consistent sound, it becomes a bridge between the behavior you want and the command you want to use.Basically, a clicker is a little device that makes a clicking noise. You can also use a clicking pen if that's all you have.
You can find clickers at pet stores or online.

, When your teenage dog does something you like, click the clicker, and give it a treat. For instance, if your dog goes to the bathroom in the correct place, give it a click and a treat.The treat doesn't have to be a food treat. Sometimes, praising the dog and petting it can be enough, particularly after you've already reinforced the behavior with food.
Only click once when trying to reinforce behavior. However, you can give more than one treat if you want to emphasis your dog did well., The best command to start with is ""touch"" (or whatever you'd like to call it). Basically, you hold out your hand with two fingers extended. When the dog comes toward it, you reward the dog with a click and treat. Next, reward the dog if it touches your hand with its nose. After your dog gets the idea, you can add the command you picked, by saying it as the dog touches your finger (""Touch!"").Once your dog has that down, move on to holding a stick. When it touches its nose to the stick, repeat the process of clicking, rewarding, and saying the command. Move the stick farther away so your dog has to move more.
You can also put a bit of peanut butter on the stick a few times in a row to get your dog interested.
Always click during the behavior, not afterwards.

, Once your dog has ""touch"" down, you can try other commands, such as ""sit."" Like ""touch,"" you first get the dog to do what you want. For instance, you can use a treat to get the dog to sit. Hold it in front of its nose, and then pull it over its head. As you pull it up, the dog will look up, causing its back end to hit the ground. Use the clicker, and offer the treat as a reward.Repeat the process until the dog understands, then add in the command you choose for ""sit.""

, If your dog is starting to do what you want, you don't need to wait until you see the whole movement to click and reward. Getting partway there is a start, and you can continue to work towards your goal.For instance, if you're trying to get the dog to sit, if it sits partway, start with rewarding that behavior.

, Dogs, particularly young dogs, need consistency in their lives. If you constantly change the rules, it will only lead to confusion. Therefore, it's important to make sure your whole family is on the same page when it comes to both commands and corrections, employing them the same way every time.It's also important to keep using treats. You can phase out using a treat every single time. However, giving occasional treats will keep your dog interested., An adolescent dog isn't going to enjoy training sessions that are hours at time. Instead, practice a little each day. That way, you are reinforcing the behaviors you want every day, and your dog won't get bored. Try for 10 to 15 minutes a day. You can even break those sessions up into smaller sessions in a day., That is, every time your dog wants you to do something, get it to do something for you first. If your dog wants a treat, ask it to sit. If your dog wants to play ball, ask it to shake hands before you throw the ball. If you consistently provide training, your dog will learn that it needs to follow your commands to get what it wants., When correcting an adolescent dog (or really any dog), you should never hit or shout at it. Rather, be firm but gentle. You can say ""No!"" in a loud voice, but not shouting. Also, once you've corrected the dog, treat it like normal afterwards. If you ignore it or refuse to play with it, that will only confuse the dog, as it won't connect your behavior with what it did wrong.You can also grab the dog by the scruff and shake it gently. This correction is acceptable because an older dog would do the same thing to a younger dog as correction. However, rewards usually work better than corrections.

, Adolescent dogs will often ""forget"" the commands you've taught them. That forgetfulness could be actual forgetting, but it could just be your pup being stubborn, too. Either way, when a dog forgets, take a moment to help it relearn the command by using a treat to go over the trick again., Whether your dog is male or female, spaying or neutering it can help with training for a variety of reasons. For one, dogs that aren't fixed tend to be more aggressive, and they'll be more likely to pee inside. In addition, spaying or neutering helps with the dog's hormones, which in turn can help increase its attention span.You can have a dog spayed or neutered as early as 6 months., If the dog doesn't get enough exercise, it's going to tear up your house even more, as it will engage in ""bad"" behaviors out of boredom. However, if you exercise your dog every day, you'll tire it out, making it less likely the dog will destroy your home., If you find yourself getting frustrated with your puppy, take a moment to take a deep breath. Getting upset will only make your dog upset, which in turn will detract from what you're trying to do. If you need to, step away for a few minutes to calm down., The first step in socializing is to take your dog out into the world. That way, your dog can meet new people and gain new experiences. You should try to expose your dog to new situations, new places, and new surfaces (tiles, stairs, grass, etc.) on a regular basis.It's important to start socializing your dog as a puppy, as that's when it's deciding what's ""normal."" However, it's equally important to continue that socializing into teenhood and adulthood.
However, don't remove the dog from its family (mom and pup siblings) before 8 weeks, as that's also important to its development.

, Just like you want to encourage your dog to see a variety of places, meeting different types of people is important, too. When someone shows interest in your dog, encourage them to pet it or offer it a treat (that you carry with you). That way, your dog can get used to all different kinds of people.Another option is to invite people over to your house to interact with your dog. That way, you get the dog used to the people in your life., Your adolescent also needs to learn how to interact with other dogs. Otherwise, your dog may become aggressive as it gets older. Letting your dog play and romp with other dogs sends the message that other dogs are friends rather than enemies.Try to pick safe choices for dog interactions. That is, older dogs that are proven with puppies are a good choice. However, other puppies that majorly outweigh your dog can be bad, as they can hurt your dog without even realizing it.

, Your dog knows how to warn people when it feels uncomfortable. It will usually start with growling, and it may move up to snapping. While this behavior seems aggressive, it's actually an important warning system.In other words, if you try to train a dog not to growl at all, you won't have that warning system anymore when the dog feels uncomfortable, and it could move from feeling uncomfortable to attacking, rather than from feeling uncomfortable to growling.
Instead, teach your dog not to growl at you in certain situations. For instance, if your dog gets agitated when you come near it while it's playing with its favorite toy, teach it you are not a threat. Try bringing a bit of a treat with you as you come near your dog. Drop the treat near it. Let it see that every time you come near it when it's playing with it's toy, you'll have something good, and eventually, it will stop growling. You can slowly lay off the treats and just spend time near it.If your dog starts growling, it's time to change up the situation. Back away if it's growling at you, or take your dog away if it's growling at strangers.
Other indicators your dog is unhappy include it licking its lips, cowering, tucking its tail in, or laying its ears back."

Start early.,
Never beat your dog.,
Reward your Great Dane for proper behavior.,
Express dissatisfaction firmly and calmly.,
Be patient.,
Socialize your dog early.",How to Train Great Danes1," Great Danes have an innate need to please, so your puppy will be easy to train.Since your Great Dane is so large, it is important to start as early as you can to help him learn good behavior. This will ensure that, as he grows, he will listen to you and follow your lead. This will be easier for you because he will be harder to convince to do things the older and larger he gets.


The earliest you can start to train your Great Dane is at around eight to10 weeks old.;
, Punishing or beating your Great Danes when he is not acting in the way you want him to is out of the question. Instead of learning from your punishment, your Great Dane will learn to be scared of you or learn to hate you. If your Great Dane behaves out of fear of punishment from you, your dog may become frustrated or anxious. This may lead pent up anger which may cause your Great Dane to become aggressive.


Given the size of a Great Dane, you could be a danger if the aggressive behavior is turned on you. This means that it is even more imperative for such a large dog., Training through rewards is the best method to get your Great Dane to train properly. It is more constructive as a training method because your dog will associate your training with pleasant things. Whenever you give a particular command, reward your Great Dane's behavior with a treat or other positive reinforcement.


This will connect your dog's behavior with the pleasant feeling.
Begin with easy commands, such stay or sit. , If your Great Dane is behaving badly or is engaging in behavior that he shouldn't, you should give short, sharp commands in a calm voice. This should be a phrase, such as ""No"" or ""Uh oh"", that you say firmly to him.


Once your Great Dane corrects his behavior, you can praise him for that behavior.
Even if your Great Dane does not respond right away, do not get upset, yell, or hit your dog. This will only make him fear you. , No portion of training your Great Dane will happen over night. You just have to keep with all the different types of training. Your dog will eventually catch on as long as you stick with it.


If a particular treat is not working, mix it up. If the training method is not working just right, switch up how you are approaching it to ensure that you are reaching your dog and training them as successfully as possible., Your Great Dane needs to be introduced to other dogs and people early in his life. This will ensure that your Great Dane acts accordingly around other dog and people. To do this, take him to a dog park, invite people to your house, or enroll him in socialization classes, which are given by professionals.


This is especially important for your Great Dane because, if he attacks other dogs or people, he can do major damage.Be sure that your Great Dane has all his shots before you take him around other dogs.

First, name the dog.,
When you've named the animal, say the name out loud whenever you interact with the dog.,
Once the dog knows what its name is, you're ready to teach it the basic commands of dog dom.,
To teach a dog to come, say ""Rover, come"" and offer the dog a treat.,
To teach a dog to sit, start with the dog in front of you.,
The dog should watch as the treat goes up and over its head, and it should naturally sit.,
Once the dog has learned to sit and come on command, teach it to lie down.,
By now you should have housebroken your dog.,
To teach a dog to drop something it's carrying, start with the dog when it has a toy it likes in its mouth.",How to Train an Untamed Dog," The name should be something short and easy to say, but don't pick a word you use a lot in daily conversation.;
, If the dog isn't good at paying attention, try saying the dog's name and then immediately giving it a treat. Very soon the dog will learn to focus on you when it hears its name.

, Every civilized dog should know its name, be housebroken, know how to come when called, sit and lie down on command, and walk on a leash. Most dogs should also be taught to let go of something they're chewing on (use the ""give"" or ""drop"" commands), ""heel"" at the owner's side, and stop all activity when they hear ""no.""

, If necessary, put a leash on the dog and tug gently on the leash to get the dog's attention. Do NOT pull hard on the leash to drag the dog toward you! When it comes, give it the treat and praise it. Repeat as needed until the dog comes when called. Gradually add in distractions to your training, until the dog will come when called even if it's busy doing something else.

, Hold a treat in your hand, say ""Rover, sit"" (or whatever the dog's name is) and slowly move the treat over and slightly behind the dog's head. Don't hold it up too high, or the dog might jump to grab the treat from you; if this happens, take your hand with the treat away and try again. (You might want to use a toy the dog likes, instead of something edible.)

, As soon as its butt hits the floor, praise the dog (remembering to say its name as you talk to it), pet it and give it the treat. After a few minutes, repeat the process. Do this several times, until the dog can sit on command even when it doesn't see you signaling with the treat. It may take more than one session to firmly establish the command, so after seven to ten repetitions, take a break and try again later.

, Have the dog sitting in front of you, hold a treat or toy, give the order ""Lie down"" and lower the treat towards the floor. Ideally the dog should lie down in order to keep watching the treat comfortably. If the dog lies down, praise it and give the treat. If the dog just tries to get the treat from you, order it back to a sitting position and try again. Repeat until the dog has learned to lie down when told to.

, If you have not, please refer to the article on that.

, Hold a very special treat in one hand and slowly reach for the dog's toy with the other. Say ""Rover, drop it."" If the dog lets go of its toy and tries to get the treat, take the toy away and give the dog the treat (with lots of praise). Then let the dog have its toy back. Repeat until the dog will give up its toy on command.

Teach your Borzoi some commands.,
Take the dog out for a daily walk.,
Let your Borzoi run free in a fenced-in space.,
Get help from experienced breeders/trainers.,
Purchase all the necessities.,
Feed your dog high quality food that is made for large dogs.,
Groom your Borzoi.,
Show affection.,
Play with your dog.,
Estimate the amount of time you can devote to a pet.,
Be careful with Borzois if you have children.,
Use caution if you have other pets.,
Purchase a Borzoi from a reputable breeder.,
Adopt a Borzoi.,
Be patient.",How to Care for a Borzoi," Borzois are intelligent, yet they can be quite stubborn. Hounds in general are independent and have a mind of their own. Start by teaching basic commands (sit, stay, come, etc.) and go from there.You can try teaching your dog to sit, training your dog to stay, or teaching your dog to come on command.
Try using positive reinforcement training where you give the pup praise and cuddles when they behave the way you want them to. This is a better option than using treats because you don’t want your Borzoi to gain too much weight on their slender frame.
If possible, get help from a professional. Taking your dog to obedience school can help it learn how to behave and respond to you properly from the beginning.;
, They should walk beside or behind you, not in front of you. They can walk for an hour once a day or for 30 minutes twice a day.Never let a Borzoi go off a leash unless they are in a safely enclosed space. They will chase anything that looks like prey and may not come back. Worse, they could be hit by a car because they can get so preoccupied when they run or chase.
Unleashing a dog, even if you think it'll listen to you, is often how they get hurt. Walking on the beach or in empty fields where they can safely run is great fun for borzois.

, While these dogs certainly need their daily walk, they also need a large enclosed space to run in. A walk won't satiate the urge to stretch their limbs and run around at top speed. You will have a destructive Borzoi if it is not given off-leash running time.


Make sure this is always in an enclosed space. The Borzoi can and will get away from you and be gone in a second.
Get involved in lure coursing or some other activity. Lure coursing is where sight-hounds chase an artificial lure across an open field. They are judged based on speed, endurance, enthusiasm, and other traits.

, If you have any questions about the breed, whether you adopt or purchase from a reputable breeder, it's always best to call a breeder to get the down-low on how these dogs actually act. Generalized information is nothing compared to the hand of experience.Accurate information will give you the tools you need to effectively train your dog and help you develop a strong bond.

, Whenever you bring a new dog into your home, you need to make sure you have all the necessary supplies so that you won’t be caught off-guard in the moment. Make sure you have everything you need.You’ll need to buy a leash, collar, dog bed, dog food, food bowls, grooming supplies (like a dog hairbrush), some doggie toys, and possibly a crate.
Use a martingale collar for your Borzoi. Sighthounds have narrow heads and inset ears, so normal collars can slip right off of their necks.
It is not recommended to keep Borzois in crates because of their high-energy nature, so only use this method when absolutely necessary. However, if you must use a crate for your Borzoi, get one that is 26 in (66 cm) wide by 36 in (91 cm) high by 48 in (120 cm) long., Since Borzois are a larger breed of dog, they need specialized formulas to ensure they’re getting the proper nutrients for their larger bodies. Check with your vet to make sure the food you choose is meeting your Borzoi's nutritional needs.You should feed the Borzoi a few small meals throughout the day instead of a large one once a day. They are prone to bloat and torsion. Eating small meals will aid in this a lot.As another precaution, feed your Borzoi on a raised surface. This will help them avoid potential stomach issues.
Additionally, don't let your Borzoi exercise right after eating to help avoid bloat and torsion.

, Be sure to take extra care with grooming your Borzoi. You should brush a Borzoi's long, silky coat once or twice a week. This will help prevent your dog’s coat from matting up and getting tangled. While you’re at it, clip the hair between the toes and clean the ears. You can get an ear cleaner at the pet store.Be sure to bathe your Borzoi, though you don’t have to bathe them as often as some other breeds. Three times a year should do the trick.
You’ll need to purchase a dog hair brush, comb, and nail clippers for your Borzoi.

, This breed is gentle and sweet and your dog will want you to love it. Don't hit the dog or be harsh with training. They don't like harshness. Keep in mind, they are sighthounds. Sighthounds are peaceful dogs who relish positive interaction with their owners.Showing affection is an important part of bonding with your dog and creating a loving lifelong relationship.

, Make sure you spend some time playing with your friendly Borzoi. Set aside at least 15 minutes daily to play with your dog. In addition to exercise, Borzois need to engage in playful activities, like tug or hide and seek, that make them think and remain active.Use motivational play training to help build a bond with your pet and keep it happy.

, Borzois were bred in Russia as hunting/racing dogs, so they have a very specific temperament. They are high-energy dogs that require a lot of exercise and activity.Borzois need owners who can commit time to them. Because of its racing nature, you will probably need to spend about an hour each day doing physical activity with your Borzoi.

, The Borzoi breed usually does not like children. They are sensitive dogs and if not raised with children they can become frightened, nervous, and anxious. Take special care if you want a Borzoi and have children.It is also easy for a large dog to knock children over and accidentally harm them.
They are usually quite gentle and good with humans, but often don’t like outsiders.

, Borzois are hunters by instinct and some of them cannot be placed in homes with other, smaller animals. If raised with a cat or smaller dog, these dogs might be able to adjust with proper training, but some Borzoi are aggressive in their instincts and cannot be trained to ignore or adjust to small animals in a home.If you have existing pets (especially small ones), you should seriously consider adopting another breed of dog. At the very least, you should try to introduce your existing pets to the new Borzoi before adopting it so you can gauge how the dog will react.

, If you want a Borzoi with a traceable lineage that you can track, you should consider purchasing one from a reputable breeder. Avoid buying them from pet stores because these puppy’s often come from puppy mills and encourage irresponsible breeding.You never know what happened to a dog when you adopt them. Purchasing a puppy, or a full grown dog, from a reputable breeder prevents temperamental issues, promotes proper socialization, and gives you a record of health via that dog’s bloodline.
You should always be able to visit the breeder's location and meet the parents of the puppies to see if their personalities match with yours. The breeder will also try to select for you a dog that will match your personality or lifestyle.
To find a reputable breeder, you should do a search on the internet and look for reviews. They will also have paperwork documenting the lineage of their breeding dogs that you can ask to see.
You might want to look for reputable breeders at dog shows that feature Borzois too. Well-respected dog shows will not accept disreputable breeders.

, If you are comfortable with this option, it could be a good idea to adopt a Borzoi that needs a home. You should try to get one from a rescue group or try searching for borzois at local animal shelters.Find a borzoi specific rescue agency to get matched with the dog you want.
Make sure you visit several dogs before agreeing to adopt one.
To find a good Borzoi adoption agency or rescue group, look for organizational websites on the internet. You can also contact the National Borzoi Rescue Foundation for recommendations of agencies in your area., If you have your heart set on a Borzoi, you should be prepared to wait a while – especially if adoption is important to you. There are not a large number of Borzoi rescues, so you may need to wait. Take your time and wait for the right Borzoi for you.If you don’t find a breeder you love right away, it is probably best to keep looking.
No matter what method you wish to use to acquire a Borzoi, it is important to remember that adopting a dog is a big commitment that will last many years – so you should not rush into it.

Determine if your dog needs a halter collar.,
Select the proper size and fit for your dog.,
Train your dog to accept the halter collar readily.,
Understand how the halter collar works.,
Walk your dog with the halter collar and reinforce good behavior.,
As your dog's behavior improves, you can begin to walk it with the leash attached to its regular collar while the dog is still wearing the halter collar, and eventually you will be able go for walks without the halter collar at all.",How to Use a Halter Collar on a Dog," A good candidate for a halter collar is a dog that pulls on the leash, has a strong neck and chest area, lunges at others while on the leash, or has a dominant personality. Dogs that are already well-behaved on leashes, or that are fearful, are not good candidates because the strap sitting over the dog's nose can exacerbate submissive and fearful behaviors.


Additionally, short-nosed dogs such as bulldogs and pugs do not make good candidates for a halter collar simply because the collar can slide off too easily.;
, If possible, take your dog with you to the store and try on different sizes. There are several different manufacturers and styles of halter collars, but all have the same functional design, which is a strap over the muzzle and one strap behind the ears, (also called the poll.) Both straps can be adjusted independently to the size of your dog. Both should fit snugly to the dog's head and cinch at the throat, but should not interfere with the dog's ability to open or close its mouth, or to breathe.


Most styles of halter collars are designed to tighten when the dog pulls, so the collar should be loose when fitted to the dog. Otherwise, the corrective effect of the collar will be diminished.
Many styles of halter collars also have a safety strap that attaches from the leash to the dog's regular collar. This is important because it allows you to retain control of your dog even if it manages to slip out of the halter collar.

, Not every dog likes to have a band over its nose, so owners should strive to give the new training aide a pleasant association. When first fitting the dog, use treats and lots of praise to encourage the dog to tolerate the halter collar. If the dog attempts to scratch it or shake it off, distract the dog by bringing its attention to something pleasant, such as treats, a toy, or any tricks the dog has already learned.


Never punish your dog for resisting the halter collar, as this could create a negative association that will result in the dog taking progressively more extreme measures to avoid the training aide.

, Halter collars take the pressure of the leash away from the dog's neck, but; unlike body harnesses which can make it easier for dogs to pull, halter collars take advantage of a dog's natural physical and psychological traits to make pulling more difficult for the animal. When the dog pulls, the halter collar places a downward pressure on the dog's muzzle, much like a mother dog or alpha wolf would do to discipline a puppy or a lower ranking pack member.


Additionally, the direction of the force applied pushes the dog's head down and back, which makes further pulling physically impossible. The dog is essentially driving its own nose into the ground every time it pulls.

, Most dogs learn very quickly that pulling presents them with a negative outcome. In behavioral terms, this is called a negative reinforcement: The animal learns that by not pulling, it will not experience the unpleasant effect of having its head shoved backwards and towards the ground. As the dog stops pulling, you should praise the dog for good behavior. This creates what is called a positive reinforcement: by not pulling, the dog earns additional affection and attention from its owner. When starting out, you can use treats, toys, and verbal praises to let your dog know it is doing a good job, but you will want to wean the dog off of food and excessive celebration.


Eventually, just walking with you will become a reward, as dogs have a natural instinct to follow the pack leader. Combining both of these training methods yields strong and fast results to alter the behavior of the dog.

, Do not be discouraged if your dog relapses and starts pulling again. Typically this means the halter collar was removed too soon during the dog's training, or the dog has simply figured out that the collar itself causes the negative outcome rather than the pulling.


In either case, simply return to using the halter collar until the dog reliably minds its manners, and then begin to phase out the halter collar again.

Avoid buying from a pet store.,
Find local breeders.,
Visit the premises.,
Assess the breeder.",How to Buy a Doberman Pinscher Puppy1," Pretty much all puppies that you see in a pet store come from puppy mills, which are essentially puppy factories with deplorable conditions. Not buying your Doberman Pinscher puppy from a pet store is a way to take away from a business that exploits for profit. Puppies raised in pet mills (as well as their parents) are also likely to carry parasites and suffer from health problems., It is a good plan to buy your puppy from a responsible, local Doberman Pinscher breeder. Browse through local classified listings, talk to area vets, ask other local Doberman Pinscher owners for referrals to reputable breeders. If necessary, visit several local breeders to find one that you feel comfortable with, and trust to sell you your new pet. Opt for local breeders so that you can meet the puppy first, visit the environment in which it’s been raised, and establish a relationship with the breeder.Visit the American Kennel Club’s website for listings of reputable Doberman Pinscher breeders in your area: http://marketplace.akc.org/puppies/doberman-pinscher


, If you contact a breeder to buy a puppy, insist on visiting the premises before going through with your purchase. Breeders who decline are likely trying to hide the true conditions of their breeding operation; you should be wary if they avoid your visit and offer to deliver the puppy to you instead. Seeing the condition of your puppy’s first home, as well as the state of its mother, is important in determining whether your breeder is trustworthy or not.Observe how the puppies react to the breeder. If they are not friendly, and recoil or shy away, take it as a sign that the breeder might not be caring for them properly.

, Responsible breeders invest a significant amount of time and consideration into caring for their puppies. A good breeder will ask a lot of questions about a potential owner, and will not be evasive when asked questions. Good breeders care about the health and well-being of their dogs, as well as the betterment of the breed as a whole. "

Keep training sessions short.,
End on a positive note.,
Make treats less predictable.,
Change up the rewards.",How to Train Great Danes2," When you are training your Great Dane puppy, you should keep your sessions short. They should last no longer than five minutes at first. Your Great Dane puppy will have a very short attention span, so you need to make sure you can keep his attention by having short training sessions.


As he gets older, you can increase the length of your sessions., Make sure you stop your training sessions on a positive note. Once you notice your Great Dane puppy getting distracted, go ahead and quit your session. End it by requesting him to do a simple command that you know your Great Dane can perform. This way, you will be able to praise him at the end of the session.


This will leave your puppy feeling happy with himself, which will make him a happier dog., Your Great Dane will eventually get used to the treat and reward schedule that you developed in the beginning. When this happens, you should make your schedule and methods much less predictable. Instead of giving a treat every time you Great Dane does something right, skip a few to keep him guessing.


This makes him wonder why he didn't get a treat and will make him work harder in the future to get the next treat or reward.
Over time, skip two or three instances that you would typically reward until you are only rewarding every fourth or fifth behavior. This will be far enough apart for him to work for it but close enough together to encourage good behavior. , When you reward your Great Dane, try to vary the types of treats you give him. These treats don't have to be food related and can vary depending on your or your dog's mood. Try bites of food, dog treats, praise, or play time with his favorite toy.


Your Great Dane will let you know which activities he likes the best. This may be tugging on his favorite chew toy or eating a bite of his favorite treat.
You should also use different treats on different days."
"
Potty train your dog.,
Use clicker training for your dog.,
Train your dog for a crate.,
Teach simple commands.",How to Train Great Danes3," When you are potty training your Great Dane puppy, you need to start as early as possible when you bring him home. Start by designating a specific place in your back yard that will be his toilet place. Take him there every 20 to 30 minutes at first, changing to once an hour as he gets older. When he uses it, praise him and give him affection and attention. This will help your Great Dane think about your praise of him when he needs to use the bathroom, which will make him more likely to repeat his good behavior.


Make sure you praise him every time he potties in the right place.
To properly potty train your Great Dane, keep a watch on him all the time while he is indoors. This means you need to follow him around, keep him in his crate while you go out, or keep him on a leash.
If your dog does mess in the house on accident, make sure you clean the area extremely well to remove the smell. This will make sure he will not return to mark the same territory again., Clicker training is a great way of designating desired behavior for your Great Dane. It will also help him know what he is being rewarded for. Clicker training works by linking the click-clack of the clicker to him getting a reward for his behavior.When you get the desired action from your Great Dane, use the clicker to reinforce it.
For example, when teaching your Great Dane to ""sit"", press the clicker as soon as your dog's bottom hits the ground. , Crate training will give your dog a small room of his own. Start with a crate large enough for your Great Dane puppy to walk around. Put a comfortable bed in his crate along with a water bowl and some toys. Keep your puppy in here when you have to leave to discourage messing in the house or chewing things he shouldn't.


To get your Great Dane used to the crate, close the door when he goes inside. Leave him in the crate for short periods of time, gradually increasing them until he can stay there for hours without whining. Give him lots of praise when he sits in there well.
To help him associate his crate with happy things, give him treats or a toy when you keep him in there.
As he grows, the crate will need to be bigger. If you don't want to buy another crate as he grows, buy a large crate to begin with. It should be large enough for him not to bang his head and long enough for him to lie down., To ensure your Great Dane behaves himself, he needs to learn to obey basic commands such as ""Sit"", ""Stay"", and ""Come"". If your Great Dane obeys these as soon as you give them, you can control him in pretty much any situation.Try using food, small treats, or other foods to help train your dog.


For example, put a treat in your hand. Let your Great Dane know you have it. Use the hand with the treat to lure his head upwards until his bottom naturally hits the ground.. As you put his bottom on the ground, say firmly and calmly ""Sit"". You can also press the clicker as soon as his bottom hits the floor. Then give him the treat.Similar methods work for other basic commands.

Inquire about health issues.,
Ask if they offer a guarantee.,
Ask for references.",How to Buy a Doberman Pinscher Puppy2," Your potential new puppy's health is of great importance. Ask the breeder if the mother of the litter is up to date with her vaccines, since puppies get their early immunity to disease directly from their mother. Inquire about any possible genetic defects (from the mother or the father), and ask if the puppy will be seen by a vet before it is sold., Ask your breeder if they offer a guarantee, more specifically with regard to the health of the animal (i.e. if the puppy is found to have a severe illness, what will they do?) See if they will cover veterinary expenses, or offer you another puppy from the litter in such an event. This question is sometimes an uncomfortable one to ask, so be as straightforward as possible by saying, ""Can you tell me if you offer any guarantee with the sale of this puppy?"" and opening up the discussion., Do not hesitate to ask a breeder for references from other people who have purchased puppies from them. A good, experienced breeder will have no trouble producing a reference, and might even ask you for references as well to determine what kind of pet owner you will be. As an added bonus, getting references creates an opportunity to communicate with other Doberman Pinscher owners who may be able to offer additional advice and guidance about your new pet."

Make sure your puppy is old enough.,
Pick a good-tempered puppy.,
Consider the dog's tail.,
Consider adopting a puppy.",How to Buy a Doberman Pinscher Puppy3," Before buying a puppy, you should make sure that it is old enough to be taken away from its mother and the rest of its litter. The first 8 weeks of a puppy's life should be spent with its mother and siblings. During this initial period it will pick up social skills, be weaned from its mother, grow teeth, and start eating solid food., When you pick your puppy from a litter, look for one who seems even tempered and avoid extreme behaviour (too energetic, or too withdrawn and skittish). Note that Doberman Pinschers, as a breed, are known for being alert, loyal, and aggressive when protecting loved ones. Spend time with your potential new puppy away from the rest of the litter to get a feel for its individual personality., Some breeders opt to dock the tails of their Doberman Pinscher puppies, so you should decide what your own feelings about it are before purchasing a puppy. This process usually happens days, or even hours, after a puppy is born; it involves tying a band around the tail to cut off circulation, which results in the tail falling off after a few days. This choice is aesthetically-motivated and practical, preventing injury that might occur to a longer tail. Many oppose this practice, which is illegal in several countries like Sweden, Greece, and Ireland., Consider adopting a Doberman Pinscher puppy instead of buying one- the cost will be much lower than buying a puppy from a breeder, and you will be giving a home to a dog that desperately needs love and nurturing. Contact dog rescue groups in your area to ask about Doberman Pinscher puppies, or for a referral to other rescue groups that might deal with the breed."

Plan your finances.,
""Puppy-proof"" your home.,
Do some research.",How to Buy a Doberman Pinscher Puppy4," Before going through with buying your new puppy, you must be sure that you have enough money for the commitment. Purchasing a Doberman Pinscher puppy from a reputable breeder will cost you something close to $1500. Beyond that cost, you will need enough money to feed a dog that will grow to be very large (approximately 60-70 lbs, or 27-32 kgs), buy supplies, pay veterinarian bills, and cover any emergencies that might arise., Before you buy a puppy, you must make sure to clear your home of any dangers that might affect a new pet. This means hiding away breakable items, covering electrical wires that might get chewed, locking up potentially toxic substances, and keeping stray items off of the floor. This is an especially important consideration for Doberman Pinscher puppies, which take a bit longer than other breeds to mature, and may remain ""puppy-ish"" until the age of 3 or 4., The Doberman Pinscher is a breed with a lot of particularities, so doing some thorough research prior to buying one is a good idea. While you may be informed about the basic characteristics of the breed (e.g. that they grow to be quite large, and require a lot of exercise), it's a good idea to brush up on more little-known facts.Some valuable things to know about Doberman Pinscher dogs include:


that they are very sensitive to cold weather
that they are very much family dogs ans should not be left alone for long periods
that they require an especially strong leader and need consistent discipline from their owner

Microchip your dog.",How to Care for a Belgian Malinois," Belgian Malinois usually live to be 14 to 16 years old and become beloved parts of your family. They are loving and loyal pets who want to earn your praise and love. Bond with your Malinois by taking care of them, giving them attention, and being physically affectionate. They can do well in a variety of homes either with other pets or as the only dog.


A well socialized Malinois does well in a home with other animals. Regardless of their breed, some dogs do better than others in homes with other animals based on their individual temperament. As a whole, Belgian Malinois are happy in homes with other animals.;
, A Belgian Malinois should fit your lifestyle and your lifestyle should also fit the needs of a Belgian Malinois. Belgian Malinois are very active dogs and do best in environments where they have space to run and play. Life in a small apartment without any yard would be hard on a Belgian Malinois.

, Like all dogs, Belgian Malinois require time and attention to become well trained. They are also very loyal dogs and prefer to be around their owners and family. They do not enjoy being left alone for significant amounts of times without social interactions.


Belgian Malinois are very intelligent dogs who want to please their owners. They are very easy to train, in comparison to other breeds, but they need their trainer to be firm and consistent.
You must be prepared to spend a significant amount of time, at least an hour a day, exercising your dog. This breed is a working dog and they do have a lot of energy. If they do not have opportunities to expend energy, such as through play or exercise, they can become destructive and act out.

, Belgian Malinois are great family dogs and enjoy being around children. They are extremely loyal to their owners and families and can be wary of strangers if they perceive them as a threat. This makes them great guard dogs, but they must be taught not to be overly protective of small children through proper socialization.


They are very loving with children but due to their larger size, they can unintentionally knock children over when playing. They also have strong herding instincts and may try to herd small children if not corrected.Small children should be watched closely around pets since kids have a tendency to pull on dog's fur, ears, and tails, which can hurt a dog.

, Like all dogs, Belgian Malinois must be taught to appropriately greet and interact with other dogs and people. You should make a conscious effort to expose your dog to new environments, experiences, people, and animals.Belgian Malinois are a social breed and enjoy interacting with other dogs and people. Since they are very protective, they may initially be wary of strangers. By exposing them to new people in safe environments, they learn that new people are not a threat.Introduce your dog to your neighbors, friends, and family. Use a friendly tone of voice and be excited to see the new person. This lets the Malinois know that you do not perceive these new people as a threat. Once they realize they are not a threat, let the dog approach the new person. Give your friend a few treats to share with the dog so they can form positive associations with meeting new people.

, Belgian Malinois do enjoy playing with other dogs and it is important to socialize your dog to interact positively with other animals. Take your Malinois to areas where other dogs are, like dog day cares or on walks with other dogs. This gives them an opportunity to play with a variety of other dogs and to be exposed to new environments.


If your friends and family have dogs, set up a play date so the two dogs can meet. Let the dogs approach each other and become acquainted. Demonstrate that you do not perceive the other dog as a threat to your safety by petting it and speaking in a kind and reassuring tone.

, Belgian Malinois want to please their owners by following their directions and commands. They are working dogs that are very task oriented and enjoy being rewarded for their hard work.


Small treats can be very helpful in training exercises, like in teaching obedience commands. Reward your Belgian Malinois immediately after they complete the task you have instructed them so they associate your praise with the action.Positive reinforcement, through treats or praise, can also help condition your dog to respond favorably to new situations.

, Belgian Malinois are a very intelligent breed and will learn new tasks and tricks easily. They are bred to be working dogs so they have a strong drive to follow directions and carry out tasks.


Basic commands like sit, stay, and come are all good first commands to begin with.

Teach your Malinois to sit by showing them a treat. When the dog looks up at the treat, move the treat close to the dog's nose, then slowly back over the dog's head. When the dog tries to follow the treat with its eyes and nose, it will usually sit down. When this happens, give the dog the treat and say ""Sit.""
Stay and come can be taught in tandem. Have the dog sit in front of you while you are standing. Take a few steps backwards as you say, “stay.” If the dog gets up to follow you, instruct them to sit again and repeat the process. When the dog has learned to stay, you can begin to use the “come” command to instruct them to follow you as you back away.

, Belgian Malinois tend to be very attached to their owners and families, so there is less of a risk of them running away than with other breeds. However, they do need to be taught to walk on a leash and to follow your commands.Belgian Malinois are very strong and can pull while on a leash. If your dog begins to pull while you are walking them on a leash, you can stand still and wait until they reach the end of the leash and are forced to walk back to you. You can also use treats to encourage dogs to stay close to your side and to match your gait.Do not use retractable leashes. They are often not strong enough to be used with larger dogs, and they reinforce bad leash habits like walking far ahead or behind you. They can also negatively impact the socialization work that you’ve already done. If you retract the leash anytime another dog or person comes close to you, you are signaling to your Malinois that you perceive that person or dog to be a threat.

, When it comes to training, practice makes perfect. You will need to spend time each day - depending on your dog’s obedience level it may be numerous 15 minute intervals - practicing the commands and tricks that you want the dog to learn.Most Belgian Malinois will enjoy training since it gives them an opportunity to spend time with you and provides mental stimulation.
Once your dog is fully trained, you should continue to frequently practice the commands that they have learned so they retain them over time.

, While most Belgian Malinois are easy to train, some owners feel overwhelmed with the training process if they have not trained a dog before. Visit your local pet store for information on obedience classes, or search for classes in your area online.


There are classes for puppies and adult dogs, and most will allow you to sit in on the classes so you learn proper techniques.
You can also enroll in an obedience class to teach your Malinois more advanced commands.

, Belgian Malinois are very active dogs with high energy levels. They need to be exercised every single day to keep them happy and healthy. When Malinois do not have an opportunity to expend their energy, they may turn to destructive behaviors like chewing furniture and destroying their beds to alleviate their boredom.


Daily walks are not enough exercise for a Belgian Malinois unless you are an avid runner who jogs several miles each and every day.
Belgian Malinois do best when they have large fenced in yards to play in. Many Malinois enjoy retrieval games, participating in agility trials, running, hiking, biking, and spending time with their owners outdoors.In addition to physical exercise, they also need mental exercise. They are very intelligent and may enjoy participating in Schutzhund, advanced obedience training, agility, herding, and tracking exercises., Since Belgian Malinois are very active dogs who enjoy strenuous exercise, they need to be fed healthy and nutritious dog foods.


Feed your Belgian Malinois on a regular schedule and always have clean water available for them to drink.Healthy dog foods should have a balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Typically, working dogs need more protein than the average house pet so look for a dog food that is around 25 to 30% protein.Work with your veterinarian to determine the amount of food your dog needs based on their health and activity levels.

, Belgian Malinois require some grooming but are generally clean and easy to care for animals. They do not require professional dog grooming, though you can always choose to take them to a dog groomer to be bathed or to have their nails trimmed. Brushing can help to mitigate shedding and reduce skin irritation.


Belgian Malinois have short and weatherproof fur. Their coat will shed out twice a year as the dog’s body prepares for winter and summer weather.They require routine brushing to keep the fur clean and to protect it from matting. During shedding season, they need to be brushed every day.

, Belgian Malinois need extensive exercise and many owners will choose to give them that exercise by running on pavement or concrete. These surfaces can be tough on dog’s nails and cause breakage if nails are not trimmed properly.


Their nails should be trimmed regularly to protect them from breaking and becoming over grown. Dog’s nails grow continuously like humans and need to be trimmed every month.

, Your Malinois’ skin can become irritated from tick or flea bites or from allergies. Check their skin for any rashes, dryness, or irritation that seems to be bothering them.You may notice that the dog is scratching or biting at a certain spot on their body, which can be an indication that there is an issue there.
If your dog has allergies, your veterinarian may recommend using an over the counter antihistamine.

, Use a dog toothpaste and a toothbrush that is specifically designed for use with dogs to clean their teeth thoroughly.


Brush their teeth two or three times during the week. This will help to protect their teeth and maintain good oral health.
Condition the dog to enjoy brushing their teeth by selecting a dog toothpaste in a flavor that they enjoy and reward them with praise and a small treat after brushing.

, As a breed, Belgian Malinois are more at risk for some medical conditions than others. By knowing what sort of conditions they are susceptible to, you can take preventative measures early on. Like most larger dog breeds, they are at risk of hip dysplasia. Responsible breeders will genetically test for hip dysplasia before breeding puppies, but you may not know a dog’s genetic background if it is adopted. Veterinarians are able to X-ray the dog’s hips to check for the condition.
Some Belgian Malinois are at risk of hereditary juvenile cataracts. Cataracts can develop as the dog gets older and can often be removed through surgery.
There is some evidence to suggest that Belgian Malinois may be slightly more susceptible to epilepsy, though extensive research has not been completed. If your dog begins to show signs of epilepsy, take them to the veterinarian immediately., When you first purchase or adopt a Belgian Malinois, you need to take them to the veterinarian as soon as possible to ensure that they are healthy. Like all dogs, Belgian Malinois require routine medical care to keep them healthy and maintain their quality of life.


Belgian Malinois also require routine vaccinations for diseases like rabies. They also need medical protection from fleas, ticks, and heartworm.

, If you do not intend to use the dog for breeding, you should desex your pet when it is safe to do so, usually between 6 and 9 months.Spaying or neutering your dog can increase their lifespan on an average of 1 to 3 years, reduces their risk for some diseases, like uterine or prostate cancer, and decreases aggressive behavior.Spaying or neutering your pet also helps to control the companion animal population. There are millions of dogs that are waiting in shelters for homes and sterilization helps to reduce the animal population.

, A microchip contains your contact information and the information for your veterinarian. This is highly recommended by veterinarians and this is a simple procedure that can be completed during a regular visit. If your dog ever runs away, becomes lost, or is stolen, a microchip can help your dog be returned to you.


It is a very small chip that is usually implanted in the scruff of the dog’s neck or over their shoulder blades where they cannot reach it.

Watch for tension.,
Identify aggressive body language.,
Listen for growling.,
Watch for food guarding.,
Back off if the dog snaps or bites.,
Feed the dog alone and at set mealtimes.,
Sit within sight of the dog.,
Pet the dog as it eats.,
Gradually move your hand toward the food bowl.,
Move the food bowl.,
Repeat with other family members.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Getting Food Aggression," The early signs of food aggression are usually subtle. While the dog is eating, he may tense his muscles or hold his tail up when a person or another pet approaches.;
, An aggressive dog may show her teeth and stick her ears straight up. On some dogs, the fur on the back will stand on end.


If the ears are pressed against the dog's head, the dog is most likely frightened, not aggressive.

, This will usually start as a low rumble before it becomes a growl.

, This behavior is also called food guarding, since the dog becomes overprotective of his food. He may hold his head down very close to the food, and look up at anyone that approaches. This can happen with edible scraps or even objects, as well as with his regular food.

, A dog that snaps the air or attempts to bite you while eating is definitely food aggressive. Stay away from the dog until it is done eating to avoid injury.

, Start feeding the dog in a room by itself, away from all other people and pets. Give it a bowl of food two or three times a day only. When each meal is over, remove the bowl and place it out of sight.

, While the dog is eating, sit near enough that it stiffens or looks at you. When the dog relaxes again or returns to eating, say ""good dog"" and throw it a small treat, such as a little piece of chicken or cheese. Repeat this each meal until the dog is used to you being near.


Use small pieces of treats while training, since you may need to use quite a few.

, Slowly move toward the dog and begin to pet his back. Stop if the dog shows signs of aggression and give him time to relax. When he accepts your hand, praise the dog and give him another treat. Repeat this each mealtime, gradually moving on to petting his head and playing with his ears.

, Once the dog is used to you petting him during a meal, put your hand down near the food bowl. Leave it there until the dog is used to it, then reward the dog. Repeat this training each meal, gradually moving your hand a little closer each time.

, Eventually, you should be able to put your hand on the food bowl without the dog reacting. Once you've reached this point, gradually move on to moving the bowl a little, then picking it up. Finally, try picking up the bowl a few inches, putting a treat in the bowl, and instantly lowering it to the ground again. This teaches the dog to trust that you aren't going to take away his food.


The dog might start eating faster because he thinks you're taking the meal. That's fine; this is not a sign of aggression.
Do not remove the bowl before the dog is done with it. This could make the dog more anxious.

, Just because the dog is used to you does not mean he is fine with everyone. Have each other member of the household repeat these same steps, one at a time. Supervise children closely while they do this.

Try to place the towels on the areas where your schnauzer will be getting in and out of the tub. Also, place a towel where you will be standing, kneeling, or sitting to bathe your schnauzer.


If you decide to bathe your schnauzer at a self-serve dog bathing station, you can still bring your own towels to place around the bathing area.;
, Make sure the shampoo, combs, towels, and treats are readily available. You can place the materials in a basket in the corner of the tub, or down by your side. This way, you can reduce the possibility of having to leave your wet schnauzer unattended in the tub.Have dog treats readily available so you can reward your dog for good behavior throughout the bathing process.
It is also helpful to have a trashcan nearby so you can throw away any excess hair that collects in the tub while bathing it.

, If your schnauzer is not able to stand in the tub, it will panic. Prevent your dog from slipping and panicking by either placing a rubber mat or a towel on the bottom of the tub., Fill the bathtub with 3 to 4 inches of warm water. Make sure the water is not too hot or too cold. If your schnauzer is smaller, make sure the water will not go above its knees.Run the water a little warmer from the start so that the water will be warm by the time you place your schnauzer in the tub.

, To avoid clogging your bathtub’s drain, place a steel wool in the drain. The steel wool will catch your schnauzer’s hair.


Throughout the bathing process, clear the steel wool of any excess hair if it becomes clogged.

, On a leash, lead your schnauzer to the bathing area. Have your schnauzer sit on the towels surrounding the tub. Once inside the bathing area, close the door behind you. Give your schnauzer a treat for good behavior.

, Use a soft slicker brush to comb your schnauzer’s hair. A slicker brush is great for removing tangles and combing out matted hair. Use a liquid detangler or baby oil to work through tough knots.If you encounter a stubborn knot or matted hair, it is best to cut it out instead of trying to work through it. If you try to work through it, the pulling can irritate your schnauzer’s skin.Because the hair is longer, pay close attention to the hair on your schnauzer’s legs and “armpits.” Make sure to brush out or remove any tangled or matted hair in these areas.
There may be food stuck in your schnauzer’s beard. Instead of brushing or cutting out the food from the beard, wait until your schnauzer is in the bath to wet and rinse any dried food from its beard., After you have detangled and cut out matted hair, run a bristle brush through your schnauzer’s coat. Make sure to brush your schnauzer from head to tail, i.e., head, ears, beard, back, chest, tummy, front and hind legs, hindquarters, and tail., By placing a forearm underneath your schnauzer’s front and hind legs, lift the dog up and into the tub.If you schnauzer is bigger, you will need to teach your schnauzer how to get into the tub with your help.

, Fill a pitcher with water and slowly pour the water over your schnauzer’s back and down its legs. Repeat this until your schnauzer’s back and legs are completely wet.Wet your schnauzer’s head by tilting its head upwards, i.e., nose pointing up. You want to tilt the head back to avoid getting any water in its eyes, ears, and nose. Slowly pour the water down the back of your schnauzer’s head., Rub the wet washcloth (without soap) between your schnauzer’s eyes and down the sides of its face, and over its beard.


Make sure the schnauzer’s beard is good and wet.

, Massage the shampoo into your schnauzer’s coat with a sponge, washcloth, or your hands. Make sure to rub the shampoo down through the hair to the schnauzer’s skin.Use a soft bristle brush to work the shampoo down through the hair to the skin. Also use the brush to comb through and clean the longer hair on its legs and paws., Wet a washcloth with shampoo and water. Gently rub the washcloth over your schnauzer’s beard to distribute the shampoo and water. Be careful not to get any water or soap in its nose.Loosen and remove any food particles from its beard with your hand or a bristle brush. Be careful not to pull too hard.
Rinse the shampoo immediately from the beard with a wet washcloth or your hands. Make sure to remove all soap.
To remove any foul odors from the beard, mix a half teaspoon of baking soda with one cup of warm water. Apply the solution to the dog’s beard, and rinse., Fill a pitcher with fresh, warm water and slowly pour it over your schnauzer’s body. Repeat this until all the soap is removed.To make sure the soap is removed, run your hands through its coat and squeeze to see if any soap comes up. If soap emerges, then keep rinsing until all the soap is removed.
Rinse your schnauzer’s head by tilting the head upwards again. Slowly run the water down the back of its head until all the soap is removed.
Be aware of the water level as you rinse your schnauzer. If the water level begins to rise above your schnauzer’s knees, drain some of the water.

, Once the cleaning is done, begin to drain the water from the tub. As the water is draining, drape a towel over your schnauzer so that it does not shake out water everywhere. Lift your schnauzer out of the tub, and place it on the towels. Rub down the schnauzer with the towel.


You can finish drying your schnauzer by blow-drying it. Set the blow dryer on the lowest setting. Gently blow-dry your schnauzer’s hair. Be careful that the air does not get too hot while blow-drying your schnauzer.After you have finished drying your schnauzer, comb through its coat with the bristle brush one more time.

Make sure that your dog cannot escape his fence.,
Keep your dog on a strong leash.,
Use a muzzle.",How to Stop Aggressive Behavior in Dogs1," If you have an aggressive dog, it is crucial to have adequate strong fencing around your property so that the dog cannot gain access to passers-by. Check your fence on a regular basis to make sure that there are no weak spots or holes in the ground through which your dog might escape and harm someone., On walks you must keep your dog on a strong leash so that you can control him with ease. You may want to consider a training harness as well to help you control your dog. It is crucial to have a strong leash and to be able to control your dog in case he should threaten other dogs or people., In addition to a leash and harness, your dog should wear a muzzle in public or whenever you have visitors. Look for a muzzle with a basket design so that your dog will be able to pant and drink. A basket design will also allow you to feed your dog treats through the muzzle, while still providing excellent protection from bites.To teach your dog to wear a muzzle put his favorite treat into the muzzle and hold it very still. Allow the dog to investigate and eat the treat. Do not attempt to fasten the muzzle at this stage.
Give your dog a treat and pop the muzzle over his nose while he's eating. Then remove the muzzle as soon as he finishes the treat.
After your dog has accepted this practice, put a treat in the muzzle again.
Then, after he has eaten the treat, put the muzzle on him and feed him treats through the muzzle. Wait a little bit between each treat so that your dog will begin to associate the muzzle with treats.

Understand the purpose of desensitization.,
Teach your dog the “Come Away” command.,
Expose your dog to his trigger in a safe, controlled way.,
Use the “come away” command to get your dog’s attention.,
Keep the session short and end on a positive note.,
Take it slow.",How to Stop Aggressive Behavior in Dogs2," The aim of desensitization is to expose your dog to the thing he fears, but in a less intense way. Doing so helps to ensure that he does not become too anxious. As he is exposes to his fears, you will reward him for being calm in the presence of the trigger, and over time, you will keep bringing the trigger a little closer. Desensitization take many sessions, often with the trigger only moving one step closer each session. That is why desensitization training takes so much time and patience., The “come away” command teaches your dog to leave one situation and come over to you. You may need to use this command to distract your dog from a perceived threat, such as a stranger or another dog. This command also makes use of a dog's natural instinct to return to his mother (in this case you) in times of stress.To teach ""come away"", take your dog into your yard or a place without distractions. Keep your dog on a long line if the yard is not fenced in.
Let him explore the yard and then give him the command ""come away"" and call his name.
As he moves towards you, take a step or two away but encourage him to come closer.
Once he reaches you, reward him with a treat.
Keep practicing this command in the yard. You want to reach the stage where you call his name and say “come away” and he comes running.

, To expose your dog to his trigger, make sure that you have control of your dog and then bring the trigger within your dog’s line of sight.For example, if your dog is triggered by unfamiliar men, then have a male friend stand at the edge of your yard. He should be far enough away so that your dog will notice him but not react.

, After your dog has noticed the man, call him with “come away” and reward him. Keep praising your dog and have the man move a step closer. Let the dog explore again (on the long line) and when he notices the man call him back again with “come away”., Expose your dog to the trigger for around 10 -15 minutes and try to end on a positive note. Do not try to push the session past 15 minutes or your dog may become fearful. If your dog becomes anxious, aggressive, or otherwise agitated, get him back under control with a “Sit.” Then, reward him for sitting and end the session., Remember that you will need to bring the trigger to your dog’s aggression closer and closer over time. But it is important to do so little by little. For example, if you started with a man standing at the edge of your yard in your first session, have him begin by standing one step closer in the next session.Do not try to go too fast in these sessions or your dog’s aggressive behavior may become worse.

Reduce your dog’s opportunities to practice guarding behavior.,
Teach your dog that he has no need to guard his food.,
Follow up with positive reinforcement.",How to Stop Aggressive Behavior in Dogs3," Try to keep your dog out of situations where he gets to practice and exhibit his guarding behavior. This means not allowing him to patrol up and down the fence, but keeping him indoors and giving him exercise in the park instead and taking your dog to another room when guests arrive.For dogs that bark at the front door when visitors arrive, consider keeping him on a long leash and taking him into another room as soon as guests arrive.
If your dog barks, don’t react or shout. Otherwise, your dog may interpret your reaction as you joining in and it may encourage is barking.

, Put the bowl down but with only part of his dinner in it. As he eats, scatter more of his dinner as close to the bowl as he allows you to get. If necessary, keep some food in a treat bag and each time you walk past the bowl, scatter some food in the bowl so that he begins to link your presence with plentiful food.Start with an empty bowl and have your dog sit on command. As soon as he sits, put a handful of food into the bowl and let him eat. Then command him to “Sit” again and put in another handful. Repeat. This reinforces you are in control and also that you are the provider of food.

, Once your dog reaches the point where she no longer shows aggressive behavior to her trigger, keep using positive reinforcement to let her know she is doing well. Praise her and provide treats in instances where she does just fine with the stimulus in order to keep strengthening those associations.

Think about what triggers your dog’s aggressive behavior.,
Get into the habit of reading your dog’s body language.,
Learn how to recognize common signs of aggression.,
Understand that there is no quick fix for aggression.,
Consider having a consultation with a registered pet behaviorist.,
Change your routine to reduce exposure to triggers.",How to Stop Aggressive Behavior in Dogs4," Dogs respond with aggression for many different reasons. Your dog’s aggressive behavior may be triggered by a certain type of person or situation. For example, some dogs become aggressive when new people visit, or when people walk past your dog’s yard area. Try to identify your dog’s triggers to help you as you attempt to retrain him., Pay special attention to his body language when he is exposed to one of his triggers. Many dogs are fearful or anxious prior to aggression. Common signs to watch for include a lowered head, low body posture, tail tucked between the legs, licking lips, looking away, dilated eyes, shivering or shaking., A dog that intends to attack will make a subtle change in the way he is standing. He will make direct eye contact and stare at his target. Then he will shift his weight so that it is over his front legs. He may also give a stiff tail wag with his tail held low. Watch for these signs because they indicate that a dog is about to lunge.If you are ever faced with a dog showing any of these signs, your best defense is to step aside or away from the dog and avoid staring back at him. Be quiet and calm as you do so.
If you notice your dog behaving this way, get him under control with a leash or bring him inside immediately.

, You will not be able to solve your dog’s aggression problem with a single training session. Retraining an aggressive dog takes time. Be patient and take precautions (such as a strong leash and a muzzle) to protect yourself and others as you retrain your dog.Never hit or punish your aggressive dog. Doing so will cause your dog to become over excited, or if his aggression is due to anxiety it will make him more fearful. As a result, his aggression may become worse.

, To increase your chances of success in retraining your dog, it is a good idea to consider a consultation with a registered pet behaviorist.Aggression has many contributing factors and a home consultation with an expert may give you the best chance of identifying all of these factors and working out the best strategy to control them.For example your dog may have a fear of strangers or other dogs, territorial aggression, or be prone to protecting a resource such as food.
Ask your veterinarian for help finding a registered pet behaviorist in your area.

, While you are retraining your dog, try to avoid his triggers. This might mean changing your walk route to something that is quieter and less used by dog walkers or playing vigorous games in the yard to burn off energy rather than going to the park."

Walk past your dog while it is eating.,
Approach your dog while it is eating.,
Stand over the dog and drop a treat in its bowl.,
Pick up the bowl and add treats.,
Seek professional help.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Growling at You when Eating1," Desensitization is a method used to make your dog more comfortable with having you around its food and bowl while it is eating. Begin by walking past your dog (not too close) and tossing a treat towards the dog’s bowl. You do not need to throw the food directly into the bowl, but it should land in the general vicinity of the bowl.Always use a treat that is more appealing than the food your dog is eating. For example, a piece of cheese, chicken, or beef.
Do this multiple times throughout the feeding and over the next few meals, until your dog becomes comfortable with you walking around.;
, Now that your dog is comfortable with you walking past while it is eating, try taking a step towards the dog. Stand a few feet away from your dog and using a light tone say something like “are you enjoying your meal?” Then, take a step toward the dog, toss a treat towards its bowl, and then immediately take a step back. Continue to do this a few times throughout the meal.Practice this over a few meals, and each day try and get closer to the dog’s bowl. Once you can comfortably stand within 2 feet (0.61 m) (½ a meter) of your dog’s bowl then you can move on to the next step.

, Try standing directly over top of your dog’s bowl while it is eating and drop a treat into the bowl. Once you have dropped the treat into the bowl, turn around and walk away. You are slowly getting your dog more comfortable with you around during mealtime. Your dog is also learning that you provide a positive treat., The final step in the desensitization method, is to pick up the bowl while your dog is eating, add treats, and then return the bowl to your dog. This works best if the dog sees you add the treats. Only raise the bowl a few inches to begin with. As the dog gets more comfortable, you can raise the bowl higher.All of these steps will need to be repeated with each adult member of your household. This will help your dog get comfortable with each of you individually.
Keep any children (under 18 years of age) away from an aggressive dog while it is eating.

, If your dog is extremely aggressive and you are afraid it might bite you, then you should contact a professional. Do not attempt to train an aggressive dog that may snap, bite, or chase you away from its food. Contact a Certified Applied Animal Behavioural Specialist. If there are no behavioural specialists in your area, you can also use a Certified Professional Dog Trainer.Ask the dog trainer if they have any experience treating aggressive dogs. Find someone who has worked with dog aggression in the past.

Move houseplants out of reach.,
Train your dog to leave plants alone.,
Spray houseplants with diluted lemon juice.,
Keep the dog confined.,
Remove toxic houseplants.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Your Plants1," One way of keeping dogs from eating houseplants is simply to move them to a location that is out of the dog's reach. This can be achieved with the use of tables or plant stands. Houseplants that grow in vines should be trimmed back to stay out of reach of the dog or placed totally out of reach.You may also be able to build cages around the plants using chicken wire or other products that will cut off access to plants.;
, Using a motion-sensitive repellent, you can train dogs to stay away from plants. When your dog approaches your houseplants, a motion-sensitive device will trigger, scaring the dog away from the plants, and reinforcing the idea that he should probably leave them alone. These devices come in many varieties, sometimes with an air horn or both an air horn and a chemical deterrent. Other varieties may shoot a stream of water to discourage the dog, though these may not be as desirable for use indoors.Consider clicker training as well. Clickers can help your dog understand commands more quickly as well as get their attention quickly. Clickers are available at pet stores, and many dog training academies will give instruction on clicker training. (See elsewhere in this article for information on clicker training.)

, Many dogs avoid the smell of citrus, so if you dilute lemon juice half with water and use a spray bottle to mist it onto your plants, this might deter your dog from eating your houseplants. If you do not want to spray the diluted lemon juice solution onto your plants, you can place lemon slices in the pots as an effective alternative.Empty spray bottles can be purchase at dollar or home stores.
Be sure to change lemon wedges regularly so they don't spoil.

, If your dog tends to eat your houseplants when you are not there to discourage him from doing so, keep the dog confined to spaces where there aren't any houseplants while you aren't available to supervise.This can be a room with a door you can close or a pet crate. Always be sure to keep the dog's well-being in mind when crating, as extended periods spent in crates can have adverse effects.If you aren't sure how to crate train your dog, read this helpful wikiHow article on the subject.
Many different types of crates are available, and dogs should have toys, food, and water with them inside.
Pay attention to your dog's behavior while confined, as some dogs may get stressed out from confinement.
Never use crates as punishment—dogs should only be crated if they are comfortable and happy there. You can encourage your dog to be comfortable in his crate by feeding him his meals in it and leaving its door open all the time so that he can go in and out as he pleases when you're home., Some houseplants are toxic to dogs. If you are having a hard time getting your dog to stop eating indoor plants, consider getting rid of toxic plants so that your dog does not actually ingest them and become ill. Here are some common houseplants that are poisonous to dogs:Castor bean
Daffodil
Elephant Ear
Hyacinth
Narcissus
Oleander
Rosary Pea

Keep track of when they whine.,
Figure out if it’s related to a medical condition.,
Consider if they’re expressing a need.,
Identify whether it’s related to stress or anxiety.,
Assess if their whining is a signal of submission.,
Ask if it’s related to excitement.,
Decide if it’s undesirable, attention-seeking behavior.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Whining1," Is there a particular catalyst for their whining? Which situations cause them to act up the most? Take notes about the context for each time you hear them whining. More often than not, there’ll be a pattern that you can recognize if you’re alert to it.


Once you identify the patterns and contexts for their whining, it will help you create a strategy for addressing it.;
, If your dog seems to be whining when they make certain movements, assume specific positions, or attempt particular activities, there’s a good chance that they’re expressing pain. There may be a medical reason for their complaint. If you identify such a pattern, take your dog to the vet immediately.For instance, if you notice that your pet is whining whenever they go down the steps, they might have a joint issue. Or, if your pet is whining after each mealtime, they might have a digestive issue or food intolerance.
If there is a medical reason for their whining, oftentimes proper treatment will put a stop to it.

, Puppies instinctively whine when they need something from their mothers. This behavior can carry through to adulthood, and sometimes it is used to express a legitimate need.For instance, your dog may be communicating that they need water or need to go to the bathroom.

, Dogs may whine when they’re worried. If you notice that your dog reaches a fever pitch when they’re facing new or different situations, confronting other people or animals, and/or dealing with your departure, their whining may spring from anxiety or stress.Oftentimes, this kind of whining will be accompanied by other signs of disturbance like panting, drooling, and/or pacing.
This type of whining is common for puppies before they have been socialized. It also frequently develops in older dogs as they cope with aging.

, If your dog’s whining is accompanied by signs of physical submissiveness, such as tucking their tail between their legs, lowering their head, or exposing their stomachs, chances are that their whining is expressing appeasement to an alpha.This is normal canine behavior. However, if your dog demonstrates it excessively, you can address it through training.

, Many dogs whine in anticipation of a pleasurable event, like a greeting or a walk. If this type of whining is getting on your nerves, you can train your dog to respond differently to exciting situations., If your dog is a frequent whiner who uses whining to try to get what they want, it’s graduated into a behavioral issue that should be addressed through training.This type of whining is often accompanied by other forms of physical attention-seeking, such as staring at or pacing around you.

Choose a release command.,
Teach your dog a release cue.,
Practice the command.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Growling at You when Eating2," Sometimes dogs can become aggressive when guarding a stolen food item. For example, maybe a piece of food dropped while you were cooking and your dog grabbed it. Teaching your dog a release cue, such as “drop it,” will allow you to retrieve the piece of food from your dog., Use a non-valuable yet interesting item, such as a paper towel roll, to teach your dog to release an object on command. Hold onto the item and move it around to entice the dog. Continue to hold onto one end of the item once the dog grabs it. Then using your other hand place your dog’s favourite treat under its nose and say “drop it.” The dog will likely let go of the object in order to take the treat.Once the dog has finished the treat give the dog the object again and repeat the command.
This demonstrates that when they let go of the object they are rewarded with an even better item (the treat). It also teaches the dog that they can have the object back after taking the treat.

, Once your dog has learned this command, you should practice it with a variety of different objects. Try using a more valuable item, such as the dog’s favourite toy. This will teach your dog to release a prized item on command. Eventually you will be able to get your dog to release food on command.

Feed your dog at the same time each day.,
Control the feeding situation.,
Give your dog plenty of space and food.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Growling at You when Eating3," You can also manage signs of food aggression by creating a mealtime routine. In some instances, food-based aggression occurs when a dog is uncertain about when it will get its next meal. Always feed your dog at the same time each day. That way they will become familiar with the routine, reducing their aggressive behaviour.

, Teach your dog a few basic commands, such as sit and stay. This will allow you to control the feeding situation and can help reduce growling and other aggressive behaviour. For example, give your dog the stay command and have them stand a few feet away from you. Drop their food into the bowl and then, once you are ready say “ok.” Then the dog can approach the food and eat.


These commands allow you to be the one in charge of feeding.

, Food aggression, in many instances, stems from dogs competing for food and resources in the wild. You can reduce this behaviour by giving your dog access to food and plenty of space to eat. For example, allow your dog to eat in their own private space, such as their crate or a separate room.


This way they will not feel as though they need to defend or protect their food source.

Add treats to your puppy’s bowl while they eat.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Growling at You when Eating4," Hand feeding a puppy is a great way to prevent the development of food aggression. It teaches the dog that people are not threatening and that they provide food. Try hand feeding your dog an entire meal by giving them small pieces of kibble at a time. You can also hand feed your dog treats throughout their training. This will develop trust between you and your puppy.Do not attempt to hand feed an adult dog that already displays signs of food guarding and aggression.

Instead, spray the ground near the off-limits area to create a barrier.Always be sure to use non-toxic substances to keep dogs away id it is used in a manner where dogs may ingest them.
Be sure to follow all safety information in using deterrents.

, Use aluminum foil, pine cones, chicken wire, or any other items to create a barrier in front of plants the dog is eating. The dog will not like the feeling of these items underfoot, so he will be less likely to cross the barrier and eat the plants.Chicken wire also discourages digging.
Be sure that any items you spread that the dog may tread upon will not hurt him.

, Using something like bird netting, cover the plants that the dog tries to eat to keep him from being able to do so. This netting is easily found at home stores and farm supply stores. You can also use chicken wire or other fencing material to block access to the plants the dog tries to eat.Chicken wire or fencing may also help keep other unwanted animals out of your garden.

Ignore negative whining behavior.,
Only give your dog attention when they’re calm.,
Give your dogs treats for being quiet.,
Greet excited whining with calm.,
Distract them from excitement.,
Build your dog’s confidence.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Whining2," If your dog’s whining is a behavioral issue, training can help address it. The first step is to avoid reinforcing their behavior. Never respond to whining by either scolding or acquiescing to their demands.Communicate the fact that you are ignoring them by calmly but firmly folding your arms and turning away from your dog.Even if your dog is expressing a legitimate need, it’s best to wait to address it until they have stopped whining. Otherwise, you’re teaching them that whining gets results.

, Your pet will figure out that whining does not get them anywhere if you only engage with and attend to them when they’ve stopped whining and settled down.Remember, this includes even negative attention. It’s far more effective to ignore your dog than to yell at them.

, If your dog could use additional reinforcement through training, have them practice being quiet. Each time they start whining, ask them to sit. Once they’ve sat down and stopped whining for at least five seconds, give them a treat.Gradually lengthen the amount of time that your dog has to be quiet before you reward them with a treat.

, While it’s often difficult to hide your enthusiasm for your pet, keeping your “hellos” as short, calm, and understated as you can will help minimize their whining. Resist greeting them with excited exclamations, praise, and affection; your dog will eventually pick up on your tone.Treating your greetings in a mellow, matter-of-fact manner can also help ease any separation anxiety that your dog may feel when you’re away.

, If your pooch is prone to noisy displays of excitement, try distracting them with another task when those situations arise. For instance, if they get excited when visitors arrive, make them sit and wait for a treat while you usher in your guest or give them a favorite toy to play with., If your dog whines out of submission, you can address their behavior by making them feel a bit more dominant. An easy way to do this is through regular one-on-one play sessions.

Switch your dog’s food.,
Treat your dog to steamed veggies.,
Give your dog its own plant.,
Allow your dog occasional chomps of grass.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Grass1," Some dogs may nibble on grass because of a nutritional deficiency.Give your dog a different type of premium food for a week. This may help alleviate its desire to eat grass.Get a premium dog food that is high in fiber. This can ensure your dog is getting all of the necessary vitamins and minerals. The additional fiber may help relieve your dog’s desire for grass by aiding digestion and keeping it regular.Look for the following types of fiber on dog food labels: rice hulls, corns, corn by-products, soybean hulls, beet pulp, bran, peanut-hulls, pectin.Change to your dog’s new food gradually over five days. On the first day, mix 20% of the new food with the old. Increase the amount by 20% each day, until you reach 100% on the fifth day. Follow with one week on the new food.;
, Another way to increase your dog’s fiber intake is giving it steamed vegetables. You can do this as a snack or part of regular meals. Steamed veggies can also be a nice alternative to commercial dog snacks. Consider steaming the following for your dog:


Broccoli
Carrots
Peppers
Green beans
Spinach
Celery
Zucchini
Squash
Sweet potatoes, If your dog really likes eating grass without any ill health, consider giving it a plant. This can help your dog fulfill its natural instinct to munch on greenery and keep it away from grass. The following plants or greens are safe for your dog to eat:Burdock herb
Milk thistle
Peppermint
Astragalus herb
Garlic grass
Rosemary

, Before humans domesticated them, dogs used to hunt their own food and would get dietary needs—including greens—from their prey. Let your dog have a nibble of grass occasionally if the animal seems to enjoy it and it’s not causing any health issues.Recognize that you can train a dog to stop eating grass. However, it may be difficult and cause your dog stress because it is following a natural instinct.

Play with the dog.,
Walk the dog.,
Run your dog.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Your Plants3," Dogs may exhibit unwanted behaviors due to a lack of exercise.If you make it a point to play with your dog regularly to expend his excess energy, he will likely be less interested in eating plants in the yard or in the house. Games that force the dog to move around a lot while you mostly stand still are best. They include fetching, frisbee catching/fetching, chasing a toy on a rope or stick that you move, catching bubbles, and many more.Be sure dogs have access to water during play.
Always keep safety in mind when playing with your dog.

, Walking your dog not only gives him some great exercise, it also stimulates his mind because of unfamiliar sights and sounds you may encounter on the walk. Use an extendable leash that is retractable, giving the dog lots of room to investigate what he encounters. During the walk, try to walk faster than your normal pace for 30 minutes. Older or out-of-shape dogs may need to start with a shorter walk and work up to a faster, longer walk.Pay attention to signs that display rules for walking dogs in public areas.
Be sure to clean up after your dog when when walking.

, For a more significant workout that will expend more of your dog's energy and hopefully discourage him from eating plants, try running your dog. You can run the dog by taking him with you on the leash while you are in-line skating or bicycling.Always be careful when running your dog—he may have to learn to pay close attention to you during the run instead of stopping to smell things or relieve himself. Take regular breaks to allow him to relieve himself.
Younger dogs whose bones are not fully formed may need some time to develop before a run is appropriate.
Enlist the help of a dog trainer for leash training if your dog has trouble getting used to running.

Give the dog a bone—or chew stick.,
Schedule daily playtime.,
Provide toys during “alone” time.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Grass2," Many dogs eat grass because they are bored and need some form of entertainment. Making sure your dog has plenty of bones and/or chew sticks can provide it entertainment that engages the mouth. This may stop your dog from chewing on grass as an alternative.They also help improve a dog’s dental health and can relieve teething pain.Choose a bone or chew toy for your dog made from either natural materials or nylon. You can get natural chewing toys by giving your dog beef bones, rawhide bones, and non-rawhide chews made from vegetables and chicken.
Select nylon chew toys are bone-hard and a great choice if your dog is a power chewer. You may also want to get a dental bone that cleans your dog’s teeth and keeps its mouth occupied.

, Humans originally bred dogs to work. It’s a natural instinct for a dog to want to “work” through play and other stimulating activities. Making sure your dog isn’t a couch potato by scheduling play time every day can also stop it from eating grass.Try and schedule 30-60 minutes of play for the same time every day so your dog knows to anticipate it.The following types of play can stimulate and engage your dog and may prevent nibbling on grass:Running
Walking
Fetching
Catching a Frisbee or ball
Visiting a local dog park
Hunting for dinner

, You may need to go to work or school during the day. This may require leaving your dog at home, which can cause boredom and lack of activity. Making sure your dog has plenty of toys at home can help it beat the boredom and may prevent it from eating grass when you are outside.Your dog may enjoy:


Hard rubber toys for chewing and carrying around
Rope toys
Tennis balls
“Busy box” toys with hiding places for snacks
Soft, stuffed toys
Dirty laundry that smells like you

Know the signs of aggression in dogs.,
Remain calm.,
Create space.,
Pick up your dog.",How to Avoid Vicious Dog Attacks on Your Small Dog1," By noticing signs of aggression in other dogs, you can quickly remove and protect your dog from a potential attack. Aggression in dogs usually begins with warning signs and then culminates into an attack. However, the time between warning signs and an attack can be very quick. For example, it can be as quick as two to three seconds. Here are some signs of aggression in dogs:The dog’s body becomes very still and rigid.
The dog makes threatening sounds, like guttural barks.
The dog begins to snarl, i.e., growl and show teeth.
The dog begins to lunge forward or charge at you and your dog.
The dog tries to make itself look bigger by raising its ears up and forward, by making the fur on its back and tail stand up, and by raising its tail straight in the air.;
, If another dog begins showing signs of aggression toward you and your dog, try not to get anxious, angry, or fearful. Your dog, as well as the aggressive dog, can read your energy. If you become fearful, anxious, or angry, your dog will sense this and become anxious. The other dog will be able to sense your fear or anxiety, as well. Your fear, anger, or anxiety can encourage or provoke the other dog to attack.


Do not yell or scream at the aggressive dog or your dog. Take a couple of deep breaths and tell your dog, “It’s ok,” in a reassuring tone. You can calmly and firmly say, “No,” to your dog, as well as the other dog., Create space between you and your dog, and another person and their dog, by moving across the street to the other sidewalk.If you cannot move across the street, create space by standing in front of your dog. You can also create space by moving into a driveway or a lawn to let the other dog and their owner pass. Or, go behind a car., If an aggressive dog is already lunging or running toward you and your dog, pick up your dog immediately. Do not run the other way, or turn your back. This will prompt the dog to either chase you, or attack your back.


Simply scoop up your dog and remain calm. Put your hands over your dog’s eyes and face. Firmly tell the aggressive dog (without yelling), “No,” “Leave it,” or “Stop.”
Stand your ground. Slowly back away from the dog until the owner has regained control of their dog."

Hire a professional.",How to Stop Your Dog from Begging," Dogs are relatively simple creatures. If they perform a behavior that results in a reward, they will repeat the behavior expecting a reward in the future. If a behavior does not result in a payoff, they will have no reason to repeat it.


Some dogs will just sit and look at you, while others might whine at you until they get what they want. If the dog does not get what it wants, it may even bark at you, paw at you, or climb up on the couch or chair to get closer to you to make its point.
If you feed them or pet the dog when it does these things, you reward the behavior with a treat or pat on the head. A food reward is a very common payoff, but throwing a ball or giving the dog attention is also a form of positive reinforcement.
For some dogs, only one or two payoffs are needed to train a dog to beg. Undoing this training is a matter of removing the reinforcement, challenging though this may be.;
, The most basic and important step in the process of undoing the negative training that has led to begging is to stop feeding the dog from the table.


Most people give in every once in a while and give some scraps to their begging dog, and this reinforces the undesirable behavior.
Refusing to acknowledge your dog when you are eating is crucial to both preventing a begging habit and stopping an existing problem. No matter how much your dog barks, whines, or stares at you when you eat, do not feed it.

, Unless you are giving the dog a command, don’t give your dog attention by talking to it, or even mentioning its name.No matter how frustrated you get, do not yell at a begging dog. Attention of any kind, even such negative attention, can reinforce the begging behavior., Even making eye-contact with your dog is a form of attention, which rewards the behavior you are trying to extinguish.Even the most subtle attention can encourage the begging behavior.

, If you can train your dog to go somewhere else on command, or confine it to another area, this may stop it from begging.


Try putting the dog outside or in another room. The idea is to be out of sight and prevent access to avoid begging. This may not stop the barking or whining, but will at least put some distance between you and the obnoxious behavior.If you don't want to confine your dog, you can train it to just go elsewhere during dinner. If your dog is crate trained, place it in is crate with a dog safe-treat while you are eating.
If you have trained your dog to “crate” or “go to bed,"" give the command so that the dog leaves the immediate area. However, some dogs may still whine or stare at you from afar.
Crate training your dog will require you to give it rewards for going to its area. But, if you feed or reward the dog after begging, it will continue the behavior. So, it's best to practice “crate” or “go to your bed” when dinner is not on the table. Once the dog understands the command and performs it reliably, then you can introduce the added challenge of using it when the distractions are high (e.g at dinner time).
You may need to tether the dog or close its create to keep it in the desired area during dinner., It can be helpful to teach your dog the command “leave it.” This means ""leave whatever it is that you are sniffing alone.""You will need to practice this command on-leash and away from the table.

, If your dog will not voluntarily leave the table or continues to beg from its crate, you may need to give the dog ""time-outs"" in another room.Immediately after the dog begs, place it in a room with no food or toys. The idea is that the room should be a boring place, away from you and your meal. It should not be a place the dog enjoys.After a few minutes, let the dog out. If it begs again, put it back in the time-out room. Before long, the dog will begin to associate getting a time out with the begging behavior.Your dog may whine or bark after being place in time-out. This might seem worse than the begging, but if you stick with the routine and are consistent, you will eventually stop the undesired behavior.

, Make sure everyone in your household is following the same ground rules as you are. Otherwise, the dog will not learn to stop begging.


If even one person in your household gives in and feeds from the table, your effort will be compromised. Your dog will learn quickly which people will or will not give it food.
Help your family members or roommates understand that it is for the dog’s sake that the begging should stop. The dog should have a balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight for a long life, and feeding from the table will compromise those goals.
In addition, begging is a habit that undermines the joy of living with a well behaved house pet.

, If you slip-up even once, that will give your dog motivation to keep begging.


It’s not the end of the world if this happens, but you will need to start again.
Remember that consistency is key with any dog training. “No” means “no” and you need to follow through and not give in to your dog’s wishes.

, Your dog is not deprived, will not starve, and will not hate you for this later.Guilt is a human emotion. Your dog will not hold a grudge against you later for not feeding it table scraps.
You can treat your dog later with something healthy if it makes you feel better. Use the treat to reinforce an old command or to start teaching a new one. Do not give treats that are not earned. That means that the behavior is your idea, not your dog’s.

, Your dog should stop begging within a couple of weeks or so, but you (and everyone in the household) need to remain vigilant.


If there is no pay off, the dog will eventually stop trying, especially if you start administering time outs.

, If your dog is more persistent than you are, you may want to get a professional and reputable dog trainer involved with helping break the habit.


Chances are good that this is not the only bad habit that needs to be broken. Both you and your dog may need to revisit obedience classes to brush up on your commands.
Contact your local animal shelter or dog-boarding business. They may have a training program themselves, but if not, can probably refer you to one.

Stand still and stay calm.,
Do not make eye contact with the dog.,
Tell the dog to go away.,
Back slowly away from the dog.,
“Feed” something to the dog.,
Curl into a ball on the ground.,
Do not pull away from the dog.",How to Stop a Dog Chase from Becoming an Attack," If a dog is chasing you, standing still is probably the last thing you think you should do. You may feel like you’re now an easy target for the dog. However, standing completely still is one of the best things you can do to stop the chase from becoming an attack. Stand with your arms to your sides, like a tree.If you think you’ll be tempted to move your arms if they’re at your sides, fold them across your chest. It’s important not to flail your arms around—this could agitate and excite the dog even more.When you stand, turn your body to the side so you can see the dog from the corner of your eye.;
, As you stand, do not look directly into the dog’s eyes. If you make eye contact, the dog may interpret the stare as a direct threat, increasing the likelihood of an attack.If the dog walks in front of you, try looking downward or to the side.

, A dog intent on attacking wants its target to be stressed and afraid. If you are calm, still, and assertive, the dog will be much less likely to attack you.As you are standing still and staying calm, firmly say ‘Go away!’ to the dog.Do not yell the command, since this could agitate the dog.


Say the command just loudly enough so the dog gets the message that you are not afraid of it.
You can also give the dog regular commands, like sit, down, and stay.If the dog has received obedience training, it may respond to these commands.
Most dogs will turn and leave at this point, once they realize that showing aggression isn’t enough to scare a person off.If the dog does not leave, continue to stand still and avoid eye contact.

, If the dog calms down and doesn’t attack you, breathe a huge sigh of relief! Don’t let your guard down just yet, though. The dog may wait until you turn your back on it to attack you.Back away slowly until the dog is out of your sight., If the dog does not back down and proceeds to attack you, it’s time to go into protective mode. To keep the dog from biting you, give it something else to bite, such as a purse, backpack, or anything else you can quickly throw at the dog. Doing this will distract the dog and put distance between you and the dog.If you’re wearing a long sleeve shirt, try to get your arm out of the sleeve and have the dog bite the sleeve as you take the shirt completely off. While the dog is distracted, back slowly away and get to safety., If you have fallen on the ground during the attack, quickly curl into a tight ball. Cover your ears with your hands and remain still and silent.Curling into this position will protect your face, chest, and throat.These areas could suffer serious damage from dog bites.


The throat has major blood vessels (jugular vein, carotid artery) that could bleed a lot if damaged by a dog bite. The chest contains vital organs, like the heart and lungs.
Curling into a ball mimics playing dead, which will not be threatening to the dog.Most dogs will stop the attack and leave the area once a person has curled into a ball., If you are curled up on the ground and the dog starts biting, you will probably want to pull away. However, pulling away could actually cause more damage, since your skin could tear while you pull away.It will be hard for you to stay still, but do your best to do so.


Stay still until the dog has stopped attacking you.
Yell for help if you can.

"
Reward your dog for desired behaviors.,
Use small training treats and a click trainer.,
Take charge of your dog.,
Use the leash as a tool.,
Pair verbal and non-verbal commands.",How to Walk a Stubborn Dog1," Rather than scold your dog for not doing what you want, reward your dog for doing what you do want. By rewarding good behavior, you’re teaching your dog that they will receive a reward for doing something, and they will begin to positively associate good behavior with going for walks. On the other hand, if you yell at or hit your dog, they will only associate walks with something bad and become even more resistant.Yelling at your dog or physically disciplining them is never going to yield desired results. It will only make them fearful and anxious.;
, Dogs, like people, form associations between behaviors and positive experiences. When you reward your dog for desired behaviors, consider using small training treats and a click trainer. Wait until your dog has performed the behavior you want, such as walking forward, and then quickly, almost in unison, click the trainer and then offer the dog a small training treat. Your dog will associate walking forward with the click sound and treat, and ultimately you will be able to reward with a click sound rather than treat.Use training treats, or break a large, soft treat up into small pieces. Training treats are small and soft by design so that they can be a reward, not be a distraction, and not fill your dog up.
Click trainers are inexpensive and can be found at all pet stores.

, Taking charge simply means establishing that you are the dominant figure in the relationship between you and your dog. You will not take charge by hitting, kicking, yelling, or physically intimidating your dog. By being the person with the treats, the leash, the click trainer, the commands, and the person responsible for feeding and housing the dog, you’re already in the dominant position. When you’re on a walk with your stubborn dog, maintain that power dynamic by calmly giving commands and leading your dog where you’d like it to go.You might get frustrated with your stubborn dog, but that’s no reason to lose your cool. Keep calm and focused, showing your dog that you’re in charge.

, The leash is, for all intents and purposes, an extension of your arm and an invaluable tool. The leash is an effective way for you to communicate what you want your dog to do, while making sure that they don’t leave your side when excited.Put your hand through the leash and also wrap it once around your right hand.
Hold the slack in the leash with your left hand.
Gently pull on the leash if you need to so that you can remind your dog to behave.
Never yank or pull hard on the leash and never hit your dog with the leash.

, Pairing a verbal command with a non-verbal command is the most effective way to tell your dog what you want them to do. When you teach your dog the commands, pair the verbal command with a hand signal and a training treat. Ultimately you will remove the treats and just use the hand signals and verbal commands.You can teach your stubborn dog the “let’s go” command, which indicates that you’re both going to walk forward.
You can also teach the “stop” command, which alerts your dog that they are to stop walking.

Deter your dog with a home scent.,
Plant borders on the grass.,
Reprimand your dog.,
Train your dog to not eat grass.,
Visit your vet.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Grass3," Some scents, such as coffee or spices, repel a dog from approaching and eating grass. Spray or spread readily available scents you have in your home to keep the dog from eating grass.Sprinkle black or cayenne pepper or chili powder around the edges of your lawn. You can also mix these in a bottle with water and spray it around the yard. Make sure to use only a moderate amount of each as sniffing these scents can cause your dog’s nose to become inflamed.
Dry coffee grounds, which have a strong and bitter scent dogs don’t like, in your oven for 20 minutes at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius). Then flip the grounds over and bake for another 20 minutes.Spread dried grounds loosely on the grass and around the edges of your lawn. You’ll need about one cup (237ml) of grounds for each 40 square feet (3.75 square meters) of lawn you’d like to treat. Spray a mixture of equal parts lemon juice and vinegar around the yard. These scents will deter your dog from crossing on to the lawn. Avoid spraying directly on the grass, as the vinegar may harm your lawn.

, Certain plants have a scent that repels dogs. Creating borders around your grass with these plants can keep your dog away from the lawn. The following plants may deter your dog from eating grass:Coleus canina
Marigold or calendula
Lemongrass
Citrus trees
HolliesEvergreen huckleberry
Succulents such as aloe

, Despite your best efforts, your canine companion may still chew on grass. Some owners physically punish their dogs to stop undesirable behaviors. This does little to deter the behavior and can make your dog fear you.Using a firm, “No!,” can teach your dog to stop eating grass. If your dog is on a leash, you can gently pull on it while saying, “No!”Stay consistent with your reprimanding. Dogs eventually learn that “No!” means you don’t like the behavior.

, Although sometimes difficult, you can train your dog to not eat grass. The safest and kindest way to do this is using a spray bottle. Whenever you go outside with your dog, carry a spray bottle filled with cool and clean water. If your dog puts its mouth near the grass, reprimand it with a firm ""No!"" followed by a spray in the face with the water. Avoid filling the spray bottle with hot water or other liquids. These could get sting your dog’s eyes or hurt it.

, If your dog continues to eat grass despite your best attempts, schedule an appointment with your vet. The vet can examine your dog for underlying physical and mental conditions. The doctor may also suggest an animal behavioral specialist or dog trainer who can help stop your dog from eating grass.

Be aware of off-leash dogs.,
Carry a stick with you.,
Carry other protective devices.",How to Avoid Vicious Dog Attacks on Your Small Dog2," If an off-leash dog begins to approach your dog, command the dog to “Sit,” “Leave,” or “Go home.” To further you message, raise your hand in a “stop” signal, and reinforce it with “No.” If you have doggie treats, put out some treats to distract the approaching dog. If the dog falls for the bait, keep moving past it.Try to create as much distance as you can between your dog, and the off-leash dog. If the dog keeps following you, head home.

, There are times when avoidance tactics just don’t work. To prepare for these situations, carry a stick with you. Carry a stick that is at least an inch in diameter and two feet long, like a walking stick, cane, twirler’s baton, or PVC pipe. The point is to make the stick an obstacle the aggressive dog has to overcome, not a weapon.When an aggressive dog approaches, point the stick at the dogs nose. If the dog stops advancing, take small steps toward it while still pointing the stick at the dog’s nose. If the dog backs up, take another small step. Repeat this until the dog backs down.If the dog does not back down, keep the stick pointed at its nose. Do not swing the stick because it leaves you open for attack, and you could hurt the dog. The point is to have the dog grab the stick with its mouth so that its mouth is preoccupied. Once the dog grabs the stick, do not pull back. Wait for the dog to pull, and when it does, take a step forward. This will push the stick into the dog’s mouth, but be careful not to hurt the dog. Repeat this until the dog backs down.

, Other devices that will help deter aggressive dogs are air horns, rape alarms, and umbrellas. The loud sound produced by an air horn or a rape alarm will startle an approaching dog, and hopefully deter it from advancing. On the other hand, an umbrella is useful in either frightening the dog, or creating a barrier. When a dog is approaching, open the umbrella in front of the dog."
"
Teach your dog indifference.,
Know how to calm your dog.,
Keep greetings short and sweet.",How to Avoid Vicious Dog Attacks on Your Small Dog3," Train your dog to avoid other dogs, unless you say it is ok to initiate interaction. Teaching your dog how to be indifferent to another dog, especially if it is aggressive, will decrease the chances of an aggressive interaction.


When encountering another dog and its owner, keep your eyes forward, and do not look at the other owner or their dog. Keep walking at a natural pace. Reward your dog with a treat if they show indifference to the other dog.If your dog begins staring, obsessing, or interacting with the other dog without your permission, tell your dog to “Sit” and refocus its attention on you. Once your dog sits and the other dog has passed along. Give your dog a treat for obeying.

, Training your dog to sit, stay, and get up when told is an effective way to calm and reassure your dog. At home, practice telling your dog to sit. Every time he sits, give him a reward, like a treat. Also, practice telling him commands like “Yes” or “Ok,” so it knows that your are the final authority on when to get up.Training your dog reassures your dog that, if it encounters a negative situation, you will handle it for him. This prevents your dog from feeling like it needs to defend itself. If your dog feels as if you cannot protect it, any sign of aggression from another dog will provoke aggression in your dog.

, Prevent your dog from getting overexcited at the sight of another dog by keeping greetings between your dog and other dogs brief and positive. While your dog is saying, ""Hello,"" to another dog, keep the interaction brief by positively interrupting your dog to refocus its attention on you.Once your dog has met a dog, interrupt it and regain your dog’s focus for a few seconds. A positive, interruptive command could be something like, “Hey, hey” or “Come on.” Gently tug your dog’s leash to move him away. Reward your dog’s good behavior.

"
"
Consider that your dog may be in pain.,
Have your dog evaluated for dementia.,
Treat your dog for anxiety.",How to Walk a Stubborn Dog2," Your dog may be resisting going for walks, but it might not be because they’re stubborn, but because they are in pain. If your dog has gradually or even suddenly decided it is no longer interested in walks, this change in behavior could be a good indicator that they’re hurting. Get your dog to the veterinarian for an examination.


Your dog could have arthritis, which is a painful condition involving the joints.
Your dog may have sustained an injury, such as to the pad of their foot or to a muscle or tendon.

, Dogs, like people, can develop diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and dementia, that impact how they sense the world around them. If your dog becomes fearful of going for walks or their behavior changes, take your dog to a veterinarian for evaluation.These are progressive diseases, and your vet will discuss any and all viable treatment options.
Even if you are only able to tell your vet that your dog seems “off” or “different”, with a few examples, may be enough to help them determine if your dog likely has dementia or not.

, Some dogs have anxiety, and if your dog is one that does, your dog may appear stubborn when you try to take it for a walk. Because dogs can’t articulate themselves verbally, it might be difficult to distinguish between anxiety and stubborn behavior. Take your dog to the vet and explain the behavior changes. Your vet may prescribe anti-anxiety medications that should help your dog be more comfortable going for walks.Some signs of anxiety in dogs include panting, curling their tail between their legs, drooling, crouching low to the ground, and hiding.

"
"
Take a new route.,
Go to a new location.,
Use reverse psychology.,
Desensitize your dog.",How to Walk a Stubborn Dog3," Just like people, dogs can get bored easily. Your dog may be acting stubborn on walks because it is bored. Take a different route on your walk, or go to another park or neighborhood altogether for your walk. Even walking the same neighborhood but in a different pattern may be enough to make the trip exciting again for your pup.Try taking the route that you normally take but in reverse, if possible.

, Another way to mentally stimulate your dog is to take it to a new place for a run or walk. Introducing your dog to new sights, sounds, and smells stimulates your dog mentally and physically, and should make them eager for that walk that they’ve been resisting.Check if your county or city has a dog park.
There might also be a state or national park nearby that allows dogs.
Even if you take your dog to a designated off-leash area, make sure that you have a leash on hand at all times.

, Your dog may expect that they know exactly how this is all going to happen: you’re going to put the leash on them, you’re going to start walking, and you’re going to take that same boring route that you always take. Instead, give your dog the stay command and make them hold the position. Then, tell your dog to go, rewarding them for moving. This simple “reboot” in your walking routine might be just the trick to getting your dog to walk without issues.You will need to decide early on what commands you’ll use with your dog, including what you’ll use for “stay” and “go.”

, Your dog may be a stubborn walker because they fear some part of the experience, be it the leash, passing cars, or simply walking around outside their home. Desensitization is a lengthy process in which you introduce your dog to graduating levels of the stimuli that they fear. The idea is that as they become comfortable with a low level of the stimuli, you add a bit more until they are again comfortable. Desensitizing your dog may be the key to your dog becoming happy to go on walks.Desensitization takes a lot of patience. Don’t expect results overnight and don’t lose your cool if your dog doesn’t respond right away.
Make sure that you don’t overwhelm your dog and that you introduce small, graduating levels of the stimulus.
For example, if your dog is uncomfortable with unfamiliar people, invite someone to come over to your house and sit in the yard, maybe in a chair while reading a book.
Keep your dog on leash away from the person and allow them to smell the air. As they get comfortable, take a step toward the person, moving slightly closer every time your dog appears comfortable.
Ultimately, your dog should be close enough that you can introduce your friend to the dog without a fear response from your pup.
Don’t force your dog to approach the person. You follow their lead, not the other way around.

Keep medications secured.,
Store household products in a separate, locked area.,
Beware of pest-control products.",How to Keep Your Dog from Being Exposed to Household Poisons1," Make sure to secure all medications in a medicine cabinet or high cupboard. This should include anything from prescription pills to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs. Even a small dose of medication could cause symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, stomach and intestinal ulcers, kidney failure, or cardiac distress. To prevent any accidents (e.g. your dog jumping to eat a pill you drop on the ground before you can stop it), take your medications when your dog is out of the room and be sure to close pill containers firmly after use.;
, Household products with harsh chemicals should be kept as far as possible from your dog, preferably in a room it does not frequently enter (e.g. the garage or laundry room). Make sure that these products are placed in a closed closet or cupboard, and that they are firmly sealed so that they do not leak or spread. Products to be especially vigilant about are:Paint thinner
Anti-freeze
Bleach and other cleaners
Pool chemicals
Fertilizers

, Keep pest-control products like rat poison and insecticide away from your dog, as both can be toxic to it. If possible, avoid using these products inside your home. Instead, opt to use glue traps in areas that your dog can’t reach, or other methods such as live traps.If you do use pest-control poisons, place them only in rooms closed off to your dog (e.g. by means of a baby gate or locked door) and store them securely with other harmful household chemicals.

Reward your dog coming back to you.",How to Train Your Dog to Not Run Away," Just like people, dogs tend to form lifelong behaviors when they’re young. You may have a difficult time training a very young puppy, but it’s always good to try. If you’ve adopted an older dog, you can still retrain him, but it may prove more difficult.;
, Choose treats that your dog will enjoy, but that are still healthy. You should always use treats designed for dogs, rather than small pieces of your own food. Hold the treats in your pocket or a small bag, so that they are out of sight.Choose a treat that he only gets when you practice training. If he gets the same treat at other times, it will be harder to get him to associate the treat with the desired behavior.
You can break treats up into smaller pieces and your dog will still be just as excited about them.

, Use a simple, verbal command, such as, “Come.” You can also use your dog’s name, as in, “Rover, come.” Say the command firmly once. Wait to see if he responds. If he doesn’t, repeat the command in the same tone.Limit distractions in the room such as other people or TV.
Make sure there are no exits for your dog to escape through. This will limit the options of where he can go if he’s confused.

, If your dog comes to you, he’s done a very good thing. Praise him and pet him to let him know that you appreciate this behavior. Immediately give him a treat so that he’ll remember that he was rewarded for following directions.Pet your dog and speak to him lovingly when you give the treat. This is another way of rewarding him.

, Once you’ve given your dog a treat and praised him, the task is over. You can now walk away from your dog. He will probably follow you, especially since you just praised him. Continue to walk around until he gets bored or distracted and stops following you.Stay inside, or in an enclosed space. Don’t give your dog the chance to run away.
If your dog takes too long to leave you alone, you can begin another activity on your own, like cooking a meal or doing some chores. Once the dog sees that you’re distracted, he’ll likely get bored himself.

, Once your dog has left you alone, try calling him again. Use the exact same command and tone that you did the first time.Your dog will probably be farther away now, so you may need to call louder or repeat the command multiple times.Resist the temptation to move close to your dog. Your dog may think this is a game, or he may begin to assume that you will always come to him.

, Practice this command several times a day until your dog will predictably come when called. Be consistent. Make the time to practice every single day. Repetition is what will train your dog to come on command.


Just like people, dogs have limited attention spans. If you notice your dog getting bored or antsy, stop for the day. You can practice again tomorrow.

, Once your dog reliably comes on command, start to practice in larger spaces. This can mean a larger house, or an enclosed dog run or dog park.Scale up slowly. Don’t immediately move from your bedroom to a dog park.

, This step can be the most difficult for a dog, especially for dogs bred to hunt. Distractions can be other people, other animals, or ambient sounds. When your dog is left to roam free in your yard there will be plenty of distractions, so this is an important step for him to master.When using other people as a distraction start with people the dog knows. This will be less jarring for the dog than introducing a stranger.
Small animals may be birds or squirrels in your yard. These wild animals can generally keep themselves safe from dogs. Don’t purposefully put a small animal (like a kitten or gerbil) in danger by introducing it to a dog.

, “Stay” is the most common command for getting a dog to stay still. However, it’s more powerful when combined with a hand signal. An easy hand signal to remember is putting out your hand as though you’re telling someone to stop. Practice saying the command and doing the hand signal at the same time.
Use a firm, clear tone of voice. Make your signal one clean motion.

, Act natural, as though you’re about to leave the house. Do anything you would normally do, such as grabbing your keys or hat. Don’t speak to or look at your dog as you go., Even if you’re not looking at him, you’ll likely hear him trailing behind you. As soon as you notice that he is following you, stop and turn to him. Use the same verbal command and hand signal to tell him to stay.Resist the urge to pet your dog to comfort him at this point. This will encourage him to follow you more.
Use the command and hand signal only once and then turn to go again.

, It may get tedious but continue to turn and repeat the command until your dog stays. You should be able to get all the way to the door without your dog moving from their “stay” position., Once your dog can reliably stay until you get to the door, practice opening the door. You should be able to open the door slowly and step through it without your dog moving.Be careful when opening the door. Your dog may still get excited and try to run for it.
When your dog can reliably stay, you should be able to open the door for several seconds without him running outside.

, Once you’ve gone out the door and your dog has successfully stayed put, come back inside and give him a treat. You should also pet him and praise him so that he knows how good he’s been.Don’t give the treats and praise until you’re able to get all the way out the door without him following you.
Keep treats hidden until you decide to give them, otherwise they can be a distraction.

, Now that your dog can reliably stay when you head for the door, you can practice outside. Begin in an enclosed area, such as a fenced yard or dog run. Use the same verbal command and hand signal that you used inside.


Your dog may get distracted by animals and other people outside. This creates a challenge in getting him to stay. You may need extra practice for him to master it.
Try walking away from your dog once you've told him to stay. He should be able to do this outside as well as inside.
Practice in increasingly larger spaces. Eventually, your dog should be able to stay in an open yard without running off.

, Many dogs run away because they think they need to get home. If you’ve moved recently, your dog may not understand that your new home is his new home.Whenever your dog will be spending time in a new place, give him time to explore and become familiar with the smells and sounds.

, A common reason dogs run off is to find a mate. This is especially true of unneutered male dogs. Having your pet spayed or neutered will help prevent this urge.Spaying and neutering also helps prevent unwanted puppies from becoming strays and crowding shelters.

, Dogs are social animals. They need stimulation and interaction or they’ll become bored. Make sure your dog has plenty of social time with you, other dogs, or other people.If you work long hours, consider hiring a dog walker or pet sitter to engage your dog during the day.
Not all dogs will get along with others. Always introduce dogs while they’re on a leash to prevent dangerous fighting.

, Sometimes, dogs run off simply because they want to run. Make sure your dog gets plenty of walks and time outside. This way, he won’t need to run away just to get exercise.Different breeds need different amounts of exercise. For example, a pug may only be able to walk briskly for 20 or 30 minutes before needing a break. A husky is bred to run great distances. Find out what’s healthy for your particular breed.
Exercise can include going for walks, chasing a ball or a frisbee, or running around a dog park with other dogs.

, Make sure your dog knows that coming back is good behavior. When he comes back, praise him and give him a treat. This reward will teach him that coming back can feel as good as running away.Never scold a dog when he returns to you, even if it took him a long time. This teaches the dog that he’ll be punished for coming back.
Don’t only call him back when the fun is over. For example, if you’re at the park, call him back for a moment before letting him continue to play. If you always call him right before going home, he’ll learn that coming back means that playtime is over.

Keep your dog happy and entertained.",How to Train Your Dog from Running out of Your House," If you walk into a room and your dog sits, then your job is half done. Reward your dog when it sits, even if you don’t issue the command to sit. Give your dog a treat when it sits in front of you., After a few days of rewarding the dog for sitting naturally, begin issuing the “sit” command before giving a treat. Get on the dog’s level and hold a doggie treat enclosed in your hand a few inches from his nose. Bring it up and toward him slowly. Your dog will lower itself back onto its butt. When its butt hits the floor, reward your dog with a treat., A clicker is a small device which makes a clicking sound when pressed. Produce a clicker sound at the same time you tell your dog to “sit.” The dog will, in time, learn to associate the clicker sound with the behavior of sitting, and the reward he receives.


If your dog has already been trained with the clicker to engage in a different behavior, you might confuse the dog if you try to retrain it to sit instead of engage in its original behavior.

, If the door is open, or about to be opened, getting your dog to remain seated can be a challenge. Incorporate an open-door phase into your training sessions. Teach your dog to stay seated as you back away towards the door.Put your dog far away from (but within eyesight of) the door. If your dog starts moving after being seated, put your hand up and say sharply “Stop!” Re-seat your dog in its original spot and repeat the exercise.
If your dog has difficulty remaining seated, get a friend to help your dog stay seated while you can open and close the door.
When your dog is able to remain seated despite you opening and closing the door, give it a treat (even if it took help to keep him stationary). Get in the habit of giving your dog a treat each time it is able to remain seated when the door opens.
To prevent your dog from running out when you come home, repeat this exercise but enlist aid from a helper who opens the door from the outside. This way, your dog will know to stay seated when you come in.

, Practice for 10-15 minutes in at least three different sessions each day for about two weeks. Different dogs learn at different rates. Do not be discouraged if your dog seems to be slow to learn how sitting works. On the other hand, do not be quick to assume that your dog has mastered sitting just because in one session he or she seemed to sit with every command during that session. Stick with it and stay positive. Your dog will eventually learn to sit.

, If your dog loses interest during the training session, your training may have gone on for too long. Let your dog go out before you begin the training so that he won’t have to relieve himself during the training.


Do not train your dog in the presence of guests or other distractions.
Issue the command to sit every time you or someone in the house opens the door.
Give your dog a treat when it sits.
Even after training, keep an eye on your dog. Sometimes the excitement of an open door or a new person can inspire him or her to dash outside. When entering your home, open the door slowly and come in quickly, staying alert for potential dog movement.

, For instance, if your house has a small anteroom between the house and the door that leads outside, keep your dog out of it. Alternately, if the dog tends to bolt through certain doors, keep your dog out of the room with that door. Using baby gates (low gates meant to keep babies from crawling about the house) are useful for keep smaller dogs out of certain zones. Finally, if all else fails, enclose your dog in a room before you go in or out of the house.Keep the room stocked with toys, chew bones, and a comfy dog bed to keep doggie happy.

, Attach a long dragline -- a lightweight leash -- to your dog’s collar. Let your dog get used to it and drag it behind them while wandering around the house. If your dog runs out the door when you open it, quickly close the door while part of the dragline passes through the door, catching it between the door and the jamb. This way, your dog will be stuck outside but immobilized. Wait 30 seconds, then grab the portion of the leash on your side of the door before opening it. When your dog comes back to the house, praise it effusively.When your dog continues to run outside, increase the time it spends outside by 30 seconds. For instance, the second time it runs out, catch its leash in the door again and wait 60 seconds before bringing it back in. Wait 90 seconds on the third escape attempt, and so on.
Be careful not to catch your dog’s tail in the door when closing it during the escape.
If you are coordinated and quick enough, you can simply step on the length of leash dragging behind your dog instead of closing the door on it as your dog exits.

, If your dog does run out of your house, the best way to prevent a full-on escape is to fence your yard. This is often only a viable choice for the backyard, though small front yards can be easily enclosed with tasteful white picket fences. Install a smaller fence for a small dog and a higher fence for a big dog. Note that big dogs can jump very high, so twice the size may not be enough.

, Pet barriers are small devices which emit noise when your dog approaches. Triggered by a wireless device attached to the dog’s collar, the barrier will scare your dog away from the door. If your dog remains undeterred from approaching the door, he or she will receive a small static shock from the collar intended to keep them inside. The shock is harmless and in time, your dog will avoid approaching the door altogether.


Pet-proof sprays serve a similar purpose, though they have a different design. Spray cans are battery-operated and should be placed near the door you do not want your dog to run out of. Switch the spray can on. When your doggie approaches the door, the device will emit a harmless spray whenever your pet approaches the door. Be sure to turn the device off when you’re not expecting to open the door through which the dog might disappear.Both pet sprays and barriers can prevent your dog from bolting when you or someone else is coming into the house. Set the spray or barrier before you exit the house so that when you come back, your dog will not run past you and escape.

, Tie its leash to a solid object so that the dog will not escape. Tying the leash to the arm of a sofa or the base of a heavy dining table are good choices. You could also, of course, hold the leash in your hand when someone comes in or goes out. In time, your dog will come to understand that it cannot dash outside when a door opens.Tethering your dog should be a last resort since it can be dangerous or detrimental for your dog.
Try to avoid tethering your dog when you go out of the house for long periods. Your dog should be able to move about, access its food and water, and play with its toys when alone in the house.Do not tether your dog near stairs. If your dog tries to jump down the stairs it could hang itself.

, In their attempts to mate, they will make a run for the door, and from there to a dog of the opposite sex. This motive is especially powerful in male dogs. Talk to your vet about neutering or spaying your pet. The procedure is very safe and relatively inexpensive.

, Tired dogs are less likely to want to escape the house. Make sure you exercise your dog every day. You can either give your dog free reign for fifteen to twenty minutes in the backyard or take your doggie for a walk. If your dogs likes to play fetch or catch the Frisbee in an enclosed area, that provides a good source of exercise as well. Dogs of all sizes and breeds should spend some time outside each day, weather permitting.

, Bored dogs may be driven outside in a search for amusement. Keep your dog engaged and content by playing lots of games with it, teaching it tricks, and generally paying attention to your dog. Let your doggie know it is loved and cared for. When you come home, give it a hug and pat it on the head. Rub its belly if it rolls over for you. Set aside time in your schedule for you and your dog to bond."

Prevent your dog’s access to the garbage can.,
Make the garbage can undesirable.,
Keep your dog full.,
Provide your dog with physical and mental exercise.",How to Teach Your Dog Not to Get Into Garbage Cans1," There are many ways that you can keep your dog from getting to the garbage can. For example, you can keep the kitchen garbage can in a closed cupboard. However, if your dog has figured out a way to open cupboards, you may need to put childproof latches on the handles.In other rooms of the house, you could try putting small wastebaskets at a height where your dog could not reach them,such as the top of a dresser.
You could also restrict his access to entire rooms that have garbage can or wastebaskets by closing doors or using baby gates.Consider using a garbage can with a lid that your dog cannot open.garbage cans with a step mechanism to open the lid would not be good, since your dog could figure out how to use the step. Look at garbage cans from your dog’s perspective to determine which types would be easy or difficult for him to get into.;
, A common way to correct bad behavior is to make that behavior undesirable. Environmental punishment is a way to discourage bad behavior. There are commercially available deterrent devices that you can set up near the garbage can to keep your dog away from it. One device is a mousetrap-like device that will loudly pop up into the air when your dog steps on it.You can also place a motion-activated device near your garbage can that will blow a shot of compressed air when your dog approaches the garbage can.There is also a type of mat that delivers a small shock when your dog steps on it.Environmental punishment is most effective for dogs who have learned to sneak into the trash when their owners are not around.Although environmental punishment does not cause physical injury, it should not be used with dogs who are naturally skittish or anxious. If your dog is skittish, the sudden shock, blast of air, or loud popping noise may make him even more fearful., Your dog may want to sift through the trash because he is hungry. Feeding him several small meals a day can help keep him full to the point where he won’t feel the need to scavenge for extra food. If your dog is on a diet to lose weight, consider talking with your veterinarian to come up with a feeding schedule that will keep him full but will not cause him to gain weight.If you are away for most of the day and cannot be there to feed him, restricting his access to the garbage can may be easier for you.
Be aware that some dogs are not good at knowing when they are full and never stop eating. Don't attempt to feed these dogs until they stop eating or they will become obese.

, Even if your dog feels full, he may be tempted to get into the garbage can because he is bored.From your dog’s perspective, the different scents in your garbage can could keep him happily occupied. To keep him from getting bored, make sure that you give him plenty of exercise by taking him on walks and playing with him. If he is well trained, you could also take him to a dog park to let him run around and interact with other dogs.


Giving him toys to play with can keep him busy when you are not home."

Write a list of dangerous foods.,
Talk to kids about the dangers of “never” foods.,
Use locking containers to store dangerous foods.,
Store dangerous foods in the fridge or high cupboards.,
Keep your dog out of the trash.",How to Keep Your Dog from Being Exposed to Household Poisons2," Many everyday foods that we eat can be harmful, and even lethal, to dogs. Make a comprehensive list of “never” foods and hang it on a wall or on the refrigerator, so that the entire family knows to keep them away from the dog. These foods include:Chocolate
Alcohol, which can be life-threatening even in small amounts.
Artificial sweeteners (e.g. xylitol)
Grapes and raisins
Macadamia nuts
Onions and garlic

, Kids, especially very young ones, will think little of sharing their favorite snack with the family pet, so it is important to talk to them honestly about the dangers involved. Make sure that children understand the difference between human food and dog food. Convey the consequences of feeding your dog the wrong foods gently but firmly.For instance, say something like, “We can’t feed the dog chocolate because it will get very, very sick if it eats it”, and prompt your child to repeat it back to you (e.g. “Can you tell me why we aren’t going to feed Rover chocolate?”).

, Any foods that can be dangerous to dogs should be kept in locking containers that they cannot open. Most store packaging can be chewed through easily if your pet gains access to it. Tupperware with airtight seals and snap-lock latches can be purchased at department stores, or online., To make sure your dog can’t get to foods that are toxic to it, store them in the fridge or in a high cupboard. This will remove the opportunity and temptation for your dog to eat them, and provide peace of mind when you leave the house. To make things easier, clearly label all containers., Make sure that your dog can’t gain access to the trash by purchasing a dog-proof trash container from a hardware store. Common trash items like food scraps, fruits pits, or chicken bones can be both inviting and toxic to your dog. Look for a model with a tight-locking and a sturdy enough base to prevent your dog from knocking it over.Look for a garbage container that is also charcoal lined, to prevent the temptation of food smells.

Hold a treat in a closed fist.,
Teach your dog to look at you to get the treat.,
Place a treat on the floor.,
Say ‘Leave it’ when your dog approaches the garbage can.",How to Teach Your Dog Not to Get Into Garbage Cans2," The ‘leave it’ command teaches your dog to walk away from the garbage can. With the treat in your closed fist, your dog will probably sniff and paw at your hand, and might even bark or whine to get the treat. When he has lost interest in getting the treat—probably after a minute or two— open your fist, immediately say ‘yes,’ and give him the treat.Every three to four times that you practice this, hold your fist open, say ‘yes,’ and give him the treat. You want to teach him that he needs to walk away only when you say ‘leave it.’Keep practicing this until your dog knows to leave the treat alone when you say ‘leave it.’, Hold a treat in your closed fist and say ‘leave it.’ Rather than paw at your hand, your dog will likely look up to you expectantly to wait for you to say ‘yes.’ As soon as he looks up at you, open your fist, immediately say ‘yes,’ and give him the treat. You may need to practice this many times before your dog learns that direct eye contact with you is necessary to earn his treat when you say ‘leave it.’Looking at you also redirects his attention from whatever he may have been tempted to eat.

, Choose a different type of treat to place on the floor—it should be one that he likes, but not as much as his favorite treat. The treat on the floor will be the ‘bait.’ When you place the bait on the floor, say ‘leave it’ and closely cover the bait with your hand. Hold his favorite treat in your other hand. When your dog eventually loses interest in getting the bait under your hand, pick the bait up off the floor, immediately say ‘yes,’ and give him his favorite treat.Make sure that he does not eat the bait. If he manages to get to the bait, show him the tastier treat that he could have gotten if he hadn’t eaten the bait.Challenge him by holding your hand up to six inches above the bait.This will test his ability to leave the bait on the floor even when it is in clear sight and easily attainable.
Repeat this until he resists the temptation to eat the bait, and instead chooses to look up at you and wait for you to say ‘yes.’, When your dog walks near the garbage can, say ‘leave it.’ By this point in his training, your dog should know to look at you for a reward rather than reach for something that he is not supposed to (in this case, whatever is in the garbage can). Reward him with a treat each time that he turns away from the garbage can and looks at you."
"
Clap your hands and say ‘off.’ If you catch your dog in the act of sifting through the garbage can, clap your hands and authoritatively say ‘off’ at the same time.,
Say ‘off’ without clapping your hands.,
Place a smelly food on top of the garbage can.",How to Teach Your Dog Not to Get Into Garbage Cans3," Then, gently take him by the collar and move him from the garbage can. It is important to say ‘off’ when you see him going through the garbage can. If you do it after the fact, such as when you see him munching on food that he got from the garbage can, he will be confused as to why you are punishing him. That confusion may lead him to become fearful of you and your punishment.It may take several repetitions of you saying ‘off’ and clapping your hands before your dog learns not to dig through the garbage can.

, An alternative way of giving this command is to say ‘off’ and then call him to you. Reward him with a treat when he comes to you.You can think of this as discouraging the bad behavior by distracting him with something more rewarding.


You may need to repeat this several times when you see him approaching the garbage can. Eventually, he will learn that walking away from the garbage can is more rewarding than walking towards it.

, If you know what type of food he typically likes to scrounge for in the trash, place that food on top of the garbage can. Say ‘off’ and reward him when he comes to you. After several (or many) repetitions, your dog should eventually learn that he should walk from the garbage can, even when something very desirable is in it."

Try talking to your pet.",How to Teach Your Pet Not to be Scared of the Vacuum Cleaner1," When the vacuum cleaner is not in use, place it where your pet can easily see it. Being around the vacuum while it is not making noise should help your pet view the cleaner as something other than a threat., Make sure the vacuum is as close to the ground as possible. Adjust the upright section of the vacuum so that it is lying on the ground or is as close to the ground as possible. Reducing the overall height of the vacuum may make it seem less imposing to a pet.

, Move the cleaner to where the pet is sitting while it is turned off and allow the animal to look at and smell it. Pets go by scent as well as sight. Once they get used to seeing and smelling the vacuum, they should naturally be less afraid.Never place the vacuum cleaner where your animal likes to sleep or eat. This might only work to make them afraid of those areas, causing further problems.
If you have a cat that you are trying to acclimate to a vacuum, never place the vacuum by its litter box., Try placing a towel or sheet the animal uses on the vacuum cleaner while it is turned off. Your pet may want to get closer to the vacuum because it smells familiar or because it has something the animal wants on top of it., When the vacuum is lying on the ground in the off position, try placing a treat on top of it and see whether or not your pet tries to retrieve the treat. Animals will become much more steadfast in their resolve when a treat is involved., Animals can be quite territorial when it comes to their favorite toys. Take a toy you know your pet loves and place on the vacuum cleaner while it is off. Over time, the animal may come to associate the vacuum cleaner with one of its play things., Now that your pet has had the chance to investigate the vacuum while off, try turning the vacuum on. Your pet will probably run away because of the noise, but it might keep looking at the vacuum from a distance, showing more curiosity than fear., While the vacuum is on and making noise, leave it in one place. If it is not moving, but still making noise, your pet may choose to be brave and approach the vacuum. At the very least, it may get a little bit closer, signaling a minor victory.Be sure to reward your pet for any attempts to get close to the vacuum with treats or toys., Try to vacuum at a distance from the animal. Do not go too close while they watch you. After a while, they might be braver and actually follow you around as you vacuum., When you finish vacuuming the desired area, turn the vacuum off and offer your pet a treat, toy or reward. If your dog loves going for walks, take him out for a walk immediately after vacuuming. If your cat likes wet food, give it a can when you have finished vacuuming. If you do this consistently, the animal will come to associate the vacuum with activities it enjoys., Talking to your pet in a calm voice while vacuuming may help it realize that the vacuum is not something to be feared. Animals take verbal and non-verbal cues from their humans. Try calling the pet over to you with a friendly and calm demeanor while the vacuum is running. Its eagerness to follow your commands may be enough to help your pet overcome its fear.

Consult a veterinarian about behavioral changes.,
Commit to a good sleep schedule.,
Respond to a dog's frequent urination.,
Spend more time exercising your dog.,
Alter your dog's feeding schedule.,
Reduce your dog's stimulation.",How to Stop Your Dog from Waking You Up at Night1," If your dog is waking you up more than it used to, a medical problem could be affecting its sleep or stress levels. Visiting a vet is an excellent first step so you can rule out this possibility, or catch problems early. Even if your pet is not sick, a vet can help you pinpoint the cause.Any significant change in behavior or sleep schedule could be a sign of a medical problem. Difficulty eating or eliminating could point to gastric distress that keeps your dog awake.If the dog wakes you up to beg for food in the night, it may be experiencing increased hunger due to diabetes or another metabolic disorder.;
, A regular, predictable sleep pattern makes it easier for your dog to adapt. Do your best to go to sleep at the same time every night, and wake up at the same time every morning.


While doggy sleep patterns are different than that of humans – they sleep up to twenty hours a day and sleep for shorter amounts of time – your dog will get used to your sleep schedule over time., If your dog wakes you up in the night to go outside, they may have a medical problem such as a urinary tract infection or Cushing's disorder. A vet can diagnose your pet and prescribe medication to treat this problem.If your vet rules these out, your dog may have a weak bladder due to old age. You can make you and your dog more comfortable by providing a pee pad.


A dog door is another solution if you have an enclosed yard and are not concerned about dangerous wildlife.

, A great way to reduce the likelihood that your dog will wake you up is to tire them out before you go to sleep. You can do this by increasing the amount of time you and your dog exercise together. In the end, a sleeping dog won't be able to wake you up.


Go on a walk around the block with your dog.
Play Frisbee or fetch with your dog.
Allow your dog to run around your back yard or in a dog park., You can also decrease the chance of your dog waking you up by changing your dog's food schedule. Ultimately, your dog might be waking you up because they're hungry or are still active because they ate really late.


If you think your dog is waking you because they're hungry, push back dinner time an hour or two. This way, your pup's belly will be fuller for a longer time.
If you think your dog is waking you because they're hyper from the last meal, move dinner up a little bit. Feeding your dog at 6PM might work more than feeding them at 8PM., Another reason your dog might be waking you is because they're still awake, energetic, or are just overstimulated. This can be remedied through a number of ways:


Don't play with your dog for a couple of hours before bed.
Don't leave toys around your dog's sleeping area.
Turn off your TV or any music before bedtime."

Determine if your dog escapes due to fear.,
See if your dog is looking for a mate.,
Look for signs of separation anxiety.,
Make your yard exciting.",How to Stop Your Dog from Running Out of the Backyard1," Your dog may be trying to escape from something that is scaring him. This will usually be in response to something noisy, like a loud car or construction. It may also be something visual, like a bright light or a person walking by the yard. If you identify the thing responsible for your dog's fear, and it is possible to do so, remove it.
Try to limit exposure to the event that causes a fear based escape. For instance, bring your dog inside if a loud bell or siren scares him.
Watch your dog to see where he likes to hide when scared. Try to create a similar “safe space” for him in the yard and in the house.
Try desensitizing your dog to the fear stimulus. Starting small and gradually increasing exposure to the stimulus over time can result in the loss of fear to that stimulus. Talk with your veterinarian or local dog trainer to learn more.;
, At around six months old, dogs will begin to look for mates. This drive can be quite powerful. Male dogs are more likely to try to escape if they smell a bitch in heat. Unfortunately for the owner of the male dog, they are able to detect the pheromones (chemical messengers) over a distance of mile. Female dogs are less likely to wander due to hormonal reasons. Female dogs come into heat twice a year, and if you own a female dog, your main concern is other dogs getting in, rather than her out! The best way to prevent this is to have your dog spayed or neutered.
Spaying your dog will prevent her from becoming pregnant if she escapes.

, Your dog may simply miss you. Separation anxiety is caused when you leave your dog's presence and his attachment to you causes them anxiety. He may try to escape in an effort to follow you.If your dog usually escapes right after you leave, there is a good chance separation anxiety is to blame.
Act calmly when coming home or leaving. By showing your dog that your departure and arrival are not something to be excited about, he should learn to relax during these times.
Think about giving your dog an over-the-counter medication, or asking your vet for a prescription, that will reduce anxiety. Even if you use an over-the-counter medication, consult with your veterinarian before use and follow all directions., Your dog may simply be bored, he might be wandering in search of something exciting and new to do. By keeping your yard interesting and engaging, you will make escape less appealing to your dog.


Make sure there are plenty of toys in the yard.
Play with your dog in the yard. Besides using up energy, your dog will associate the yard with activity and play.
Leave food and water out if the dog is outdoors for extended periods of time.

Keep your dog busy with toys and chews.,
Buy dog-friendly houseplants.,
Make your own household cleaning products.,
Master basic training.,
Crate your dog if it misbehaves.",How to Keep Your Dog from Being Exposed to Household Poisons3," Visit a pet store to buy your dog puzzle toys and chews to keep it busy and out of trouble. Puzzle toys are hollow toys to fill with treats, which your dog must work to get at for at least a few hours. Chews will also appease your dog’s natural instinct to chew things, which will make it less likely to get into poisonous household items.Opt for dental chews like Nylabone, which will clean your dog’s teeth and gums while it chews them.

, Note that many household plants are poisonous to dogs, so be careful before purchasing any for your home. Visit the Humane Society website at http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/pets/poisonous_plants.pdf for a comprehensive list of common plants that might be toxic to your pet (e.g. poinsettia and elephant's ear plants).Opt instead for a plant proven not to be poisonous to dogs, such as:Lemon button ferns
Spider plants
Areca palms
Baby rubber plants
Ponytail palms

, Many commercial cleaning products contain chemicals that can be harmful to your pet, even just by inhalation. To keep your pet safe and healthy, make your own cleaning products using non-toxic ingredients like baking soda, lemon, vinegar, and hydrogen peroxide. Using homemade cleaners will also save you money on cleaning supplies.For instance, mix 3 cups of warm water with 2 tbsp. of lemon juice and 2 tbsp. of baking soda for an all-purpose cleaner.

, To keep your dog out of danger, make sure that it stays well-behaved. Your pet should respond to the basic five commands: ""Sit”, ""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here”, and it should obey promptly when given them. If you and your dog need to review these steps, visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for more in-depth training information and helpful videos.

, If your dog does not behave while you are out of the house, prevent dangerous misbehaviour by crating it during your absence. Crate training is meant to regulate your dog’s behaviour and should not be treated as a punishment. Continue crating your dog when you go out until you see signs that you can trust it to behave while alone in the house (e.g. it seems calmer and more obedient).

Use a halter on walks.,
Strap your dog into a harness.,
Consider trying a different type of collar.",How to Walk Your Uncooperative Dog1," If your dog pulls, zigzags, or engages in any other type of undesirable behavior on walks, a halter might help. Halters are designed to redistribute pressure. When your dog pulls or veers off course, the halter pulls your dog's nose down and towards you to discourage uncooperative behavior.Halters fit over the bridge of the nose and around the back of the head. They're easy to put on and they can make walks with your dog much easier.
A halter will not hurt your dog. It simply makes it slightly uncomfortable if your dog tries to behave badly on a walk.
You can buy a halter at most pet stores or online.;
, Harnesses work similar to halters, but they strap around your dog's chest rather than on the head. There are several different types of harnesses, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. You can buy a harness at most pet stores or through an online retailer.


Back-clip harnesses are not very effective at controlling or breaking behavioral issues. However, they are comfortable for dogs and won't injure the neck like a leash could if the dog pulls too hard.Front-clip harnesses work much like back-clip harnesses, except they make it easier to control the dog's movement. The downside to front-clip harnesses is that they may cause your dog's legs to get tangled on walks.Tightening harnesses can help control your dog's movement very well, but they won't actually train your dog to behave on a walk. Some tightening harnesses can be painful for dogs, so make sure you read reviews online and try it out on your dog before a walk., Collars typically fall into one of two categories: regular collars and aversive collars. Aversive collars, like choke chains and pronged collars, use pain or discomfort to try and break dogs out of bad behavior. Talk to your veterinarian or a professional trainer before using an aversive collar, as simple training may be more effective.Flat collars are the standard strap-style collar most dogs wear.
Martingale collars can be helpful for dogs that are able to slip out of a normal collar.
A choke chain is a chain made of metal links that slips over the dog's head and tightens when your dog pulls. Choke chains are sometimes considered inhumane, as they can cause a dog to choke or sustain injuries to the neck, trachea, or esophagus.
Prong/pinch collars work like a martingale collar, but they're lined with blunted metal prongs. Like choke chains, these collars are often considered inhumane.

Look into sound therapy.,
Purchase a quiet vacuum.,
Be patient.,
Use clicker training.",How to Teach Your Pet Not to be Scared of the Vacuum Cleaner2," Have a look at the Sound Therapy 4 Pets website. They have a number of CDs that prepare and treat dogs that have sound phobias. While not always effective, getting your animal used to the sound without the sight of the vacuum could help the animal overcome its fear., All vacuums make some noise, but many vacuums are designed to limit and almost eliminate the amount of noise they make. If your pet is really scared of your vacuum, try buying one that isn’t as noisy., While some pets will fear the vacuum cleaner their entire lives, some pets just need to get used to its presence. If you have young pets, simply go through your vacuuming routine as usual. Over time, they may get used to it and lose their fear. , If your pet has been trained with a clicker, try using the clicker to get the animal used to the vacuum. Start with the vacuum off and click while dropping a treat when the animal comes around the vacuum. Once the animal is close, run the vacuum very briefly and turn it off again. While you are doing this, click and drop a treat for the animal before it has the chance to react to the noise.Once the animal has gotten used to the sound of the vacuum, try using the clicker method while moving the vacuum around your pet."

Ignore your dog's licking.,
Try dog-appeasing pheromones.,
Change your soap or lotion.,
Use citrus-scented skin products.,
Keep your dog occupied with toys.,
Consider medicating your dog.",How to Stop Dogs Licking You1," If your dog is licking your skin for attention or affection, removing that reward may help curb this obsessive behavior.


Don't scold your dog. Even a negative reaction is still, in your dog's mind, a reaction to her excessive licking behavior.
Stop what you are doing, stand up, and leave the room when she engages in prolonged licking. This will help reinforce in your dog's mind that licking will not achieve these desired outcomes.;
, Dog-appeasing pheromones, also known as DAP, have been proven as an effective means of treating the obsessive behavior that often accompanies separation anxiety in dogs.These artificial chemicals replicate the pheromones released by a nursing mother dog, which can calm anxious or frightened dogs., It's possible that your dog's licking is caused by a scent or taste that she finds desirable. Try using unscented soaps and lotions, and see if your dog's licking declines.

, Though there are exceptions, most dogs are generally repulsed by the smell and taste of citrus. Using a citrus-scented skin product, or even dabbing your skin with a citrus rind, may keep your dog from licking your skin., Burning energy can help curb negative behaviors, so having a range of toys, including a treat-dispensing toy that challenges her mind, may help curb undesirable behavior like excessive licking., If your dog's licking is part of a larger separation anxiety, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about medication as an option for your pet.


Clomipramine is often prescribed to pets with anxiety and obsessive compulsive tendencies. The medication helps to counteract obsessive compulsive behavior like licking.Fluoxetine is another common medication prescribed to pets with anxiety. This medication treats canine compulsive disorder with relatively few side effects."

Command your dog to sleep.,
Avoid giving in to your dog.,
Adjust your schedule for medical conditions.",How to Stop Your Dog from Waking You Up at Night2," Sometimes your dog will just wake you up because they’re bored or they want to play. In this case, you should command your dog to lay down and go back to sleep.


Use a command like “lay down.” This should get your dog to stop pawing you and licking your face.
Say your chosen command in a stern voice.
Use the command only once.
You may want to point to the ground as you say the command.
Training your dog by commands might take several weeks. Don’t lose patience – your dog will eventually learn., If you reward your dog with attention for waking you up, you will train them to repeat the behavior. Ignore your dog's efforts except for that single ""lay down"" command — even prolonged scolding can be a ""reward."" When it is time to get up, spend a little time on your own activities instead of walking directly to the food bowl.


Remember, though, your dog might genuinely have to go to the bathroom. Don’t make them suffer because you want another twenty minutes of sleep., Depending on your dog’s general health, you may have to adjust your lifestyle, habits, and schedule to your dog’s needs. By adjusting to your dog’s needs, you’ll reduce the chance that they’ll wake you up. Consult your vet if your dog's medication or feeding schedule makes it difficult for you to sleep.

Keep your dog in another room.,
Put your dog in a crate at night.,
Let your dog sleep in the same room as you, if they didn't originally.",How to Stop Your Dog from Waking You Up at Night3," If you’ve tried everything and your dog still wakes you up, you may consider having your dog sleep in another room. By putting your dog in another room, you’ll make sure that you have restful sleep and your dog is undisturbed during the night.


Make sure to provide your dog with a comfortable bed if you put them in another room.
Be aware, keeping your dog in another room, especially if they’re already used to sleeping with you, might result in crying, barking, or a dog with hurt feelings., Some dogs may find it hard to sleep without waking up their owner. This is especially true of high energy dogs that are not crated at night. A solution to this is keeping your dog in a create at night. By putting your dog in a crate, you’ll send your dog the signal that night time is sleep time, and you’ll also remove their ability to run around or disturb your sleep.


Housing your dog in a crate at night will prevent them from jumping on you and licking you awake in the morning.
Make sure that the crate is big enough for your dog. Dogs 0-15 pounds should have small crates, dogs 16 to 35 pounds should have medium rates, dogs 36 to 65 pounds should have large crates, and dogs over 65 pounds should have extra-large crates., Some dogs may bark to wake you up at night because they’re lonely or want your attention. One way to address this is to have your dog sleep in the same room as you. By moving your dog into the same room as you, you may eliminate the reason why your dog is barking and waking you up.


Provide your dog with a crate, bed, or somewhere to sleep in your room.
Make sure to set boundaries from the very beginning. This means creating a space and then training your dog to sleep in until you are awake.

See if your dog is jumping the fence.,
Look for signs that your dog digs under the fence.,
Inspect the fence for holes caused by chewing.Sometimes dogs can gnaw his way through a fence or other barrier you have put around them.",How to Stop Your Dog from Running Out of the Backyard2," Dogs can be quite agile, and if your fence isn't high enough or offers some footholds, he can jump over top of it. Try the following to make it difficult for your dog to hop over your fence:Check the areas near the fence. Look for any objects that your dog could be using to get over the fence. It may be a chair or some potted plants, with just enough height to help your dog make the jump. Move them away from the fence.
Install a fence extension.You can try to make your fence taller if your dog seems to be big enough to jump over by himself. When you add the extension, try to slant the new addition inwards at about a forty-five degree angle. This will make it very difficult for your dog to make the leap.

, Sometimes, dogs will take the low road, and dig under a fence to escape. There are a few methods you can use to reinforce your fence and make any attempts at burrowing more difficult for your dog.Dig down and place chicken wire below the fence. Make sure to point any sharp edges outwards, away from the inside of the fence, to prevent injury to your dog.
Try putting large stones around the foot of the fence. By putting these stones in place, your dog will be unable to dig close to the fence and escape.
If you install a chain link fence, make sure to leave enough height to put some of it underground. This will make an escape by digging difficult, as your dog will have to dig down quite far to break free.
Look for any other small gaps he may be squeezing through and cover them up.

, This can not only be dangerous for your dog, but can be an expense as well.


Your best option is to figure out what is triggering your dog's escapes and alter that.
Install a fence made from a material that is hard to chew through. Sturdy wood or metal can be good options, but if your dog chews them, it may prevent a health hazard.

Make your yard exciting.,
Teach your dog basic obedience.,
Don't punish fear or anxiety based escapes.,
Never discipline your dog after an escape.,
Catch your dog in the act.",How to Stop Your Dog from Running Out of the Backyard3," By keeping your yard engaging for your dog, you make it hard for him to want to leave in the first place. By keeping your yard secure, you make it hard for him to leave even if he wants to.Play with your dog often in your yard. If your dog strays to the edges of the property, call them back. By playing and learning the boundaries, he will be more inclined to stay close to home.
Keep plenty of toys and play things in the yard. If your dog is outside for a long time, add food and water to prevent escapes based on a search for these things.
Make any fence tall enough so that it cannot be jumped over. Also check that it runs deep enough so that your dog cannot dig underneath and escape.

, Work with your dog to teach them some basic commands. The most useful commands you might want your dog to learn are “come” or “sit”. This will allow you to have your dog return directly or at stop to sit, if he escapes.

, If your dog suffers from anxiety when you leave him alone, punishing your dog will not help him relax. Try instead to help your dog overcome anxiety that is cause by your departure.Punishing and anxious dog will only help to increase fear.
Conversely, do not reassure your dog when it is exhibiting anxious behavior, as this will reinforce the anxiety.
It is best to simply ignore any unwanted, anxious behavior from your dog.

, Once your dog is free of the fence, any punishment will become associated with wherever he might find himself at that moment. Only discipline your dog if you catch them in the act of escape. Punishing after escape will not teach your dog that escape itself is wrong.Disciplining your dog after you catch him will only make him fearful of you. Catching him again will become more difficult as he may try to run away from you.

, If you are able to catch your dog as it tries to escape, you may take disciplinary action. You will have to be careful to discipline him in a way that he will associate only with the escape, not with you.Try taking and action that your dog won't associate with you. Spray your dog from a distance using super-soaker type water pistol so your dog won't see you coming.
If your dog sees you as the cause behind the unpleasant disciplinary action, he will associate with you alone. Now your dog will simply wait for you to leave before going back to his escape plans.

Have your dog's digestive system checked by a veterinarian.,
Optimize your dog's diet.,
Treat worms, if your dog has them.,
Make sure your dog isn't bored.,
Give some time for medical issues to clear up.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Cat Poop1," A small percentage of poop-eating dogs are suffering from medical conditions that make them do atypical things. A dog suffering from a lack of digestive enzymes may crave to eat feces because it is lacking the ability to properly digest its food and looks to reclaim those vital nutrients.Another example of a medical problem causing coprophagia (poop eating) is an overgrowth of bacteria in the bowel, which leads to a vitamin deficiency in the bowel wall. In order to correct this deficiency the dog then craves poop.Typically, both these conditions are associated with soft or liquid feces, since the dog cannot digest food properly. However, normal stools do not rule out all the health issues.;
, If the dog's diet is lacking in nutrition it can all lead to coprophagia.A hard to digest diet that is high in cereal may cause some dogs to seek poop to eat in order to supplement their diet. Switch to a high quality food that has a named meat at the top of the food label.


Make sure you are feeding the recommended amount (not too much or too little) so that the dog is not hungry.

, Intestinal worms rob the dog of vital nutrition, which it may try to reclaim by eating poop. Worm your dog with a good multi wormer (these are usually prescription only) against all classes of worms (roundworms, whipworms, and tapeworms).

, A bored or frustrated dog may make their own amusement, which includes seeking out and eating poop! Make sure your dog has plenty of exercise and interactive play in order to stop boredom, leading to unpleasant habits.

, You have a healthy dog that is dewormed and exercises regularly, but it still eats cat poop. Be aware, that some things are habit forming and that includes coprophagia. It can take a few weeks after any underlying problems have been addressed for the dog to stop.

Determine the cause of your dog's behavior.,
Look at your behavior.,
Look at your dog’s environment.,
Consider his diet.",How to Stop a Dog's Unwanted Behavior1," Remember that your dog makes all of his choices out of his own self-interest. What is your dog getting for this behavior? Is it your attention, good or bad? Is it turning into a fun game for your dog? After establishing what is causing your dog to act in such a way, you’ll better understand how to change his behavior for the better.Think broadly about your dog’s behavioral issues. Most likely, your dog is acting badly for a number of reasons. You should consider a number of factors including its diet and the amount of time it spends exercising or locked up in a kennel/cage/room.;
, Do you leap to the dog's beck and call by yelling at it or cajoling it to stop? Maybe this is exactly what your pooch wants from you. Even angry attention is attention — your dog craves to be noticed and be part of the pack. If you only notice or give attention when your dog is acting up, you are responsible for ""training"" him to be bad., Is there something almost “irresistible” in your dog’s space? This might take some detective work or it may be incredibly obvious! If your dog chews on slippers, remove them. If your dog can’t help but bark at people walking outside your house, obstruct its view. Set your dog up for success. When your dog behaves properly, you can reward it. Without triggers, your dog will behave better., Is there a pattern to the start of his bad behavior that coincides with a change of diet? A lot like some kids with food or additive intolerances, some dogs can be intolerant of a particular ingredient or preservative in a food and it shows it's as hyperactivity and bad behavior. If you suspect this to be the case, run a detox and either put him back on his original diet, or give him a bland (chicken and rice) diet for a couple of weeks and see if his behavior improves."
"
Understand the dog's behavior.,
Start discouraging the behavior early.,
Ignore her when she jumps up.",How to Stop a Dog from Jumping1," In a dog's world, it is instinctual to greet another dog by coming nose-to-nose with them. This allows them to sniff each other's faces and become acquainted with the other dog's scent. Of course, your nose is a bit higher to reach so it is only natural that your dog will jump up to get closer to your face when greeting you.This can be quite annoying and unnecessary, but fortunately, the habit can be broken.;
, You may think it is sweet when your dog greets you by jumping on you. For the most part, puppies think that when they jump up on someone, they are highly likely to be picked up and cuddled soon after.


It is best to start discouraging this type of greeting behavior as early as possible. You will be excited to see your puppy as well, but if your puppy has this tendency, you can do this by practicing the no touch, no talk, no eye contact rule when greeting your puppy.
Avoid looking or talking to your puppy until she settles down. This, in turn, will send out calming signals to her and will avoid getting her excited or anxious about your arrival.
Puppies tend to learn very quickly, so it will be much easier to train her to greet you in a calm and desirable manner the younger she is.
Although it isn't an issue when she is little, you may be encouraging a bad habit that could be difficult to break later when she becomes an adult. A small, 15 pound Labrador puppy jumping up on you is quite a different story than a full-grown 100 pound Labrador that could knock you over and even injure you or your guests., One way to teach your dog, no matter her age, that jumping up is not an acceptable greeting is to ignore her during this behavior. This involves turning your back to her and not giving her any type of attention, such as physical, vocal, or eye contact.


As soon as your dog is calm and all four paws are on the ground, tell her she is being a good girl and give her a small treat or loving pat on the head.
Try to talk in a calm voice and use calm petting techniques to avoid your dog becoming too excited again. If she returns to her jumping behavior, turn your back again and ignore her.
In the early stages of this training, you may be turning in circles several times, but your dog will soon relate her jumping to your lack of attention and stop.
As with any training, consistency is key. This means that everyone in the household and all guests should be informed that training is in progress and be willing participants. Even the occasional attention given to your dog while she is jumping can encourage her and could result in several steps backwards in your training process."
"
Practice walking your dog on-leash at home.,
Train your dog with a clicker.,
Use treats to discourage pulling.,
Be consistent in your training.",How to Walk Your Uncooperative Dog2," Pulling during walks may be a sign your dog is overly excited to go outside. If your dog associates being leashed up with an exciting adventure, he or she may be more likely to pull and lunge on your walk. By desensitizing your dog to being leashed up, you may be able to discourage your dog from pulling on the leash.When you put on your dog's leash, do so silently and without any trigger words. The goal is to get your dog accustomed to being leashed up without getting excited.
Leash up your dog between walks and stay indoors. Walk around the house with your dog on-leash as you read, watch TV, or just move about from room to room.

, Clicker training is a common method of breaking dogs out of bad behavior. Using a clicker and plenty of treats when you walk your dog can help your dog associate good behavior with food rewards, which will reinforce good behavior over time.Carry a clicker and dog treats on every walk.
As you walk outside, wait at the door until your dog looks back at you. Don't give any verbal commands, and don't move until your dog looks at you.
As soon as your dog looks at you, activate the clicker and give your dog a treat. Then stop every few steps on your walk, click the clicker, and reward your dog with another treat.
Transition to stopping only when your dog begins to pull. When your dog stops pulling and turns to face you, activate the clicker and give your dog a treat.

, If you don't like the idea of clicker training, you can try training your dog by just offering treats. Over time, your dog will learn that when he or she stops pulling you will offer more treats.Carry some treats with you on walks. Keep a few treats in whichever hand is closest to your dog as you walk him or her.
Give your dog a treat every so often if he or she is walking appropriately.
Any time your dog begins to pull, stop walking and wait for your dog to look back at you.
Once your dog stops, give the ""sit"" command. Hold the handful of treats in front of your dog's nose so he or she smells the treats, but don't give any treats until your dog starts behaving again.

, If you let your dog get his or her way from time to time, your dog will pick up on this and act out accordingly. The goal in any type of training is to be consistent every time you walk so that your dog breaks out of his or her undesirable habit."
"
Pick a side and stick to it.,
Use a short leash.,
Teach your dog the ""heel"" command.,
Work your way up to loose-leash walking.",How to Walk Your Uncooperative Dog3," If your dog zigzags during walks, your walking etiquette may be to blame. Dogs take behavioral cues from their humans, and your dog may not know which side you prefer if you alternate sides while you walk. Dogs need consistency to ensure good behavior, and that includes which side you walk your dog on.Make a choice and be consistent. Whether you walk your dog on the right side or left side, make sure you stick with that side for every walk while you train your dog.

, Using a short leash can be very helpful during training. Give your dog just a little slack, but not so much that your dog will be able to switch sides or weave between your legs. As your dog's training progresses you can work your way up to a normal leash length.You can either buy a short leash, or simply keep your dog's leash reeled in to a shorter length.

, Teaching your dog to heel may help break him or her out of zigzagging on walks. When you train your dog to heel, you reinforce the importance of following your lead and staying close to your body.Stand at your dog's side and hold the leash in the hand closest to the dog. Carry a reward (either a squeaky toy or treats) in the other hand.
Hold the reward above and just ahead of your dog's face so your dog can see it.
Say ""heel"" and start walking. Make sure your dog walks in step with you and follows the reward.
Any time your dog gets distracted, squeak the toy or hold the treats right in front of your dog's nose. Do this just long enough to regain your dog's attention and get back in step with one another.
Every time your dog walks in step for 30 seconds, give your dog a reward (either play time with the toy or a treat). Gradually extend that length of time for your dog, and eventually you'll be able to get your dog to heel without treats.

, Loose-leash walking involves training your dog to walk as fast or as slow as you do. If your dog runs ahead or lags behind, using treats and stopping the walk can help teach your dog to follow your lead and defer to your desired speed.Any time your dog starts pulling, stop walking forward and take a few steps backwards.
As you step back, call your dog in a happy tone of voice. Give your dog a reward when he or she returns to your side.
Give your dog rewards every three or four steps that he or she stays in synch with your pace.
Gradually increase the number of steps your dog needs to take to get treats, then progress to random rewards once your dog has learned how to keep pace with you.

"
Reinforce alternative behaviors.,
Give your dog more exercise.,
Reward your dog's good behavior.,
Train your dog to lick on command.,
Be consistent.",How to Stop Dogs Licking You2," One way to help curb obsessive behavior like licking is to reinforce a different, incompatible behavior. An incompatible behavior in this situation would be any activity that occupies your dog's mouth and keeps her from licking you.


Start a game of fetch or tug-of-war as soon as s/he begins licking. This will distract him/her from whatever anxiety was causing the obsessive licking, and you will make it physically difficult for him/her to lick you while playing with a toy.Try taking your dog for a walk whenever s/he licks you. This may condition him/her to lick you whenever s/he needs to go out, and it may become less of a compulsive behavior.

, A vigorous workout can help tire your dog out, relieving stress and reducing his/her desire to lick you., If your dog is licking you because s/he wants your attention, then give it to him/her while s/he is behaving appropriately. Rewarding good behavior should take place immediately after your dog has acted responsibly, in order to maximize his/her association of that action with your reward. Rewarding your dog in this manner will teach him/her that calm, “normal” behavior is desirable., This will help teach your dog that licking is only acceptable when you initiate it.Choose a word to initiate licking. It can be ""lick,"" ""kiss,"" or any other word you want your dog to associate with licking.
Hold out your hand while saying the command word you've chosen. You can use a small dab of peanut butter on your hand to prompt licking in the early phases of training. However, this option should only be taken if you know your dog is not aggressive with food.
Issue an end command, such as ""stop,"" ""no more,"" or ""no kiss."" Wait to see if your dog responds on his/her own. If s/he stops licking, even for a few seconds, reward him/her. If not, repeat the command and move your hand away.
Praise your dog when s/he licks and stops on command. Praising your dog's good behavior is crucial in training him/her to respond to your commands.

, If you want your dog to stop licking you, you must commit to stopping the behavior altogether. You cannot praise your dog for licking you one day and scold her for the same behavior the next. Doing so will only confuse your dog, making it harder for him/her to understand what you want from him/her. Remember, any type of training requires patience, dedication, and consistency."

Relocate the litter tray.,
Use a covered litter box.Instead of using an open tray, consider using a hooded one.,
Booby trap the litter box.,
Make the feces unpleasant for the dog.Consider making the cat feces less appealing by making them unpleasant.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Cat Poop2," Sometimes it is best to help your dog by eliminating the temptation to misbehave. With this in mind, if you can, put the cat's litter tray in a room that the dog has no access to. Consider barring the doorway with a child-gate, so that the cat can jump over the gate but the dog's path is blocked.


For large dogs or those adept at jumping, consider installing a cat flap in the door to that room and keeping it shut.
If you have a small dog, fit a microchip activated cat door and only program in the cat's number so that the dog is denied access.
Obviously, make sure the cat is well aware of the tray's new location.

, This makes it physically more difficult for the dog to get to the cat poop. In fact, there are trays that are top-entry only, making them accessible to fit young cats (probably not a good idea for elderly or arthritic cats) but not the dog.


Be aware that some cats dislike using covered litter boxes, in which case consider a different option.

, The idea is to make something unpleasant happen when the dog approaches the tray. This could mean placing a motion-activated canister of compressed air beside the tray so it fires as the dog approaches, or improvising snap-traps on the ground around the tray so they snap as the dog gets close.


This needs to be done with care and perfect timing, or you may accidentally surprise the cat which could put dissuade it from using the tray.
Do not leave these traps in place permanently or you could upset the cat., There are many commercial products available that are designed to be added to food, in order to make the resultant feces taste unpleasant.


This has a couple of drawbacks. The additive goes onto the cat's food and cats are notoriously fussy eaters, and may refuse to eat the adulterated food. In addition, dogs have a relatively poor sense of taste and may not find the altered poop all that unpleasant (after all, how much worse can it be?)
Instead, it could be more effective to make the feces unpleasant when smelled. Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell and sniffing usually precedes the eating. Liberally coat the feces with pepper. When the dog sniffs the poop the pepper will make it sneeze and prove unpleasant.
Do not expect the dog to stop right away. It can takes weeks of constant sneezing to eventually give it up as a bad job."
"
Be gentle when stopping the behavior.,
Train the dog to leave the cat poop and ""come away."",
Never punish the dog.",How to Stop Your Dog from Eating Cat Poop3," Be aware that swooping in and removing the cat poop as the dog is going to it can backfire. It simply serves to increase competition for the poop. It is better to let the dog investigate but then distract it and reward its redirected attention., One method is to hold a treat in your fist and let the dog sniff the fist but not have the treat. When the dog eventually gives up sniffing the closed fist and turns its head away, say ""come away"", and give it a treat (not the one in the fist). Eventually the dog will learn that no matter how tempting the forbidden treat, when you say ""Come away"" there is a guaranteed goodie waiting for it.

, Never rub the dog's face in feces and never physically or verbally abuse the dog. The dog's actions may be annoying, and disgusting, but you need to act strategically in order actually change the behavior. Yelling and getting visibly angry will only teach the dog to fear you and to become more secretive in its activities."

Punishing your dog will damage your relationship with your dog and possibly make the problem worse. A punishment does not have to be physical. Find alternatives that don’t injure or scare your dog. Do not hit or hurt your dog in any way. This breeds vicious, scared dogs, not lovable, huggable pooches.


Never hit your dog. Just say ""No!"" firmly instead.Your dog will make the connection between his behavior and what you did to stop him., If there are certain objects, toys, and plants in your house or garden that appear to ""set off"" your dog, remove them. Give your dog a toy that it likes, that it will spend an hour playing with. Get a rawhide bone, a real bone, or a safe chew-toy. If there is some way to fill it with treats, your dog will spend even more time trying to get the treats out., Clicker training is a method of delivering immediate praise with the help of a clicker. You can click faster than you can give a treat or pet your dog's head. As such, clicker training reinforces good behavior fast enough for a dog's learning speed. It works by creating a positive association between the click sound and rewards. Eventually, your dog will consider the sound of the clicker itself reward enough for good behavior. You can apply the principle of clicker training to any dog command.Click the clicker device, then immediately give the dog a treat. This creates a positive association with the click sound. Later, that sound will “mark” a behavior as correct so the dog knows that he did something right.When the dog performs a desired behavior, make the click sound, then give him a treat. Once he's performing that behavior consistently, you can give the behavior a command name. Begin tying the command and the behavior together with the help of the clicker.
For example, before you ever teach your dog the ""sit"" command, give the click sound, a treat, and praise when you find him sitting. When he begins sitting just to get the treats, start saying the word ""sit"" to get him into position. Pair it with the click sound to reward him. Eventually, he will learn that sitting in response to the ""sit"" command will earn him a click reward., When your dog does a behavior you do want, such as laying down instead of barking, reward him or her. He will be much more likely to repeat the desired behavior and less likely to repeat the ""bad"" behavior. When incentives for bad behavior are withdrawn and incentives for good behavior are introduced consistently, the dog will soon learn the preferred response., Try to stop yelling, cajoling, or responding in any manner that gives the dog signals that you are excited, playful, dog-focused. Whilst you may feel very irritated, even angry, the dog may misinterpret this for playfulness or ""joining in"". Resist the temptation. Ignoring and silence is better than yelling — clean the mess up later after you send the dog elsewhere.

, If your dog is running away from you and hiding, you have a lot of work to do to redevelop your damaged relationship with your dog. Your dog's trust in you has been damaged and it will take a lot of consistency and positive reinforcement training on your part to mend the broken relationship and turn it into something fabulous., Dogs are slow learners. Your dog doesn't have the same contemplative powers that a human does. He can’t learn from one situation and extrapolate for others. To fundamentally change a dog’s behavior requires time and attention. If you have adopted your dog as an older dog with habits that seem to be set in stone, relax. The habits are not set. Remember, dogs are very context specific and that works to our favor. The dog now has a new pack and a new home and if you set the limits and expectations immediately when the dog arrives at his new home, he will learn. Sometimes when you are dealing with a hardwired behavior like a border collie that is herding the neighborhood kids instead of sheep, you cannot easily counter train that out. It is so much easier to manage the situation, rather than try to train him out of it. How quickly a bad behavior stops depends on how well established it is. If the problem is an ingrained habit, then it can be difficult to break the association between action and reward. In fact, in the short or medium term the bad behavior can get worse because the dog works even harder to try and get the reward."
"
Understand that your dog learns by trial and error.,
Understand that your dog makes direct connections.,
Think about your dog's routine.",How to Stop a Dog's Unwanted Behavior3," You dog acts in a specific way because of an expected reward - whether it be food, play, or attention. When a dog behaves badly, think about what it gets out of it in terms of a reward and then make sure the reward does not happen. Unfortunately, to the canine mind attention is a huge addictive reward — which means shouting at your dog or telling him off is only rewarding the bad behavior. Any action can have three possible outcomes: a pleasant one, an uncertain one, or an unpleasant one.What matters is the dog's response to those outcomes. Each outcome evokes a different response.
The pleasant outcome, means the behavior is likely to be repeated
An indifferent outcome, means the dog may or may not repeat the behavior
An unpleasant outcome means the dog is less likely to repeat the behavior.
Now when you realize that shouting or chastisement is a reward, it puts a whole different complexion on reacting to bad behavior — you are making the problem worse not better., Dogs live in the moment. If your dog chews up your favorite shoe and you don’t punish him immediately, your dog won’t learn his lesson. If your mother comes home later, discovers the destroyed shoe, and slaps the dog, he will link the punishment to the owner who came home and for no reason slapped him. Thus he becomes wary of the owner. The dog learns nothing about the inherent evils of shoe chewing.Punishment isn’t clear for dogs oftentimes. If you catch the dog in the act of chewing a shoe, and tell him off immediately, once again he might simply link the punishment to the owner rather than to the inanimate object he’s destroyed.

, Remember that your dog is a creature of habit. Determine if your dog is boredom or anxious. Boredom and a surplus of energy can turn a normally well-behaved dog into a delinquent. Make sure he has plenty of regular exercise and plenty of opportunity to express physical energy chasing and running. This leaves him happily content when he gets back home and less likely to get up to mischief.If your dog is destructive when you're out, consider that he might be anxious or bored in your absence. Try giving him a toy that will consume his attention for 20 to 30 minutes — such as a Kong stuffed with dog food. In hot weather, stuff the Kong and pop it in the freezer overnight, so that he gets a cooling dog-food ice pop to keep his mind occupied whilst your out. The chances are if he gets over the initial half an hour without noticing you're gone then he's more likely to settle down for a nap afterwards."
"
Redirect with a sit command.,
Use a special toy.,
Stay calm.",How to Stop a Dog from Jumping2," The simple 'sit' command can be useful in many different situations. Most importantly, it is a great distraction technique for redirecting your dog's attention from an undesirable behavior, such as jumping up. When your dog jumps up on you, turn your back to them while keeping them in your peripheral vision. Ask her to sit and immediately praise her when she does so.


If your dog is too excited to notice that you are asking her to sit, ignore her excited behavior until she calms down, and then repeat the command. Again, as soon as she follows your command, give her lots of praise or a special treat to let her know this is the behavior that gets rewarded, not jumping.
With this simple command, the goal is to redirect your dog's jumping behavior with a task that should be easy to perform and then rewarded well. Your dog will soon figure out which greetings get her your full attention and which don't.
If your dog doesn't know the sit command yet, start teaching her the command along and then try this method., Some dogs exude such extreme excitement when greeting someone that it may be difficult and time consuming to wait for them to calm down for a redirecting sit command. If this sounds like your dog, she may be more inclined to grab a toy and shake it or hold it instead.


Keep a special toy by your front door to throw for your dog or give to her when you come home. This will redirect her energy into playing with the toy as opposed to jumping on you or your guests., The key to keeping your dog calm, and therefore exhibit calm behavior, is to also participate in only calm behavior when you come home. Try not to use a high-pitched or loud voice when talking to her. This includes shouting at her when she starts jumping up. This type of vocal tone could encourage more excitement and jumping.


Instead of using physical punishment to discourage bad behavior, teach your dog what behaviors get them the most rewards from you. You will have to repeat the actions of her training multiple times before she will get it.
Don't get frustrated or upset because this will make her worse. Keep at it and she will eventually catch on

Toss a ball or a toy.,
Give your dog a command.,
Interrupt your dog.,
Move the dog away from the spot.,
Pull away if your dog is licking you.,
Purchase an Elizabethan collar.",How to Stop a Dog from Licking Everything1," When you see your dog licking or sucking fabric, take their favorite toy and throw it. Instead of licking the furniture, they will start to play. If you do this often, they will start using their toys to get their licking urges out instead of the furniture.;
, It's a little hard to keep licking when you're supposed to do something your master or mistress commands. Telling your dog to ""Sit!"" or ""Lie down!"" will stop them momentarily., Every time you catch them licking, bang something loudly and yell ""No!"" very authoritatively.Don't be inconsistent - every single time you catch them, you must respond this way so that they come to associate the licking with an unpleasant noise and your disapproval.

, If you have a small dog or a puppy, you can pick them up and take them to a different room. This is especially effective if they seem to be licking the same spot over and over again. This will reinforce that they should not be licking at that spot., Licking can be a social activity for dogs, which humans often reinforce with praise. Some people, however, may not find it so endearing.If you want to stop your dog from licking you or other people, you will have to show them that licking is not an acceptable behavior. Every time they lick you, step away. If you are sitting, stand up and leave the room for a minute. After a while, they will learn that licking will not earn them attention.

, If your dog had surgery, you will need to stop them from licking or chewing their stitches. Elizabethan collars are the plastic cones that dogs wear after surgery. If your dog’s licking is caused by a medical procedure, have them wear the cone until they are fully healed.Do not make your dog wear the cone to prevent general licking unless directed to do so by a vet. Dogs find the cone uncomfortable. Only use it for a short period of time.

Begin training your dog.,

Stop the behavior before it occurs.,
Be consistent.,
Consider professional training.,
Exercise your dog.,
Train your dog to do a different activity.,
Give your dog a job in the house.",How to Stop a Dog from Herding," You will need to have control over your dog's behavior in order to keep it from herding. Training your dog to stop herding requires you to have very strong control over the dog's behaviors.


Teaching your dog to sit, stay, and lie down is the first phase of training. Once it has these basic commands down, you can move on to more advanced training.
If your dog only herds every once in awhile, basic training should be sufficient to eliminate the bad behavior. You should be able to direct the dog to stop and sit if it begins herding behavior.;
, Once your dog has the basics down, you can move on to more advanced training. This training is about getting the dog's attention at any moment and getting it to perform a variety of behaviors on command.In many cases, people who are doing advanced training with their dogs use clicker training. This is a process in which you get the dog to respond to the sound of a clicker when you want it to dog something. If the dog responds appropriately, then it gets positive reinforcement, such as a treat, to reinforce the behavior.

, In dogs that have a very strong herding instinct, training them to stop herding will be difficult and long term work. This means that you need to commit to continued training and reinforcing that training consistently over time.


Many dog breeds that instinctively herd also thrive more when they are consistently trained. This means that a commitment to training the dog will both eliminate behavior that you don't like and it will give the dog something to focus its energy on.

, Once you have seen the herding behavior repeatedly, you should be able to figure out when it is about to happen. Perhaps your dog barks right before it is about to herd or it sniffs at the heels before it nips. Maybe its body language simply changes.Whatever the sign, figure out how to spot it and then intervene immediately when you see it happen.


If you can do this then you have the opportunity to redirect your dog's attention before it starts to herd.
Try redirecting your dog's attention with a command that will get its attention or with its favorite toy. Don't give it a treat, however, as this could simply reinforce the herding behavior., You can't allow the herding behavior some times and then get mad at your dog for doing it other times. This will only confuse the dog and it will not eliminate the undesired behavior.Some dog owners may think of the herding as a cute party trick that is funny once in awhile. However, encouraging the dog to herd sometimes and punishing it for the behavior other times will only create mistrust and confusion in your dog.

, If you are unable to train your dog well enough to eliminate the herding behavior, then you may want to bring in a professional to help you out. A professional dog trainer should be able to find a way to change the dog's behavior through positive reinforcement and repetition. They may teach the dog to respond to a clicker, and they should show you how to use it with the dog as well.


The key to success with a professional dog trainer is that you follow the trainer's instructions even when they are not around.

, Getting your dog's energy out before it has a chance to herd will minimize its desire to do it. Play a game of catch or go for a run with the dog every day, whatever will tire it out.


Just letting your dog out into its yard will not motivate it to exercise. It will usually need to have some sort of interaction from you to get its heart rate up.In fact, for strong herding dogs, a short walk will not be enough daily exercise. It needs to run on a daily basis to get its energy out.
To give your dog enough exercise try committing to exercising with it on a regular basis. This could include going on a jog or run with it. It could also include a different activity that gives both you and your dog some physical activity, such as swimming.

, If your dog really wants to herd, you can usually redirect the dog towards a similar activity that is not as annoying. The activity could include agility work, time trials, disc catching, or other competitive dog activities. These all require the repetition and physical exertion that enables them to replace herding in a dog's life.Training your dog to do a new activity is simply an extension of the basic training you have done with it. Find an activity that your dog enjoys, such as catching a frisbee, and develop that skill through training.
Training your dog to do one of these activities does not mean that it has to compete. Just the practice will be enough to redirect your dog from herding if you do it enough.

, If your dog continually tries to herd you and your family, then it may be willing to take on a different job in the house. Because herding dogs are so trainable, which is what makes them great at the job of herding, they can be trained to do different things. Consider working to train your dog to do small tasks around the house instead of herding you. These could include:Turning lights on and off
Bringing you specific items
Finding items that you often misplace

Immediately react when your dog climbs onto something.,
Say “off”.,
Use an appropriate hand gesture.,
Use a clicker.,
Immediately offer your dog a treat.,
Repeat the above steps until your dog understands the command.",How to Stop a Dog from Climbing up on Things1," When your dog climbs up onto the counter, you need to immediately react. Dogs learn by testing their boundaries. If they have been up on these spaces for longer than a couple of seconds, they might not understand why you are telling them to get down. Rather than associating your command with their location, they might just begin to think that you’re a mean person — someone to be feared., Say it in a firm voice. Don’t yell it, but be sure to be clear. Don’t say “off” and then several other words. You want to make sure that your dog gets the message.


“Off” is the best word choice, if you plan to teach your dog other commands. Some people use the word “down”, but if you want to teach your dog to “lay down” this can get confusing for the dog. For example, if it gets up onto the bed and you tell it “down” it may just lay down., Most people point to the ground when they say “off”. This gives your dog both an auditory and a visual cue that it is time to get down. It can also have the added benefit of telling your dog where it should get down at.

, Many people will use a clicker to further reinforce proper behavior. Every time your dog gets up onto a surface it shouldn’t be on, say “off” and click the clicker while it is getting down. After a while, your dog will associate the clicking sound with the appropriate behavior (getting down). Then you can just click the clicker and the dog will get down., You should present the treat right away if you want your dog to associate their action with it. If you wait a couple of minutes after getting your dog down to give it a treat, it won’t know why it is getting it. Depending on your dog and its preferences, a “treat” might simply be a pet on the head. Typically, food rewards work best. Choose a small treat that your dog goes nuts for. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of choices for you and your dog to choose from. Make sure that the treat is not too fattening and is small enough for you to carry around., Remember to remain vigilant. You never know when a training opportunity will present itself.

Look away from those begging eyes.,
Don't talk or pet your dog.,
Try teaching some basic commands.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Resist a Begging Dog1," Giving your dog any attention when it's begging only encourages it to beg more. Plus, if you look at your dog, you're more likely to give in. If you give into your dog and feed it food sometimes, that teaches it will be rewarded for this behavior. By ignoring the dog altogether, your dog will learn that begging doesn't get it anywhere.Make sure everyone in the family works together to ignore begging. You must be consistent.;
, Trying to talk your dog out of begging won't work. Therefore, you shouldn't just look away; make sure you're also not talking to it or petting it. Any attention you show your dog will only encourage it, making it want to beg more., Teaching your dog ""sit"" and ""stay"" can help with begging, as it removes your dog from the table area if you can get it to ""stay"" somewhere slightly away. To work up to these behaviors, you need to start small.To teach sit, have a treat ready. Start with the treat in front of the dog's nose, and move it back and upwards, above the dog's head. The dog will need to lift its nose to follow the treat, pushing its rump down. As you do this move, say ""sit."" If the dog doesn't complete the motion, try pushing gently on the dog's rear end. Reward the dog with a treat when it is in the sitting position. Keep practicing the move, then work on doing it without a treat.
For stay, get your dog in sitting position. Say ""stay."" It can help to hold your hand up to the dog with your palm flat. Walk a few steps away. If your dog follows, take it back to the starting position and repeat the command. When your dog stays, even for short periods, try rewarding it with a treat.

, Once you've ignored your dog's bad behavior, make sure to reward good behavior. That is, if your dog has been begging for 20 minutes, and then goes and lays down quietly, take it a small treat to let it know that being quiet and not begging is what gets it rewarded.For this tactic, it can help to have a comfy place for your dog nearby, like moving its dog bed near the table.

Spray furniture with a taste deterrent.,
Give the dog a toy when they are more likely to lick.,
Give the dog plenty of exercise.,
Praise your dog when they are licking an appropriate toy.",How to Stop a Dog from Licking Everything2," Dogs won’t lick objects if they taste unpleasant to them. You can find a variety of sprays that will coat your furniture and rugs so that they give off a bad taste. Bitter apple spray is a common repellent.Test the spray on a small part of your fabric or wood furniture first to make sure that it won’t stain.
You may need to reapply the deterrent every two to four weeks.When sitting down with your dog, you can put a small amount of hot sauce or lemon on your skin to deter them from licking you. Wash it off immediately afterwards., If you notice that your dog is licking at certain times of the day, it can be a signal for you to give them the simulation they need. For example, you may notice that your dog licks you when you sit down to watch TV at night. Whenever you sit down on the couch, give them a toy or bone that will distract them for that period of time.


You can fill a Kong type toy with peanut butter or kibble.They will spend their time trying to lick the food out instead of licking the furniture.Another idea is to make some ice cubes flavored with chicken or beef broth. Your dog will suck on these until they melt.

, Anxiety and obsessive behaviors can cause licking, especially if you notice the dog licking themselves. Even if you have a yard for them to run in, take them on walks at least once or twice a day. If you're gone for work during the day, try to come home during lunch, or ask a friend to walk the dog in the middle of the day. These can ease the underlying behaviors behind licking., If you catch them licking, distract them with a chew toy or ball. Once they have taken it into their mouth, praise them. Make sure that the toy is in their mouth or that they are licking the toy before you praise them. You are aiming to teach your dog to only lick certain objects.Punish only when you’ve caught them in the act. Dogs only understand that they are being corrected for behavior committed in the current moment.

Is the dog not getting its usual amount of daily attention? It may be as simple as restoring a routine or spending more time with your dog. Give the dog extra attention until normalcy is restored.

, Sucking and licking blankets and furniture can be a sign that the dog was weaned too early. It is a common feature in bottle-raised puppies.Early intervention is necessary to prevent it from becoming a life-long habit. You can try:


Giving the puppy a variety of other toys to chew and play with.
Designating a blanket for them to suck on. Praise them when they use this blanket and only this blanket.
Physically moving them away from the object.

, If your pet is licking furniture while you are out, it could be separation anxiety. Leave a TV or radio on while you leave. Make sure they have plenty of toys to play with while you are gone.Before you leave, give them a toy filled with treats or peanut butter. They will spend time trying to lick out the peanut butter and may forget that you left them at all., Compulsive behaviors can be difficult to break without the proper training. Try to find a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). They will be able to find the root of your dog's behaviors while practicing safe methods to treat the habit., If all else fails, talk to the expert. Your dog’s licking could be the result of allergies, fleas, or obsessive compulsive disorder.While it is possible to medicate a dog for such behavior, this should be treated as a last resort and it's much better to find some behavioral changing methods first.

Note how often your dog licks.,
Pay attention to where they lick.,
Identify damage done by licking.",How to Stop a Dog from Licking Everything4," Dogs often mouth, lick, or suck things to feel their way around the world.Licking themselves or various objects around the house a few times a day is normal. Excessive licking, however, may be a compulsion. If they are sitting at the same spot for long periods of time or if you cannot distract them from their licking, they may have a compulsive disorder.

, Where the dog licks is an important clue to what is causing their problem. Watch to see if they are licking themselves or furniture.


Licking or sucking blankets or bedding may be a result of early weaning.Furniture licking may be a sign of stress, anxiety, or compulsive behavior. Your dog may not have enough stimulation, or they may have other behavioral issues.Licking their anal area could mean that your dog has allergies or a problem with their anal glands.Licking their feet or legs until they lose hair may be Acral Lick Dermatitis.Licking their genital area frequently is normal behavior. As it is harmless, you should not try to correct it., You may notice wet spots on your furniture or places where the fabric has worn thin because of excessive licking. Wood varnish may have disappeared, or there may be faint teeth marks on a chair leg. Before you take action, try to catch your dog in the act. Determine if the dog was really causing the damage before you try to correct the behavior.

Be consistent.",How to Stop a Dog from Climbing up on Things2," Nothing is more tempting to a dog than a pound of sliced bologna sitting on the edge of a counter. Maybe you are making a sandwich and let it there for just a few seconds while you grabbed the bread, but for your dog it was an eternity. That bologna was just too tempting so it jumped up on the counter and then got in trouble.


Put up foods in tupperware containers. Place your bread in a designated basket away from the edge of the counter. Put cookies in the cookie jar and other pastries away in the cabinet. If your dog likes to eat fruit — as some do — move those to a designated place as well.
If your dog has learned how to open cabinet doors, use baby-proof locks to keep them out. Eventually, your dog will learn not to even try and then you can remove the locks., Does your dog love to go sit in your favorite leather armchair? If he does and every time he jumps up on it he leaves little indentations from his nails, just block off the area. Close doors or use baby gates to block off rooms. If you do this early enough — when your dog is first introduced to a space as a puppy or whenever — your dog will soon learn what areas are off limits. Your dog will respect your boundaries, especially if he sees you as the alpha male., If you want your dog in the room, but not on a particular chair, simply place something on it to stop them from climbing up. Pillows don’t really work that well. They might seem like better napping materials. They are also light and can easily be dislodged. Use books, magazines, or baskets to block off these spaces. Whatever you decide to use, just make sure that it is heavy — something a light nudge of the nose won’t knock over.

, Dogs often search out food sources when they are hungry. The source of your dog’s bad behavior might be instinctual more than purely disruptive. Try feeding your dog several small meals a day, following the amount specifications for your sized dog on the back of the package. Hopefully, this will cut down on your dog’s counter surfing.If your dog is on a diet, talk to your veterinarian about a suitable high-fiber food for your dog. He’ll be able to suggest a couple of high-protein, low fat options that will help your dog feel full., Sometimes, dogs cuddle up with their owners on the couch because they're cold or uncomfortable. Create a designated space for your canine companion. Put a blanket on a doggie bed in the corner. Give them a kennel and crate train them. This works especially well with puppies, who will come to love their separate space., Your dog might be climbing up onto things for attention, not for food. Some people enjoy sitting on the couch with their dog’s head on their laps. Others don’t. If you are in the latter group — either because you don’t want to ruin your furniture or your clothes — you should designate other time to spend with your dog. Remember it is a social creature and if you don’t make the time, it will by jump climbing up onto things to get your attention., If your dog is jumping up for attention and you give him attention, he'll learn that this behavior is acceptable. Instead, tell him off and don't pet him. When he has returned to the floor and is calm, feel free to pet him as much as you want. He'll then associate his place on the floor with attention., Too often dog owners will condone certain behavior some times and punish that same behavior later. Don't send mixed signals to your dog. It won't understand the intricacies of your decision making process. You need to make it cut and dry for them. Don't jump on this. Climb on that. Remember that dogs love structure. Give it to them."

Think about how treats could affect your dog's weight.,
Learn which foods are toxic.,
Remind yourself your dog isn't starving.",How to Resist a Begging Dog2," Feeding your dog table scraps can add a number of calories to your dog's diet. That can cause your dog to gain weight over time, particularly if you have a small dog. With a small dog, even a bite or two can be a significant number of calories. Resist feeding your dog's begging by focusing on its future., Many human foods are toxic it to dogs. Knowing which ones could hurt your dog will make it easier to resist feeding your dog food at the dinner table, as many human foods contain ingredients that could harm your dog.Onions, garlic, and chives are probably the most common ingredients that are toxic to your dog. However, other common toxic ingredients include raisins, grapes, xylitol (a sweetener), chocolate, coffee, caffeine, alcohol, and macadamia nuts.
Yeast dough is also a problem because it can bloat in your dog's stomach, which may mean emergency surgery if the dog's intestines twist.
Foods like milk, dairy, nuts, citrus, and coconut oil can cause upset stomach and diarrhea.

, When you're looking at those big, soulful eyes, it's hard to remember that your dog just ate five minutes ago. However, if you remind yourself of that, you may be able to resist your dog's begging better. You're not starving your dog. You're feeding your dog food that's appropriate for it.If you're not sure whether you're feeding your dog enough, talk to your vet about how much your dog needs and what food is best.

You might say, ""think again,"" or a similar phrase in a cheery, but corrective tone of voice. The tone should suggest, ""Are you sure you want to do that?"" Your dog will recognize your tone as much as the words.Remember that your dog is not maliciously trying to disobey you. When your dog does something you don't want him to do, you need to let him know not to repeat this behavior in the future.;
, If the dog continues to do the wrong thing, turn your back or leave the room so that your withdraw attention.Dogs are sociable animals and want to be at the center of things. Being left out or ignored makes them reconsider their actions. If you catch bad behavior early, you can stop it before it's ingrained.For example, if you're teaching your dog a command and he refuses, say, ""think again,"" and turn your back. Your dog should realize that he's done the wrong thing. Turn back around and repeat the initial command. If he still doesn't cooperate, say, ""think again,"" and turn your back. Repeat this until he understands the correct behavior., Once you know how you should react to a disobedient dog, understand what reactions reinforce bad behavior. Sometimes, your dog might be acting badly just to get your attention. By acknowledging your dog or shouting at him, you're accidentally rewarding the behavior with attention. This will make him more likely to repeat the behavior in the future. Remember that even scolding and shouting are rewards to a dog.For example, if the doorbell rings, it may catch your dog off guard making him bark with surprise. If you ignore the bark, he gets no reward and won't bark the next time he hears the bell. But, if he barks and you shout at him to be quiet, you have accidentally rewarded the barking with attention. Now, he'll be more likely to bark the next time he hears the bell.

, Verbal or physical punishment is not an effective way to prevent bad behavior. Instead, your dog will simply learn to fear you. For example, hitting your dog after he urinates in the house might just cause him to hide where he urinates. He may become secretive and disappear to urinate. This won't help you, since you'll spend more time looking for soiled areas in order to clean them up.Your dog doesn't understand physical or verbal punishment. He'll just be confused and hurt, which will damage your relationship.

, Biting is a bad behavior that must be controlled. Teach your dog that biting can hurt people. Do this by giving a high-pitched yelp and removing your hand when your dog nips at you. Take your hand away and stop playing for a few minutes or leave the room. Withdrawing the fun and attention is punishment in terms that your dog will understand. He'll soon associate rough playing with an end to the game and will avoid the behavior.Full-grown dogs that bite might be doing so because they are aggressive, and it will be more difficult to train them to stop without professional help. Consider calling your vet or an obedience trainer for insight.

, Remember that dogs do not misbehave out of malice. If your dog appears to misbehave, such as chewing your shoes, destroying furniture while you're out, or growling at strangers, then the dog has a reason to do so but you haven't figured out what it is yet. Spend some time figuring out why your dog is acting out.For example, if your dog chews the furniture when you are out, he may be doing so because he's bored or anxious at being separated from you.

, Once you've figured out what's causing your dog's bad behavior, try to remove the triggers. Maybe you've found that your dog barks when something excites him, like seeing someone walk down the street or a car drive past. To prevent barking, you might close the curtains.


You can also make arrangements so your dog is less likely to get caught by surprise, which can trigger a lot of bad behavior. For example, if your dog is easily started by a certain trigger, like the mailman, make sure your dog is in the backyard before the mailman comes each day., Use positive reinforcement if your dog plays nicely, responds to commands, or successfully eliminates in the right spot. Offer him treats or shower him praise like, ""good dog!"" in a cheerful voice. Reward the behavior immediately after the action, so your dog creates a positive association. If you reward him too soon or too late, your dog won't understand why he's getting the reward.You may want to keep treats with you to reward good behavior whenever you see it.

, Dogs that are bored or inactive tend to bark more than well-exercised dogs. If your dog spends most of his day inside, he may just jump up, bark, or act out when he finally does get outside or when you get home. Try to let your dog get a walk or run outside for at least an hour every day. Staying active might keep your dog from behaving badly.Make sure the dog has plenty of chew toys. This can keep him active and occupied when he has to remain inside. It can also prevent bad behaviors, like gnawing or chewing things he shouldn't.

, Your dog may engage in bad behaviors if he's feeling stressed or unsure of his surroundings. You can make him feel more secure and relaxed by establishing simple routines. For example, if your dog is inappropriately urinating, start by crate training him and regularly taking him outside to the same spot to urinate. If you do this at set times, he'll learn to associate urinating with the correct spot.You should also feed and play with your dog at regular times. This way, your dog will learn to expect attention and care. He'll be less likely to act out or try to get your attention if he knows that playtime is coming., If you can't figure out what's causing your dog's bad behavior or if your dog's behavior doesn't improve, get the advice of a professional animal behaviorist or pet psychologist. You can ask your veterinarian to recommend someone who's trained, registered and approved.You may also ask your vet to check the dog over for a medical condition that may be causing the bad behavior.


Getting a physical is especially important for older dogs. For example, your dog might have an incontinence issue due to a medical problem. Your vet will be able to diagnose and recommend further medical or behavioral treatment."

Train your dog to sit.,
Leash your dog and ask the dog to sit beside you at the door.,
Slowly open the door.,
Repeat the last step once the dog is again sitting beside you.,
Continue to repeat the opening/closing exercise till the dog figures out that the door only opens when the bum is on the ground.

",How to Prevent a Dog from Door Charging,";
, Allow enough room for you to open the door without forcing your dog to move. This is very important.

, Your dog will likely get up and try to charge through it. When this happens quickly shut the door and wait till the dog sits down. It is best to ignore your dog at this time. If the dog takes too long to sit you can gently encourage the dog to sit the first few times.

, Slowly open the door. If the dog raises from the sit again close the door quickly.

Choose a command to teach.,
Use treats as lures in early training.,
Reward your dog right when he complies.,
Repeat the gesture to reinforce the behavior.",How to Train Your Dog With Silent Signals1," Before you begin your training session, choose one command to focus on with your dog so that he will not be overwhelmed. You may want to start with something simple, such as “sit.”


Commands such as sit, stay, heel, come, and lie down are considered basic obedience commands.These are important commands to teach your dog so that he will be well behaved.;
, By holding a treat in your hand, you can teach your dog to focus on your hand, which is crucial for hand signal training. You can also use the treat to get your dog to move in the direction you want him to go. Choose one of your dog’s favorite treats and grasp it in your hand.


For example, if you want your dog to sit, then you can raise the treat high into the air, so that he looks up at it. If you want him to lie down, then you can lower your hand with the treat in it down to the floor. This will encourage your dog to change his body position to get closer to the treat, such as by sitting or laying down.
Keep in mind that it is important to stop using treats as lures as your dog learns.After using a treat as a lure a few times, try giving the command with the same hand gesture, but with no treat and see if your dog complies.
You can also try using a laser pointer or flashlight to get your dog’s attention.By directing a laser pointer at the ceiling, you can direct your dog’s attention up and this may encourage him to sit. This may be especially helpful for teaching commands like stay and come.

, It is important to mark your dog’s good behavior right when it happens. Otherwise, your dog may not make the connection between the desired behavior and the reward.For example, if your dog complies with your command to sit, then you can mark the behavior with a physical gesture for “good job,” such as clapping your hands and smiling or giving your dog a thumbs up and smiling.Just make sure that you perform this gesture right as your dog’s bottom touches the ground.
Then, make sure that you give your dog a treat or pet your dog to provide some additional reinforcement right away.

, Train the same command at least a few times during each session. This will help to ensure that your dog understands the command. After a few sessions, your dog should be a master of the command and you can start to teach him a different command.


Make sure that everyone in your household uses the same commands and techniques as you do.Otherwise, your dog may get confused.

Buy a harness for your dog.,
Get your dog's favorite toy and treats as leads.,
Start your training in an area with few distractions, and after your dog has already exercised in some way (playing fetch with you, running in the park, etc.),
Every time your dog looks away, say his name excitedly, shake the toy or treat, and say ""Let's go!"",
If the dog gets ahead of you and starts to pull, take a few steps backwards (look behind you, first!),
Use lots of praise with your dog, as long as the leash is loose.,
If your dog is consistently pulling, you may want to try using a head halter; these work very well also if your dog is comfortable wearing it (it may need to be desensitized first).

,
Remember that you need to give your dog enough slack in the leash that is loose when the dog is walking close to you.,
Remember, do not use any harsh discipline like hitting, jerking on the leash or yelling when your dog doesn't follow.",How to Train Your Dog to Walk or Heel Without a Choke Chain," Pulling a dog by the neck using a choke chain is incredibly uncomfortable. Also a tugging dog will deny itself oxygen when it's pulling on the lead. The harness fits under the front legs, across the chest and over the back. It will be much more comfortable for the dog and will give you more control. The lead should clip onto a ring in the middle of the back. There are also front-clip harnesses where the leash attaches at the middle of the dog's chest that can greatly reduce pulling.;
, This will lure your dog into following you around and, it will teach him to hold his head high, since he will be looking at you and the treats.

,

, (excitedly), treat him, and he will keep walking.

, until the dog is moving back towards you again and is at your side. At that time start walking forward again - the dog should be at your side and you should immediately praise and reward your dog.

, He will be happier with praise and a food or toy treat than he will be with any of those alone.

,, If you hold the dog close to your side with a tight leash, it will be very difficult for the dog to learn to walk without pulling.

, Heel is a command that takes being tender, loving, and having patience. If your dog doesn't follow, do step three again, and if he does, but then starts pulling again say a soft yet stern ""No Max"", and continue.

Before you attempt to correct a dog's behavior make certain you have established yourself as the dominant member of the family or pack.,
Never feed your dog from the table, TV tray, or from your plate.,
If you and your dog haven't yet established dominance, this may be a problem area to begin addressing this issue.,
If you've established dominance, you can allow the dog to be in the same room with you but keep put the dog into a down position.,
As my professional trainer told me, you get the dog you deserve.",How to Make Sure Your Dog Won't Eat Your Dinner," If you haven't established your control, you will have a lot more problems than just losing your dinner.;
, Even scraps. And do not allow friends, other family members, or guests to feed the dog from or under the table. This will begin a negative habit, one which the dog will not understand why he is not entitled to your food and also leads to begging.

, If you crate your dog, before serving your food, put the dog into his crate. If you don't crate your dog, place the dog into a tie down position. If you don't use a tie down, place the dog outside, on their dog bed, or in another room.

, If the dog begins to release himself from the down position, use a steady voice to remind him he is in a down. Do not allow the dog release himself from your last command.

, In other words if you are consistent with your dog, and work with them daily, they will be responsive. Don't think just because your dog is trained, your work is done. In the wild, the Alpha dog is constantly being challenged so you need to work with your dog maintaining your dominance. Also a dog who is working is a dog who is not bored. A bored dog tends to engage in negative behavior, in part because you pay attention to the dog during that time period

Begin by showing your dog a treat that will fit inside your hand.,
Say “leave it” in a firm voice.,
Allow the dog to explore your hand.,
Praise him immediately.,
Repeat this as necessary.,
Move the training to the floor.,
Say “leave it” and then place the bait treat on the floor.,
Immediately praise and reward the dog.,
Leave the bait treat in view.,
Try the training standing.",How to Keep Your Dog from Eating Your Cat's Food1," The goal with “leave it” is to teach your dog to leave things alone that you don’t want him to mess with. To accomplish this, you will train him that he will get something better (a tasty treat) when he “leaves it” as you command. Show your dog the treat and let him see what you have.Make sure you have a treat ready for him in your other hand, but don’t let him see this one.;
, Don’t yell at your dog, or you could scare him. Simply say it in a firm voice that makes it clear that you are issuing a command. Then, hold out your hand with your fist closed around the treat.You can also connect a gesture with the command. Since you will be teaching this command with a closed fist, a fist held sideways could be a good gesture.

, Because your dog knows there’s a treat inside your fist, he will probably try to get to it. He may paw at your fist, nose at it, or lick you. Ignore all of this and do not say anything. Wait until your dog stops trying to get at the treat.Usually, once the dog realizes he can’t get at the treat, he’ll stop pawing after a few seconds.

, As soon as your dog stops trying to get at the treat in your fist, praise him and give him the treat you were holding in your other hand. Go over the top with your praise so that your dog knows that you like it when he “leaves it.”, Repeat this exercise at least ten times in a row. You may need to continue the training across several days or even weeks, depending in how quickly your dog catches on.The key is consistency. Praise him and give him a treat as soon as he stops trying to get at the treat in your fist.
You should eventually be able to just show him your closed hand and say “leave it” for him to obey. Your dog will eventually move away from your hand as soon as you say “leave it.”

, Now you will place a treat on the floor and instruct your dog to “leave it.” It’s recommended that you use “high-value” treats (like pieces of cheese or meat) for the reward treats and something less exciting for the “bait” treat that you will place on the floor., Cover the bait treat with your hand. Allow your dog to investigate. Because this is a different situation than the treat in your fist, he may not immediately associate it with the “leave it” command he already knows.Wait until the dog stops trying to get at the bait treat.

, As soon as your dog stops going for the bait treat, praise him enthusiastically and give him a “high-value” reward treat as you remove the bait treat from the floor. This will help teach him that listening to you is more enjoyable than going on his own.You will need to repeat this process more than the simple training. Repeat the process at least 40 times in one session.

, Once you have thoroughly practiced the technique with you removing the bait treat from the floor, you will progress to leaving it on the floor. Tell your dog “leave it” just as before, but this time, hold your hand about an inch or so above the bait treat so that he can see it, but not get at it.


Wait until the dog stops trying to get the treat. Then praise and reward him immediately.
Try to keep the dog from getting the treat off the floor. If he does manage it, show him the “high-value” treat, allow him to smell it, and then withdraw it. This will help teach him that you have better treats than he can get on his own, and he will not get them unless he obeys.

, When your dog is responsive to the “leave it” command with the treat on the floor, it’s time to try it standing up. Put your dog’s leash on and hold it while you stand next to the bait treat on the floor. Tell him to “leave it.” Cover the bait with your foot if the dog tries to grab it.


If the dog does not go for the treat, praise him and give him a “high-value” treat.
With enough repetitions, your dog should learn to look at you when you say “leave it” in anticipation of a tasty treat, ignoring the bait treat altogether.

Feed your dog its own food during dinner.,
Provide a distraction.,
Separate the dog from the dinner table.,
Never feed your dog from the table.",How to Resist a Begging Dog3," Your dog considers your family to be its pack, and your dog likes to eat with its pack. One way you can make your dog feel more included while not giving into begging is to feed your dog its food while everyone else is eating. Plus, it gives your dog a distraction, at least for a little while., If a standard meal isn't distraction enough, you can try a different kind of distraction, such as a food puzzle toy. These toys make your dog work for its food or treats, which keeps it entertained.If your dog still comes up to the table, you can tether it to a heavy piece of furniture in the same room. Just don't leave your dog alone, as it could cause harm to itself with the tether.

, One way to discourage begging is to put your dog in another part of the house. For instance, you can put your dog behind a baby gate away from the table or put it in another part of the house and close the door.Another option is to put the dog in its crate, if you've crate trained your dog.

, While you can feed your dog the occasional ""human food"" treat (as long as it's a safe food, like bland chicken), never feed the dog from the table. That teaches your dog that it can expect to be fed in the future from the table, encouraging begging. If you want to feed your dog a bit after dinner, take the food over to its bowl to feed the dog."

Use bite sized treats.,
Give treats less frequently as your dog learns.,
Keep the training sessions short.,
Be consistent with training sessions.",How to Train Your Dog With Silent Signals2," You may want to select treats that are small to avoid giving your dog too many extra calories and to keep him motivated. If the treat is large, then you can cut it in half or quarters. It is important to only give your dog small rewards to keep him motivated. Otherwise, he may wander off to enjoy his treat and lose interest in continuing the training session.


Pea-sized treats are ideal because they will add only a few calories and your dog will want more, so he will probably be more willing to work. You can even try giving your dog a single piece of his dry food as a reward., To keep your dog motivated, you will also need to reduce the frequency of the treats. Otherwise, your dog may expect a treat every time he obeys a command and the treats may become more like a bribe than a reward.Start giving him treats every other time he performs the command, and work up to only giving him a treat at the end of the session.

, Keeping training sessions short will also help to ensure that your dog complies with your commands. If you train your dog for too long, then he might begin to lose interest or become frustrated.


Try to keep the training sessions at around 10 to 15 minutes, or less if your dog has a really short attention span.

, Giving and reinforcing command often will also help to ensure that your dog gets the most out of the training sessions. Try to train your dog every day. You do not have to train him in the same place or at the same time, but training him every day will increase the effectiveness of the training.


Training your dog in different rooms of your house as well as outside is also a good idea because it will reduce the chance that he will associate the commands with a single location."

Put your dog on a leash when you take him out.,
Use vibrations to communicate with him.,
Touch your dog to let him know you are nearby.,
Consider working with a dog trainer.",How to Train Your Dog With Silent Signals3," Deaf dogs can wander off or get into dangerous situations because they cannot hear. Likewise, if the environment is loud and busy, then even a dog with perfect hearing might get distracted and wander off. To keep your dog safe when you go out with him, make sure that you always keep him on a leash or inside of an enclosed area.You may still need to use a leash at some enclosed spaces, such as at a dog park. Otherwise, you may find it hard to communicate with your dog when there are so many distractions around.

, Within your home, you can take advantage of vibrations to get your dog’s attention. By knocking on a wall, stomping on the floor, or thumping on a table, you can get your dog’s attention from a different room in the house.If you want your dog to come when you create vibrations, then make sure that you praise and reward him for coming when you do these things.
You can also purchase vibration collars to get your dog’s attention. These collars vibrate gently when you push a remote control button.They are available in pet stores.

, Giving your dog a gentle touch on the back is also a good way to avoid startling him when you are nearby. Make sure that you touch your dog gently, such as by patting him softly on the head or softly stroking his back.For example, you might use gentle touch to alert your dog that you are in the room with him or that you are about to pass him in the hallway.

, If you are struggling to communicate with your dog, then you may want to schedule a session with a professional dog trainer. A professional dog trainer can help you to identify your dog’s challenges and find ways to help you communicate more effectively with your dog.


If your dog is deaf, then try to find a trainer who has experience working with deaf dogs.

Wait until your dog starts eating the cat's food.,
Tell your dog to “leave it.” Using the command you’ve taught your dog, show your dog the gesture as you say “leave it” in a firm (but not yelling) voice.,
Use a spray bottle to discourage your dog from eating the cat food.,
Startle your dog with a loud noise when he eats the cat food.,
Reward the dog when he eats his own food.,
Avoid yelling.",How to Keep Your Dog from Eating Your Cat's Food2," To effectively train your dog to not eat the cat food, you have to wait until he actually does it to discipline him. Otherwise, he won't understand what he did wrong and the training won't work. When you put down the cat food, wait a few minutes and see if the dog goes for it. If he does so, then take corrective action., If your dog does not respond, you may need to use other tactics to create a negative association between an unpleasant (but not harmful) experience and eating cat food.

, A spray bottle can startle your dog so he'll associate eating the cat's food with an unpleasant (but harmless) experience and will not want to do it anymore.

Fill a spray bottle with water and keep it near the cat's bowl so you can reach it easily.
Wait for your dog to go for the cat food. Then take the spray bottle and send 2 squirts toward the dog.

, In addition to using a spray bottle to discourage the dog, you could also get a similar effect from startling the dog with a loud noise.This is supposed to scare your dog so he will be discouraged from eating the cat food again.

A few things you could use are a coffee can filled with coins, a whistle, or a magazine smacked against the table.
Wait until your dog goes for the cat food and then make the loud, startling noise.
Try to make it so that the dog does not know you are the source of the sound. You want him to respond negatively to the sound, not to you.

, The other side of dog training is rewarding behavior that you want to continue. When the dog eats his own food from his own dish, pile on the praise. Tell him he is a “good boy” and pet him (if he will allow it while he is eating -- some dogs will not)., Yelling at your dog is ineffective, as he is unlikely to make the connection between you yelling and his eating. It could just make your dog decide that he’s scared of you, in which case he will wait until you are not there to eat the cat food."
"
Feed your cat and dog at the same time every day.,
Consider switching to wet cat food.,
Use a feeding game.,
Place the cat food in a separate room from the dog food.",How to Keep Your Dog from Eating Your Cat's Food3," The ASPCA recommends that you feed your cat twice a day in controlled portions.This helps your cat avoid overeating. If you feed your dog at the same time as your cat, the dog may be too distracted by his own food to go for the cat’s.Leaving dry cat food out for your cat all the time will allow her to graze, but this eating behavior can actually be unhealthy for cats because they may not get enough exercise to balance the calories they consume.“Free feeding” is also associated with feline diabetes.However, free feeding may resemble a cat’s natural feeding behavior more, so if your cat has no problems maintaining her weight with free feeding, go ahead and let her graze.
Feeding your cat in a “timed feeding” session can help you manage your cat’s eating habits. Put the food out and if the cat doesn't eat it after 30 minutes, put it away. Your cat will learn that if he doesn't eat, the food won't be out all day. This will teach him to eat right away, giving the dog less of a chance to steal his food., Cats can usually eat wet food faster than dry food. If your cat struggles to finish eating before the dog comes and takes his meal, try switching to wet food. This way, he can finish eating quickly, before the dog can get to his food.If you free feed your cat, you can’t leave wet cat food out all the time or it will spoil.

, There are several feeding “puzzle” games that you can purchase (or make at home) that will turn your cat’s mealtime into a fun game. Simply fill the puzzle game with dry food and introduce it to your cat.


This method may also make it more difficult for your dog to get at the food.
To make a puzzle game at home, try cutting some small holes in a plastic water or soda bottle. Fill the bottle with dry food (but not all the way). Your cat will get pieces of kibble as she bats the bottle around.

, Putting the dog and cat food next to each other could lead to the dog scaring away the cat and taking his food. Separate the food by placing them in different rooms. This will let the cat eat in peace without getting interrupted by the dog."
"
Place your cat's food somewhere high that your dog can't reach.,
Block off the cat's food with a gate.,
Install a cat door.,
Try an electronic cat feeder.,
Designate a room as the cat room.",How to Keep Your Dog from Eating Your Cat's Food4," Cats can usually reach higher areas than dogs can, so take advantage of this by placing your cat's food out of the dog's reach. Try up on a counter or on a cat post. That way your dog won't be able to reach the food and your cat can eat in peace.This method will also ensure that your cat has to “work” a little for her food, which will help keep her healthy., If your dog is small enough, a gate should successfully block him from the cat food. The cat should be able to climb or jump over this gate to reach her food.Some special gates have a cat hole, just big enough for the cat to get through. Consider this option if your cat is unable to get over a gate blocking her food.
You could also use a baby gate to block off a doorway and set it a few inches off the ground. This will give the cat room to squeeze through, but your dog won't be able to unless he's very small.

, Like a gate, a cat door will block off a doorway and stop the dog from getting through. The door has a flap that the cat will fit through, but that most dogs will be too big for. Look for one of these in a pet store or on the internet.This will only work if your cat is smaller than your dog(s). If the dog is the same size as your cat, obviously, this won’t work.

, There are some products that electronically block off your cat's food. They operate through a microchip or electronic tag that your cat wears. A sensor on the feeder will recognize your cat and open when the cat approaches. It will then close when the cat leaves. This can be an expensive option, but it will prevent your dog from taking the cat's food without you watching him all the time.Make sure that your dog doesn’t become a bully. Some dogs may sit in wait for the feeder to open for the cat, then bully the cat out of the way. Observe the feeding several times and discourage any bad behavior.

, If your dog has a habit of pestering your cat, it might be good to give the cat a room to himself. Place his food, water, litter box, and toys in here and block off the entrance with a gate that your dog can't get over or under. That way your cat can retreat in here to rest whenever he wants."

Reinforce verbal commands.,
Try clicker training with your dog.,
Teach your dog impulse control.,
Make your dog steady or settle.,
Resist the urge to give negative attention.,
Seek professional help.,
Control your dog's barking.,
Change the way you interact with an anxious dog.,
Introduce your excitable dog to other dogs.,
Block out exciting distractions.,
Exercise your dog.,
Give your dog breaks from playing or exercising.",How to Train Your Dog to Be Calm," Verbal commands are the first line of defense for a dog that is overly-excited. Start by teaching your dog simple commands in non-distracting places that will teach them to focus on you instead of distractions. For example, teach your dog to touch your hand or look you in the eye on command. Once your dog becomes more manageable, you can begin to teach more advanced commands such as ""settle"" or ""stop"".Make sure you use an appropriate volume and tone of voice when giving verbal commands. You need to capture your dog's attention and give it a firm command, not a timid suggestion.


""Watch me"" is the single most important command you can teach an over excited dog. Simply say your dog's name, followed by ""watch me"" (or ""focus"") and then give a treat when your dog looks you in the eye.Over time, with consistent training, your dog will learn to look to you for a treat rather than at a distraction.
Verbal commands like ""sit,"" ""lie down,"" and ""stay"" should also all be reinforced until your dog can act on command. You may lure your dog treats, but withhold them until your dog complies with your commands.
Practice giving commands to your dog while you are in different positions, such as standing or crouching. If you always give commands while sitting, your dog may only listen when you're in a seated position.
Similarly, you should practice giving verbal commands in all rooms of the house and various outdoor locations. Your dog should feel comfortable following commands anywhere and at any time before you can expect compliance in various scenarios.
Don't keep your hands in your pockets. Your dog may associate a hand in the pocket with a reward, and you want your command to be the thing that makes your dog listen (not just a hand rustling for treats).
Do give a lot of treats, especially when your dog is just learning a new command or returning to an old command you haven't practiced in a while.;
, Clicker training is a helpful way to teach your dog new commands and reinforce old ones. A clicker may be helpful for overly-excited dogs who won't sit or remain calm in certain situations.You can buy a clicker at most pet stores or through an online retailer.


Start with a command your dog already knows, like ""sit"" or ""down.""
Give them command and press the clicker as soon as your dog complies, then immediately offer a treat.
The clicker should be used to reinforce your dog's action, while the treat is given to reward the position your dog complies with (for example, sitting).

, Many excitable dogs benefit from impulse control training. Impulse control forces your dog to resist the urge to do whatever it wants and instead defer to your command.Try the ""say hi"" command before petting your dog. Have your dog sit, say the phrase ""say hi,"" and if your dog doesn't jump you can pet it and offer a treat.Train your dog to wait before eating its food. Have your dog sit and lower the food halfway to the ground, and if your dog starts to go for the food before you've set it down and said ""okay"" you'll start over.Teach your dog the ""leave it"" command by holding a tasty treat in your closed hand so your dog can smell it but not eat it. Any time you say ""leave it"" and your dog ignores the stimulus you're trying to avoid, praise your dog and give the treat as a reward., Steady and settle are both good commands to teach an over-excited dog. Steady works best when you're out walking your dog on leash, while settle works best for when you're at home in a familiar setting.Steady - give your dog's leash some slack, and say ""steady"" if it starts to pull. If your dog stops and lets the leash slacken again, praise it and give a treat; if not, repeat until your dog gets the hint.
Settle - choose a designated spot for your dog to settle, like the dog's bed, mat, or kennel. Call your dog to the spot and say ""settle"" when your dog needs to calm down (you may need treats until your dog learns that this is its spot).

, If your dog is behaving badly, you may be tempted to yell at your dog or put your dog in ""time out."" Logically, being yelled at should be unpleasant for a dog. However, your dog sees any attention from you - even negative attention like yelling/scolding - as a type of reward for the bad behavior you're yelling about. Over time, this actually reinforces the bad behavior.The best way to respond when your dog is seeking attention is to just ignore the bad behavior.
Some pet experts recommend waiting as long as it takes for your dog to tire itself out or get bored with its own bad behavior. It may take a while, but your dog will eventually tire itself out (at which point you should praise your dog for stopping).

, If training at home doesn't help your dog behave more calmly, you may need to enlist the help of a professional. You can find training professionals in your area by searching online, checking the phone book, or asking your veterinarian for a recommendation.In addition to one-on-one training, there are also a number of group classes that deal with both training and socialization.
Make sure the training specialists you work with use positive reinforcement, not negative reinforcement.

, One of the most common behaviors of excitable dogs is barking excessively. If your dog will not stop barking and is incapable of calming down, you may be able to break this bad habit out of your dog with exposure and behavioral techniques.Remove the motivation by taking your dog away from whatever it's barking at. For example, if your dog barks at passersby in the yard, bring your dog inside immediately.
Try ignoring your dog's barking. Turn your back when your dog starts barking, ignore it until the barking stops, and when it stops praise your dog and offer a reward.
Desensitize your dog to the stimulus by introducing your dog to the person or dog it barks at. Feed your dog plenty of treats to distract it until the person or dog is close enough to greet calmly.
Teach your dog the ""quiet"" command by repeating the word ""quiet"" and holding up a treat. When your dog stops barking and sits calmly, praise your dog and offer the treat.

, Some dogs become incapable of remaining calm when their humans leave. This is usually due to separation anxiety. While you cannot ensure that your dog will remain calm every time, there are steps you can take to get your dog more comfortable with you leaving the house.Ignore your dog for about 15 to 30 minutes before you leave the house. Grab your keys and put on your shoes about a half hour before you actually leave so that your dog won't associate these things with the fear of being alone.
When you're ready to depart, don't make a big deal about it or fuss over your dog in an effort to say goodbye. When you return, greet your dog calmly and quietly, and don't pet your dog until it's calmed down and behaving better.
As you leave, offer your dog a tasty treat that will distract it for at least 20 minutes after you leave. A hollow toy (like a Kong or a hollow ball) stuffed with treats or time-consuming food like peanut butter will distract your dog until you've left the house.
Put away the distracting toy when you return home. Don't take it out again until the next time you leave the house - that way your dog will come to see it as a special (and delicious) goodbye toy.

, Some dogs are perfectly calm around people but become highly excitable around other dogs. This may be a problem with socialization or it may be caused by the dog's upbringing. Setting up a calm, low-pressure introduction is generally the best way for an excitable dog to meet other dogs.Introduce the dogs in a neutral area. Avoid introducing them at one of the dog owners' homes, yard, or favorite park, as one or both dogs may get very territorial.
Have each dog on a leash with some slack. Remain calm and relaxed to put both dogs at ease.
If the dogs have not been hostile, it should be safe to let the dogs off leash in an enclosed area. Keep a watchful eye, though, and immediately remove the dogs if one or both becomes aggressive.
If one dog tries to ""bully"" the other, it's usually okay to stand back and let them work it out (provided that neither dog is being aggressive or violent). This is a normal part of play, but it should be closely monitored to ensure both dogs' safety.

, An excitable dog may need to be separated from exciting distractions in order to remain calm. Some situations are more difficult to control than others, but generally you can take steps at home to calm your dog's excitable behavior.Close your dog out of the front room if outside sounds from your street or sidewalk get your dog excited.
If your dog gets worked up at the sound of the school bus or garbage truck passing by, try playing music or using a white noise machine to block out some of the sounds for your dog.

, One of the best ways to make an overly-excited dog calm is by getting exercise together. This will help reduce boredom and over excitement (which can both trigger undesirable behavior) while simultaneously keeping your dog healthy.


Try to walk your dog at least one mile every day.Aim for at least two 30-minute walks or three 20-minute walks daily.If your dog is well-behaved, you can also try taking your dog running, hiking, or even bicycling. If your dog isn't so well-behaved yet, you can let your dog run off-leash in a fenced-in yard or park.

, While exercise and play time are tremendously important for your dog's wellbeing (and may also help your dog calm down), too much uninterrupted fun can wind your dog up. Try to take breaks periodically and frequently while playing catch, engaging in tug-of-war, or jogging around the neighborhood so your dog can calm down intermittently.There's no firm ratio or frequency of break time during play time. Try to monitor your dog, and any time it seems like your pet is getting overly excited or hyper you'll need to head inside for a break.

The best time to try a training session is after he or she has exercised vigorously. Try running your dog around the yard, playing a game of fetch or giving your dog a brisk walk in order to burn off the nervous, unproductive energy that we call hyperactivity.


It's most likely that your dog won’t be able to focus until it is physically pooped out.;
, After your dog has expended some energy, then do a short training session. Start with training sessions that are less than 5 minutes and then expand to 10 minutes as the dog is able to focus on you.

, This will work the best with a hyper dog. A positive reinforcement in the form of a small piece of a tasty treat or lavish praise is given immediately when the dog obeys the command.


If you do not reward immediately the dog will quickly lose interest in working with you and won’t be able to understand what you expect.
It is best to train the dog in an area with few distractions: a fenced in back yard with no other animals or humans or a quiet room in the house.
Small, tasty treats of slivers of cheese or tiny cubes of cooked chicken should be kept handy at all times when training your hyper dog. A plastic baggie can be easily stashed in a pocket. Some people even wear fanny packs worn with the pouch in front to keep the treats in.
Once the dog consistently obeys your commands start giving the treats intermittently along with tons of praise until you phase the treats out. At this point the dog is obeying you because it wants to please you. Remind it that you are pleased with it with occasional praise to reinforce training.

, Short one or two command words need to be used. Any longer will only confuse the dog and make you frustrated due to its lack of understanding. Give the command in a friendly voice and always praise your dog for any attempt in the right direction, no matter how small.


Absolutely never hit or yell at your dog or you will lose its respect and make it afraid of you.

, The first lesson to teach your hyper dog is the meaning of 'no' or 'stop'. You can use either one but use one consistently.


You need to always be firm and consistent when using this command.
Once you have said ‘no’ or ‘stop’ immediately move your dog away from whatever it is doing and once again say ‘no’ or 'stop'. Keep repeating until your dog stops and obeys you consistently.

, You will need to teach your dog not to bite and chew during play if it has this habit. To begin with, help the dog avoid the temptation. Have plenty of toys available for your dog to chew on instead of chewing on people or things they shouldn't be chewing.


If the dog does nip at you tap his nose lightly with your free hand and say “No bite.” As you pull your hand from the dog’s mouth, be sure to put a toy in its mouth and encourage it to bite the toy instead.
If at all times if you do not feel safe consult a veterinary behaviorist (your veterinarian can guide you) for advice.
Chewing is a natural behavior but a destructive habit. Diversion works well in these cases. If you find your puppy chewing on an unacceptable object, take the item away, put it out reach and give the puppy a toy to chew on. As you take the item away, say “no chew” and give them a toy to chew on. The dog will eventually understand what it can and cannot chew., Jumping on people can be a problem with hyper dogs. They generally do so to get your attention. Many times they also jump up during play, which can knock over and potentially injure people especially children, the disabled, and the elderly.


If your hyper dog is a jumper, keep a leash on it to be able to correct it as it starts to jump and then give it the command to sit. Reward the dog when it promptly responds with a tasty treat. It will soon learn that jumping is not an appropriate behavior to display around people., Dogs that sit promptly make feeding, grooming and, relaxing a joy. It is a simple command that most dogs learn easily. Have your dog stand in front of you and place a treat in your hand, letting your dog see it in your palm. Firmly say 'sit' in a friendly voice, while pushing the dog’s rear end down until it sits. Give the treat immediately along with praise.


Repeat this process by stepping away from your dog, turn to face it, and telling it to sit. Continue to push the dog's rear down and praise it as you did before until it sits on its own.
Work on the sit command for a few days until it is sitting promptly and consistently without the treat reward.

, Once your hyper dog has learned to sit you can teach it the ‘down’ command. Have your dog sit while putting a treat in your hand. Making sure the dog knows you have the treat in your hand, put your hand near the dog's nose. While moving your hand to the floor say ‘down’ or ‘lay down.’ The dog should follow your hand to the floor by starting to lay down.


As soon as the dog lays down, even if it’s a partial attempt, give the treat and praise.
Practice this command until the dog is going down consistently. Practice this new command for up to a week until the dog has thoroughly learned ‘down.’

, Teaching a dog to stay will help you control your hyper dog even further. Tell your dog to 'sit', praise it when it obeys, and put your hand in front of the dog's face, wide open like a stop sign. Firmly say 'stay,' then back away slowly.


Most likely the dog will run up it to you but command it to sit again. Then put your hand in front of the dog once again, say 'stay,' and back away while repeating stay.
If the dog runs up to you, you will have to repeat it again.
Once the dog stays don't let it come to you. Instead you go to the dog, praise it, and give it a treat. Repeat this process while going farther away from her than you did the previous time until your dog consistently obeys this command.

, A very important command for your hyper dog to learn is ‘come.” A dog with a solid response to the ‘come’ command can be quickly recalled to your side if it is ever going towards danger or is acting hyper when it shouldn’t.Start teaching this command when your dog is away from you, perhaps playing or sniffing around the yard or house. Crouch down, slap your thighs and say ‘come’ in a friendly voice. Your dog will think you are playing and will run to you eager to play with you. Reward it with a little treat and lots of praise.
Work on this command at for a few weeks at different times when your dog is distracted, yet receptive to training. If it is off in the distance, slap your thighs and say 'come!' in a happy voice. Once it comes to you, praise it and repeat the word 'come!' a few times.
At this point throw a treat and or a toy a short distance from you, and tell your dog to 'come' after it chases it down. Be persistent. If necessary, always have a treat or a toy that the dog loves more than the one you threw. Wave it to the dog once it looks up and say 'come!' Once it returns to you, praise and repeat.
Work on this important command once a day until your dog has it down solidly.

, Although you might want your dog to bark when people come to your home, it should also learn the ‘quiet’ command to quit barking when you want it to. Keep treats handy so that when the dog starts to bark you can take one out and say ‘quiet.’


Draw the dog's attention to the treat and when it stops barking immediately give the reward. This will help the dog associate the word “quiet” with stopping barking. It may take a while but eventually it’ll understand that you expect it to hush when you say quiet. Consistency and patience are key to making this work for both of you.

Start in an area with few distractions.,
Grab a small but tasty dog treat or biscuit.

,
Show the dog the treat clearly.,
When the dog's bottom end hits the floor, say ""Yes!"",
Keep practicing until the dog is anticipating the movement and sitting as you start to move the treat.

At this point, say ""Sit"" just before you go through the motion and say yes/click the clicker.

,
After several repetitions, leave the treat on the table but hold your hand in the same position and guide the dog through the motion in the same way.,
Gradually, over several more repetitions, transform your hand movement from ""holding a treat"" to a sit signal (whatever you choose it to be; sweeping the open hand, palm up, up and out from you, is common).

,
Also, you may hold a dog treat above the dog.,
When you trust the dog, you may teach it with the actual command, ""Sit!""",How to Train a Dog to Sit (Treat and Click Method)," If you are in a safe, enclosed space, you do not need a leash. Also, make sure you have a good bond with your dog.;
,, Hold it right in front of the dog's nose, and slowly move it to above his head (aim for the spot between the ears). The dog should follow the treat with his nose, and, if it is held low enough, most dogs will naturally sit down. If the dog does not naturally sit with the lure, add gentle down pressure to the hips.

, and/or click a clicker, hand over the treat, and say ""good girl/boy!""

Lock the doors.,
Disable power windows.,
Get a crate that is certified as safe.,
Have a pet travel kit.,
Reserve the front seat for humans.,
Get your dog used to car travel gradually.",How to Travel Safely with Your Dog in the Car1," In this day and age, most cars have power locks. This translates to a safety risk for smart pets. If your dog unlocks the doors and you’re not aware of it, he is then at risk of exiting the vehicle while it’s moving. Even if your dog is crated the entire trip in the car, accidents can occur.


It may seem silly to think of a dog opening a car door, but sometimes cars have very easy access handles. Curious paws can get tangled in them and the door can open when your dog tries to pull free.
Even if you keep your dog crated in the car at all times, there may come a day that you don’t latch it all the way and your dog gets loose. This is dangerous because while driving, you have no control over a loose dog.;
, Most modern cars are equipped with a button that can turn off all the power windows. This is a wise button to push if you have a loose dog in the car. A dog can easily push a window button accidentally, exposing themselves to a dangerous escape route.This button is often located on the driver’s side window control panel in the door. It may have a drawing of a window with an “X” over it. This indicates that it turns off the power windows.
Even if you crate your dog, they may be a time when you don’t latch it all the way. If your dog gets out of the crate when you are driving, having the windows locked provides peace of mind.

, Get a well ventilated, crash-tested crate for your dog to ride in. Make sure that your dog can turn around, stand, sit down, and lie down inside. Situate the crate near the back of your vehicle and position it so that it won’t move around. Keeping the crate from moving around when you break can minimize your dog’s feelings of carsickness. Place luggage, blankets, and other bulky items around the crate to secure it in place.
Make sure there is nothing in the crate that can harm your dog, such as extra leashes or collars. These are choking hazards., Prepare a dog traveling kit to keep on hand in the car. This kit should have enough materials for both short and long road trips. Just like you would pack a road trip bag for your child, include snacks, a favorite toy, a favorite pillow, and so on.Also include a first aid kit, a watering bowl, travel documents (proof of veterinary certification, proof of rabies shot, etc.), and medications, and a waste scoop and doggie bags for bathroom stops.
Don’t feed or water your pet while on the move.
Use bottled water. Some dogs have sensitive stomachs and can’t handle water in new places very well.
Administer snacks on breaks only, and make sure they are high in protein., Even if you decide to leave your dog out of a crate inside the vehicle, make sure they stay out of the front seats. This is because of the airbag situation. If an airbag deploys on your dog, it will likely injure them.If you do keep your dog loose in the car, make sure to buckle them in. Put your dog in a specially designed safety harness, which allows you to buckle the seat belt directly into the harness., If your dog has never been on a car ride, it is helpful to gradually get them used to being in the car. Start with taking short trips around the block. Every time you get in the car, go a little bit further until your dog is able to handle trips across town. Eventually your dog may be ready for long road trips.

Use prevention techniques.,
Teach your dog associated commands.",How to Tell Your Dog No," The goal of teaching your dog any command is to help her associate the command with the desired behavior while strengthening the connection with positive reinforcement. To teach her “no” or “leave it,” begin by showing her the behavior you want.


For example, show her a treat in your hand, and then say “no” before closing your fist around the treat. Let her sniff and lick at your hand, but don’t give her the treat. Once she stops trying and turns away, offer her plenty of praise and provide a treat from your other hand—not the enclosed one.Use a stern voice to issue the command, but don’t yell or otherwise make your dog think you’re punishing her. Use a neutral, stern voice as opposed to the happy voice you usually use with your dog, so she doesn’t mistake the command for positive reinforcement.;
, You can anticipate repeating this exercise ten times or even more before your dog understands that she gets the treat by leaving your closed hand alone.Stay patient with the process, and always offer plenty of praise when she eventually leaves the closed hand alone (shows the desired behavior).


Space the trials out as well to stop both of you from getting frustrated. Try a few times a day over the course of several days., Your dog will understand body language just as much as a command. Stand tall and issue the command in an authoritative voice, but don’t try to scare your dog. You want her to want to understand and obey the command instead of simply frightening her.

, You don’t just want your dog to leave the object alone, but you want her to turn her attention to you when you issue the command. This will allow you to tell her “no” to stop a behavior but then also “come” in case the object you want her to leave is dangerous, for instance. Once she understands that “no” means to leave the object alone, you can add more complexity to the command to turn her attention to you.


Instead of immediately offering praise when she turns away from your enclosed fist, don’t say or do anything. Since this isn’t what she expects to happen, she’ll look up at you for instruction. As soon as she does, offer the praise and the treat (still from your opposite hand).Repeat the exercise until your dog immediately looks up and makes eye contact with you when you say “no” instead of staring at your fist for several seconds before looking to you. This may require lots of repetitions—up to forty or fifty.You can make her focus and show even more self-control by slowly increasing the amount of time she needs to keep eye contact with you before offering the praise and treat., “No” is easier when your dog can’t reach the treat anyway (when it’s in your fist). The next step is to place the treat on the floor with your hand guarding the treat rather than completely enclosing it.You may have to start with your hand completely around the treat, but over several repetitions, begin lifting your hand until she stops when you say “no” even with the treat in the open.To help make this successful, use a treat she likes but doesn’t love on the floor. Reserve her favorite type of treat for when you provide the praise and treat when she leave the one of the floor alone.Be very consistent with the positive reinforcement.
Remember that you should wait to provide the treat until your dog looks at you when you say “no.”The process will require patience and lots of repetitions.

, The final test for your dog is to ensure that she can still repeat the behavior in a less controlled environment. Begin using the command in a variety of other settings instead of just in the home. Tell her “no” outside while other exciting things are going on. When she regularly obeys under these circumstances, that’s when you know she has full command of the order.


For instance, hide a treat along your walking path before you actually take your dog out for a walk. When she gets a whiff of it and begins heading toward it, issue the command and keep walking. If she pulls at her leash toward the treat, then stop out of range. Wait for her to stop pulling and to look up at you, then offer plenty of praise and give her a treat from your pocket—not the one you planted., As your dog begins obeying the command regularly, decrease the instances where you provide a treat while still providing all of the praise for obeying the order. She will continue to obey even if you only provide a treat once every four or five times she responds to the command as long as you remain consistent with the other aspects of positive reinforcement.

, A rambunctious dog full of pent-up energy is much more likely to disobey or have self-control issues. Aim to give your dog a thirty-minute walk each day at a brisk pace for active breeds., You simply cannot always be around to tell your dog “no,” so set her up for success by removing the items she’s not supposed to get into. Put plants and fragile items on high shelves, keep shoes behind a door, and keep clothing off the floor.


This is also a great precaution to take even when you are home while she’s still learning the command and doesn’t yet always obey.

, Once your dog understands and obeys “no,” then she’ll know to resist the temptation of the forbidden object, but only for a short time. Rather than telling your dog “no” over and over, she to distract her with something else, such as her favorite toy or a walk.For instance, say your dog consistently keeps trying to get up on the couch. Rather than saying “no” over and over all afternoon, say it once. Then say, “Where’s your toy?” Proceed to go get her favorite toy and toss it or play tug-o-war with it for a moment. Her attention will shift away from the sofa.
Distraction is another great step to take while your dog is still learning the no command. Make sure to interrupt your dog before she actually displays the undesired behavior—when she sniffs at the couch or paces in front of it, for example. Otherwise, she might begin to associate you playing with the toy with her as praise for the behavior.

, While your dog is still learning or if she’s having trouble with consistency, then you can also use prevention measures. If it is furniture that is a problem (for instance), look for dog repellent sprays such as orange oil or bitter apple and spray around the vicinity of the furniture or objects that the dog seeks out.Make sure to check an inconspicuous spot on the object first to make sure the repellent spray doesn’t damage the item.
There are also electrical mats or chargers that you can place on or around items. If your dog comes in the vicinity (shock collar type) or touches the object (direct contact type), the mat or charger will give the dog a slight shock to deter him from coming in contact with the article.

, While “no” is a good preventative command to teach your dog, it might not always apply, especially if your dog proceeds to follow through with the behavior anyway. For these instances, it helps also to teach your dog other associated commands that you can use to help her understand the behavior you expect from her.


For instance, if you tell her “no” before she runs across the yard, but she runs off anyway, then it’s beneficial for your dog to respond to a command like “come.” You can begin teaching this command by saying it before making your dog chase you and then offering positive reinforcement.You can find more information on teaching your dog this command at How to Train a Dog to Come

Similarly, teaching your dog “down” if she jumps up on people after being told “no” can also help. To do so, completely ignore her as she jumps up on you except for issuing the command “down,” and then give her plenty of treats and praise as soon as all four of her paws are back down on the floor.This is more effective than pushing her off, which she can mistake for play.

Most people, however, will find that treats are the most effective way to teach a dog. The best treats will be ones your dog loves, and which are also easy to carry, easy to break into pieces, and healthy.Use a variety of treats so your dog doesn’t get bored.Try:String cheese sticks.
Cooked chicken.
Meat rolls (available at pet stores).
Broken-up dog biscuits or store-bought training treats.
Baby carrots or frozen green beans (for dogs on a diet).;
, In clicker training, you use a sound (the clicker) to let your dog know when she has done something right. The clicker is very effective because it is a consistent, unique sound, different from your voice. However, you can also say “good” or “yes” as a signal if you don’t have a clicker.Load your clicker first. Get a treat in your hand. If your dog tries to get it, just close your hand. Click and offer it to your dog. Repeat a few minutes later. Then again. Continue until your dog comes immediately at the sound of the clicker and expects a treat., This will make her more likely to bark. Play a game that gets her excited like fetch or tug., Now that your dog is primed for barking, grab the reward. Let your dog see it, then hide it behind your back., Hopefully your energy, your dog’s excitement, and the treat behind your back will result in a bark. If not, you may need to show the treat again, or even hold it out but not let them have it. Your dog will be confused, which often leads to barking, but be prepared to wait. It may take 5 minutes or more. Be patient. When your dog does bark, click or say “yes” and reward her with the toy or treat.If your dog does not bark, you might try your own barking to encourage her., Now that your dog knows barking will get her treats, name the behavior. Try to say “speak” or “talk” just before she barks. You might also consider adding a hand signal, since dogs learn visual cues more quickly than spoken ones. Practice several times saying “speak” or “talk” just before your dog barks.Be sure to keep your voice at the same tone and volume each time you say “speak.” They will associate that tone with the command, making it easier to learn., Now that your dog is starting to associate a word with barking, say “speak” or “talk” and wait for her to bark. Be sure to say the command only once.When your dog barks, offer a reward. Continue doing this practice for about ten minutes a day until they have mastered the command.Be sure not to practice too long. You dog will learn better if training is fun. If she starts to lose interest, stop., Treats are a great way to teach a behavior, but once the behavior is learned, continuing to give treats actually distracts your dog and slows response time. Start phasing out treats as soon as your dog responds correctly.Gradually increase the number of correct responses before you give a treat. Begin by offering a treat only every other time. Then every third time. When you feel your dog has mastered barking on command, see how many responses you can get without a treat. Work your way up to 10 or 20.Also increase the amount of time you wait before you reward. The idea is to break gradually break the link between completing the command and food.Substitute other rewards for food. Once your dog can bark on command 10 or more times without a treat, start working in short training sessions with no food. After several successful responses, praise your dog, pet her, and play with her. The goal is to start replacing treats with other rewards.It is okay to keep giving occasional, unpredictable treats to sharpen behavior., Once your dog has mastered barking on command in the calm of your home, try at the park or on walks."

, If you don't have a clicker, a retractable pen will work the same. Eventually the dog will respond to the 'click' sound and know that treats will follow. Use any small treat that can be eaten quickly without much chewing. For example, Goldfish snack crackers work very well. Anything small that your dog likes will do, even his or her kibble. Put the treats in your left pocket, and some in your left hand. Put the clicker in your right hand. This is a time for training, try to ignore any distraction such as the phone, etc.

, If your dog has not learned the basic command 'come', you can teach that to him or her first. Say the dog's name first before the command. (Such as ""Fido, come"".) Keep the command short and simple. Saying his or her name first gets the attention of the dog, and the simple command next tells the dog what you want.

, This is reinforcing positive behavior, and soon your dog will understand that he or she can respond to a command and a treat will follow that click. The dog will actually begin to watch you and listen, which is what you want.

, With your dog in front of you, the treats in your left hand and the clicker in your right, the two of you are ready. Move the treat hand over your dog's head between its ears. When he or she looks up, click and treat. You don't have to say anything, not yet. Repeat this several times.

, As soon as his or her back legs start to fold, click and treat. Repeat this several times.

, Eventually your dog will sit. Click and treat. Move to another part of the room and see if your dog follows. If not, call him or her to you, then hold your left hand out over his or her head. Don't say anything, see if the dog sits on his own. Click and treat. Then move again and repeat the process several times. Many dogs will begin to follow their owner around and sit, hoping for a treat! Have fun with your dog!

, Repeat this several times.

, Once your dog has mastered the sit command, try teaching him or her the down command. As your dog is sitting, put your closed treat hand to his or her nose. Move it downward between his or her paws, keeping your hand close to the dog's body. The nose will follow your hand, and the dog will start to lie down. Once those front legs start to bend, click and treat. Repeat this several times.

, If your dog doesn't lie down, begin again with the sit command, click and treat, and then try the down process again. Repeat several times. Eventually your dog will lie down.

, Wait to see if your dog lies down on his or her own. Click and treat for any movement in the right direction! Wait a few moments before you click and treat, this keeps your dog's attention riveted on you.

, Once your dog has mastered the down command, move to another part of the room, call your dog to you, hold your treat hand over his or her head. If the dog sits, click and treat. Put your treat hand to his or her nose, and lower it down. If the dog lies down, click and treat. Move to another part of the room and repeat the process. Most dogs will find this to be a very fun routine and will eagerly participate!

, As you hold your treat hand over his or her head, say the dog's name then sit. (Such as ""Fido, sit"".) Repeat several times. Then proceed several times with the verbal down command as well.

, Once your dog has learned the three basic commands of come, sit and down, you can teach your pet more. You can use clicker training for heel, shake paw, beg, roll over, chase your tail, speak, etc.

Keep your pet out of your lap.,
Have your dog ride inside the vehicle.,
Stay with your dog in a parked car.,
Prepare your dog for a road trip.,
Take breaks on road trips.,
Decide about medication.",How to Travel Safely with Your Dog in the Car2," A roaming dog inside a vehicle hurtling down the highway at a minimum of 70 miles per hour is not a good plan. The dog can become a distraction to the driver. Not to mention that they may be able to unlock doors, open the doors, and roll down the windows if you’re not careful. Keep your dog either crated or buckled in by the leash.Seat belts have not been proven to protect animals in a crash. Your safest bet is to always use a crate.

, It is dangerous to let your dog ride in the back of a truck or otherwise stick heads or body parts outside of a moving vehicle. Dogs do not foresee danger like humans do, and debris along the road can easily injure your dog.Keep the windows rolled up to reduce risk of injury to your dog.

, It is very dangerous to leave your dog in an unattended vehicle, especially when the weather is warm. Many states have ""hot car"" laws that make it a crime to leave a dog in a car alone. Some states even allow citizens to break into cars when they see pets locked inside during summer heat. Always stay with your dog if you’re going to park the car, or bring the dog with you.Keep in mind that when it is 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius) outside, it can rise to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 Celsius) inside a closed-up car within 30 minutes. That is enough time to kill a dog.
This is true even with a window cracked. Just don’t leave your pets in the car., Before you head out for a road trip for the first time, you should get your pet used to the idea. Practice for your road trip by taking your dog with you in the car while you run errands in town. Other ways to prepare for a trip in the car include a vet checkup, attaching dog tags to their collar, and ensuring they have an empty stomach.


Practicing with short trips around town is also good because you will discover if your dog gets carsick or not. If they do, you may want to talk to your vet about medication.
You may also want to get your dog used to being crated by placing them in a crate at home for 15 minute intervals. This is especially important if they tend to have separation anxiety when crated.Consider installing a microchip on your dog so that if he runs away at any point, it is not impossible to find him. A microchip is installed between your dog’s shoulder blades. When someone takes your dog to a shelter, the authorities scan for a chip and contact you., Dogs are not designed to stay in one position for 12 hours straight. Just as you probably have to stop every two or three hours to let your restless child take a break, you should stop for your dog. Dogs need to stretch their legs and do their business every two or three hours.Engage your dog on each break in a game or brief run to help release extra energy.

, If your dog is on medication for a specific physical malady, of course you should continue the medication. However, consider whether or not your dog needs medication to fight car sickness. Medication should really be your last resort. First try to minimize how much motion they feel and moving images they see.Get a crate with solid sides so they can’t look out the side windows at scenery flashing by.
Place the crate in the center of the vehicle instead of far in the back. This spot gets the most motion.
If you still need assistance, ask your vet for a mild sedative.

Get a veterinary inspection certificate.,
Find out which states have “hot car” laws.,
Look at which states allow others to break into cars for rescue.,
Observe the penalties for breaking a “hot car” law.",How to Travel Safely with Your Dog in the Car3," In order to cross most state lines with your dog, you must have what is called a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI). This certificate ensures that your dog doesn’t have any diseases that can be spread to other animals.There are a few states that don’t require a CVI for dogs: California, Georgia (unless the dog is for sale), Main (unless being transferred to a new owner), Montana (unless transferring ownership), Texas (unless the dog arrives by air), Washington State (unless the pet is being commercially imported).
A CVI states that a veterinarian has not observed any symptoms of contagious disease. It only lasts for 30 days., There are 21 states with some form of law against leaving pets in cars. One state (Pennsylvania) has a bill waiting to pass. A “hot car” law generally disallows pets to be left unattended inside vehicles in a way that appears to endanger their lives.These states are: Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin., In some states, police and humane officers are allowed to break into a car if they see an unattended pet. In others, both police and civilians are allowed to break in. In still others, there are variations on this law, such as permitting someone to break into a car only after the authorities have been alerted.Only police and humane officers are allowed to break into cars in Arizona, California, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington.
Anyone is allowed to break into cars for a pet in Tennessee and Wisconsin.

, If you leave your dog in a car and you are caught in the act, you risk conviction by a judge. You may be issued a misdemeanor, a fine, or an infraction. In New Hampshire, you can even be convicted of a felony if you repeat the offense."

Teach “quiet” after you teach “speak.” It’s much easier to teach “quiet” (or “enough” or “hush”) if your dog will bark when prompted.It’s often necessary, too.,
Ask your dog to speak.,
Say “quiet” and offer a treat.,
Phase out the treat as you did when teaching “speak”.,
Practice in more difficult circumstances.",How to Teach Your Dog to Speak2," Once your dog learns that barking on command leads to treats, it may be hard to get her to stop barking. The “speak” command should generate no more than 1-4 barks. After that, you’ll need to be able to ask your dog to stop., Wait for her to start barking.

, When your dog stops barking, give her the treat. Repeat this sequence, practicing ten minutes a day., Start by saying “quiet” without showing the treat, but still rewarding after your dog stops barking. When they have mastered this, you can start increasing the number of correct responses before giving treats. However, still give a treat every once in a while to keep your dog interested.

, When your dog has mastered “quiet” in a calm room, try the command in more distracting circumstance, like outside at the park or when a visitor comes to the door."

Teach your dog to ask to go out.,
Make sure your dog is house trained.,
Stand outside with a treat in hand and your door open just a crack.,
Remove the treat.,
Go inside.,
Move away from the door.,
Try getting your dog to bark in different rooms.",How to Teach Your Dog to Speak3," Imagine you really need to use the toilet, but you’re in a foreign country, can’t find a bathroom, and don’t speak the language. Welcome to a dog’s life. Teaching your dog how to ask to go outside by barking will help prevent messes in the house and make both your lives easier.

, Your dog needs to know she has to pee and poop outside before you can teach her to ask to go.

, Ask your dog to “speak”. When she does so, open the door and give the treat. After a few times, drop the “speak” command. Your dog should bark to come out. Open and give the treat., Now that your dog knows barking can open the door, you need to teach her to go outside to potty, not for treats. Do this training first thing in the morning, when your dog needs to pee. Stand outside and ask them if they need to come out. When they bark, open the door, praise them, and let them go potty. Praise them again after they pee or pooh. Do this each morning for two weeks., With your hand on the door, ask your dog if she wants to go out and wait for a bark. Reward with praise as before. Do this for two weeks., Sit in the room with the door out, but act as if you have forgotten all about letting your dog out. Wait for her to bark, then immediately open the door for her to go out and offer praise., Shut you and your dog in a room different from the one with the door she goes out. Be patient and wait for her to bark, then immediately offer to let her outside and praise her when she goes. After two weeks of this, your dog should be expert at barking to go outside.Be sure you also respond to barks when you are not actively training. Every time your dog barks to be let out, she should be let out and praised.

"
"
Be sure you want your dog to bark when people come to the door.,
Stand by the door and knock on it.,
Drop the “speak” command and knock only.,
Have a friend or family member come to the door and knock.,
Gradually phase out treats.",How to Teach Your Dog to Speak4," Many dogs will make too much noise when visitors arrive. If your dog doesn’t bark, you might consider yourself lucky. On the other hand, you may want to teach her to bark for security reasons, or because you have a big house and can't hear people knock.

, Give the “speak” command as you knock. Reward your dog for barking., After several rounds of knocking and asking to “speak”, you want your dog to start barking at the knock alone. Reward your dog and give lavish praise if she barks. Practice this over several days to be sure your dog has it down.You can do the same training with the doorbell. Have a friend or family member outside to ring it for you.

, You may need to give the “speak” command the first couple of times. After that, drop the command and let the dog respond to the knocking.Again, you can do the same training with a doorbell.

, As instructed earlier, start by asking for the correct behavior multiple times before giving a treat. Then work in sessions with no treats.

Begin training by teaching your dog how to sit on command.,
Give positive praise when your dog sits.,
Replace the treat with hand signals.,
Repeat until your dog responds to your command every time.",How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands1," Sitting is the dog form of politeness. It is a natural action. It shows that a dog is not aggressive and that she or he is willing to wait.As you enforce the 'sit' command, the dog will learn that when it wants something, or you are busy, sitting and waiting is the right thing to do.
The goal is for the dog to learn that when you give the 'sit' command, it is time to pay attention or calm down.
Stand up right in front of your dog. You want to exude calm but assertive energy. Get your dog's attention, looking it right in the eye. As you say "", sit,"" hold a treat above the dog's nose.In order to see the treat, the dog will need its head up, which will make its bum go down.;
, As soon as she or he sits, say ""Yes!"" and deliver the treat. The goal is for the dog to connect the action, phrase, or word with the treat and the praise.

, As your dog learns the verbal command, stop assisting the action and begin to use an accompanying hand signal. A common one begins by placing your flat hand over and in front of the dog's head. While saying ""Sit"", pull your hand up into a loose fist, or lift it in a J motion to end with your palm facing up.

, This can take some time, especially if you are training an adult dog or a stubborn dog. However, don't give up! It is important to the relationship between you and your dog that it follows your lead. This will help you live together and will actually keep your dog safer."
"
Choose a training method.Some of the methods are as follows:


Operant conditioning.,
Know that the most important part of the training is consistency.

,
With your deaf animal, using operant conditioning, you will need to decide on a signal to signify 'success' or 'yes'.,
Using your 'yes' signal, (thumb up, or whatever you choose), make the signal and give the dog a treat.,
Do this repeatedly, until you feel that your dog recognizes the connection.

,
Have a plan.,
Once the connection has been made, teach your dog to watch you or focus on you.,
Another way to train a particular behavior is to 'catch them in the act', and reward them.",How to Train a Deaf Pet," Operant conditioning includes two types of reinforcement.

Positive reinforcement - Most trainers who use positive reinforcement also use ""negative punishment"", which means they take away something the dog wants to reduce behavior that the trainer doesn't want (for example turning away from a dog who is jumping up for attention).
Negative reinforcement - works by rewarding the dog by removing something aversive (like stopping shock, or loosening a tightened choke chain).

;
,, This is a hard one...think it over. Different animals need different types of reward/acknowledgment. Some ways that you can consider:


Hand signals
Small flashlight (not a laser light, this is potentially damaging to your animal's eyes).

For the purposes of this article, hand signals will be used, but whatever method you select can be used in its place.



,


Some dogs like food, others like a quick scratch or stroke off the head.

,, Know, ahead of time, at least the first few things that you will be teaching your dog. 'Yes', 'Come', 'Stay', 'Sit', 'Leave it', are a few that you can start off with.

, This can be done by tapping the area near your eye or pointing at your eye so it catches his attention. Once the dog has made eye contact, signal 'yes' and reward.


You might need to 'grab' their attention by waving a treat in front of them and then bringing it to your face. Whatever you do...be consistent.
Another idea for grabbing your pet's attention is to thump your foot or hand so that they can feel the vibrations.

, For example, when your pet sits, give the 'yes' signal and reward. The signal and reward let your animal know that they did something good.

Fence in your flower beds.,
Consider growing barrier plants.Tall, thorny, or especially fragrant plants can be a great deterrent for dogs.,
Make your flower beds unappealing by adding tastes and smells that dogs don't like.Dust the edges of your flower beds with red pepper powder or other pungent spices.,
Locate flower beds in inaccessible areas.,
Switch to container gardening if your flowers are getting repeatedly trampled.Dogs are less likely to get into pots or raised beds, as access it inherently more limited than flat areas of a yard.",How to Keep Dogs out of Flower Beds1," This should send a message to your dog, or other dogs in the area, that he or she is not allowed in your garden. Ensure that the fence is sturdy and tall enough so a dog can't simply push it over or jump over it.


Many times dogs simply wander into flower beds because they are just areas that are easily accessible. Simply making access more difficult with a short fence will deter many dogs from entering.;
, Planting a row of thorny roses or other prickly plants along the edge of your flower bed will make the area much more unappealing to a dog looking for a place to dig or lounge around.

, You could also sprinkle strong smelling liquids, such as vinegar, around the edges of your beds.


Make sure that whatever you use as a deterrent is unpleasant for a dog but it not toxic to it. The goal should be to deter dogs from entering your beds, not to injure them.
Don't use commercial repellents made to repel deer or rabbits.Most of these products contain coyote urine, which keeps deer and rabbits at bay but attracts the interest of dogs.

, Place your prized flowers that are not in the path of neighborhood animals. Backyards or side yards are less likely to have unwanted visitors than the front of a yard near a sidewalk or street. You shouldn't have to limit what and where you plant necessarily, but use common sense when choosing the right spot for a delicate and special flower specimen.

, Having raised beds will not guarantee that your pooch won't go tromping through it but it will make the occurrence less likely.

Spread baking soda around the perimeter.,
Spray vinegar around the perimeter.,
Change fertilizer.,
Plant lavender or spiky shrubbery.,
Be cautious about other home remedies.",How to Keep Dogs off Lawn1," Prepare a mixture of water and baking soda, approximately one cup of baking soda per gallon of water. Apply around the perimeter and where the dog has urinated. Repeat at least twice per week.


Baking soda will also protect plants from the damage caused by dog urine.
Baking soda will neutralize the smell of dog urine, which should both make your nose happy and halt the territorial behavior that draws dogs to one another’s urine.;
, Spraying undiluted vinegar around the perimeter of the lawn creates a sort of invisible fence that drives off both dogs and cats. A roaming dog will take one sniff of your lawn and turn away, but you should keep reapplying the vinegar on a daily basis. Also try to apply vinegar where the dog has urinated.


Vinegar can also work as a natural herbicide to kill various weeds. For this reason, though, you should avoid spraying it over your entire lawn, since it has the potential to damage vegetation.
Vinegar neutralizes the smell of dog urine, which should both make your nose happy and halt the territorial behavior that draws dogs to one another’s urine.

, Many dogs have a strong reaction to the smell of organic material. Try a new fertilizer if dogs seem to be drawn to yours. Dogs are especially drawn to blood, fish, and bone meal. Try a plant-based fertilizer., Dogs are generally bothered by the smell of lavender, even though it is rather pleasant plant for humans.Similarly, prickly or thorny plants can be planted around the perimeter of your lawn to install a natural barrier against dog invaders., There are a number of popular home solutions, especially cayenne pepper, which have actually been known to harm dogs.Similarly, refrain from using coffee grounds, mouth balls, garlic power, Tobacco, ammonia, and detergents to drive off dogs."
"
Teach your dog to ""stay."",
Start your training with your dog in the ""sit"" position.,
Hold the dog's collar and say "", stay!"",
Gradually increase the amount of time you have your dog stay.",How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands2," There are some commands that can literally save your dog's life and the ""stay"" command is one of them. Keeping your dog out of dangerous situations, in addition to simply keeping it out of trouble, can be achieved more easily when you can train your dog to stay put.A pup has an instinctive understanding of how to stay when being threatened and the mother uses a very distinct ""stay"" command as well. This instinctive and early training should help you to train your dog to follow your command to stay., When your dog is sitting, stand so that he or she is on your left side facing the same direction. Later this will be referred to as the 'place' position.

, You should do this while placing your open hand in front of, but not touching, your dog's face. The tips of your fingers should be pointing up and your palm should be facing your dog. Wait two seconds. If the dog stays in place, say ""Yes!"" and it a reward.


If she gets up, say ""Oops!"" and start again. Begin with ""sit"" and proceed again to ""stay"".
Repeat this until your dog stays in place for at least ten seconds and then praise it. This means you may need to repeat this whole sequence several times.

, When your dog learns this command well, you can start to increase the length of time while gradually moving away during the stay. If your dog gets up, go all the way back to sitting and repeat the sequence, until you can move around freely during the stay.You should also have a certain command to release your dog from the stay such as ""okay!"" or ""come"". This way, your dog knows when it can move.

"
"
Start training your dog at a young age.,
Let your dog know that the flower beds are off limits as soon as you can.,
Have a designated area where your dog can play and roam.,
Don't scold your dog when he or she tries to enter the flower beds.,
Try a commercial dog repellant.,
Be consistent.,
Hang in there!",How to Keep Dogs out of Flower Beds2," Puppies are ripe for training and most thrive under a kind and productive training system. Even puppies that are less than a few months old can learn commands successfully., It is easier to let a dog know it can't go somewhere before it ever does, versus teaching it after it has enjoyed the area already.


While training your dog to stay in designated areas, it's a good idea not to leave it alone with the temptation and ability to break the rules. This is basically just setting your pooch up for failure.

, Make sure the area is inviting and fun for the dog. Have some toys and enough space to play, so that the pup doesn't need to look for other areas to explore.


You can also designate an area where your dog can dig, if that is what they are doing in your flower beds. Make your dog's digging area appealing to them. Encourage them to play there, letting them tear up the area as much as they like.
Prevent your dog from digging in the soil by placing chicken wire, large rocks, or a plastic membrane over the earth.

, Scolding the dog could teach them to go into the flower bed for attention. The owner needs to be more subtle, such as distracting the dog and then rewarding the dog for the good behavior.

, When the dog isn't there, you can either spray it around the bed. Don't spray directly at the dog. It may not be clear to the dog why it is being sprayed and what behavior you would like it to stop in response to the spraying. Spraying repellant when the dog is there is going to teach the dog to avoid you, rather than the flower bed.

, You need to be consistent with your disapproval, never letting the dog wander into the flower beds without facing negative consequences. Also be consistent with your praise when a dog follows your command. Give it positive reinforcement with treats if need be. This will give your dog a good reason to do as you ask.

, Keeping your dogs out of your flower beds will require persistence. No dog will get the message that you don't want him or her in your flowers right away. Just try to make it as clear and consistent as possible. Above all, keep playing with your dogs and let them know you love them, even if they do dig up your prized petunias once in a while.

Be neighborly.,
Suggest that your lawn is unsafe.,
Confront your neighbor.,
Report the neighbors.",How to Keep Dogs off Lawn2," The first step to keeping dogs of your lawn is to convince the dogs’ owners to cooperate. Make friends with your neighbors. Express concern about your lawn without accusing them or their dog of being at fault. Ideally they will begin to police their dog better if they know it might be a problem., If friendly cooperation is unlikely and you don’t mind being a bit dishonest, tell your neighbors that you have had your lawn chemically treated to repel raccoons or skunks and that it could be dangerous for dogs.There are a number of reasons why this is generally a less than optimal solution. It could illicit a negative reaction and lying will compromise your ability to appeal to authorities later in the process.

, If you know whose dog is responsible, consider contacting the owner. Be casual; invite him over for dinner or a drink. Instead of accusing him, assume that he is unaware of the situation and just needs to be informed of it. If the owner agrees to do something about it, drop the subject. Continuing to complain will likely aggravate him and jeopardize any agreement you might have reached.If you cannot reach an agreement, send a formal written complaint. Keep a copy for yourself so that you can prove to the authorities that you made an effort to resolve the issue., Look up local ordinances to see if they require dog owners to clean up after their pets; in most cases they will.Take a picture of the dog urinating or defecating on your lawn and call Animal Control to report the infraction.


In most cases city ordinances will be posted on the city’s website. Look up your city’s website to see what the law says about the situation.Alternatively, you can install a security camera to prove that the dog is invading your lawn. This can also be useful if your neighbor becomes aggressive and you want to prove his poor behavior to the authorities."

Spray a commercial dog repellent.,
Install a motion-activated sprinkler.,
Put up a fence.,
Use an ultrasonic repellent.",How to Keep Dogs off Lawn3," These products usually come as sprays or powders, and you can often find them at pet shops and garden supply stores. There are numerous scents manufacturers use to drive dogs away, and most products contain natural ingredients.


Some of these dog repellants are meant to have a bitter smell that dogs dislike. Others actually smell like the urine of the predators and will thus scare dogs away., Motion-activated sprinklers are not only designed to water your lawn but also to scare off any visiting critters, including dogs, cats, and raccoons. Set these sprinklers up along the perimeter of your lawn or at any specific spot where visiting strays frequently do their business. As the dog passes in front of the sprinkler, the motion will set it the sensors, triggering a quick spray of water. This spray is enough to startle most dogs and send them scurrying away., Nothing keeps animals out quite like a physical barrier. Dogs looking for an easy spot to take care of their business will likely skip over lawns with fences in favor of those without. Make sure you keep the gate of your fence closed and periodically monitor the perimeter for holes dug by stubborn canines.


If you already have a fence, check for holes that need to be repaired. It is also possible to purchase electrified fences, but that is an extreme solution.

, Ultrasonic repellents are also motion-activated. You can mount the mechanism onto a shed, tree, or fence. As the dog approaches, it will trigger the sensors, causing the repellent to emit sonic and ultrasonic sound waves that are intended to bother the dog.


It is unclear how well these devices actually work. Until more evidence emerges supporting their efficacy, this should probably be your last resort."
"
Teach your dog to lay down.,
Start again with your dog in a 'sit' position.,
Give your dog positive reinforcement for completing the command.,
Repeat this sequence several times.",How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands3," ""Down"" is usually combined with ""stay,"" and is meant to be a stronger command. Down actually stops whatever action was happening before the command, so it is useful in controlling behavior.

, As you say "", down!,"" hold your left hand above your dog's head, palm toward the floor. With a treat in your right hand, lower your hand towards the floor slowly and relatively close to the dog's body.

, Once both bum and elbows are on the floor, say ""Yes!"" and deliver the treat. This will make an association in the dog's mind between the action and a reward., Repetition is key to your dog learning, and following, the command. The goal is for your dog to follow your command no matter what it is doing when you give it. That way, if your dog is doing something naughty, you can stop the behavior quickly and effectively.Like training other commands, if the dog does not follow the command or does something different, start again from the beginning. Put the dog in sitting position once again and start from the beginning.

"
"
Teach your dog to come when you call it.,
Gently pull the dog towards you while saying "", come!"",
Lure your dog to come with a treat.,
Reinforce the action with praise.,
Practice the command at a variety of times and in a variety of locations.",How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands4," The ""come"" command is also known as ""recall."" Like training for other basic commands, begin with your dog in ""sit"" position., You should do this in a more encouraging voice than you use for other commands, as you want the dog to want to come to you. Accompany the command with a gesture to show the dog what you want.

, Once you have shown your dog how to come and what command you will give, place a piece of dry dog food at your feet and point to it. After a very short time, the gesture of pointing at the floor in front of you should be enough. Later only the command or the gesture will be needed.

, When your dog reaches you, praise it using the phrase ""Good come!"" Give him or her a nice pet on the head, showing the dog that you are appreciative of what it just did for you., When interacting with your pet, take opportunities to call it from across the room by using its name and saying ""Come!"" and praising it when it gets there. This will make your dog familiar with the command.

"
"
Teach your dog to ""heel."",
Put your dog in sitting position.,
Tell your dog to ""heel."",
Instruct the dog to stay by your side.,
Correct wrong behavior.,
Give praise when the dog heels.,
Teach the dog to sit when you stop.,
Practice the command solely through body language.",How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands5," This command is often the most complicated one to teach.However, most dogs can learn it if you are consistent with your training. Teaching your canine companion to heel will save your back, your shoulders, your dog's neck, and dignity for both of you (although, dignity may be low on the priority list for your dog).


Your dog will probably naturally want to jog at a canter and sniff and veer off in many directions. You need to show him or her that there is a time for exploring and a time not to.

, Using the regular walking lead, put your dog in a ""sit"" position beside your left leg, facing the same direction as you. This is known as the ""place"" position.Always use the left side to avoid confusing the dog.

, Say "", heel!"" while stepping forward with your left foot. Starting with the left foot will become a signal that it is time to move forward. Your dog may either resist or hurry past you. In either case give a gentle pull and repeat the command ""heel.""

, If he or she strays too far off to the side, pat your leg and say ""Keep with me!"" or ""Over here!"" or another short phrase. Always say the same phrase to mean that particular thing.

, If the dog moves out ahead, say ""No, , heel"" in a calm voice. If necessary, tug on the lead. When you stop, always stop on the left foot and say "", sit."" If your dog moves ahead again, gently pull or physically place him or her beside your left leg using the ""sit"" command.If things get a little to out of control, stop and place the dog in a sit position at your side once again, praise him or her, and start over. You should always adjust the dog to your position, not adjust your position to his. (if you adjust your position to his, he will eventually have his human well trained to obey him)
You should get your dog used to not feeling any tension on the lead unless you are making a correction, or the dog will get into the habit of pulling constantly. Make your corrections by voice and gesture and only use the lead if it isn't listening.

, You may gently praise your dog while he or she is heeling well, but keep it toned down so as not to distract it. Once it is obeying the spoken commands consistently, remain silent and only use the spoken commands for correction.


The length of time to learn is individual so don't be in a hurry to move things along.

, When you are ready to stop, you should stop on your left foot and say "",sit."" After a few repetitions you should no longer need to use the sit command. Your dog will come to know that stopping on the left foot is the signal for him or her to stop and sit.

, When your dog is consistently obeying the ""heel"" command properly, start unexpectedly starting of with the left foot and stopping without verbal commands or hand signals. Also, when your dog is in the ""place"" position, occasionally step off with the right. Your dog will want to start with you, so you use the ""stay"" command and walk around him back to the ""place"" position.


Alternate stepping off with the left and using the heel command and then stepping off with the right and using the stay command. After a while you can advance to randomly stepping of with either foot and reinforcing the appropriate ""heel"" or ""stay"" behavior. When you and your dog has learned this well, you will be able to function smoothly as a team no matter where you are.

Enroll in obedience classes.","How to Teach Your Dog ""On By"""," Buy a head or body harness for your dog that will allow you to direct the motion of their body. This will give you more control over the walking process. The harness should fit snugly, but not tight enough to chaff the skin and cause irritation. Attach a thick, sturdy leash directly onto the harness and you are good to go.


Practice making smooth, even motions with your leash. A harness is not any less reactive than a collar. You do not need to jerk or pull for your dog to feel it. Walk your dog around your home testing out the feel of the gear.
A chest-led harness is often preferred by owners looking for a bit more control. The leash attaches to the chest of harness (via a ring loop). If your dog pulls, the leash will tighten pulling his body to the side instead of letting him lunge forward.;
, This is especially critical with a new dog or puppy. Before you begin teaching commands, you will want to start building a relationship with your dog. Say your dog’s name throughout the day and praise him when he responds to you. Make this a ritual before you go out of the house, reinforcing your bond before you head to an area with distractions., Practice making eye contact with your dog and holding it. Do this 2-3 times a day at least. Get in the habit of looking into your dog’s eyes when speaking with him or when offering commands. This lets your dog know that you are the alpha and leader in the relationship and should be followed.Don’t get carried away and turn this into a stare-down contest. If you adopt an aggressive posture while giving eye contact, your dog may respond in kind. Remember, you are trying to have fun with your dog, not scare him.

, Observe your dog closely over the course of two days and write down every time that he lunges or refuses to leave an object, person, or other dog alone. These are the trigger or threshold moments. You will first need to address the indoor triggers, followed by the outdoor triggers. Once your dog masters ""On-By"" during a potential trigger moment, you can mark that one off your list.

, Like humans, different dogs respond well to different types of encouragement. Some dogs are food-motivated and will do just about anything for a treat. Others want special toys. And still others yearn for open affection, hugs, and kisses.The entire time that you are training, rotate in various forms of positive reinforcement to see what creates the best reaction out of your dog.

, Clip a leash onto your dog’s harness. Put one of their favorite toys (or treats) on the floor. Walk the dog past the toy saying “On-By.” Hold the leash taut if you must to keep them from getting the toy. When your dog successfully passes the toy without lunging, give them a treat (not the one from the ground).


After they go on-by successfully a few times, make them do it with a loose lead. You do this by lessening the tension on the leash, giving them more control over movement. Again, follow a success by treating.
For an even more challenging scenario, add additional toys into the mix. Make a little path where they have to go in between a bunch of toys. Heavily praise a lunge-free walk.

, Moving from inside to outside increases the distraction level and can be a challenge for even the most well-prepared dog. Counter the distractions that may come your way by having a plan of action in place from the moment you leave your house until you return. You might ask yourself, “What will I do if a person approaches and my dog lunges? How should I have my dog respond to other pets?”


If your dog begins to lunge, pick up your pace and say, “On-By.” Keep a firm control on the leash and start a jog, if necessary. Odds are your dog will enjoy the opportunity to run so much that they will ignore the prior distraction. When you’ve passed the object in question, praise your dog., Praising and rewarding is not as simple as just tossing a few dog treats in your pet’s general direction. Good positive reinforcement is thoughtful and planned. For example, be prepared to reward by carrying a variety of dog treats with you (in a baggie in your pocket). Also, reward your dog right away for a job well done. And praise every behavior that is good and on command.There is a good possibility that your dog will eventually fully transition from treats to just praise and physical affection.
Differentiate praise by speaking in a higher tone, as you would when excited. So, you might say, “Well done, boy!” and clap your hands., This applies to both your commands and positive reinforcement methods. If a certain behavior isn’t okay once, then it is never okay. For example, lunging is never acceptable, regardless of the circumstance. Use “On-By” in a consistent way by not pairing it with another phrase.


Instead of saying, “On-By, leave it alone, keep going,” just command, “On-By.”
This also means that everyone in contact with your dog needs to use the same commands and reinforcements. Everyone’s cooperation is especially important during the early stages of training., Stay positive regardless of any setbacks that you may encounter. For example, a new dog may move into the neighborhood, distracting your dog to a whole new level. If this happens, refocus on your indoor training and try to train outdoors when the other dog is not around. Adapt to changing circumstances and keep praising your dog., Once your dog understands what “On-By” means, it is your job to not abuse this power through overuse. Reserve the command for situations that require it, including possible safety concerns. You want your dog to be friendly with other people and dogs when it is appropriate. Don't rush to use ""On-By"" every time anyone approaches.


When you are around others, don’t limit your dog’s normal behaviors such as greeting other animals or even marking, unless it becomes excessive.

, Have a friend stand fairly far away from a sidewalk or trail, close enough so that the dog knows they're there. Tell the dog “On-By,” then treat them for not lunging. If they lunge, have the friend move back. Gradually have the friend move in closer until he/she is right by the trail and the dog goes “On-By.”


Ask a friend with a dog to do the same as above. The presence of another dog will add an extra element of distraction and is good practice for real walking scenarios. Make sure that your friend’s dog is well-behaved.
When you pass your friends, do so at an arc. This will give you and your dog some extra distance. Your dog will eventually get used to the pulling away sensation and will learn to go along with it., Once you’ve established the basic “On-By” command, take a multi-week, or even just a few, dog training sessions. The class environment will expose your dog to a whole new level of distraction. And you will have the chance to troubleshoot any difficulties that you having by talking with your fellow classmates.To ask for advice, you might say, “My dog always lunges and barks at this one fence. Have you had this happen to you? How do you handle it?”

Put candy on a list of dangerous foods.,
Teach children the dangers of Halloween candy for dogs.,
Allow children to have candy at specific times.",How to Keep Your Dog Away from Halloween Candy1," There are many foods that humans eat which are very dangerous (and potentially lethal) to dogs, such as grapes and chocolate. Make a list of these foods and hang it on a wall or on the refrigerator, so that the entire family sees it as a reminder. Include candy (as well as chocolate and gum, which children also receive when trick-or-treating) on this list., To make sure that your kids are vigilant about keeping their Halloween candy away from the family dog, talk to them honestly about the dangers involved. Be gentle but firm about conveying the information so that they understand why they are not allowed to share sugary treats with their pet. Keep things simple but direct by saying things like:“Eating chocolate will make the dog very, very sick, and too much can be poisonous.”
“Candy and gum can very dangerous for the dog because it might choke on them.”

, Regulate when and where your children are eating their Halloween candy to avoid your dog gaining access to any that might be dropped, discarded, or forgotten about. For instance, have a specific “snack time” after school or after supper, when children can enjoy their treats. Have this happen in one room of the house (e.g. in the kitchen) and keep the dog in another room for that time.Be sure to clean up thoroughly after your children finish enjoying their Halloween candy by properly disposing of wrappers, sweeping the floor, and wiping down the surface they ate on.

Practice your trip closer to the road each time.,
Walk near the road.,
Build a fence.,
Use a shock collar when your dog approaches the road.,
Reach out to a professional dog trainer.",How to Keep a Dog from Chasing Cars," You should teach your dog the command “sit” so that you can make it stop before it attempts to run toward a car. Get on your puppy’s level. Hold a treat close to its nose and move the treat up so that he begins to lower his butt. Once its butt hits the floor give it the treat.Keep on telling your dog to “sit” as you do this. Eventually he will come to associate the action with the command.
When your dog’s butt hits the ground, give it the treat and, if possible, make a noise with a clicker. If your dog associates the sound of the clicker with the treat, eventually the sound of the clicker will be a reward of its own.
Praise your dog when it sits down correctly. Say nice things in a positive tone and pet your dog to reward it for being good.
Repeat this trick several times a day until your dog does it even when it isn’t given a treat.;
, Getting your dog to run back to you can save its life in an emergency. To train your dog, try getting a second person to restrain it as you call its name and offer a treat or toy. When the second person releases your dog, use the call “come.” Your dog will learn to associate the word “come” with running back to you.


It is easiest for your dog to pick up these commands when it is a puppy, but commands should be reinforced regularly throughout its life. Practice using this and other commands on nearly a daily basis.
Never use the call “come” when you intend to scold your dog. If your dog associates the command with negative memories, it is less likely to respond to it. In general, positive reinforcement is more effective and humane than scolding your dog., Your dog needs to learn to follow your lead on its leash. Never allow it to pull you. If it does pull on its leash, stop and command it to sit.After getting your dog to sit, consider walking in the opposite direction. Over time, your dog should learn that rushing ahead of you will only make it harder for it to get where it wants to be.

, As a car approaches, give your dog a command, like “sit.” If it sits appropriately as the car passes, make a noise with your clicker and give it a treat. You will probably need to start far away from the road to limit the attraction of the cars.If your dog is having trouble, try a command that might better get your dog’s attention. Teach your dog “find it” and then drop treats in front of it. Your dog will hopefully be too busy finding and eating treats to give much thought to cars.

, Your dog will be less excitable if it is standing instead of walking. It will also be less excitable further away from the road. So, start off stationary, 15 or 20 feet from the road. If your dog performs the trick without getting distracted, try it the next day a couple of feet closer to the road.


Don’t expect your dog to learn this trick immediately. Try four or five sessions, fifteen minutes long. Every time your dog is rewarded for correctly following its command, it will develop a stronger positive association with staying away from the road.

, Once your dog has successfully learned to sit as a car passes, try walking along the road. If your dog can manage this, move closer to the road. Your dog will be more tempted to chase the car the closer it gets, but you should work to desensitize it to progressively more exciting stimuli.


Give your dog a command as the cars pass. If your dog follows the command, use your clicker and give it a treat.As time goes on try using just your clicker. When your dog looks at the car, make a clicking sound. When it looks away, give it a treat and press the clicker again.
If you don’t have a clicker, just make a sound as the car passes and show your dog a treat. Make your dog walk toward you before you give it the treat. After the car passes, give it a couple more treats., The best way to ensure that your dog doesn’t chase a car when you are not around is to build a fence. If you can’t install a physical fence, you can bury an electric fence around the perimeter of your property. The fence will shock your dog whenever it tries to chase a car.The average price of an electric fence is approximately $1000., Shock collars send an electric shock to your dog. They are mildly painful but are not dangerous. If you shock your dog when it does something bad, it will quickly learn to stop that behavior. With this technique, try walking along the street. If your dog starts chasing after a car, give it a short shock. After a few shocks, it should learn not to chase the cars.

, Became many dogs are fascinated by cars, moderate positive reinforcement often is not enough to convince them to change their behavior. Sometimes you might have to resort to a professional dog trainer, who has mastered more advanced techniques to change behavior.Several sessions with a dog trainer might cost between $300 to $600."

Have a separate pantry with a door for human food.,
Let cooked human food cool in an inaccessible place.,
Put prepared human food on high tables.,
Pick up human food on the floor so your dog cannot get it.",How to Keep a Dog from Sneaking Human Food1," Start by making sure human food is out of reach for your dog. Store human food that is uncooked or packaged, such as cereal, crackers, chips, canned goods, and sweets in cupboards or on high shelves.Make sure the shelves are high enough that your dog cannot reach them by standing on its hind legs. If your dog is tall, store human food in cupboards with doors that can be shut to keep your dog from getting at it.;
, If your kitchen has a pantry or a long cupboard you can use as a pantry, store human food in there to keep it away from your dog. Designate the pantry as the spot where you keep human food in your kitchen so your dog cannot get into it easily.

, When you cook human food, let it cool in your kitchen on a high counter, where your dog cannot reach. You can also keep cooked food in the oven to cool with the door slightly ajar. Often, dogs are turned away by the heat from the oven and cannot open the oven door on its own.Get in the habit of keeping cooked food in the middle of an island in your kitchen or on a high table to cool so your dog cannot access it.

, If you are serving prepared human food, such as at a dinner or a lunch, keep it on high tables. Make sure your dinner table is high enough that your dog cannot reach the food. Or position the food on the dinner table so it is away from the edges, where your dog cannot access.


Remind others in your home to avoid keeping human food on tables that are low or easy for your dog to reach. Tell everyone to be careful when lifting food to the table.

, If any human food falls on the floor during a meal, pick it up quickly before the dog can get at it. Doing this will discourage your dog from having human food and prevent begging at the table.


Remind those in your household to always pick up dropped human food before the dog can get it. Make it a habit so it becomes an automatic reflex when human food is being prepared and the dog is around.

Keep your dog out of the trash.",How to Keep Your Dog Away from Halloween Candy2," To ensure that your dog can’t gain access to Halloween chocolate, store it in the fridge. This will prevent the treats from melting and keep it safe from your hungry pet. Store chocolate in a refrigerator-friendly container, or in several clearly labelled containers to remember whose goodies are whose.

, Purchase bulk food containers with airtight seals and snap-lock latches to prevent your dog from opening them. Your dog can easily tip over a bowl or other open container and gain access to Halloween candy, so making sure the treats are sealed and secured is important. Containers can be purchased at department stores, or online., The best way to control what happens to Halloween candy in your home is to store it all together in a high cupboard. This will remove access to the candy from your dog, and make it difficult for your children to access it outside of the times they are allowed to consume it. If a step stool is required to reach the cupboard, store it in another room to keep track of who is using it, and when., Make sure to keep your dog out of trash cans to prevent it from ingesting candy wrappers or uneaten Halloween treats. Try storing your garbage container in a kitchen cupboard, with a magnetic lock on the cabinet door if your dog can open it. Alternatively, look for a dog-proof trash can with a tight-locking lid, heavy base (so that your dog can’t tip it over), or latches to keep it shut.Locks and dog-proof trash cans can be purchased at hardware stores.

Puzzle toys are hollow chew toys that can be filled with treats or all-natural peanut butter, which your dog will work for hours to get at. Kong toys, for instance, are puzzle toys widely recommended by veterinarians and trainers, and are available online or in pet stores.Try freezing a toy with peanut butter, which will take more time for your dog to get out of the toy.

, Dogs have a natural tendency to chew, and will look for things (such as Halloween candy) to gnaw on. Keep your dog away from your treats by giving it a chew such as a Nylabone, which lasts for hours and clean your dog’s teeth in the process. Purchase chews at pet stores, but be sure to avoid options that may splinter, such as rawhide., A well-trained dog is less likely to act out and go after your Halloween candy stash, so try teaching or re-teaching it the basic five commands: ""Sit”, ""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here.” This kind of basic training can also be a bonding experience between you and your pet, as dogs enjoy the security of structure and discipline. Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for videos and instructions on the best way to train your pet.


If you see your dog trying to eat a piece of Halloween candy, the command ""Come here"" should prompt it to drop the treat and come over to you.

, As a general rule, a tired dog is a good dog. Exercise your dog at least 30-60 minutes every day to keep it physically and mentally engaged, and to prevent restless or disruptive behaviour. A dog with excess energy is more likely to get into trouble at home.Exercise may include long walks, playing fetch or Frisbee, taking a hike, or visiting a dog park.

Have your dog “lie down” around human food.,
Keep your dog in its crate.,
Reinforce good behavior around human food.",How to Keep a Dog from Sneaking Human Food2," Hold a piece of human food in your hand and show it to your dog. Say “leave it” as you slowly lower the food to the ground. If your dog stays seated and looks calmly at the food as you lower it to the ground, reward it with a doggie treat. If it tries to grab the food from your hand, close your fist and do not let it get the food.Repeat this until your dog understands that “leave it” means not grabbing at the food. It may take some practice for your dog to get this command.
Always reward your dog when he follows the command with a treat. Do this command during dinner or when someone drops human food on the ground so your dog does not eat it and “leaves it” instead.

, To keep your dog away from human food, instruct your dog to “lie down” when you are preparing or holding human food. This will neutralize your dog and discourage any begging or stealing of the human food.You can tell your dog to go to lie down in its “spot,” if they know the “go to your place or spot” command. The spot may be its bed in the corner of the room or its favorite spot on the floor.
Let your dog play with toys in its spot while human food is around so they are distracted and do not try to sneak food.

, You can also keep your dog away from human food by putting the dog in its crate. Many dogs are trained to go to its crate when its owner is not home or when they are sleeping. Integrate the “go to your crate” command around human food into your dog’s obedience routine. This may be easier to do if your dog is already used to being in its crate.You can also try putting your dog on its leash by the back door or in another area of your home, away from the human food. This way, they are not tempted to try to get to the human food.

, Make sure you reward your dog if they behave properly around human food. Reinforce this good behavior with treats and verbal praise like “good job!” or “great going!” This will remind your dog that acting obediently around human food is a good thing and something to be rewarded with treats.Give your dog treats and verbal praise if it stays in its spot and lie down while you have dinner.

, Push it down towards his chest, so his nose follows it.


It may take a few tries, but this should cause the dog to rock back into a ""laying"" position. The moment your dog is fully laying down, give him the treat.

, Once he is doing this easily, you can begin adding the command.  Now when he is laying down, say ""drop"" or ""down"" or ""lay"" or whichever command you have decided you want to use for this task.

, Now that your dog is comfortable laying down while following the treat in your hand, try holding the treat in your other hand or not at all, yet still using the hand you would normally use to hold the treat to push into his chest while telling him to lay down.  He should do it as he has been, and you can give him the treat once he is all the way down.

, Eventually, you should be able to tell your dog your command, i.e. ""drop!"" and he will plop down into the laying position.  You should treat him right away for this at first, but as he grows confidence in the command you should hold off a little longer  and a little longer before rewarding him (with treats, words, or affection) so that he understands that he must then stay laying

Do not reinforce unwanted behaviors.,
Train your dog to engage in a wanted behavior.,
Reward good behavior.,
Consult a dog behaviorist.",How to Identify and Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviors1," In order to identify unwanted dog behaviors, you will have to define what you enjoy and do not enjoy in your dogs. Some people might enjoy the sound of their dog’s endless barking, but others might not.You might think it’s cute when your dog begs for food at the table, but you might also find it irritating.
Realize that sometimes personal preferences must be adjusted for the safety of others. Some people might like the fact that their dog jumps up on visitors enthusiastically, but a dog that does this could end up harming an elderly person or small child one day.;
, In addition to your own personal preferences, you should consult other dog owners and veterinarians about what they consider unwanted dog behavior. They might have some insights about what qualifies as desirable or undesirable behavior.For instance, you might say to a fellow dog owner, “I am trying to identify unwanted dog behaviors. What sort of behaviors should I be on the lookout for?”Behaviors that are dangerous for you, your dog, or others should always be considered unwanted behaviors.
In addition to conversations, you should spend some time reading profiles about your dog’s breed. This information can help you better understand what to expect when identifying and correcting unwanted dog behaviors.
For instance, collies, golden retrievers, and German shepherds are easy to train, so correcting their unwanted behaviors will be easier than doing so with hard-to-train breeds like Beagles, Pomeranians, and Basset hounds.
Learning more about dog behaviors might help you realize that what you see as a normal behavior is in fact unwanted or even dangerous, and behaviors that you might consider unwanted are actually normal.

, Instead of phrasing the dog’s unwanted behavior as a problem (“I don’t want my dog to bark endlessly”) think of the situation in terms of what sort of behavior you wish your dog exhibited (“I want my dog to sit quietly”). This important change in perspective will help you devise a plan for action, Correcting your dog’s unwanted behavior (that is, replacing an unwanted behavior with a desirable behavior) should be the long-term goal, but the first step in doing so is to end the current behavior. The easiest way to do that is to starve your dog of the motivation to continue its unwanted behavior.For instance, if your dog barks by the door when it wants to go out to play, then you open the door to let it out, you’re rewarding your dog for barking.
To correct the behavior, you should ignore the dog when it barks and only let it out when it sits at the door quietly, even if it can only maintain this good behavior for a moment at first.

, The desirable behavior you should replace the unwanted behavior with varies depending on the behavior you are correcting for. For instance, if you wish to correct your dog’s barking by the door when it wishes to go out and play, you could train your dog to be ready to play at regularly scheduled intervals that you decide., If your dog is quiet, responsive to your commands, or otherwise well-behaved, reward this behavior in order to ensure it continues. Use a combination of verbal praise, physical affection, and treats when rewarding your dog.For instance, if you ask your dog to sit and it does so, reward it with a treat.
If you tell your dog to be quiet and it stops barking, say, “Good dog!” and pat it on the head.

, You might be unable to adequately identify and correct unwanted dog behaviors simply using a step-by-step guide or a conversation with another dog owner. Every dog is different and unwanted dog behaviors may develop due to a variety of causes. A dog behaviorist expert can help you develop a plan to combat your dog’s unwanted behavior, and can be vital when dealing with dangerous behaviors or in helping older dogs with deeply ingrained habits.Ask your vet for advice in locating a reputable dog behaviorist.

If your dog has exhibited begging behaviors, make sure you ignore the dog while you are cooking.Additionally, don’t call your dog to come to you while you are eating. You don’t want to encourage it to beg for the food.;
, While you’re eating, try to avoid touching your dog in any way. This will encourage your dog to interact with you while you are eating and to get closer to you and your food.Don’t pet your dog, play with your dog, or let your dog snuggle next to you while you are eating your food.

, If your dog is begging, don’t make eye contact with it. The dog will interpret this as a sign to continue doing with its current behavior since you have obviously noticed it and have not discouraged its behavior.Continue eating your meal, but do not look at your dog directly.

, But if your dog is clearly begging, you should tell it “no” firmly. Try to give the command loudly in a strong voice so your dog will take you seriously.If your dog continues to beg, send it out of the room until you have finished eating.

, A good way to prevent your dog from begging for food is to feed the dog before you begin eating. This will distract the dog from the fact that there is human food to beg for. It will also make your dog less hungry, so it will not be as tempted to beg for your food.This can also help establish a clear routine for your dog so that it knows what to expect and what you expect from it.

, Before you begin eating, give your dog something to play with or chew on to distract it from begging for your food. You can give your dog a food puzzle to keep it occupied while you are eating, or another type of toy.A rawhide bone or other hard chew toy would also work well for this type of distraction.

, If your dog needs some distractions from the fact that you are eating, you may need to send it to another part of the house. This will eliminate the temptation for the dog and help it get out of the habit of begging.Consider putting your dog in the back yard (if your yard is fenced), or put it in another room with a doggy gate during meal times.

, As soon as your dog comes home with you, you should begin making your expectations clear through consistent training repeated over time. It will be much easier to break a dog of a begging habit if you have never given it human food. A dog who has come to expect that begging sometimes works is much more likely to continue begging.When you bring your dog home, provide it with its own food and treats. Never give it any of your food.

, If you want to keep your dog from begging, it’s a good idea to teach it to do something else during meal times. Consider teaching your dog to lie down on its dog bed while you are eating, or to remain seated on a mat in the corner.This will help your dog to learn your expectations and to know how it should behave.
Be sure to use positive reinforcement when teaching your dog new behaviors. This means that you should praise your dog (and on occasion reward it with treats) when it performs the new behavior correctly. Don’t yell at or hit your dog. This will just teach your dog to fear you.

, If you expect your dog to learn a new behavior, you have to give it clear guidelines to follow. You can’t allow your dog to eat some human food on special occasions and expect your dog to avoid begging all the other times. Dogs can’t distinguish between special occasions and regular ones, so that will just teach your dog that if it keeps begging you will eventually give it something off your plate.The more consistent you are with your rules, the easier it will be for your dog to learn what you expect from it.

, Remember that it will take some time and practice for your dog to learn a new behavior. In order to meet your expectations, your dog has to run some trial and error tests that will take a bit of time for it to figure out. Be patient during this process.Being patient means not giving up when your dog doesn’t understand right away. But it also means allowing your dog some time to learn the new behavioral patterns.

, You should follow the remaining steps of the General Method to complete his training in this task.

Tell your dog to “stay” in another room.,
Have your dog “lie down” in another room.,
Instruct your dog to “go to their place” while you vacuum.",How to Keep a Dog from Chasing the Vacuum Cleaner2," Use obedience training like the “stay” command to get your dog to stop chasing the vacuum cleaner. Tell your dog to stay in another room. Reward them with a treat when they sit and stay. Have them stay while you vacuum. Reward them again if they stay in place and do not run or chase the vacuum cleaner.


You may try having your dog “stay” outside with a treat or behind a gate or fence indoors. This may reduce the temptation for them to chase the vacuum cleaner while it’s running, even while they are sitting and staying.

, Another way to neutralize your dog and get them to stay calm while you vacuum is to instruct them to “lie down” in another room. Reward them with a treat when they lie down and tell them to “stay.” This will ensure they do not get up and chase after the vacuum cleaner.


You can also give your dog a bone to chew on while they lay down so they are not tempted to get up and chase the vacuum cleaner.

, If your dog knows the “go to your place” command, use it when you vacuum. Your dog may have a designated place or spot that they go to to relax and calm down when someone is at the door or there is commotion outside. This could be their bed, a spot on the floor, or a spot by the door. Reward your dog with a treat once they go to their place and instruct them to stay there until you call them.


This obedience trick is a good option if your dog is already comfortable with the “go to your place” command and you want to keep them away from the vacuum cleaner while it is on.

Put your dog on its leash.,
Get your dog used to the presence of the vacuum cleaner.,
Run the vacuum cleaner back and forth in front of your dog.,
Reinforce positive behavior with treats and praise.,
Repeat until the dog is calm around the vacuum cleaner.",How to Keep a Dog from Chasing the Vacuum Cleaner3," Desensitizing your dog to the vacuum cleaner is a process that requires patience and consistency. Start by putting your dog on a leash and holding the leash in your hand. This will give you control over your dog while you work on desensitizing them to the sight and sound of the vacuum.If your dog is really jumpy or excited at even the sight of the vacuum cleaner, you may put them on their leash in an adjacent room so they can get used to the sound of the vacuum from a safe distance.
You may ask a friend or partner to assist you by holding your dog by its leash while you hold the vacuum cleaner. This can make it easier for you to keep your dog under control.

, Take the vacuum and unroll the cord. Your dog may react to the sound of the cord. Speak to them in a calm voice and instruct them to relax. Reward them with a treat if they do not run or chase after the vacuum upon seeing it.Hold the vacuum and stand in front of your dog. Tell them to stay calm and reward them again with a treat if they stay relaxed in the presence of the vacuum.

, Start with the vacuum unplugged to get your dog used to seeing the vacuum moving back and forth in front of them. Then, plug it in and move it back and forth slowly in front of your dog. The goal is to get your dog used to the movements of the vacuum without chasing or running after it.If your dog reacts by barking at the vacuum or chasing after it, turn the vacuum off and go back to simply standing in front of your dog with the vacuum in your hand. Once they calm down, reward them with a treat. Then, gradually turn the vacuum on and run it a few times in front of your dog.

, As you go through the process of desensitizing your dog to the vacuum cleaner, continue to reinforce their positive behavior. Give them treats and verbal praise like “good job!” or “great going!” when they stay calm around the vacuum cleaner.If your dog does not react positively to the process, do not get angry at them or yell at them. This will only make them more fearful and anxious around the vacuum cleaner. Instead, stay calm and have your dog try again.

, Repeat these steps several times until your dog appears calm around the vacuum cleaner when it is on and moving around the room. Once they appear relaxed around the vacuum cleaner, take them off the leash. Let them sit in the room while you vacuum. Reward them with a treat if they stay calm and do not chase the vacuum cleaner while it is on.


You may need to work on desensitizing your dog to the vacuum cleaner over a period of a few days to a few weeks, depending on how riled up your dog gets around the vacuum. Be patient and consistent with this process. Over time, your dog should learn to remain calm and stationary around the vacuum.

Look for excessive barking.,
Take your dog to a vet.,
Limit your dog’s ability to see others.,
Teach your dog to be quiet.,
Distract your dog.,
Use a head halter.,
Do not encourage your dog to bark.,
Give your dog more exercise and attention.",How to Identify and Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviors2," All dogs bark sometimes. But if your dog barks constantly, it could be unwanted. Listen for barking that has a clear reason. For instance, perhaps your dog is barking because someone knocked on the door, or because they hear another dog barking outside. But if your dog starts barking without any apparent cause and continues to do so for many minutes on end, take corrective action., Sometimes dogs bark because they have pain or some medical condition that causes them to vocalize. Take careful notes about your dog’s nuisance barking to help your vet make an accurate diagnosis regarding your dog’s health and the reason behind its barking.For instance, you should note when your dog barks, where it barks, how long it barks, the tone of the bark (high and piercing? low and groaning?), and any related details pertaining to the period in which your dog engaged in nuisance barking (for instance, perhaps your dog was running around the house while barking).

, If your dog barks because it sees other animals or people outside, find ways to limit your dog’s visual and auditory access to high-traffic areas. For instance, if your dog frequently starts barking when perched on a sofa near a window, move the sofa to a location where the dog cannot jump on it.If necessary, you could also use baby gates to prevent your dog from accessing parts of the house that often receive the most noise from without.

, It is hard to completely isolate your dog from seeing or hearing others, and eventually your dog will end up barking even when you wish it didn’t. Sometimes the best way to correct unwanted barking is to allow your dog to bark two or three times, then say, “Quiet.” Walk over to your dog and hold its muzzle. Repeat “Quiet” again. Then, release your dog, walk away from the window or door, and call your dog over to you.


Have your dog sit and give it a treat.
If your dog remains quiet while sitting for about thirty seconds, give it another treat. As long as your dog continues to sit quietly, feed it treats every thirty seconds for the next several minutes.
If your dog starts barking again after you’ve put the treats away, repeat the “Quiet” command and the other steps above.

, If your dog does not respond to other techniques, you could try focusing your dog’s attention elsewhere. Sometimes unwanted barking can be stopped if you do something surprising or extraordinary. For instance, if your dog starts barking, say, “Quiet” and then start shaking your keys or a bottle full of pennies. The noise should end your dog’s barking and draw it away from the window or door where it is likely located.Once your dog’s attention is focused on you and away from the sound or sight that inspired its unwanted barking, order your dog to sit.
Give your dog a treat every thirty seconds for several minutes.
If your dog starts barking again, distract it with another loud noise or surprising behavior, and start giving it treats again.

, If your dog engages in unwanted barking while out and about, you can equip it with a head halter. A head halter is a sort of strap that wraps around your dog’s nose and connects to another strap on the neck.A dog in a head halter might be more relaxed and restrained, and thus, less likely to bark.Never let your dog wear a head halter unsupervised.

, Some dog owners like to wind their dogs up for amusement by asking leading questions like “Who’s there?” when they and their dog hear a noise. Other owners train their dogs to ""speak"" for food, or bark when they want to go out. These behaviors can encourage unwanted barking in other circumstances and should be avoided.If a dog is allowed or encouraged to bark, whine, scratch, or beg for one kind of attention (to be let out, for instance), they will not be able to understand why it is not acceptable other times.

, Some dogs engage in unwanted barking as a way to amuse or stimulate themselves. In other words, they bark because they are bored. This compulsive barking is best cured by providing your dog with more opportunities for play and interaction.If you spend large stretches of the day out of the house, have a friend or neighbor visit your dog to let them out and play with them.
Compulsive barking of this sort might be accompanied by other behaviors like spinning or jumping while barking.
Dogs might also bark regularly out of separation anxiety, a problem which is often relieved through some combination of spending more time with your dog, the use of training aids like thunder wraps, reinforcing good behaviors and anti-anxiety medications prescribed by a vet.

Determine how severe your dog’s begging is.,
Feed your dog.,
Refocus your dog’s attention.,
Do not feed your dog while at the table.",How to Identify and Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviors3," There are several forms of begging. For instance, a mild case of begging might involve your dog sitting near you while you eat and gazing longingly at you. A more serious case might involve your dog barking in addition to sitting and staring at your during mealtime. And a very serious case of begging would involve your dog jumping up on you or leaning against the table and barking while you dine., One reason why your dog might beg is because it is hungry. In order to prevent begging, feed your dog before you eat so that it is not hungry during your mealtime.Don’t just feed your dog any old food. Ensure your dog is getting a healthy and balanced food that was formulated by a company with credentials in animal nutrition. Talk to your vet to ensure that your dog is getting everything it needs from its diet relative to its age, activity level, and size.
You may have heard about adding digestive enzyme supplements to your dog’s meal to help with digestion. Generally there is no reason to use these supplements unless your dog has a medical condition diagnosed by your vet.

, Give your dog a chew toy or KONG toy stuffed with kibble to keep it occupied while you eat. This will ensure that your dog never even knows that you are eating. And if your dog doesn’t know you’re eating, it cannot engage in unwanted begging., The most important thing you can do to prevent your dog from begging is to consistently refuse to give it food while it begs. Never give your dog food from your meal while you are eating. And if you do wish to share some scraps of an appropriate food with your dog when your meal is done, do not feed them to your dog while seated at the table. Instead, place them in its dish."

Feed your dog more.,
Spend more time with your dog.,
Help your dog through the teething process.,
Provide acceptable chewing opportunities.,
Keep items you don’t want your dog chewing on out of your dog’s reach.,
Utilize chewing deterrents.,
Confine your dog.",How to Identify and Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviors4," It is possible that your dog is chewing because it is not getting enough calories. If your dog is engaged in unwanted chewing, talk to your vet. Your vet will be able to determine whether your dog’s weight and size are appropriate relative to its breed and age. Irregularities in your dog’s size and weighty could indicate a caloric deficit., Some unwanted chewing is caused by separation anxiety. If you spend a large amount of time out of the house each day you can talk to a friend or family member about visiting or playing with your dog while you are away, take steps to reinforce good behaviors, talk to a vet about anxiety medication, or try a combination of these and other strategies. , If your dog is less than six months old, its unwanted chewing is likely related to its teething process, which can cause mild pain and irritation. Feeding your dog ice cubes in a bowl could help. Alternately, you could wet a washcloth, freeze it, then give it to your dog., It is natural and healthy for dogs to chew. You can help your dog engage in desirable chewing by giving your dog chew toys. There are a wide variety of chew toys. Some have squeakers or other noisemakers, and some have flavors like bacon or cheese. Visit your local pet store and obtain a variety of chew toys for your pooch.Pay attention to the types of chew toys your dog prefers. Provide more of the sorts of chew toys that occupy your dog’s attention longest.
Keep in mind that you should avoid giving aggressive chewers squeaky toys whose squeakers could be chewed out and swallowed, a potentially deadly situation.
In addition to chew toys, you could also offer your dog some edibles to chew on. For instance, many dogs enjoy consuming rawhide, pig ears, and pig skin rolls. Obtain some of these doggie snacks at your local pet store and offer them to your dog.

, Don’t leave clothing, books, papers, or other objects lying about. Doing so only opens the door to the possibility that your dog will engage in unwanted chewing.Keep closet and cupboard doors closed and valuable things out of reach
Keep garbage cans covered and inaccessible.

, Chewing deterrents refers to a wide class of sprays and applicable scents that discourage dogs from chewing. If your dog tends to chew a certain chair or pillow repeatedly, you can use chewing deterrents to ward your dog off.When you obtain a new chewing deterrent, place a few drops of it on a piece of wool. Place the wool bit gently in your dog’s mouth.
Your dog will spit the wool out and retch, shake its head, or cough. This experience will help your dog remember not to chew anything that has the scent of the deterrent next time it encounters it.
Reapply the deterrent daily for two to four weeks.
Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to apply your chewing deterrent.

, If your dog is confined, it cannot engage in unwanted chewing. You could keep your dog in a closed room or in a crate. However, do not use the crate as a substitute for careful monitoring. If you are home, your dog should generally not be crated unless it has engaged in an unwanted behavior.Ensure that your dog does not spend excessive time in its crate. Excessive confinement can lead to stress and actually increase the frequency of unwanted chewing.
An appropriately-sized crate will be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around.

Despite our hardest efforts, some little dogs will be just too stubborn or confused to lay down on their own without a little help.,
Position your dog in front of you, and place your hand gently on his shoulder blades.,
Repeat this until he begins to grasp the concept.",How to Teach a Small Dog to Lie Down on Command3,"  Some dogs learn fastest using this method.

,  Holding the treat in front of his nose pull it down towards the ground while exerting firm but gentle pressure on his shoulder blades (not his back).  This should encourage him to lay all the way down.

,  With enough repetition, he should begin to lay down when you pass your hand over his head to place it on his shoulder blades.  Once he is at this point, you can resume teaching him as outlined in the General Method

Create a good sleep environment.,
Train your dog to sleep in a crate.,
Get your dog plenty of exercise.,
Establish an evening routine.,
Give it time.,
Consider any sleep disruptions.,
Determine if your dog has medical problems.,
Let a new puppy adjust to your home.",How to Get Your Dog to Sleep," For a sleepless puppy, you can offer a warm blanket for sleeping. Place a clock that makes a rhythmic ticking sound nearby. You can also try playing the radio softly or use a white noise machine to help the puppy sleep. Consider using a heating pad under half of the crate to provide a warmer corner for cuddling.


Since the heating pad is outside and under the crate, the puppy should not be in any danger of chewing on the cord or pad.;
, If you want your dog to sleep in a crate, but he isn't crate-trained it may take some time to get him used to the crate. Do your research and be prepared to teach your dog that the crate is a good place. Put special treats in the back of crate to encourage investigation. Make sure that when you say ""kennel"" or ""crate"" you use a positive tone of voice. This tells him that going into the crate to sleep isn't a punishment.


If you use it as a punishment, you may find that your dog never grows accustomed to the crate as a relaxing and quiet place.

, Your dog may be restless at night if he's not getting enough exercise during the day. Depending on your dog’s breed, age and fitness level, you may be able to tire him out in 30 minutes or 3 hours (or more).You can exercise your dog at any time during the day that works with your schedule. Although, it's best to avoid a lot of activity the last hour or two before bedtime so that your dog has a chance to settle down.


Consider playing a new sport or activity like NoseWork, Rally, agility, tracking or Flyball with your dog.New activities mean learning new skills for both of you. Getting involved will increase mental and physical stimulation which helps both of you with exercise, boredom and will add to your bond.

, Make sure that your pet has had a chance to urinate and defecate right before bedtime. Feed your dog dinner a few hours before bedtime. This gives him plenty of time to digest and eliminate. Try keeping the hour or so before bedtime nice and calm which will set the tone for the night’s sleep to come.


If your dog is overly anxious, try giving him Adaptil. This is a product that replicates the pheromones of a nursing mother dog and may help settle your dog or puppy by reducing anxiety., Any changes in sleeping arrangements may take a while to get used to. Making sure that your dog gets plenty of exercise to the point of being tired is a great way to ensure a good night’s sleep for you two. Talk to your vet about using an antihistamine like Benadryl to help settle your dog for a few nights during a transitional period.

, Perhaps there are other issues causing a bit of unrest in your dog. Are you packing for a trip or moving? Are there guests in the house? A new neighbor? Loud noises? Just remember, dogs appreciate a routine. A small change to you (like moving your bedroom furniture) may seem like a big deal to the dog.


Some dogs are more anxious than others, so be patient and think about things from your dog’s perspective. Then, you can make changes accordingly.

, If this is an older dog that has been quiet and content before, try to determine if there is a medical problem. Talk to your veterinarian about any unexplained changes in your dog's behavior, including appetite, energy level and ability to move comfortably.


Pain or needing to go outside to eliminate in the middle of the night can cause a pet to whine and be restless during the night.

, It may take a few days (and nights) to adjust to the new household and routine. Establish ground rules at the beginning to create a good routine. This will help your puppy understand the end of day rituals that lead to getting to sleep in the new household. Feed your puppy at the same time in the evening, followed by a trip outside 15-20 minutes later to eliminate.Place the pup in his crate, which should be in your bedroom so that the puppy is close by. This way, he can communicate when he needs to go outside to eliminate during the night.

Teach your dog to sit.,
Train your dog for loose leash walking.,
Teach your dog the command “come.” When you dog is several feet, offer and a treat or a toy and command it to “come.” Do this on a regular basis until it responds to the command “come” without you offering a treat.,
Practice your commands near horses.,
Try to introduce your animals when they are young.,
Let them see each other from a distance.,
Bring your dog to the barn.,
Introduce your dog and horse in a controlled environment.,
Teach your dog to stay away from riding areas.,
Give your animals time to become disinterested in each other.,
Build a fence.,
Buy a shock collar.,
Hire a professional dog trainer.",How to Keep a Dog from Chasing Horses," Before you introduce your dog and horse you need to be sure that you have taught your dog the basic commands, like sitting, that would allow you to keep them safely under control. Get on your puppy’s level. Hold a treat close to its nose and move the treat up so that your dog begins to lower its butt. Once its butt hits the floor give it the treat.Tell your dog to “sit” while your dog moves its butt to the ground. Eventually it will come to associate the action with your command.
When your dog’s butt hits the ground, give it the treat. If you have a clicker, make a clicking sound as you feed your dog its treat. Once your dog associates the click with the treat, it will perceive the clicking sound as its own reward.
Praise your dog when it sits. Speak in a positive tone and pet it.
Repeat this trick several times a day, every day, for a week, then periodically thereafter.;
, Your need to be able to control your dog when it is on its leash. Never allow it to pull you forward with its leash. When it begins pulling stop and command it to sit.After getting your dog to sit, consider walking in the opposite direction. Over time, your dog should learn that rushing ahead of you will only slow it down.

, If your dog knows this command, you can call it back from a dangerous situation.


You don’t want to build negative associations with the command “come.” If you tell your dog to “come” and then scold it or do something--like give it a bath--that it doesn’t like, then it will be less prone to respond to “come” in the future. This can undermine your training and make it more difficult to control your dog in a dangerous situation., Practice the commands “sit” and “come” near a horse. Give your dog a treat every time that it executes commands successfully. Don’t punish your dog if it fails. It will probably take several sessions of progressively more demanding training for you to establish control over your dog when horses are around.


Sessions should be no longer than 15 minutes, so that your dog does not get tired.
Start far away from the horse. Each time your dog has a successful session, move closer for the next one. Eventually try to perform commands when someone is riding the horse, because this is when the dog’s hunting instincts will be most likely to kick in.

, Horses and dogs both reach peak socialization at around 12 weeks of age. It is during that period that you are most likely to be able to make them comfortable with each other. Don’t, however, let the animals run loose around each other at this age.


It is particularly dangerous to let a puppy run loose around a horse. The puppy might startle the horse and get kicked. Hold the puppy closely and introduce them in a controlled manner, until they are trained and responsible.

, Before you introduce your animals, give them time to acclimate to each other from a distance. With your dog on a leash, stand about 50 feet (15 m) away from the horse. Act as if nothing unusual is happening.If your dog barks or runs after the horse, tell your dog to sit and be quiet. Use your commands to keep your dog under control. Do not allow your dog near your horse until it can interact calmly with the horse from a distance.

, Bring your dog around the barn every day as you go through your routine. Get your dog acclimated to spending time near the horse. While in the barn, introduce your dog to the smell of the horse.


In the barn, allow your dog to smell the horse’s halter, headstall, or saddle blanket. Introducing your dog to the smell of the horse will put it at ease when the two are finally introduced., Outside of the barn, allow your dog and horse to approach each other, but be sure that both are firmly restrained. Allow them to smell each other.


If your dog begins to get aggressive—biting, barking, or growling—firmly correct it and separate the two briefly. Wait for about a minute and then allow them to approach each other again.
Your dog should be on a leash for this encounter. Your horse should be controlled by an experienced handler., If your dog comes to believe that areas where your horse runs quickly are safe, it will be likely to rush into a dangerous situation. Anytime your dog begins approaching a riding area tell it “no” and command it to “sit” or “come.”


For practice, try walking around the riding area with your dog on a leash. If it begins heading to the riding area tell it “no,” then command it to “sit” and have it come back to you., Ideally, your dog and horse won’t notice each other or pay the other much attention. The best way to accomplish this is to continue to allow them to see each other from a distance. Your dog should be near the barn on a regular basis, but never in a riding area.


It might take several months for your dog and horse to reach this level of comfort. Until then, ensure that they are physically separated or under constant supervision when they are together., The best way to ensure that your dog stays away from your horse is to fence them off from each other. Many retailers sell fences that are specifically designed for horses. It is important to use these, because they are designed to be visible to the horse and protect the horse if it collides with the fence., A shock collar will allow you to send a mild electric shock to your dog when it begins behaving badly. Usually a few shocks will be enough to teach a dog not to engage in bad behavior. Shock your dog when it begins approached the horse’s riding area. This method will cause pain, but it is not dangerous., Professional trainers are familiar with advanced dog training techniques that you might have trouble employing. A well-trained dog even run safely alongside a horse. However, this requires that the dog be taught a variety of signs and be taught to keep a certain distance from the horse. It is dangerous for an amateur to try to teach these sort of techniques.For advanced skills, like teaching a dog to run safely near the horse, you will need to find a trainer who also works with horses and is thus qualified to teach both animals to work together.
Several sessions with a dog trainer might cost between $300 to $600."

Get to know your reactive dog’s body language.,
Stand close to your dog while it eats.,
Approach your dog while it eats.After your reactive dog has had 10 meals during which it did not engage in reactive behavior, begin incorporating some movement into your feeding routine.,
Move closer to the reactive dog.After your dog has had 10 meals without reactive behaviors and you are within two feet of your dog’s dish before stepping back, your reactive dog is ready for the next stage.,
Encourage your dog to eat from your hand.,
Touch your dog’s bowl.,

Proceed with caution.,
Have everyone in your family engage in counterconditioning.,
Get professional help.,
Do not punish your reactive dog for not relaxing around food.Do not tie your dog up by its leash in a dark room, yell at the dog, or yank at the dog’s leash.",How to Help a Reactive Dog Relax Around Food1," The body language of a reactive dog can be difficult to discern. But generally, a happy dog will wag its tail, perk up its ears, and raise its head. An agitated or aggressive dog will growl, stand stiffly, snarl, snap or bite, and lower its head to line up with its spine. Watch your dog’s head, tail, and mouth closely for signs that indicate its mood.A reactive dog is one that growls, lunges, or bites when eating. A reactive dog guards its food because it believes that another pet or person will take it. If you notice your dog growling, lunging, or biting other pets or people who come near it during meal times, your dog is reactive around food.
Pay attention to your reactive dog when it seems to be happy. For instance, when your dog is taking a walk with your or sitting on the couch while you watch TV, what does your reactive dog do? Write the dog’s behavior down in a small notepad so you can refer to it later.
Conversely, take note of your reactive dog’s behavior when it is being reactive. Does it gulp food greedily, stare at you or other potential food thieves, or engage in some other reactive behavior?;
, If you notice reactive behavior at any point during your early attempts to help your reactive dog relax around food, you will need to engage in a counterconditioning program to break it of its bad behavior. While your reactive dog is eating kibble from its bowl, move to within five or six feet (about two meters) of it.Say, “Wow, that looks good” in a gentle and reassuring way.
Toss a treat toward the bowl when you start speaking.
Do not move closer to your reactive dog, but continue to speak to your dog and administer treats every 20 seconds or so until your dog has finished eating.
If your dog moves toward you to obtain more treats, ignore it. Continue the training when it has resumed eating.

, While your reactive dog is eating from its dog food bowl, situate yourself at the same distance you were previously at. Say, “Wow, that looks good” in a friendly way. While speaking, take one small step forward and toss a treat in your dog’s dish. Step back immediately. Repeat every 20 seconds or so until your reactive dog has completed its meal.Continue getting a few steps closer to your dog’s bowl each day while tossing a treat in.

, Situate yourself next to your dog’s food dish and drop a treat into it. While dropping the treat into the bowl, say “Wow, that looks good” in a calm and reassuring way.Then, immediately walk away. Come back after 20 seconds and repeat.
Stop approaching the bowl and dropping treats in it when your dog is done eating.

, When you’ve successfully approached your dog’s bowl as it eats and dropped a treat in it 10 times, your dog could be ready to eat from your hand. Approach your dog as it is eating and say. “Wow, that looks good” in a reassuring and friendly tone. Hold a treat in your hand and let it dangle at your side. Walk away and collect another treat.Return to your reactive dog as it is eating about 20 seconds later with another treat in hand. Repeat the reassuring mantra and allow your dog to pluck the treat from your hand.
Gradually lower yourself to the dog’s level when you offer it to take the treat from your hand. For instance, the first four times you offer your dog to take the treat from your hand, stand upright. The fifth and six times, bend slightly at the knees. During the seventh and eight passes, bend even further. Eventually, you should be on one knee next to your dog as it eats when feeding it a dog treat.

, Once your reactive dog has consumed a treat directly from your hand while you kneel next to its bowl during 10 consecutive meals, you’re ready for the final step. For the final stage of counterconditioning, do exactly what you did in the previous step, but while your dog eats a treat from your hand, touch your dog’s food bowl., After 10 meals in which you were able to successfully touch the reactive dog’s bowl, add a new twist. Instead of just touching the bowl, start lifting the bowl from the ground and dropping a tasty treat in it, then returning it to its rightful spot in front of the reactive dog. After three or four meals, raise the bowl off the ground to a greater elevation. After six or seven meals, raise it higher still.By the time you get to your reactive dog’s tenth meal, you should be able to pick up the dish, walk a few meters away with it, then return it to where you originally picked it up.
Remember to drop a treat in the bowl each time you raise it.

, If at any point during the counterconditioning your dog exhibits reactive behavior, revert back to the previous stage. For instance, if your dog starts growling or snapping during the stage in which you stand directly over its bowl and drop treats into it, remove yourself to a distance of about two feet and toss a treat toward the dish., When you do counterconditioning with your dog, your reactive dog doesn’t really become conditioned to relax around food. Instead, it becomes conditioned to relax around you when food is present. For the dog to remain calm around food when the other members of your family are present, each of them will have to undertake these same counterconditioning exercises.Nobody under the age of 18 should attempt these exercises unless properly supervised.

, If you find that your dog is very reactive around food, or you doubt your ability to condition your dog to relax around food, get a professional involved.Professional dog trainers can help your reactive dog to relax around food. Find a trainer at a puppy kindergarten or obedience school.Ask your vet for a recommendation or use your yellow pages to look up pet trainers or obedience schools. The best trainer will be a certified applied animal behaviorist, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, or a certified dog professional. Ask the certified dog professional if they have experience treating reactive dogs who cannot relax around food, since this might not be part of their repertoire.
Explain your problem to the trainers and ask it they can help. For instance, you might say, “My reactive dog will not relax around food. Can you help?”
You might also be able to obtain guidance from a DVD or book. Check your public library for books and DVDs with information about how to train reactive dogs to relax around food.

, This will only agitate and upset your reactive dog even more.Yelling at your reactive dog or scaring it could make it even more reactive and less calm around food.

Say a short command (like ""Sit"") in a loud, clear voice. Say the command one time only, to teach the dog that he needs to respond right away.
To get the dog to sit, raise the treat above the dog's ahead, or gently press down on the hindquarters. For other commands, you may need to mimic what you want the dog to do, or wait until the dog does it accidentally.
Praise the dog as soon as he obeys, and give the treat. Many dog owners use a clicker tool to make a sound that the dog will learn means a reward.;
, Once the dog knows a couple commands (at least Sit and Come), you can start teaching it good manners during fetch. The Drop It command is useful for dogs that won't let go of the ball or stick, even while they're begging for you to throw it again. Here's how to train this behavior:Give the dog a toy to hold in its mouth. Choose one it likes to play fetch with.
Hold a small treat near its mouth. Pick something the dog likes, but not so much that it ignores the toy.
When the dog lets go to eat the food, say ""Drop it"" and pick up the toy.
Repeat until the dog starts opening its mouth as your hand approaches. When this happens, start saying ""Drop it"" before the toy is released.
Finally (perhaps after several 5–15 minute sessions), leave out the food and reward the dog with praise instead.

, When the dog tries to start a fetch session, throwing the ball will teach it that this method works. This isn't a problem for many dogs, but if yours wants to play fetch for 24 hours, deflect these requests with other activities. Take the dog outside instead, go for a job, or give him a belly rub. Once the dog is distracted, get its attention and start a fetch session. This shows that you are the one who decides when to play fetch, not the dog.e yourself.

, Don't let the dog determine when you play fetch. Watching her bark, whine, and jump isn't fun, but if you give in, she'll learn that it gets her what she wants.Don't give in to ""one last throw"" after you decide to end it.


A stern ""That's enough"" or ""No play"" command can teach some dogs to stop bothering you.This is more difficult to train, since you can only use the command while the dog is misbehaving. Try an additional signal, such as clapping your hands, to reinforce the idea.
When playing outdoors, end the play session by putting on the leash and walking calmly back inside or to the car.

, Some ""ball-obsessed"" dogs, including many retrievers, have trouble resisting the extreme drive to play fetch. If you've tried training for two or three weeks and you aren't happy with the results, start a fetch schedule. Play fetch only at certain times of day, in five minute sessions — or longer sessions with a break every five minutes.If you regularly visit a dog park or other play area, consider only playing fetch during those visits.


The more structured the play session is, the more likely the dog is to learn how it works. Try starting each session by saying ""Playtime!,"" and giving the dog a set of commands: ""Sit,"" ""Stay,"" ""Fetch,"" ""Come,"" ""Drop It.""

Wait for the verdict.",How to Sue a Dog Owner for Bites," You should have immediately reported the bite to the police so that they could investigate. You should get a copy of the police report by calling or stopping into the police station.


You will introduce the police report into evidence at trial.
You should also read it to see if there are any witnesses listed. You might have been in too much pain after the bite to find out the names of witnesses. This information could be on the police report.;
, As soon as possible, you should take pictures of the bite. Use color photography. Color photographs can be powerful evidence of the bite marks, which will probably have healed by the time your court case goes to trial.


A dog might have also attacked your livestock.You should take photographs and video of the damage to your livestock.

, You also should ask for a copy of your medical records. Contact any hospital or doctor’s office that you visited. Ask for copies of the relevant records.


You have a federal right to inspect, review, and copy your medical records.However, you might also have to pay a fee to get copies.

, If you win your lawsuit, then the dog’s owner has to compensate you for your injuries. You can get compensation for any medical care you paid for because of the bite.Gather copies of the following:


hospital bills
doctor’s bills
receipts for prescription drugs
bills for therapy or counseling

, If you missed work and lost wages because of the dog bite, then you can be compensated for that as well.You should get evidence that shows how much you currently make:


a recent pay stub
a recent W-2 or tax form

, You can also be compensated for “pain and suffering” damages. These can be hard to calculate; however, you can generally get a rough estimate by multiplying your other damages by two or four.For example, your medical bills and lost wages might total $1,000. You then could get an additional $2,000-4,000 for pain and suffering.
If a child was bitten, then you can usually get more. A child probably suffers greater emotional harm than an adult from the bite.
You also could get more if the dog is a dangerous breed, such as a pit bull or a Doberman.

, You can also get compensated for damage the dog did to your property. For example, if the dog bit your livestock and killed it, then you can get compensated for the market value of the livestock.


You can also get compensated for damage done to your clothing, if the dog managed to tear through your clothes.

, Before filing your lawsuit, you want to understand how much money you are entitled to. The law works differently, depending on your state or city.


In some states, you can get double or triple damages if you are bitten by a dog which has bitten a person before.Your law might also allow “punitive” damages. Other damages—for loss of work, pain and suffering, and medical bills—are meant to compensate you. But punitive damages are intended to punish the dog owner.
You might be able to get punitive damages if the dog owner has been very careless letting a dangerous dog run around. You also could get punitive damages if your injuries are severe.

, You can sue in the county where the defendant lives or where the bite occurred (if that is a different county).If you live in the same county as the defendant, then visit your county courthouse.


You should also think about suing in small claims court. Your injuries may not be worth even a thousand dollars. Small claims courts have been created to help people bring lawsuits for small amounts of money. You do not need a lawyer, and the court often meets at convenient times, such as in the evening or on weekends.
You should check with your court clerk about the maximum amount you can bring in small claims court. This amount varies by state, but is frequently between $5,000 and $10,000., Once you have gathered your evidence and found the correct court, you need to start the lawsuit by filing a “complaint.” The complaint explains the facts surrounding the lawsuit and also states how much you want in compensation.Many courts have printed “fill in the blank” forms that you can use. You should stop in and ask the court clerk for the form.
If there is no form, then you will have to find a complaint form in a book or CD of legal forms.

, Each court’s form will be different. However, they will generally ask for information like the following:your name and address
the dog owner’s name and address
your lawyer’s name, if you have a lawyer
a brief description of why you should be compensated
how much compensation you are suing for

, You might need to have the form notarized.If you do, then wait to sign until you appear before the notary public.


There should be a notary public in the courthouse. Alternately, you can find a notary in most large banks.
Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification with you when you appear before the notary. Typically, a valid driver’s license or state ID is acceptable. You also could use a passport.

, You usually have the ability to pick a jury, although some states do not allow juries in their small claims courts.If you don’t want a jury, then you can have the judge decide the case. There should be a box on your complaint form for you to check.


You might benefit from a jury. For example, a jury will be more sympathetic to you as the victim. Almost everyone has had a scary encounter with a dog at some point in their life and they might want to punish the defendant.
However, there are also negatives to having a jury. If you are representing yourself in the lawsuit, you might not feel comfortable delivering an opening and closing statement to a jury. Instead, you might want only a judge to decide the case.
You also might have to pay a larger fee if you choose a jury.

, Make several copies of your complaint and take them all with you to the court clerk’s office. Ask to file the original. The court clerk should be willing to stamp all of your copies with the date.


You probably will have to pay a filing fee.The amount will vary depending on the court. Call ahead to ask the court clerk what the filing fee will be and what are acceptable methods of payment.
If you cannot afford the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver.

, You must give the dog owner a copy of your complaint. You also need to send a summons, which you can get from the court clerk. Ask the court clerk what methods of service are acceptable.Generally, you can have a person 18 or older who is not a party to the lawsuit make service. This person could hand deliver the complaint and summons to the dog owner.
You might also hire a private process server. Look in your phone book or on the Internet. Typically, they charge $45-75 per service.Whoever makes service will probably have to fill out a Proof of Service or Affidavit of Service form. You can get this from the court clerk. After service is made, the server fills it out and returns it to you. You should file the original with the court and keep a copy for your records.

, You might be overwhelmed with the process of filing a lawsuit. If so, you could hire an attorney. To find an attorney, you can contact your state or local bar association and ask for a referral.


Even if you don’t have the money to hire a lawyer, you might want to meet with one for a consultation. Many lawyers offer a half hour consultation for free or for a reduced price. During the consultation, you could ask the lawyer any questions that you have.
You can also ask the lawyer if they provide “unbundled” legal services. Under this arrangement, you can hire the lawyer to do specific tasks. For example, an attorney could represent you at trial or simply offer advice. Using unbundled legal services is an effective way to keep legal costs down.

, You should look professional for your trial. The judge and jury will form impressions about you based on your appearance, so you want to look neat and clean.


Men should wear a suit if they have one. If they don’t, then they can wear dress pants and a button-up dress shirt with a tie. Men should also wear dress shoes (not sneakers) and dark-colored socks.
Women should also wear a skirt suit or pant suit. Otherwise, women can wear a conservative dress or slacks with a nice blouse.
For more tips, see Dress for a Court Hearing.

, If you chose to have a jury, then the first thing you will do is choose jurors. The judge begins jury selection by calling a panel of prospective jurors to the front of the courtroom. The judge then asks them basic questions, such as their job, hobbies, etc.


Jurors are also asked if they can be fair. If a juror can’t be fair, then you should ask the judge to dismiss the prospective juror “for cause.” You can remove a juror for cause if they know too much about the case already, know either you or the defendant, or have admitted that they can’t be fair.The judge should also give you a limited number of “peremptory” challenges. You can use these to remove any prospective juror. However, you can’t use them in a way that discriminates against jurors on the basis of race or sex., After the jury is sworn in, you will make an opening statement. You will go first, and the defendant will go second. You should use your opening statement to present the jury with a “road map” of what your evidence will be.Be sure to stick to just the facts, not arguments.For example, you can say, “As the evidence will show, on October 31, 2015, the Plaintiff was walking across her lawn when a dog approached her from the street. As the evidence will further show, this dog was a 100-pound pit bull, with no leash.”

, You can present witnesses in support of your case. In a dog bite lawsuit, however, you might not have any witnesses. Nevertheless, you will probably want to testify as the victim. You can tell the jury how the dog attacked you, and the pain it caused you.


If you have an attorney, the attorney can ask you questions. If you are representing yourself, then you will probably deliver your testimony to the jury in the form of a speech.
You can also expect the judge to ask you questions if you don’t have a lawyer. The judge will also try to keep you from rambling or getting off track.
For tips on how to question your witnesses, see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself.

, After you present your case, the dog owner gets to go next. He or she can also call witnesses. If witnesses are called, you can cross-examine them. You can approach cross examination in a couple of different ways.


First, you might not ask the witness any questions. Not every witness offers testimony that hurts you. If you don’t have anything to ask the witness, then simply stand and say, “No questions, your honor.” Then thank the witness for coming into court.
You can also show that the witness is biased. For example, the dog owner might have a family member testify. You can ask the witness about their relationship to the dog owner and their relationship to the dog. By highlighting this information, you show the jury that the witness might have a motivation to lie.

, Once all evidence has been submitted, you and the dog owner can make your closing arguments. As the plaintiff, you will go first. Now is your chance to draw together all of your evidence and explain how it supports your case.


Be sure to refer to specific pieces of evidence in your closing argument.The jury might have forgotten what was presented, or the jury might not have understood why it was significant.
For example, you could say, “I showed you two medical reports, if you remember. The first was dated October 31, 2015 and came from a Doctor Tyler. That report stated that the wound was ‘serious’ and at least one inch deep.”

, At the close of evidence, the judge will read the jury its instructions. The jury then retires to deliberate. If you took a bench trial, then the judge might take some time to deliberate, or he or she could make an immediate ruling.


In most states, the jury does not need to be unanimous for you to win. In many states, you can win if 3/4 of the jurors side with you. For example, if nine out of 12 jurors agree with you, then you may win your dog bite lawsuit."

Hide the ball.,
Distract the dog.,
Get a mechanical thrower.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Playing Fetch With You2," If you don't want to play fetch, take the ball or other thrown object and hide it. Do this when the dog isn't looking, and place the ball somewhere the dog can't see it.


If your dog want to play fetch constantly (and is getting adequate exercise), keep the ball hidden. Only take it out during playtime.
When outside, hold the ball on the side opposite the dog, or hide it in a bag.

, Try this of the dog won't obey a ""drop it"" command, or won't stop harassing you. Show the dog a treat and toss it next to him. Toss another treat a few feet (couple meters) away. When the dog goes for it, grab the ball and hide it.


This is best used when you're looking after another person's dog and urgently need cooperation. If this is your own dog, training it is the better long term option.

, These devices automatically launch tennis balls across your backyard or hallway. If your dog is bored or doesn't get enough exercise, this could be a good solution.


Keep an eye on the dog the first few times it plays. Make sure the thrower doesn't launch the ball hard enough to hurt the dog.
Several short play sessions a day are healthier than one long play session. Puppies and old dogs are especially vulnerable to injury, and should stop after five minutes to catch their breath and drink water.

Find a muzzle that matches your dog's measurements.,
Decide on a type of muzzle.,
Test the muzzle's fit.,
Encourage the dog to wear the muzzle.,
Get the dog used to the muzzle.,
Put on the muzzle in risky situations.,
Watch for warning signs.,
Only use the muzzle when necessary.,
Make the dog ask for permission.,
Try other methods first.,
Respond to nipping with commands and muzzling.,
Remove the muzzle once the dog is calm.,
Be ready to return to the muzzle.",How to Use a Muzzle to Correct Nipping in Dogs," Most muzzles are labeled with two to four measurements. The first measurement is the circumference around the dog's mouth. The second number is the length from the tip of the nose to the back of the head. Some muzzles also measure the length from the tip of the nose to the point in between the dog's eyes, or from the point between a dog's eyes to the back of the skull.;
, There are two types of muzzle design:


Some muzzles still allow the dog to drink water and pant. These may not prevent all nips, but they should greatly reduce the danger.
Some muzzles keep the dog's mouth shut completely. These should not be used for more than a few minutes. If left on longer, the dog could panic or overheat due to an inability to pant.

, Read the instructions for the muzzle and make sure you know how to put it on correctly. The muzzle should not be uncomfortably tight, but it should be snug enough that the dog can't tug it off. The muzzle should cover at least 50–70% of the dog's mouth.


If the dog's eyes are covered in any way, the muzzle is probably on upside down, an easy mistake to make.
Let the dog attempt to remove the muzzle by rubbing its snout on the ground or using its paws to pull the muzzle off. If it succeeds, try a different size.

, Allow the dog to smell and investigate the muzzle. Once it calms down, practice placing the muzzle on and off the dog using mild positive praise when they cooperate. Praise enthusiastically once the dog has calmed down, while you remove the muzzle. Repeat several times.


If the dog starts nipping, keep putting on the muzzle each time it nips. Give less praise each time so the dog gets a sense that it has not pleased you.

, Go for a short walk, let the dog wear it around the house for a few minutes, or practice obedience training with the muzzle on. Get the dog used to the muzzle, or it may panic and become more aggressive when you try to use it in an urgent situation.


Remember, if the muzzle keeps the dog's mouth closed completely, do not keep it on for more than a few minutes.

, Identify the risky situations that have caused your dog to nip in the past. Does it happen at the park or in the house? Does it happen during mealtimes, or while playing? Identify the common factors that are present when your dog nips, then muzzle your dog whenever it's about to face these situations. Remove the muzzle once the situation has passed.


This may make your dog less aggressive over time, if it learns to handle its needs in a different way.

, If you know your dog's warning signs before it nips, muzzle it as soon as you see one. Stiff body language, raised fur, and growling are common signs.


Before you try the muzzle, give the dog a command to stop (""uh uh"" or ""no""). If the dog doesn't obey, muzzle it immediately (ideally within a few seconds).

, Do not keep the muzzle on the dog for more than 30 minutes at a time.If the dog responds well to the muzzle, you may be able to use the muzzle for shorter and shorter times.

, If your dog nips at strangers or other dogs, muzzle it and take it to a park on a leash. Keep it next to you, with a short grip on the leash. Do not allow it to roam on its own or even approach another person, dog, or object on its own. If the dog looks back at you, grant it permission to approach that target.


In this exercise, the muzzle is used mostly as protection. It's the control over the dog's behavior that corrects the aggression.

, Punishment methods rarely work on dogs, who have trouble connecting them to bad behavior.If the dog doesn't understand what you're doing, muzzling or hitting in response to bad behavior can even increase aggression.Try training methods based on positive conditioning.


If the nipping dog is a puppy, have it spend time around adult dogs to learn ""dog etiquette.""
If you do try using the muzzle as described below, watch how your dog reacts. Don't hesitate to stop the muzzle training if the dog remains aggressive.

, Give the dog a ""stop"" or ""no"" command if it nips. If it doesn't stop immediately, muzzle within a few seconds.


If you wait more than a few seconds, the dog will probably not understand why it is being muzzled.

, Wait until the dog lies down or sits, and maintains eye contact. Remove the muzzle without any words or fuss, to avoid getting the dog worked up. It should understand that staying calm is the way to get the muzzle removed.


It can take 20–30 minutes for the dog to calm down the first few times, but this should get shorter. You will need a muzzle that allows the dog to open its mouth enough to pant and drink.
f the dog is still anxious after 30 minutes, the muzzle may not be the right tool for your dog. Remove the muzzle and try another method.

, Over time, your dog will hopefully stop nipping or growling. Be consistent with your reaction to nipping even as it fades away, or the dog can slide back into old habits. Continue to use the ""stop"" or ""no"" command, until the dog obeys immediately. If the dog doesn't obey, bring back the muzzle.

Make a schedule with all household members.,
Stock up on chew toys and treats.,
Hire a dog walker.,
Practice departure routines.,
Shift meal times gradually.,
Maintain a crate time schedule.,
Walk your dog at regular times of day.,
Establish a bed-time ritual.,
Keep up the routine even on weekends.,
Give it time.",How to Help a Dog Adjust to Your Household Routine," In order to change your and your dog’s routine, you need to get organized and figure out exactly what logistical changes you’re expecting. On a weekly calendar, write down every family member’s departure and arrival times, as well as who will be home at what times.


Once you’ve consolidated the household schedule, work in all the dog-related chores. Be specific about how many times a day you’re planning to go for walks and have meals, at what times, who will be doing it, and any other contingency plans.;
, Chances are, your dog’s new routine will involve at least a little bit of solo time. Chew toys are one of the best ways to ease your dog’s separation anxiety and keep it occupied during these stretches of solitary time. Opt for hard rubber toys rather than rawhide or real animal bones, as these animal-tissue equivalents are choking hazards.In addition to keeping rubber chew toys available at all times, give your dog a Kong-type peanut butter cone or other special treat before you head out the door. This safety cue gets your dog used to the routine of departure and provides reassurance that you’ll be returning shortly., If your household schedule shows extended periods of time during the day when no one will be home to take the dog out, you should find a dog walker or friend who lives in the neighborhood to fill in. After all, being stuck at home alone is already stressful for your canine friend. This stress can easily multiply if your dog also needs to go to the bathroom and has to hold it in over long periods of time.If you don’t know anyone in the neighborhood who would want to walk your dog, check out a mobile app such as Wag! or Swifto that can connect you with available, professional dog walkers., Once you know at what times different family members will be leaving the house, start practicing this schedule well before it actually takes effect. This will show your dog that departures are normal and not cause for anxiety.For example, if you’re going to be leaving at 7 p.m. every evening for a graveyard shift, start gathering your keys, bags, and coat at 6:30 every evening and leaving the house. Give your dog its safety cue—the toy you customarily give out when you're leaving the house—and, depending on your routine, put it in the crate as you usually would. Leave the house entirely and stay out for at least ten or twenty minutes. Return quietly and with little fanfare.

, You want to feed your dog at specific times of day rather than leaving the bowl out, as this mealtime practice builds additional structure into your dog’s day. If you find that your new schedule means that old mealtimes won’t work out, make this mealtime shift incrementally so that your dog experiences minimal disruption in its appetite and consumption habits.For example, perhaps your dog used to eat every morning at 9 a.m. and every evening at 7 p.m. Your new work schedule, though, requires you to be out of the house 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Start putting out your dog’s bowl at 8:45 a.m. and 6:45 p.m. for a few days, then move up another fifteen minutes, and so on.

, If your dog is already crate-trained, you can alter its crate schedule gradually just as you did with meal time. Just be sure that you’re not all the sudden requiring your dog to spend long hours in the crate when it has only spent brief periods in the crate in the past. You want to keep your dog’s associations with the crate positive, so never use it for extended periods of time or as a punishment for bad behavior.If your dog has never used the crate before, it’s probably unrealistic to try integrating this foreign component into your dog’s daily routine. Ask your vet or a dog trainer if they think you could make this change.

, Exercise is one of the best ways both humans and dogs alike can relieve pent-up stress and energy. You can make this activity even more stress-reducing by incorporating it into your stable routine. Take your dog out three times a day every day, and do so at specific hours of the day.


If you have a backyard, you can let your dog out for potty breaks in between walks, but never substitute proper walks with yard time., Many canine experts and trainers recommend that you have your dog sleep in the crate or on a dog bed, but you can choose whichever routine you like with your dog as long as you keep it consistent. Whether your dog sleeps with you in bed or has its own bed on the floor, it will automatically begin to wind down each evening at a certain time if it knows when to expect bed time every night.If your new schedule requires you to work a graveyard shift, you can still establish a consistent bed-time routine with your dog. If you live with someone who works normal hours, have them perform nighttime rituals such as dinner feedings, evening walks, and ordering your dog to its bed.

, In the first couple months of a new routine, you should strive to keep the exact same schedule every day without fail. This means departing and arriving at the same times, even on days when you’re not working, and maintaining the same walk schedule even if you have all day to hang around at the dog park.This doesn’t mean you can’t take your dog on bonus walks and outings when you have a day off. Just be sure not to replace normal walks with these mid-day jaunts.

, No matter what new routine you and your dog are adjusting to, know that this transition period will take some time. Expect some problematic behaviors such as whining, chewing, or anxious licking in the first few days and weeks, and don’t make any massive changes overnight.If it’s been three months and your dog still seems uneasy in the new routine, you might need to reevaluate your chosen methods and schedule. Perhaps your new routine simply requires your dog to spend too much time alone and you’ll need to find a dog sitter or other friend who can come over and hang out every day, or perhaps your dog needs some new toys or other distractions to keep it engaged.

Treat your small dog like a big dog.,
Socialize your small dog.,
Recognize misbehavior.,
Train your dog.,
Make your dog earn its treats.,
Give your small dog its own sleeping space.",How to Handle a Little Dog with a Big Attitude1," While you may want to protect or baby your little dog, this can cause misbehavior. Let your dog play with other dogs, go for walks, and explore its surroundings. Avoid letting your small dog get away with aggressive behavior that you wouldn't tolerate in a larger dog.If you're overprotective of your little dog, you can make the dog anxious and fearful. These feelings can make it overly aggressive towards other dogs.;
, Expose your dog to a variety of people, dogs, and situations. The earlier you begin to socialize your dog, the better. Socialization will help your little dog learn to interact with its environment which can prevent aggressive behavior.Consider taking your little dog to the dog park or puppy training classes. These can also make you feel more comfortable about your little dog interacting with bigger dogs in a controlled environment.

, Training your dog lets you communicate with your dog so it learns what behavior is acceptable. You can also prevent aggressive or dominant behavior, if you let your dog know that it is not in control. If you see any of these misbehaviors in your dog, work on training to stop them:Barking at other dogs
Nipping or biting
Jumping
Growling

, Manage your little dog's attitude by training it. This is also an important part of preventing misbehavior. Teach your dog basic commands like ""come"", ""sit"", ""stay"", or ""drop it"". Begin training your little dog by keeping it on a leash. This will give you control over the situation until your little dog can handle being around big dogs.Be consistent when training your little dog. Your little dog should always know what to expect when it misbehaves.

, It's easy to give little dogs treats for just being cute, but this can actually cause its attitude problems. Instead, you should give your dog treats as rewards for doing things. Your dog could earn treats for exercising, responding to training, or behaving well around big dogs.Avoid hand-feeding your little dog its treats. Hand-feeding can contribute to the pack leader mindset that you're trying to manage.

, Dogs will look for the comfiest place to rest in order to prove their dominance. This is why it's important that you never let your little dog sleep in your bed with you. Doing so will only give your dog the impression that it's the pack leader. Instead, designate a sleeping space for your dog and make it use the space.For example, you could set up a doggie bed in the corner of a spare room. If your dog tries to come into your room to sleep at night, return the dog to their space and close your bedroom door.

If this is the case, your playful dog will have a relaxed body that isn't tense or aggressive. When he nips or bites, the puppy or dog won't show teeth or bite down hard.However, if your dog is aggressively biting, his body will be stiff, he'll show his teeth, and he'll bite quickly and hard.


Pay attention to your dog attitude, in addition to his body language. Chances are, you'll already have a good idea as to whether your dog is unhappy and acting out, or if he's simply playing.;
, Dogs just don’t suddenly bite. Instead, dogs bite as a reaction to a situation or feeling. You'll need to watch your dog's body language in order to figure out why he bites. It's important to determine this since you'll need to deal with your dog differently depending on whether he's biting from playfulness or aggression. Your dog may bite if he is:Hungry
Scared or feels threatened
Defending himself or his territory
Sick or in pain
Overly excited during play

, You can figure out your dog's mood by paying attention to his body language.Knowing how your dog is feeling will help you respond appropriately and prevent future biting. Look to see if your dog is biting and:


Relaxed: Your dog will have a calm stance and relaxed facial muscles with an open mouth. His ears will be in the natural position (erect or floppy depending on the breed) or slightly forward if he's alert. He may be wagging his tail or holding it naturally and his fur will lay flat.
Aggressive: Your dog's ears and tail will be erect (while the tail might slowly wag from side to side). His muscles will be tense while his fur stands up along his back. He'll show his teeth and stare directly at you or whatever is bothering him. Note that you shouldn't meet his gaze, slowly back away, and get a barrier (like a chair, door, or backpack) between you.
Afraid: Your dog will cower with his ears back, his body tense, and his tail tucked between his legs. He may bite because he feels he can't flee from a frightening situation.

, If your dog is aggressive or even if he bites for no apparent reason, you must get immediate control of him. Use a harness, muzzle, or head halter to prevent him from further biting.Don't let your dog go outside the house without being on a leash and unless he's accompanied by a responsible adult holding the handle.


You should never leave a dog that bites alone with children. In fact, your dog shouldn't be around children outside the immediate household until his biting is stopped.

, Once you've gotten control of your dog, you need to take him to the vet for an exam and behavioral consultation. Your vet may find that the dog is suffering from a medical condition (like brain dysfunction from stroke or old age) or is in pain (from arthritis or an injury). If your vet determines a cause for the grumpiness and biting, treatment may be recommended that can stop the biting.If there's no medical explanation for the biting, ask your veterinarian to determine if the dog may be acting out of fear or because he's defending his belongings.

, Your vet may be able to recommend an animal behavioral specialist. The specialist can work with your dog to make sure he's properly trained. Working with a professional trainer is especially important if there was a human injury involved, since you most likely will not be able to correct the biting behavior on your own.


Make sure the professional you work with has been certified to work with aggressive animals. Look for a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB), a veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB) or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) in your area., You can expose your dog to less intense versions of whatever is scaring him. Gradually, increase the intensity of the situation to make him become comfortable with what he fears.Make sure you start in small amounts, with short exposure times before increasing them. Your dog should become comfortable with each new exposure.


For example, if your dog is scared of men in hats, let him look through a window or a glass door at man with a hat in your yard (you may have to enlist the help of a friend). The person should just be doing simple things like sitting and reading or standing across the street.
When your dog acts calm despite the presence of the feared object, reward him. Then allow the person to move a bit closer and repeat the praise. You may need to do this over a period of weeks or even months to retrain your dog.

, As much as you may want to help your dog work through his fear, you need to let him work through it on his own. Don’t cuddle or reassure your dog while desensitizing him. You can keep treats around to reward your dog for good behavior. You should also keep him on a leash in case he reacts poorly and you need to control him.


For example, if your dog is scared of men in hats, but hasn't run away when watching a man in a hat, have the man gently toss a few treats towards your dog. This way, he knows the man isn't a threat. Eventually, your dog should grow to accept the man and he may even enter the same room as your dog. Then, the man can hand feed your dog treats.
Make sure the person in the hat knows not to offer the dog a treat when the dog is acting fearfully or barking, as this will reward and reinforce the bad behavior.

, If your puppy or dog starts mouthing, nipping, or biting while you're playing, give a high pitched yelp. At the same time, let your hand go limp and stop playing. This will startle your dog and he should stop mouthing your hand. Immediately reward him when he backs off and start playing again. Repeat this every time he nips or bites so he associates biting with lack of attention.Most dogs learn bite inhibition as puppies when they played with their littermates. If a puppy bites another puppy too hard, the bitten pup will yelp loudly startling the biting puppy. This teaches the puppy good canine citizenship.

, You can curb your dog's biting behavior by teaching basic commands like ""sit,"" ""down,"" ""stay,"" ""look,"" and ""come."" Train your dog every day until he's mastered them. Break up the sessions into two 10 minute training periods and only work with your dog when he's relaxed. You can then use these commands to control your dog if he's ever off leash and starts to act up.Be consistent when teaching commands and use positive reinforcement like praise and rewards. Never punish or hit your dog, which will just reinforce negative behavior and make him fear you.
Practice in a calm environment (fenced in yard, quiet room in the house) and be patient. If you find you can't train, enroll your dog in obedience classes.

, Try to take your dog for three or four long walks throughout the day. This will get your dog outside and give him a chance to burn off steam and energy. You can also stimulate him, especially if you're gone through the day, by giving him sturdy rubber treat or food dispensing toys that can be filled with kibble or peanut butter. Your dog will spend time biting the toy to get to the treats which also helps release his energy.


If you can't take your dog for walks during the day, consider hiring a dog walker or putting your dog into doggy daycare. Walks or being at a daycare will also stimulate him mentally with new sights, smells, and sounds., Redirection is a useful behavior to learn to prevent a variety of unwanted behaviors. When you notice your dog starting to mouth or bite, redirect his attention towards something more desirable like a toy, treat, or activity. For example, if your dog is getting mouth, play tug-of-war. Or, take his mind off of biting by playing fetch.


Do not try to redirect a dog that is aggressively biting. This will just cause redirected aggression which can be unpredictable and dangerous.If you have taught your dog the ""look"" or ""watch me"" command, use this to bring your dog's attention to you. This may diffuse the situation.
If you see something in the distance that you know your dog reacts to, try circling around it as opposed to approaching it head-on, which is more confrontational.

Keep a puppy with its mother and siblings for ten weeks.Let your dog’s original family shoulder some of the teaching load before your family takes over the job.,
Spay or neuter your dog if you don’t intend to breed.,
Socialize your dog from an early age.,
Teach impulse control.,
Teach your dog to be gentle with human skin.Dogs don’t innately know how sensitive human skin is to sharp canine teeth.,
Teach your dog that teeth don’t belong on human skin.As your dog learns to be more gentle with play biting, raise the standard further so that any mouthing of your skin is met with disapproval.",How to Stop Dogs from Biting1,"


For dogs, as with other animals including humans, an important function of play is instruction. Puppies use yelps of pain and refusal to keep playing to instruct each other about the differences between playful mouthing and painful biting. Mothers likewise play an important instructive role in the formative weeks of a puppy’s life, one that is hard to replicate or replace.;
, This simple procedure can not only prevent you from finding yourself with an undesired litter of puppies, it can also reduce the roaming and fighting tendencies that can cause some dogs to bite., Nervous and/or frightened dogs are more likely to act unpredictably and against normal behavior, including biting. Expose your young dog to other animals and people in a wide range of environments so that normal social situations are less likely to cause fear., It might not seem as direct as trying to teach your puppy “don’t bite,” but teaching common commands like “sit,” “stay,” “come,” and “leave it” are often quite effective in bite prevention. You may think you are just teaching your puppy to obey, but you are also teaching him patience.


Dogs with poor impulse control are more likely to bite when their wants are not immediately met.
Teaching your dog to “leave it” -- to avoid taking a treat in front of his nose until told “take it,” for instance -- can be particularly helpful in preventing biting., Let your dog know this in the same way as a litter of puppies. The earlier you start this process, the better.


Play with your puppy and allow her to mouth your hand. As soon as you feel a tooth point touch your skin, however, give out a demonstrative “yelp” and let your hand go limp, indicating that this action hurt you and you will no longer play if it continues. As soon as the dog stops mouthing or licks your limp hand, praise her and start the process again.
If making your hand uninteresting for play is proving insufficient, employ time-outs. Leave the room for 10-20 seconds after yelping to make it clear that biting is not a part of play time. Extend the time-out and reduce your threshold for what constitutes a bite as your dog learns.

, Utilize the same techniques as in the previous step, but also:


Substitute a chew toy or bone when your dog begins to mouth your skin. Have the toy at the ready and quickly present it to the dog. He will learn that these are acceptable targets for his mouthing instincts.
Distract the dog with a treat in one hand while petting him with the other. This is particularly useful for dogs who tend to mouth or bite when petted. They lack of focus on the petting hand will become normal over time, even if there is not a treat to distract them.
Enjoy non-contact play, such as fetch. Show your dog that there are many ways to play that do not involve her mouth on your skin.

Train your dog in stages.,
Stop your little dog from barking.,
Keep your little dog from whining.,
Stop your dog from nipping or biting.",How to Handle a Little Dog with a Big Attitude2," Reward good behavior in your dog and ignore misbehavior. You'll need to be consistent and over time, your dog's behavior should improve. For example, if you want your dog to let you brush it, begin by rewarding your dog if it lets you just touch it with the brush. If it then barks at you and wants you to stop, just ignore the behavior.


If your dog's behavior doesn't improve over time, put it in its crate for 5 minutes if it misbehaves. Ignore the behavior so it associates the misbehavior with a time out.Never hit or yell at your dog. Your dog won't understand why you're being aggressive and will only learn to fear you.

, One of the simplest things you can do is to take away whatever is causing your dog to bark. For example, if your dog barks at people out the window, cover the window or remove its access to the view. You can also teach your dog the quiet command and reward it for good behavior. If you know your dog is going to start barking, command it to do something else that will distract it.For example, if you see people start to walk by outside, command your dog to go to its place or lay down.

, You'll first need to figure out why your dog whines. It may be because your dog is anxious, wants attention, or is just saying hello to you. If your dog is just saying hello, keep your greetings calm and short so it stops whining. For an attention seeking little dog, you'll need to ignore the whining. Instead, reward the dog when it's being quiet.If your dog is anxious, you may need to work with the vet to determine the cause of your pet's anxiety. Your dog might need medication or behavior therapy.

, If your little dog nips or bites, it probably wasn't trained at a young age. Teach your dog when it's being too rough by playing with your dog. Let your dog play and nip at your hand. When your dog bites firmly, exaggerate a yelp and stop playing for 10 to 20 seconds. This will teach your little dog that it's being too rough.If your dog's behavior doesn't improve, you may need to contact an Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB).

Monitor your dog around other dogs.,
Watch for misbehavior.,
Notice signs of separation anxiety.",How to Handle a Little Dog with a Big Attitude3," If your little dog thinks that it's a pack leader, it may constantly bark at other dogs or even just noises. Your little dog might lunge at other dogs that it encounters. These behaviors can be dangerous if a big dog decides to put your little dog in its place.Keep your dog on a leash if it will encounter big dogs. For example, it's a good idea to keep it on a leash while you're still teaching basic commands. This way, you can move your dog away from other dogs if your small dog becomes aggressive.

, If your dog feels like the pack leader in your home, it may try to get your attention by jumping on your lap, invading your personal space or trying to set its own feeding times. Your little dog might become jealous when you pay attention to other people or pets and it could even jump, bark, or snap at them.Never give in to your little dog's misbehavior. You'll need to train your dog and never reward your dog when it tries to get your attention.

, Your little dog may develop big attitude problems when it feels insecure or frightened. These feelings may come from severe separation anxiety that your dog feels when you leave the house. If you see your dog whining, barking, becoming anxious, vomiting, or becoming hyperactive, your dog may have severe separation anxiety.Talk with the vet about how to handle your dog's separation anxiety. Crate training, downplaying your departure, and giving your dog plenty of exercise can all help.

Employ the puppy training methods outlined in Method 1, Steps 2-6.,
Use a taste deterrent.There are commercial sprays available that will make you skin or clothes smell and taste unpleasant to your dog.,
Punish judiciously.,
Seek professional assistance.,
Prepare just in case.",How to Stop Dogs from Biting2," As the old saying indicates, it will be more difficult to change the habits and behaviors of an older dog. Let patience and persistence be your allies.

, If your dog tends to bite your forearm, for instance, spray your shirt sleeve in that area while playing.


You can also search for homemade versions of this deterrent.

, Beating your dog is never the best way to handle any situation, and in the case of biting only tends to instill fear, aggression, and an invitation for rougher play, all of which promote more biting. Use the following negative association methods in combination with the “yelp and stop” methods.


Spray your dog in the mouth with a peppermint breath spray (like Binaca) when she bites. She will like neither the taste nor the sensation of the spray.Utilize a choke/pinch collar, if you are comfortable with doing so.Keep a leash on the dog while you play, and give a firm but not excessive tug when a biting or mouthing incident occurs. There are differences of opinion on whether choke collars are acceptable for use on dogs, so use your best judgement.

, All dogs are different, and training a puppy or older dog can be a frustrating and seemingly fruitless task. There is no shame in seeking out help from trained and experienced professionals.


The ASPCA recommends that you seek out a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB), a Veterinary Behaviorist (Dip ACVB), or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) with demonstrated experience in dealing with dogs who bite.Train your dog in your home as opposed to sending him away to a training school if possible. Training is most effective when done in the familiar environment in which the trained behavior will be most commonly expected., Even the best-trained dog who has never shown a proclivity for biting can unexpectedly bite you, a family member, or a guest. Pain, sometimes pain of which you may not be aware, can be one cause of unexpected biting behavior.


If there are behaviors, such as rough play or head-patting that can trigger a biting response from your dog, inform your family and guests to avoid doing so.
Teach those around you to be aware of signs of an impending bite, by your dog or any others. These include ears pinned back, fur standing up, body stiffening, widened eyes with a direct gaze, and showing of teeth that can look like a yawn.Teach those around you how, in the worst case scenario, to respond to a threatening dog: remain calm, be assertive but avoid eye contact, and if attacked, ball up and protect your face, throat, chest, and fingers (by making fists)."

Receive the judge's decision.",How to Defend Yourself in a Dog Bite Lawsuit," The complaint and summons include details about the plaintiff's allegations as well as important dates and deadlines you need to know.


The summons gives you the name and contact information of the person who sued you, and also tells you how long you have to respond. Typically you must file an answer within 30 days or less of the date you receive the complaint, or the plaintiff may win by default.If the complaint includes any references to particular state laws, write them down so you can look them up later.
When you read over the complaint, look at the name and location of the court where you've been sued and make sure that court has jurisdiction over the case. If the court is far away from you, it may not have jurisdiction.Check the date when the plaintiff alleges the dog bite occurred. States only give injured people a certain period of time to sue for their injuries; however, that length of time varies greatly among states.
Look up the statute of limitations for personal injury in your state to find out how long the plaintiff had to file his or her lawsuit. You can find this out relatively quickly with an online search.;
, Dog bite laws vary greatly among states, so check your state's law to understand what defenses are recognized as well as the possible outcomes if the judge finds you responsible.


Some states have strict liability dog bite laws, which mean as the dog's owner you are responsible for any injuries caused if the dog bites someone, regardless of whether you were following all laws or took appropriate precautions.The legal website All Law has a summary of dog owner liability laws in each state available at http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/one-bite-strict-liability-dog-bite.html.
You can do some research online, but you may want to visit your nearest public library – usually located in your county courthouse. Law librarians there are accustomed to helping people who are representing themselves in lawsuits, and will be able to point you to the law and resources you need.
In addition to dog bite laws, there may be other state laws or local ordinances that pertain to your case, such as leash laws or trespass laws.You'll have to have a good idea of how and where the incident happened before you can know for sure what laws will apply to your case. For this reason, legal research may be an ongoing effort as the case progresses and you find out more about the plaintiff's claims.

, Although it is possible to defend yourself in a dog bite lawsuit, particularly if you are sued in small claims court, an experienced civil defense attorney can save you time and stress preparing your case.


If you have homeowner's, renter's, or other personal liability insurance, you should call your insurance company and turn the matter over to them. The insurance company has attorneys who will coordinate your defense.
If you can't afford to hire an attorney to represent you through the entire case, you can always use one as a consultant. He or she will explain court procedures, advise you on your case, and tell you what you need to do, but you will be doing all the work and representing yourself at trial.

, Most courts have answer forms available online or at the clerk's office.


If you can't find a template or fill-in-the-blank form, ask the clerk for an answer filed in another personal injury case in the same court. You can use it as a guide to format your answer.
Generally, you should type your answer using a word-processing application set for 8.5 x 11 paper with one-inch margins all around. These settings are the default on most applications.The top third of your first page will contain the case's caption, which is the same for all documents filed in the case. You can copy the caption directly from the complaint., In your answer, you must either admit or deny each allegation set forth by the plaintiff in his or her complaint.


Throughout your answer, refer to yourself as ""Defendant"" and the person who sued you as ""Plaintiff,"" rather than using names or writing in first person.
The body of your answer should follow the same format as the complaint, with numbered paragraphs – only instead of copying the allegation, you'll type your response.
You only have to type one word responses (""admit"" or ""deny""). There's a third option, in which you can state you don't have sufficient information to either admit or deny the allegation. If you use that answer, the court treats it the same as if you'd denied the allegation.Keep in mind that since the plaintiff has the burden of proof, denying an allegation doesn't necessarily mean you're saying it isn't true. Rather, you're forcing the plaintiff to meet his or her burden and prove it., Once you've finished responding to the allegations, you're ready to print and sign it.


Before you print your answer, look it over carefully to make sure you don't have any typos or other errors. You may want to view it through the ""print preview"" function so you can make sure your formatting is correct and your pages line up.
After you've signed your answer, you'll need to make at least two copies – one for your own records and one for the plaintiff – because the clerk will keep the originals for the court's files., Once you've completed your answer, take it to the clerk's office to file it with the court before the deadline listed on your summons.


Give the clerk both your originals and your copies. He or she will stamp them ""filed"" and then give the copies back to you.
You're responsible for having a copy of your answer served, or delivered to the plaintiff. You may do this by paying a private process serving company or the sheriff's department to hand it to the plaintiff in person, or by using certified mail with returned receipt requested.
Most people use certified mail to serve an answer since it's cheaper and easier than personal service. The clerk will have forms for you to use to complete and certify service., Depending on the allegations in the complaint, many aspects of your dog's life including its veterinary records and any obedience training may be relevant to your defense.


Whether your dog has ever bitten someone before may be important information, particularly in states such as New York and Texas that have laws protecting dog owners from liability the first time a dog bites someone.If you have a large dog, or one that shows signs of aggression, you may want to focus on what you've done to curb the dog's aggression or the measures you take to restrict or control the dog.This type of history can be particularly important to your case if your dog is a breed typically associated with aggression, such as a pit bull or a Rottweiler.

, Through the discovery process you and the plaintiff will have the opportunity to exchange information and evidence you each plan to use at trial.


You may have written discovery or depositions. If the plaintiff has filed in small claims court, you may not have a discovery process. If you do, it typically will be abbreviated and consist only of written discovery.
With written discovery, you and the plaintiff send each other questions to be answered under oath, or ask for copies certain documents or other evidence. Depositions, in contrast, are live interviews with a witness or the other party. A court reporter attends and makes a transcript of the deposition that will be available for your reference later.Learning more about the incident from the plaintiff can help you develop your defenses. For example, suppose your dog bites a postal service worker who is delivering a package to your home. In some states, you may be able to argue the postal worker assumed the risk because he or she passed several ""Beware of Dog"" signs on your property. This would reduce your liability., If other people were present when the incident occurred, you should evaluate what they saw and any other information they have about what happened.


Keep in mind that eye-witnesses may not necessarily be on your side – they may be testifying on the victim's behalf. However, you may want to bring other witnesses who didn't necessarily see the incident, but who spend time with your dog on a regular basis.
You typically can defend yourself by proving that the injured person provoked the dog. Any witnesses who observed the person teasing the dog can provide strong testimony in your favor.Keep in mind that provocation can be accidental or unintentional, such as stepping on the dog's tail., In some cases, a professional report on your dog's behavior and benefit may be useful in your defense.


You might consider asking people such as your dog's veterinarian, trainer, or others who work with your dog on a regular basis to testify on your dog's behalf and explain to the court that the dog normally is very well-behaved and not a threat to people., Through mediation, a neutral third party works with you and the plaintiff to come to a compromise and settle the claim.


Mediation is less formal than a trial, and more focused on finding a mutually agreeable resolution to the dispute than on finding a winner and a loser.Some courts require mediation before a civil case can go to trial. If mediation is required for you, the clerk will have information on the mediators you can use and when and where to attend.
There typically isn't a fee for mediation if it was required by the court, but there may be a fee otherwise, which varies greatly among jurisdictions and different mediators. Even so, mediation tends to be cheaper and less stressful than going to trial.During mediation, show concern toward the injured person and do your best to be empathetic, but avoid accepting blame. Emphasize your sympathy towards the person and your desire to move on from the incident without assessing blame.

, Before trial, create a comprehensive outline of your defense along with all evidence you intend to present or witnesses you plan to call.


Make sure you have at least two copies of any documents you want to present as evidence, so you have enough to go around for yourself, the plaintiff, and the judge.If you have witnesses, meet with them before trial and go over the questions you plan to ask them so they have a sense of what they'll be asked and you know what they're going to say. You should never ask a witness a question if you don't know what his or her answer will be.If you're representing yourself, you may want to go to court before your trial is scheduled – just to observe other cases and become more familiar with how the judge runs his or her courtroom.In addition to your evidence, your outline, and other notes, bring along some blank paper and a pen or pencil so you can take notes during the trial.

, You should plan to arrive at the courthouse at least 30 minutes before the time on your summons or notice of hearing, so you have time to go through security and find the correct courtroom.Typically a judge will hear several cases in one day, so take a seat in the gallery until the name of your case is called. When the judge calls your case, you and the plaintiff can stand and move to the tables at the front of the courtroom., Typically the court will allow the plaintiff to tell his or her side of the story first.Avoid interrupting the plaintiff while he or she is talking, or making facial expressions or noises that cause disruption. While it's understandable that the plaintiff may say things – about you or about your dog – that make you angry, it's important to respect the order of the courtroom and not speak out of turn.
Make a note of anything the plaintiff says with which you disagree so you can make a point of it when it is your turn. You may want to rearrange your outline based on the points the plaintiff emphasizes in his or her presentation.
You will have the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses the plaintiff brings to testify on his or her behalf. Exercise caution when asking the plaintiff's witnesses questions, and remember to avoid asking a question if you have no idea what the witness's answer will be.

, After the plaintiff has finished, it will be your turn to introduce evidence or witnesses that show you aren't legally responsible for the plaintiff's injuries.The best way to defend yourself is to present your strongest points first, then move on. You don't have to tell the entire story in chronological order if it doesn't benefit your defense to do so.
For example, if the plaintiff was trespassing on your property when she was bitten by your dog, this is a defense regardless of your state's dog bite statute because you have no liability for any injuries she suffered if she was on your property illegally.Make your points quickly, but don't gloss over anything important. Stick to the facts, rather than attempting to appeal to the judge's emotions.Keep in mind that in this kind of case, any sympathy typically will extend to the injured person rather than the owner of the dog that caused the injuries.

, The judge may enter an order in your case immediately after all evidence is presented, or take the case under advisement and issue an order later.


If you don't receive a ruling the day of the trial, ask the clerk how long it will be before the decision will be issued, and whether you will be notified when an order is entered.Possible outcomes of a dog bite lawsuit vary widely, and largely depend on the circumstances of the bite, the type of dog you have, the dog's history, and other factors.If the judge rules for the plaintiff, you should consult an attorney as soon as possible if you want to challenge the ruling. The court provides a limited period of time for you to file an appeal or other post-judgment motions, and an attorney can review the case and advise you of your options."

Learn about clicker training.,
Wait for the dog to stand up.,
Convince the dog to stand with a treat.,
Physically adjust the dog's position.,
Repeat often.,
Add a verbal command.",How to Make a Dog Stand Up1," Clicker training is an effective training method backed up by animal science. You'll need to use one short, easily distinguishable signal that you, such as a ""clicker,"" a whistle, or a loud finger snap. Make this sound the exact instant the dog performs the behavior you want to reward. Always follow the sound immediately with a reward, ideally praise and a small treat.


Only use this sound for training. The dog may be confused and take longer to train if you use it during play or just to fool around.;
, One easy way to start the training is to watch the dog while she's sitting or lying down. As soon as she starts to stand on his own, click the clicker (or make the noise), praise her, and give her a treat.


If the dog doesn't stand enough on his own, the next two steps provide some alternate ideas.

, If the dog doesn't figure out that you want him to stand, hold the treat a little in front of and above his nose. Gesture with the treat in forward beckoning motion. The moment the dog stands, click the clicker and give him the treat.


The hand gesture can reinforce the command once you eventually stop using treats.
If the dog sits up but doesn't stand, try keeping the treat lower in front of him. You can also back up so he has to walk forward to get the treat, but this is not ideal as the dog may learn to follow you anytime you move away, or learn to disobey the ""stay"" command.

, Finally, if the dog does not cooperate with any other method, you can coax the dog upward to a standing position by touching the hind legs, or by gently tugging on the dog's torso. As always, follow this up with the clicker signal and rewards. Dogs tend to take more time to learn what you want when you're physically assisting them, so this is only recommended if the other methods are not working.

, Assuming you have taught your dog to sit or lie down, command him to return to this position. Repeat the clicker and reward as soon as he stands up again. Do this for about two to five minutes, two or three times a day.


Always end a training session with the dog in a good mood. If it lasts too long, the dog may get agitated and start resisting the training.
Some dogs learn quickly, while others can take weeks. Be patient and never show frustration or aggression, as these set back the training.

, Once the dog seems to understand the connection between standing and rewards, start associating the verbal command. Say ""STAND"" each time the dog stands up, in addition to the click and rewards.


Eventually, you can skip the treat and just use the verbal command, and perhaps a hand signal. Make sure to praise the dog heavily when he responds.

Among those reasons is the fact that they will be far less likely to bite. Spaying and neutering will change hormonal levels in your dog, resulting in more docile behavior. Your dog's instinct to wander or fight with other dogs will be reduced.
Neutering your dog lowers testosterone levels, making male dogs less aggressive.;

, All dogs, but especially puppies, engage in normal mouthing behavior. Learning the difference will help you to understand your dogs attitude. However, no form of biting or mouthing is acceptable and both must be stopped.


Playful mouthing shouldn't hurt, and your dog should have relaxed body language.Aggressive biting will be accompanied by tense and stiff body language.Aggressive bites tend to be quicker, harder, and more painful., Dogs are pack animals, and learn from playing with each other when they are young. It's normal for your puppy to play bite you, however, you will want to start training them to never bite.If you are bit or mouthed, let out a high-pitched yelp, as a dog would.
Stop playing for a few seconds.
Praise your dog and resume play.
If the dog or puppy doesn't stop after you yelp, leave and try again later., If your puppy or older dog doesn't respond to simple yipping and short refusal to play, try adopting a time-out procedure. Ignoring your dog is a powerful way to communicate that its behavior is unacceptable.When bitten, yelp loudly.
Ignore the dog for ten to twenty seconds.You may also place your dog in a space by itself for ten to twenty seconds.

, It's important to let your dog know what he is doing correctly. Always be sure to praise your pet for stopping to nip and bite, either with pets or small treats.


Reward only behavior that you want to encourage.
Keep treats handy so that you can reward easily when training your dog.
Don't overfeed your dog, use only small treats.

, Your dog will start to nip more lightly. Keep yipping and stopping play, whenever you dog nips.As your dog reduces pressure, respond by yipping to the lighter nips.
Keep working in this way until your dog stops nipping with any pressure.

, It's only natural to want to wrestle with your dog or play tug of war. However, we send our dogs mixed messages when do this, and make it harder for them to learn to curb their biting instincts.Instead of letting your puppy gnaw on your fingers or hands, give him a chew toy or bone.Avoid wrestling games, which can get your dog overly excited or confused.
Think carefully about playing tug-of-war. This can lead to dominance issues.
Be sure to talk to your veterinarian or trainer about how to teach your dog to play tug-of-war., Playful biting can be remedied by simple training that you can do at home. If your dog is showing signs of aggression, however, this is a more serious problem.


Aggressive biting will hurt, much more so than play biting.
Your dog will have tense or stiff body language.

, If your dog shows signs of aggression, you ought to seek professional help immediately. Your vet can help you find the source of your dog's aggressive biting. Your vet can help you care for any ailments that may be causing biting.
Your vet can also teach you how to properly reward or punish behaviors.
Try speaking with a qualified pet behaviorist to better understand how to train your dog.

, However, this possibility cannot be ruled out. It's very important that you keep your dog's vaccinations and paperwork up-to-date in case someone is bitten.


Keeping vaccinations current can help protect the victim from disease.
You will have less liability in the event of a bite if your dog's vaccinations are up to date.
Keep your dog safe, as many states destroy un-vaccinated dogs that bite.
Practice responsible pet ownership. Never unleash your dog in a public area. Use a muzzle when in public if your dog is prone to biting.

, Puppies and dogs use their mouths to play and investigate the world. In general, we can distinguish between mouthing, nipping, playful biting and more serious aggressive biting.


Puppies will most often mouth or playfully nip. Although common behavior, it is unacceptable.
Older dogs may also mouth and nip, if they were not trained otherwise.
No matter the dog's age, teach them that it is never appropriate to put their teeth on a person.
Aggressive biting, in either young or old dogs, needs to be addressed immediately.

, Dogs are protective of their possessions. They have a broad understanding of what is their property. If your dog feels that his possessions are being threatened, he may very well respond by biting.


Dogs can view their toys, food, territory or even people as their property.
Watch your dog around these things to see what might be triggering its behavior.

, Another common cause of biting behavior in dogs is fear. If your dog is acting fearful, try to think of anything that may be causing it, such as new people or new locations. Watch for the following signs in your dog's behavior that indicate fear:Trembling.
Tucked tail.
Submissive posture.
Hiding.
Running away.

, If your dog is nipping or biting, and it doesn't seem like play, they may be in pain. Even the calmest, friendliest dogs may be prompted to bite if they are in pain. If you suspect your dog to be in pain, take them to the vet immediately. Look for the following signs of pain in your dog:


Whimpering.
Changes in eating or drinking.
Yelping.
Groaning.
Restlessness.
Difficult moving.
Limping.

, If your female dog is preparing to have a litter or has just whelped, then be on the alert for possible biting. The maternal instinct is strong in even the most loyal and calm dog, and so you'll want to be careful to not prompt any biting behavior on him part.


Offer your dog a safe and secluded space.
Approach the dog and him puppies carefully.
Teach others to approach the mother and new puppies with caution.

, The predatory instinct in most dogs is very strong. If interrupted in their “hunt”, they may bite. If you think that your dog is biting as a result of this predatory instinct, you'll want to address it for everyone’s safety. Dogs may consider the following to be prey:


Wildlife, such as rabbits or squirrels.
Cars
Joggers
Cyclists

, If you have ruled out the possibility that your puppy or older dog is mouthing or nipping playfully, you may be faced with dealing with more aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior is dangerous to work with. Learn the following signs of aggression in your dog.


Ears pinned back.
Fur along back is standing up.
You can see the whites of its ears.
The dog is showing its teeth.

, There are a few standard techniques that can help keep you from being bitten by a dog displaying signs of aggression. Follow these basic steps to help keep you safe from a dog bite:


Avoid direct eye contact.
Slowly step back from the dog.
Give the dog an escape route.

Redirect your dog’s attention.,
Do not punish your dog when it growls.,
Talk with your vet.,

Get your dog comfortable with wearing the muzzle.,
Use the muzzle during grooming.,

Use natural calming aids.",How to Groom a Dog That Bites," Long grooming sessions can increase a dog’s stress, fear, or pain, causing it to bite. Make your dog’s grooming sessions short—maybe just 5 to 10 minutes.Don’t worry if you don’t finish all the grooming. You can always come back to it later.


If you’d rather do the grooming all at once, give your dog breaks during the grooming session.When you let your dog take a break, let it come back to you when it’s ready.;
, When your dog is behaving well during the grooming session, give it a tasty treat.The treat will help your dog associate grooming with something positive. When your dog recognizes that grooming is a good thing, it won’t feel the need to bite.


Give your dog a treat that you’ll use only for grooming.

, If your dog is focused on everything it doesn’t like about being groomed (nails trimmed, ears cleaned), it may respond by biting. Turning on some soothing music or letting your dog look out the window will allow your dog to focus on something positive and relaxing.You could also talk to your dog throughout the grooming session. Use a soothing voice to put your dog more at ease.

, A growl is a dog’s warning signal that it’s about to bite or attack. If you punish your dog when it growls, you’re taking away its warning signal.Without that warning signal, your dog will bite suddenly, putting you in danger.


Rather than punish your dog, stop the grooming session completely or let your dog take a break.
Punishing a dog does not improve its behavior.

, A muzzle will protect you if your dog tries to bite while being groomed.It won’t, however, calm your dog down or help your dog enjoy being groomed. In fact, your dog may become even more difficult to groom if you use the muzzle incorrectly.Before purchasing a muzzle, talk with your vet.


Because many types of muzzles are available, you’ll need your vet’s expertise to decide which muzzle to choose and learn how to use it safely.
Use the muzzle as a last resort. Try other methods of keeping your dog calm before using the muzzle.

, Mesh or fabric muzzles are commonly used for grooming. However, because they don't allow a dog to eat, pant, or drink, they should be used for short periods of time only. A plastic basket muzzle can also be used. Your dog would be able to eat, pant, and drink comfortably with a plastic basket muzzle on.Whichever muzzle type you choose, ensure that it fits your dog comfortably, but snugly. You don’t want it coming off if your dog tries to bite.
The strap around the neck should fit snugly. If you choose a basket muzzle, make sure the basket area allows enough room for your dog to eat, pant, and drink.The muzzle’s strap around the neck should fit like your dog’s collar.

, Your dog isn’t going to be thrilled about wearing a muzzle. However, if it becomes comfortable with it, and gets rewarded while wearing it, you’ll feel much more protected during the grooming process. Here are some tips to get your dog comfortable with the muzzle:In the beginning, reward your dog when it looks at the muzzle.
Make the muzzle enticing by putting a tasty treat like peanut butter in the nose part of the muzzle.
When you put the muzzle on, leave it on for just a few seconds at first. Then, work up to longer periods of time.
Always reward your dog when it has the muzzle on so it associates the muzzle with something positive.

, Even though your dog will be comfortable with wearing the muzzle, it won’t want to wear it indefinitely. If you’re using a mesh muzzle, put it on only when you think your dog will bite, such as during a nail trim.For a plastic basket muzzle, put it on right before you begin grooming and take it off as soon as you finish.


If your dog is wearing a basket muzzle, give your dog treats while you groom it. If it’s wearing a mesh or fabric muzzle, reward your dog as soon as you remove the muzzle.

, Some dogs bite while being groomed because they don’t like certain areas, like their feet, being touched.That bite says ‘Don’t touch me there!’. To get your dog more comfortable with being touched in sensitive areas:Always be gentle and slow when you touch your dog. It will need to know it can trust you and your touch.
Watch your body language when you touch sensitive areas. If your dog tenses or growls, move your hand back towards a non-sensitive spot, like its back.
Reward your dog when it doesn’t react negatively to being touched in sensitive areas.

, Grooming tools (scissors, loud hair dryers, toothbrushes) can be bewildering and scary to a dog.If your dog isn’t used to the grooming tools, it may bite in self-defense. Before the next grooming session, work with your dog to slowly get it more comfortable with grooming tools. Here are some tips on doing that:Introduce each grooming tool in a non-threatening way, such as by casually placing it on the table.
Reward your dog each time it looks at or sniffs the tool.
Use the tool on your dog for a few seconds. For example, if it’s a brush, do one gentle sweep down your dog’s back and put the brush away.
Use the tool for longer periods of time, rewarding your dog each time it doesn’t get scared.

, Your dog is usually standing up when it’s being groomed. If your dog has arthritis or other joint problems, standing up could be very painful. Your dog may bite because it’s in pain.Your dog’s pain will need to be under control before the next grooming session.


Take your dog to your vet. They can diagnose the condition and prescribe a pain medication to relieve the pain.

, A calm, relaxed dog will be much less likely to bite while being groomed. Fortunately, several calming aids are available for dogs. For example, you can put a Thundershirt® on your dog to calm it down. Collars with calming pheromones (chemical signals) are also available.Rescue Remedy, which is a commercial product containing flower extracts, and lavender are also good calming aids for dogs.Calming aids are available at pet stores, online, and in natural food stores.
Talk with your vet before using a calming aid on your dog.
Depending on how much your dog detests grooming, it may take a few tries (or more) before the calming aid starts working.

Put your puppy in ‘time out.’ When a puppy is really tired, it may start running around and biting everything it sees.,

Use reward-based training.",How to Handle a Biting Dog," When puppies bite, it’s usually to get attention for playtime. A puppy will do this with its littermates and won’t see the problem with biting you, too. However, you will need to discourage this biting. Rather than saying ‘Ouch!’ when your puppy bites, simply ignore the bite.If you say ‘ouch!’ or act like you’re hurt, your puppy may interpret that as attention.Your attention is your puppy’s reward. If your puppy doesn’t get attention from the bite, it will not see the benefit in continuing that behavior.;
, Biting and nipping helps a puppy learn how to control its jaws. You don’t want your puppy’s jaws on you, though! After acting like your puppy’s bite never happened, calmly get up and get your puppy a chew toy. This will redirect your puppy’s behavior towards something good.Give your puppy some verbal praise and extra petting when it begins chewing on its toy. This will encourage your puppy to chew on the toy instead of your hand.
Small rawhide bones are great chew toys for puppies. Keep an eye on your puppy so it doesn’t choke on the bone.In general, your puppy should have a variety of toys to play with. The more toys your puppy has, the less likely it will want to nip or bite you., If your puppy is doing this, put it in its crate (if you have crate trained it) with a long-lasting chew toy, like a Kong toy. After a few minutes, don’t be surprised if your puppy has fallen asleep.Another ‘time out’ strategy is for you to get up and leave the room for 30 to 60 seconds. Then, come back and continue what you were doing with your puppy.When you leave the room, do not come back until your puppy is calm.This may take longer than 60 seconds.
Leaving the room will take away your attention, meaning your puppy isn’t getting rewarded. When you come back, play with your puppy and reward good, non-biting behavior.

, If you let your puppy nip and bite your hands during playtime, it won’t learn that it shouldn’t bite. Choose games that keep your hands away from your puppy’s mouth. For example, play fetch with your puppy.If your puppy still tries to bite you, redirect its attention toward a chew toy and away from your hand.

, After your puppy successfully follows the command, immediately reward it with verbal praise and its favorite chew toy.

, Your puppy will stop biting your hand if it doesn’t taste good. Put a bitter substance like Bitter Apple on a cotton glove and wear the glove when you’re around your puppy. Be aware, though, that your puppy may learn it’s the glove that tastes bad, not your hand.You can find Bitter Apple at your local pet store.

, Puppy biting can usually be easily corrected. Correcting an adult dog’s biting, however, can be much harder. If you have an adult dog that’s biting, take it to your vet to rule out medical causes of biting.Painful conditions like arthritis can make a dog irritable and aggressive, causing biting.


Adult dogs can also bite because they were not properly socialized as puppies. Without proper socialization, adult dogs are more fearful and more likely to bite because of that fear.This fear biting is a form of aggression.
If your vet determines that the biting is not due to a medical condition, then they will talk with you about changing your dog’s behavior to stop the biting.

, When you take your dog to your vet, you will need to have a detailed discussion about your dog’s biting problem.The more information your vet has about the problem, the better they will be able to devise a treatment plan. Give the following details to your vet:


History of any behavioral problems (destructive behavior, growling, not following commands)
Situations when your dog is most likely to bite (seeing other dogs, guarding its toys or food bowl, meeting new people, being petted)
Who your dog has bitten

, If your vet thinks your dog’s biting problem is complex, they may refer you to an professional behaviorist.The behaviorist will take a closer look at your dog’s behavior to determine why it’s biting and come up with a plan to stop the biting.


Professional behaviorists include board-certified veterinary behaviorists, certified professional dog trainers, and applied animal behaviorists.Your vet can recommend which type of professional to go to.

, Handling an adult biting dog takes a lot of patience and consistency. The treatment plan prescribed by your vet or the behaviorist will involve a lot of work and will require you to follow all instructions carefully.Make sure you understand what you are supposed to do and what your dog is supposed to do.


Ask questions if any part of the treatment plan isn’t clear to you.

, If you know when your dog is most likely to bite, then avoiding those situations will help you handle your dog’s biting.For example, if your dog has bitten a professional groomer, then you’ll want to avoid that groomer and possibly do the grooming yourself.


If your dog has bitten a delivery person, keep your dog away from the door when you are expecting a delivery.

, If your adult dog is fear biting, you will need decrease that fear. Decreasing fear involves processes called desensitization and counterconditioning. Desensitizing makes the fearful situation seem normal, while counterconditioning pairs the fearful situation with something positive (treats, toys).Desensitization and counterconditioning take time and will vary according to what the fearful situation is. Your vet or professional behaviorist will develop an individualized plan to decrease your dog’s fear.
With time, your dog will feel more confident and less likely to engage in fear biting.

, Handling an adult biting dog involves making positive behavioral changes. Training your dog to change its behavior will go more smoothly when you reward it with treats, verbal praise, and extra petting. When you reward positive behavior, you will reinforce that behavior and encourage your dog to behave well and not bite.The rewards must be consistent. When your dog knows it will get a reward from you each time it behaves well, it will make the positive behavior changes more consistently and be less likely to bite.

Work with your companion regularly.,
Keep lessons and work session short enough that your pet (not to mention you yourself) doesn't get overwhelmed, frustrated, tired, or distracted.,
Don't move on to the next set of exercises until you and your pet have mastered the present ones.,
Have fun, but don't treat it as play time.,
Praise is your most powerful teaching technique; so use it frequently and enthusiastically!,
Correction is used stop the wrong action and show the right one.,
Use short phrases or words for commands that tell your dog what you want her to do.",How to Give Your Dog Basic Training," Every day at first and then several times a week to keep those lessons fresh and make the exercises second nature for both of you.;
, Usually 15-20 minutes is plenty.

, And always review what has been learned before.

, Your pet needs to know the difference. Right after each session, make time for some type of play or attention to reward you and your pet and signify the end of the ""work time"".

, Don't hold back! Praise your dog by petting his back, rubbing his ears and head, and using a cheerful voice different from the command tone. Don't start romping with him at this point, however, or your lesson is over.


Praise for each thing your dog does properly (even if she didn't know she was doing it or you didn't tell her to) as soon as she does it. This reinforces a pleasant result from doing the act.






Use praise after correction only after the desired result is obtained. This will show your dog more clearly the difference in your response between her wrong behavior and the right one.







, It should be done firmly, but not angrily. Praise enthusiastically when he does it right, and repeat the exercise two or three more times right away to reinforce the right action.

, They need to be the same every time. Don't use similar terms to mean different things; for instance, if you use the term ""down"" to mean 'lie down', then use an entirely different word such as ""off"" to mean 'get down')


Give commands in a firm tone of voice. At first, the command and showing her the right action should be done at the same time. Later, give the command first, and show her only if she hesitates or gets it wrong. Always follow with praise.






Always say your dogs name before the command to alert him and make sure he is paying attention. And you should practice each of these both inside and outside, so he knows the rules apply the same way in both places.

Let your dog mouth your hand.,
Put the dog in time out.,
Hold the puppy’s jaw.,
Spray taste detergent on your hands and clothes.,
Hire a certified professional dog trainer.,
Avoid hitting the dog when they play-bite.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Play Biting1," To help teach your dog bite inhibition, you will have to show them that bites are painful. Let the dog play with your hand, and when they bite too hard, make a sharp yelping noise. You may also say something like “That was bad” or “No” in a stern voice. When the dog stops biting you, praise the dog.Only do this activity in brief spurts in a short period of time. You should not let the dog nip more than three times in fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes are up, end the activity.;
, Once you have started teaching the dog that biting can hurt, you should start “doggy time out.” If the dog nips you or your clothing, say “ouch” sharply. Stand up abruptly and walk away out of the room. Do not play with your dog again until they have calmed down. If you do this every time they nip you, they will learn that it is unacceptable to bite or mouth you., If the dog is young, you can also try to loosely hold their jaw after they nip you. If the dog takes your hand into their mouth, hold onto the lower jaw with your thumb and forefinger, and let the hand hang until the dog gets bored and releases you. This should not hurt the dog; rather, it should provide a minor inconvenience.Once you have let go of the puppy’s jaw, you can offer your hand to them again. If the dog licks or ignores your hand, give them a treat. If the dog tries mouthing you, try this exercise again.

, A taste deterrent is an edible spray that tastes bad to dogs, and it can discourage the dog from nipping you or your clothing. You can apply this spray to your clothing and skin for up to two weeks. If you do not want to put it on your bare hands, spray a pair of cotton gloves and wear those while you play with your dog.You can buy taste deterrents that are safe to use on dogs from your vet or local pet store. Some common taste deterrents include:


Grannick’s Bitter Apple Spray or Gel
Veterinarian’s Best Bitter Cherry Spray
Bitter YUCK! No Chew Spray
Nature’s Miracle No-Chew Bitter Dog Spray
Apple cider vinegar

, If you are having difficulty training your dog yourself, you may have to call a certified professional dog trainer (CPDT) or behaviorist. They may be able to identify what is and is not working with your training regimen, and they can train your dog according to their unique needs. You can find a CPDT through the The Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or the The Association of Professional Dog Trainers.CPDTs often offer both group classes and individual sessions.

, Hitting your dog when they nip you may only cause the behavior to worsen. The dog may react defensively or aggressively towards you. They also become shy around humans or start to cower when somebody moves their hand.The best way to train a dog is by rewarding their good behavior. Ignoring the dog by walking away or giving them dog a verbal cue like “no” can also help instill good behavior in the dog.

End on a good note.",How to Teach a Dog to Lie Down," Figure out what kinds of treats your dog likes and have them with you when training. Hold the treat in front of the dog so that he can smell it, but not eat it yet. Bring the treat back a bit so he knows he has to do something in order to get it from you.


If you have already used a clicker with training, you can use the clicker instead of a treat for positive reinforcement, particularly if your dog has weight issues or is not hungry because he just ate. ;
, It’s easier to train a dog to lie down after he already knows the “sit” command. When he’s in the sitting position, bring the treat close to his nose again. If he gets excited and springs back up because of the treat, step back again and get him back into the sit position before continuing. Once he’s steady in the sit position, kneel or squat down to get closer to his level., This is very important to do absolutely every time, because eventually you will train the dog to lie down without any treats and only with this command.

, While you’re squatting, move the treat down to the floor right in between his front legs. He should follow the treat to the floor with his nose. Once his nose is to the floor, bring the treat back out along the floor toward you.


If the dog pops up while luring him down, quickly snatch the treat away. Then immediately ask him to sit again, and start the luring process over again.

, This should deter him from getting back up and walking toward the treat. As you inch the treat along the floor, he should glide down to the floor too. The entire motion of luring is an “L” shape with your hand. , Sit down in front of him with him on either your left or right side. Put your legs out along the floor, then raise them up so they look like a tent. Slowly move the treat down to the floor and then under your legs as he’s sniffing it. Move it out under your legs so he has to crouch down under them to get to it.Remember, don’t allow him to have the treat until he lies down. He will get confused about what it is you’re asking him to do.

, If your dog is particularly resistant to the luring technique, you can reward “catching” him lying down on his own. Simply stand with your dog in a room and wait for him to lie down.


The instant his body hits the floor, say “down,” use your clicker and throw a treat a few feet in front of him. He’ll have to stand up to go get the treat, so then you just wait for him to lie down again.
Repeat the sequence until he seems to start connecting “down” with what you want him to do., Say “Yes!” or “Good dog!” and then give the treat (or click the clicker). The moment his elbows, rear end, and belly touch the floor, that’s when you give the praise and the treat – not before!

, You can say, “Ok!” or “Up!” and then clap your hands or take some steps backward to get him to stand up.

, After he stands back up, repeat these steps immediately 5-15 times after he gets it the first time, depending on what his attention span allows. This much repetition in the beginning will help him to remember what to do.

, Try to keep each training session short and simple, about 10 minutes each time. Once he gets it easily each time, you’ll be ready to move onto gradually removing the treats. Some dogs will be ready to move on after only a day or two of those steps; others will need more practice., This teaches your dog to know what he’s expected to do without having to actually see the treat. Practice saying “down” and luring him down to the floor, using the same “L” motion, but without a treat in your hand.


Keep the treats nearby and give him one as soon as he lies down and stays, and be sure to give praise. If he refuses to lie down without seeing a treat, you can try this “fake out” trick: lure him into the lying down position with a treat just like in the first section quickly 4 times in a row.
The last time, quickly do it without the treat. He will probably lie down, thinking you have a treat. As soon as he does, say your praise (“Yes!” or “Good dog!”) and open your hand to show him there’s no treat. #*Then give him 3 surprise treats.
Start again practicing without the treats and only using the hand signal.Practice the empty hand method for 10 minutes a couple of times each day for a couple of days.

, After a couple of days of practicing using an empty hand, you’re ready to also start shrinking your hand signal. Instead of guiding your dog all the way to the floor with your hand, say “down” and guide him almost to the floor.


Stop your hand an inch or two above the floor and move it out. As soon as he lies down, deliver the praise and the treat., Every couple of days, make your hand signal smaller and smaller. You will eventually have to bend over less, and finally all you’ll need to do is say “down” and point to the floor while standing up. Continue delivering treats and praise each time he lies down for you on command., Practice your dog’s new skill in different locations so he’ll be able to do it anywhere you ask him to. Start by using different rooms in your house, then go outside around your house when no one else is around. Increase the level of distractions gradually.


Try practicing while you’re out on a walk where there’s little distraction, then work up to environments where there is a lot he’s distracted by., After your dog can lie down in various locations and under various circumstances, start giving less treats. Always give praise and a pet though! You can start by only giving treats for the fastest downs, letting the slower more reluctant ones just get a praise and a pet., Start asking your dog to lie down before different fun activities, like before you put on his leash to go for a walk, before you give him dinner, before you throw him a favorite toy, before he’s allowed to meet new people, or before you let him off leash to play.


Dogs like having a job to do! And when he discovers that lying down gets him all kinds of rewards, he’ll be more likely to do it as soon as you ask., Like kids, dogs don’t have the longest attention spans. There’s no definite rule, but each training session should last about 15 minutes or less. Within that session, you can work on one skill, or switch between a few different skills.


Spend those 15 minutes practicing new skills, but keep old ones polished by doing single repetitions at convenient times throughout the day., If you like a behavior that your dog does, reward it. If you don’t like it, don’t reward it. For instance, if you sometimes pet your dog when he jumps up, but sometimes you yell at him, he’s bound to get confused about how you feel about the behavior.


Don’t bury words like “sit” and “down” in complex sentences. When training, decide what word you will use for the action that you want, and use it clearly and consistently every time.
Negative reinforcement doesn’t work! If you hit your dog or yank his leash when he does something you don’t like, he may simply learn that you are scary and not connect his behavior with how he got hurt. It’s much easier to focus on what you want your dog to do (if he starts doing something you don’t like, you tell him to sit) than on what you don’t want him to do., Many skills have complex parts. For instance, if you’re teaching your dog a solid sit-stay, you’ll need to work on having him stay until you release him, then staying while you move away from him until you release him, then staying while you move away from him with distractions until you release him.


Start with the more basic part of the skill, and then move upward in complexity for each level of mastery., Dogs, unlike people, don’t automatically take new information with them everywhere. They learn very specifically and don’t always apply their knowledge to different places and situations. So if you only practice a new skill in the kitchen, you’ll have a wonderfully kitchen-trained dog.


While you may want to start a new skill in a quiet room of your house, move to different locations as soon as he starts getting it. Train your dog in different rooms of your house, in your yard, at different stops during your walks, and at friends’ houses., It’s important to stop a training session before either one of you gets frustrated, tired, or bored. Also, remember to let your dog be a dog.


This means that you should have patience with dog training, and accept that your dog has certain traits and behaviors (chewing, mouthing, roughhousing) that are just part of being a dog. You can deter some behaviors by not rewarding them, but this takes time and patience.
If you are trying to prevent certain undesirable behaviors in your dog (like digging through the trash can), consider what you can do to prevent the behavior (like putting the can in a place where the dog can’t get to it) instead of setting unrealistic expectations on him."

Screen your dog for risk of hip problems.,
Tell the dog to sit.,
Hold the treat just above the nose.,
Raise the treat and command the dog to stand.,
Support your dog's paw (recommended).,
Repeat in short training sessions.,
Improve your dog's standing skills.,
Encourage your dog to stand onto your legs (optional).",How to Make a Dog Stand Up2," This trick can seriously injure your dog if he has an existing leg condition or weakness caused by genetics or malnutrition. Many breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia or other leg-related problems, especially (but not only) large breeds such as mastiffs and German shepherds. Before you begin, take your dog to a veterinarian who can examine your dog's hips for possible problems.


If you got the dog from a breeder, he may have a third-party certificate confirming that the dog's parents were screened for hip dysplasia. It's even better if the grandparents were tested, since it is possible to pass on the disease through a carrier with no symptoms.

, Assuming your dog is healthy and not at risk for leg issues, get her attention and command her to sit.


The better your dog's basic training, the easier this trick will be.

, Pick a treat the dog absolutely loves, preferably one with a strong smell. Hold it right above the dog's nose, without letting the dog eat it.


If the dog wasn't sitting up already, gesture upward with the treat and encourage him to sit upright.

, Lift the treat directly upward. The dog should naturally stand on his hind legs to reach the treat. The instant he does, give the ""STAND"" command (or a particular hand gesture) and reward him with praise and the treat.


If the dog already knows ""STAND"" as ""stand on all fours,"" use a different command instead, such as ""DANCE.""
Don't expect a great distance on the first try. It's fine to reward the dog for raising him front paws slightly off the ground.
Try not to raise it so high that the dog jumps. If the dog does jump, you can reinforce it with the ""JUMP"" command instead, but teaching two tricks at once isn't ideal.

, A dog's leg muscles are not built for a standing position. In the beginning, you may need to to help support the dog by letting him steady his paw against your hand. As he practices this trick, your dog's muscles will develop to support this position, and your dog will learn how to balance.

, Each session should only be two minutes max. Repeat no more than three times a day. Always end on a positive note, before the dog has tired out. Over time, the dog will learn to respond when you give the ""STAND"" command.

, If you like, and if the dog doesn't seem uncomfortable standing, hold the treat higher each time, until the dog can stand fully upright. This will also improve her balance, allowing her to hold the standing position for a little longer. Some dogs can learn to hold this position for a long time and even take a couple steps, but this is generally restricted to smaller, lighter dogs.

, Most dogs will stand up and place their paws on your legs when they're very excited to see you. If you want your dog to do this more often, encourage this by playing with the dog when it happens, fondling her ears or scratching under the neck. You can also praise them for standing up using a distinct word or sound that you only use for this situation. The dog may associate this sound with standing up, and learn that it's okay to stand on your legs if you say it.


If your dog doesn't do this on her own, sit on a chair and call the dog over. Play with the dog and lift the front legs slowly and gently until the front paws are on your knees.
Never force the dog to stay in this standing position. It is an unnatural position that causes uncomfortable strain if an unpracticed dog holds it for too long.
If you want the dog to sit down again, hold the front paws and help direct them back to the floor, rather than make your dog drop down suddenly.

Exercise the dog.,
Give the dog a chew toy when they start to nip.,
Encourage non-contact play.,
Arrange play dates for your dog.,
Avoid waving your hands around their face.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Play Biting2," A dog that has plenty of exercise is less likely to become overexcited during play, and they are less likely to nip out of boredom. Make sure to take your dog on walks once or twice a day. Give them plenty of time outside, and consider taking them to a dog park where they can play with other dogs., If the dog starts to mouth your hand, give them something acceptable to chew, such as a chew toy, KONG toy, or rawhide bone. Do this every time you think they are about to take someone’s hand or body part into their mouth.If you are nervous about the dog nipping children as they pet the dog, you can give the dog a toy before letting the children come near the dog.

, Dogs naturally want to nip and mouth people when playing contact games like wrestling or chasing. To prevent the dog from nipping you while playing, try games where you and the dog are not touching. These games include fetch, find the toy, or tug-of-war., Proper socialization with other dogs can help teach your dog what is and is not appropriate behavior. Letting your dog play with other, non-aggressive dogs will not only teach them proper play but it will let them get out their natural nipping tendencies without injuring you.Try to find a dog that has a similar temperament to your dog and who is roughly the same size.
Once they have learned how to safely play with individual dogs, you may want to take them a dog park to see how they fare with a group of unknown dogs.

, When playing with the dog, try not to wave your hands or feet around their face. Doing this might signal to the dog that your limbs are toys. Instead, keep your hands behind their heads while playing."

Find a quiet place to train your dog.,
Teach the dog to watch you.,
Choose a release cue such as ""okay"", ""free"", or ""break"" to communicate to the dog that it's okay to break heel position or get up from a sit.

Think of the leash as an extension of your arm.,
When you praise your dog, do not let it disobey your command until you release it.,
Reinforce that your dog cannot forge ahead.,
Train your dog not to lag as well.,
Try placing your thumb in your pocket to secure the lead at a length you feel comfortable working with.,
Use a thick collar.",How to Teach Your Dog to Heel," You want to eliminate distractions, so that your dog can concentrate on you easily. If you have a backyard, that is the perfect place to train your dog. Otherwise, find a quiet corner of a park with few other people or pets. If outdoors is too distracting, start inside. Gradually increase the amount of distraction as the dog learns, and be sure to practice in different places, so that the dog understands that ""heel"" means ""heel"" everywhere, not just in the backyard.;
, This can be accomplished by simply associating a cue such as ""Watch me"" with a treat. Your dog will quickly learn to look at you when you use the word, as they will expect a treat. Once this has been accomplished, give treats randomly, not necessarily for every occasion, but don't stop completely.


Don't rely on the leash to physically move the dog. The leash is for safety, not a means of communication. Practicing off-leash in a safe location is ideal.

,, The proper way to walk a dog is with the dog on your left side. However, this is only necessary for formal obedience and some other sports. For pet dogs, choose whichever side is best for you, but be consistent and stick with the chosen side.


The dog should walk with its head or shoulder even with your hip.
You are not holding the leash tight to keep your dog in place. The leash is slack between you, with no contact.

, ""Right Here"" is a useful command to teach your dog when standing. If your dog is not close enough or is confused about which side to sit at, slap your hip and use the command ""Right Here"". If needed, lure your dog to your side with a treat. As your dog learns, slowly fade the lure by using your hand without a treat, then just your hand, then more general. The lure can become a hand signal (moving your hand to your hip).

, The key to heeling is having your dog's attention. Start standing still with your dog sitting beside you in the correct position. Get your dogs attention by calling its name, tapping on its head, making noises, or using your pre-taught ""watch me"" cue.


When the dog looks up, slap your left hip with your hand and say ""Right Here"". This is a command. Your dog can learn to look where you indicate, and in this way you are giving your dog a reference point for where he should be while heeling.
Set your dog up for success. Try your best to avoid asking for more than your dog is capable of.
Remember, the key is getting your dog's attention. This can be the most difficult thing. Also, though it takes some work, while getting your dog's attention you can teach your dog to look at you when you say ""Watch me"" or whatever your chosen cue is. Remember to reward with a treat when your dog responds correctly.

, Reward your dog. Increase to two, then three, and so on.

,


Consider every walk you have with the dog a training session., Treats are usually the most favoured and easiest option. You should positively reinforce your dog when he obeys your commands correctly. Avoid using punishment to train.

, Many people train their dogs with all positive, reward-based methods, which require a lot of patience and consistency. Corrections can get quicker results sometimes, but it can also backfire by damaging your relationship with your dog, creating anxiety and confusion in the dog, and resulting in more unwanted behavior.

, With this in mind, do not correct your dog unless he or she needs correction. Giving mixed signals to your dog will only complicate and inhibit successful training.


Keeping the leash slack (not correcting constantly) means that when you actually do pull on the leash, your dog is much more likely to listen to you.

, For instance, if you tell your dog to sit, it obeys, you praise it, and it gets up, immediately stop the praise. If your dog does not sit down again by itself after a few seconds, firmly put it into place, then praise again.


You do not need to repeat the command. Enforcing it is much more effective. You may want to give the dog another chance to obey properly.

, Most dogs forge ahead. To correct this, keep your dog on a leash that is tight enough to allow you to step across in front of him. When he tries to forge ahead, turn sharply and step directly in his path, making a 90 degree turn and heading off in a new direction. Once again, turn sharply, as if walking along a square.


The dog will be used to leading you, and may be surprised or confused. Walk in a straight line again, until the dog tries to forge past you. Pull the same stunt. Doing this for 5-15 minutes a day is enough. Some dogs learn after the first session, but some dogs who have been used to leading you for years may take longer.

, Most dogs lag consistently if they feel afraid, neglected, unwanted, or abused but many dogs lag occasionally if they are sidetracked by smells or activities. The way to stop lagging is similar to stopping forging. All you have to do is let the leash hit your leg every time you step as you walk.


Your leash should once again be in your right hand, and a lagging dog would be on your left side behind you, with the leash crossing in front of your legs. This will cause a jerk when you step forward with your left leg, and if this isn't enough to make your dog want to catch up, you can slowly reel in the leash while your leg is bumping it.
You should use a command while doing this ""Get-Up-Here"" and/or ""Right Here""; with your left hand slap your hip. Speak this command, and your dog's name, using ""Hey"" to get his attention if needed. Once your dog is next to you, praise and let the leash slack. Most likely he will lag again, but all you have to do is repeat., The abrupt stop or changes in direction at the consistent lead tension seem to direct the dog well. Sometimes with your hands free you can tend to allow too much slack allowing the dog to roam while you daydream. The thumb trick keeps them firmly in place.

, Thinner collars are more severe than wider collars, as pressure is not displaced over a larger area, making corrections more severe.

Use the “Drop it” command with a treat.,
Use the “Drop it” command without a treat.,
Increase the time that your dog holds his toy in his mouth.",How to Teach a Dog to Fetch1," Your dog may be good at catching and bringing the toy back to you, but may not know that he needs to drop it. To teach him how to drop his toy, hold a treat in one hand. With your dog sitting or standing in front of you, start shaking his favorite toy in your other hand until he gets excited (eg, wagging his tail). As you’re shaking the toy, give the verbal command “Take it.” After your dog is excited and you’ve given the command, allow him to take the toy from your hand with his mouth.After a few seconds, give him another verbal command– “Drop it”– to drop the toy.Your dog will probably not drop the toy once he has it in his mouth (at least not initially), which is why you’ll need the treat. Hold the treat close to his nose. Once he drops the toy, immediately reward him with the treat.;
, Put the treat in your pocket. When he has his toy in his mouth, hold your hand in front of his nose as if you have the treat in your hand and give him the “Drop it” command. When he drops his toy, reward him with the treat.Eventually, your dog should be able to drop his toy with only the verbal command to do so., Gradually increase the amount of time that he must hold his toy before you give him the “Drop it” command.The longer he can hold his toy in his mouth, the easier it will be for you to him teach him the next parts of the fetching process. Increase the time by a few seconds each time you practice.


If he drops the toy before you command him to do so, start again shorten the period of time that he has to hold it.Remember to reward him each time he drops his toy at your command.
Practice the “Drop it” command each day until your dog is comfortable with it and has mastered it. This part may take longer if he is reluctant to give up his toy once he has it in his mouth. Practice in short intervals (5 to 15 minutes) several times a day.

Start training when your dog is about 3 months old.,
Offer your dog a toy.,
Say “drop it” and offer a treat.,
Repeat the process.,
Practice in different environments with different items.,
Reinforce your training constantly.",How to Teach Your Dog to Drop It," Pick a toy that is easy for your dog to hold in its mouth and one it enjoys playing with. A stuffed squeaky toy or a dog bone is a good choice. In the grander scheme of things, it doesn’t matter too much what kind of toy you give your dog, because you are going to be teaching it to drop it anyway., You’ll want treats that your dog likes more than its toy. It is important to have a value system in mind that your dog will follow. A tasty treat is worth more to a dog than a dog toy. This can be your dog's normal treats or special treats just for training. Dogs like treats make from turkey, chicken, or cheese. Be sure to keep the amounts very small as you will be using them frequently during the training sessions., In the early twentieth century, the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov discovered that dogs could be taught to “expect” food at the sound of a bell. This “neutral stimulus” — the sound of the bell — caused the dog’s to drool and expect food.You can use the same principle here. Pick something that is portable and makes a sound. Make people use clickers, which literally just make a clicking sound. You might even consider just using a sound file on your phone., If your dog tends to run with its toys, you might want to keep it on a leash for your training. Otherwise, you’ll need to keep it in a confined space with minimal distractions. Your goal is to focus your dog's attention on the training, not on playing., You need to have realistic expectations. Yes, it is possible that your dog might learn a basic command within a day or so, but it is far more realistic to expect small, yet noticeable improvements., Each session should last about 15 minutes and you can attempt up to 3 sessions spread throughout the day. Typically, the younger the dog, the shorter each session will need to be because of limited attention spans., Make sure you have the toy in one hand and a treat in the other. Hold the toy in front of the dog’s mouth. Wait for your dog to sniff it and take it. You can even tell your dog to “take it”. This way your dog will learn to both take and drop things in the process. Always use the same command., Again, make sure you are using the same command each time. You can repeat the command a couple of times, but don’t use it too much. Place the treat in front of your dog's nose. Hopefully — if you’ve chose your treat wisely — your dog will drop the toy and eat the treat.If you’ve decided to use a trigger, now is the time to use it too. When you say drop it, click the clicker. Make sure that it occurs at the same time, so that your dog will associate “drop it” and the clicking sound with getting a treat.
Be sure to keep an assertive tone, but remain calm. You don’t want to yell at your dog and scare it., Hold the toy up, until your dog takes it. Say “drop it”, while pressing the clicker and then offer a treat. As you practice this, move further away from the dog. This way your dog will expect a treat whenever it hears the command or the click. You don’t want your dog to only follow the command if you are right in front of it., You want to hone your dog’s understanding of the command as much as you can. Remember that dogs are smart. Your dog might only associate the command with its toys or to specific places. You’ll want to teach your dog the command inside and outside. Offer your dog different items. If your dog really enjoys carrying a specific thing in its mouth, train it with that item.Always use acceptable chewing objects when practicing ""drop it"". You don't want to encourage your dog to pick up and drop something you wouldn't otherwise want her getting a hold of. For example, if your dog likes to chew on your shoes, don’t use your shoes to teach it this trick. It might end up associating chewing on your shoes with getting a treat., You never know when a teaching moment will present itself. Keep treats and your clicker/trigger available. If you don't have treats, then offer your dog something of greater value. For example, exchange the TV remote for a dog toy. "

Distinguish between aggression and playfulness.,
Introduce dogs on neutral ground.,
Hide toys when another dog is around.,
Separate dogs in a tense situation.,
Avoid tricky situations.",How to Get Your Dog to Stop Play Biting3," Just because play is rough does not mean that dogs are hurting each other. Dogs often enjoy and benefit from wild play. Watch their body language to see if they are becoming aggressive.Sign of aggressive play include tense facial muscles, a stiff posture, and raised fur on their backs. Dogs may also snarl or bare their teeth at the other dog. If this occurs, you should try to separate the dogs.
If the dog bows or rolls over, they are likely just playing, and you do not need to separate them. They may also crash into one another, nip, jump onto one another, lightly growl or bark, and chase each other. These are all normal behaviors.Dogs growl while playing, but if the growl suddenly drops to a lower tone, they may be becoming aggressive.

, Before you let two unfamiliar dogs run free together, put them both on a leash, and let them meet one another outside on neutral territory. Allow the dogs to sniff each other before taking them on a short walk. If the dogs are friendly towards one another, you can let them play together off the leash inside or outside.If you introduce the dogs inside your house, your dog may feel territorial over their home.

, If your dog becomes aggressive or territorial around their toys, you may need to hide or remove these toys when another dog is present. This will prevent your dog from becoming defensive over the toys, and it may allow them to play normally with the other dog., If the dog is demonstrating aggressive behavior or if it seems that they are about to engage in a fight, get your dog away as soon as possible.If your dog is trained to respond to commands, use a “come” command or call their name.
You may be able to distract the dogs by splashing them with a little bit of water.
Do not grab the dog by the collar or front of the face, or you risk being accidentally bitten. Instead, if you absolutely have to handle the dog, grab the dog by the hindquarters.

, If your dog repeatedly becomes aggressive during play, you may need to remove them from the situation when it arises. You can prevent these situations by placing the dog in a separate room if there is a strange dog in the house. You may also need to avoid dog parks. You can take your dog on a leashed walk instead or play with them in an enclosed yard.

Play ‘Bait-and-Switch’ with your dog.,
Play ‘Catch Me If You Can’ with your dog.,
Teach your dog to bring his toy closer to you.",How to Teach a Dog to Fetch2," If you notice that your dog chases after his toy but doesn’t bring it back to you, try playing fetch with two of his favorite toys. To play the ‘bait-and-switch’ game, throw his first toy. When he fetches this toy, call him to get his attention. Once he starts turning to you, throw his second toy in the opposite direction that you threw the first toy. He’ll probably drop the first toy to go chase after the second one.When he’s chasing the second toy, run and get his first toy. Call his name, and repeat the process. Your dog probably sees this as a fun game of chase, but you are teaching him to turn back to you.After doing this a few times, throw your dog’s first toy again. Call his name, but do not throw the second toy yet. When he gets closer to you with the first toy in his mouth, give him the “Drop it” command and show him the second toy. When he drops his first toy, throw the second one. When he chases after the second toy, pick up his first toy and repeat the process.Eventually, your dog will learn will learn to bring his toy back to you after you throw it to him, without the need for the second toy., This is another game to teach your dog to give his toy back to you. Attach a leash or rope to his toy and throw the toy. If your dog catches it but doesn’t bring it back, wiggle the leash or rope and start running in the opposite direction. Chances are that your dog will start chasing you with the toy still in his mouth. Give him a treat if he does so.If your dog initially drops the toy and doesn’t chase after it, wiggle the leash or rope a little more and start running away. Eventually, he should try to chase after and catch the toy. Give him a treat when he gets closer to you with the toy. After a few weeks’ time, your dog will learn that he should bring his toy back to you after you throw it to him., If your dog tends to drop his toy before bringing it all the way to you, stand in place and say “Bring it” just as he reaches the point where he usually drops it. Wave your arm to gesture that he should follow you, and then start walking away from him. When he starts to follow you and reaches the place where you were originally standing, say “Drop it” and walk back towards him to pick up the toy.It may take a few weeks before your dog understands the “Bring it” command, so be patient with him."

Try a “round-robin” approach.,
Expand the range of training.,
Get help.",How to Train a Dog to Come," The dog will not learn if you do not have the right frame of understanding. A little research is in order before your first session, and it is always best to take an obedience class with your dog, and train as ""homework"". But for positive training, keep in mind:

Your mood will be picked up by your dog. If you go into training in a funk, or feeling frustrated or angry, likely your pup will feel this too. Although consistency is important, it may be better to skip training that day rather than get negative emotions into the mix. Keep training a positive activity.
Be sure the dog masters #1 before going to #2. A success in one step does not necessarily mean the dog actually ""gets it"". You still need repetition to be sure the dog is consistent. Be sure the dog can really do the first step every time before going to the second.
Keep sessions short and frequent. Dogs--and especially puppies--typically have short attention spans. Asking a dog to have prolonged periods of intense training may lead to frustration on everyone's parts.
Do not get frustrated if the dog has some failures. When something new is being learned, there will always be failures. This is not a bad thing, just part of learning. If your dog picks up that he or she is disappointing you, and does not really know why, training becomes something bad.

Never punish a dog for obeying a command. If you give a command, you should never, ever give the dog any mixed signals that your signal was bad. If your dog was chasing a deer, and you command, ""come"" and the dog comes, praise him or her--do not rebuke him or her for chasing even though you may be upset and want to get across chasing deer is not OK. Your dog will only understand that if he or she comes, he or she is punished and may not come next time.;
, As with any new command, you want to start with a location that’s familiar to your dog and free from distractions such as toys, small children, food, loud noises, or other animals.This allows your dog to focus as much as possible on you, the command, and the behavior you want him to associate it with.


If you live with other people, keep them involved in the training process too. This way they will know not to distract your dog while you’re teaching commands.

, While your dog will later graduate to off-leash developments in the method, the initial training should take place on leash to keep him close and focused on you. Start with a shorter, six-foot leash that keeps your dog close and you more present in his field of vision.Stand an appropriate distance away so that your dog can’t reach you within just a step or two. For a small dog, this may only be two or three feet, whereas you may stand back the entire six-foot length of the leash for a large dog.

, Your dog will naturally want to chase you playfully when you start taking fast backward steps away from him.You want to issue the command a single time, ensuring you say it before you begin moving backward.This will allow your dog to hear the command clearly before getting distracted by wanting to chase you.


Issuing the command one time is sufficient. The more you say to your dog during training, the less likely he is to begin associating any of the words with behaviors.If your dog does not respond and stays put, give your leash a slight tug and encourage him to move toward you.

, Signals are a good idea since they further associate the behavior, and they also help in situations where your dog can see you, but may not be able to hear you.If you choose to teach with both verbal and hand signals, use a distinct hand signal. Make sure you use the signal and the verbal command at the same time.


You can wave your hand toward your body or point at the ground in front of you. Holding your hand out in front of you, palm up, and curling your fingers back onto your palm is another common signal for the come command.
Hand signals are additionally helpful in situations where verbal commands are not so useful, such as near a loud highway.
If your dog goes deaf (which is not uncommon in old age or in some breeds) hand signals become especially helpful.

, You want your dog to associate the command with coming all the way to you and not simply running a few feet. To help with this while using the shorter leash, keep backpedaling (carefully not to run into anything) until your dog reaches you.If you are clicker training your dog, be sure to click as soon as your dog starts moving toward you and when he reaches you. This will reinforce his movement, direction, and good behavior., Once your dog reaches you, offer plenty of praise. Repeated positive reinforcement helps your dog to understand that he’s doing what you want with the associated behavior.Though positive reinforcement most often takes the form of praise and a treat, use your knowledge of your dog to your advantage. Maybe you know he responds best to being given his favorite toy after obeying a command.

, The key to success is introducing greater distances and distracting environments in small increments that add a new dimension without overwhelming your dog. If you initially begin in your quiet living room without any toys around, try scattering a few toys next time, and then try turning on the TV as well the time after that. Next, try moving it to the backyard and using a fifteen-foot leash instead of the shorter one., One of the best ways to help train on the command consistently is to incorporate it into your daily walks with your dog.This not only ensures that you’re regularly practicing the command with your dog, but it also provides a variety of different locations and surrounding levels of distraction to challenge your dog to stay focused.

, Your dog will eventually learn to associate the command with the behavior, allowing you to stop taking steps backward to initiate the behavior. Reduce the number of steps you take after issuing the command from several to just one or two. After that, work on issuing the command without taking steps backward at all.


Remember to be patient. If your dog fails to come when you stand still, go back to taking one or two steps for another day, and try try again.

, If your dog hits a wall anywhere in the process, then consider taking him to a trainer. A professional trainer can help correct any mistakes in your home technique for the training, and the group environment is great for socializing your dog.


A trainer can teach you and your dog how to best communicate with each other and how to learn from each other as well., After several days or weeks—depending on your dog—of on-leash training, choose an enclosed area, and see if you can get your dog to come while off leash. If he doesn’t respond to the command, you may have to start using the back-up method again to make him chase you.Remember that the process will take time and patience, so don’t allow yourself to get frustrated if your dog doesn’t quite understand yet the first time you take him off his leash. The important part is to keep trying.


Also, avoid repeating the command over and over if it’s proving ineffective. Each time you repeat the command without the dog understanding, you risk weakening the association he had already begun to form with the command. If he’s not responding at all, go back to using the long-leash training for another day or two before trying again.
If you do initially have to take a step or two backward to initiate the behavior, reduce those steps, take smaller steps, and other similar actions to wean your dog off needing you to move to respond to the command.
Occasionally ask him to come when he is not expecting you to. For example, call him when he is sniffing around the yard to test his attention to the command.

, As you try to increase the distance from which you recall your dog, you may have to get help from another person. The restrained recall variation involves having someone else hold your dog still, so you can get farther away without your dog following along. When you’re ready, issue the command once (along with any hand signals you may also be teaching) and have the person restraining your dog let go.As always, use your clicker if clicker training and offer plenty of positive reinforcement when your dog reaches you.
The best way for the person holding the dog to restrain him is by lacing fingers across his chest., Once your dog is successfully responding to the command for you, a round-robin approach offers new challenges and complexity to the process. Have two or three additional people besides yourself stand in a large circle at least twenty feet apart, and then have people on different sides of the circle take turns issuing the command and having your dog come.Make sure that each person has the proper amount of time to give your dog praise and a treat before the next person issues the command.Remember to use the clicker if you’re clicker training and to have each person use the proper signal if you’re using hand signals in addition to the command.

, After you feel more comfortable with your dog's progress, alter the training environment and increase your dog's exposure to distractions. If you notice that your dog always seems distracted during training, you should backtrack and work in a familiar setting again before moving onto more complicated environments.Make sure that you never progress all the way to open areas (or even enclosed park dogs where safety may be an issue) until your dog is successfully obeying the command in various locations with all different levels of distraction.

, If your dog is consistently struggling to make the leap from obeying the command on his leash to obeying it while off his leash, then don’t be afraid to get help from a professional dog trainer. A training session with an instructor can guide you through these difficulties. You can also contact a professional trainer or canine behaviorist to get more advice.


Each dog is different and therefore not every dog learns in exactly the same way."

Keep your dog still on a table.,
Have your dog stand on a ‘whoa’ board.,
Teach your dog to stand still on a barrel.,
Give your dog the ‘whoa’ command.,
Perfect your dog’s ‘whoa’ appearance.,
Create a half hitch with your check cord or leash.,
Walk with your dog outside and say ‘whoa.’ As you are walking with your dog, say ‘whoa’ once.,
Tell your dog to ‘whoa’ and walk away from him.",How to Teach Your Dog to Whoa," To teach your dog to ‘whoa,’ he will first need to understand what the command means when he is standing still. There a few different ways you can do this, one of which is to keep him still on a table. If you are crafty, you can build a table using a 12 x 12 foot (about 4 x 4 meter) section of plywood (available at your local home improvement store),with ramps on each side.Use the ramps to elevate the table to about the height of your waist.The ramps are also a way for your dog to walk up to the center of table without you having to lift him up.
If you do not want to build a table, you could consider placing your dog on a table you already have.
With your dog on the elevated surface, stroke him continuously and give him treats. These rewards will teach him that standing still is a good thing.Depending on the age of your dog, keeping him still might take extra effort. The goal is to have him stand still for up to one minute at a time.;
, ‘Whoa’ boards are similar to the ‘whoa’ table, but smaller. If you want to build them, use two x three foot (0.6 by 0.9 meter) sections of plywood and elevate them about four to six inches (10 to 15 centimeters) off the ground.You can place some books under the boards to keep them elevated.


It is helpful to place the ‘whoa’ boards throughout your home to get your dog used to them. Whenever your dog walks by the board, place him on it and keep him still.The more practice he has standing still, the better!
Keep him still and reward him as you did on the ‘whoa’ table.
To create a positive association with the board (or table), feed your dog on it for a weeks. This is especially useful if you are teaching ‘whoa’ to a puppy., If you have access to a large barrel (it’s okay if you don’t!), place it on its side. Place your dog on top of it and have him stand still. To help him feel more confident with his footing, attach a piece of carpet to the part of the barrel where you want him to stand.While he is on the barrel, reward him as you did when he stood on the ‘whoa’ table or boards.When you place him on the barrel the first time, hold him gently to keep him from jumping off.
Standing on a barrel won’t be easy for your dog. It will be okay if he gets a little wobbly and falls off. Just make sure he lands on his feet (or place him on his feet when he takes a tumble).Your dog may be able to stand still for only a few seconds at first. With more practice, he will be able to stand on it for longer.
He will recognize that the barrel will move if he moves—an uncomfortable sensation for him. It shouldn’t take him long to understand that standing still will be more comfortable., Up until this point, the goal has been to have your dog simply stand still on different surfaces. Now it is time to add in the verbal ‘whoa’ command. On whichever elevated surface you have him standing, say ‘whoa’ repeatedly as you stroke him.Saying ‘whoa’ multiple times when your dog is standing still teaches him that the command is associated with staying still.


Say ‘whoa’ in a soothing and reassuring tone. The command itself is calm, so it should be said soothingly.When your dog stands still when hearing the ‘whoa’ command, give him another command (e.g., ‘ok’, ‘release’) to let him know he can move. Give him a treat when you release him., This is more applicable for hunting or sporting dogs. When your dog is standing still on the elevated surface, pick up his tail and keep it elevated.In addition, cup his lower jaw in one of your hands, with your thumb on one side of jaw and your fingers on the other side.As you progress through the training stages, continue to keep his tail elevated and head still. Over time, this will teach your hunting or sporting the dog the proper position he should hold when he responds to the ‘whoa’ command.

, Check cords are useful for controlling a hunting or sporting dog during a hunting session.If your goal for teaching the ‘whoa’ command is to keep your dog from running in the street, you can use a leash instead of purchasing a check cord. To make the half hitch, first attach the check cord or leash to your dog’s collar.Wrap the check cord or leash around your dog’s belly. Run the loose end of the check cord or leash underneath itself on your dog’s back.The half hitch allows you to tighten the check cord or leash and correct your dog without hurting him., Although your dog is now familiar with this command, he knows it only in association with standing still, not when he is already moving. Do not be surprised if he continues moving the first few times you say ‘whoa’ when he’s moving.Without saying anything, simply give the leash or check cord a tug to move your dog to where he was when you said the command.Continue walking with your dog and saying ‘whoa’ at different intervals of time or distance.Keep practicing until your dog stops immediately when you say ‘whoa.’
You can also give him the verbal release command to let him know it is okay to start moving again. Offering him a treat and some verbal praise immediately afterwards would also be helpful.

, When your dog immediately stops when hearing ‘whoa,’ challenge him by walking away from him after giving the command (continue to hold the leash or check cord). If he moves before you give him the release command, use the check cord or leash to move him back to where he was when you said ‘whoa.’Do not repeat the ‘whoa’ command if he moves. If you do, he may not understand that he is supposed to respond to the command the first time you say it."

Walk your dogs on one leash together regularly.Dogs which walk together on one leash can experience increased companionship and opportunity for socialization with one another.",How to Walk Two Dogs with One Leash," The dogs you want to walk together on one leash should know each other already. If their temperaments are not compatible, they may fight each other or get into trouble. Only walk dogs who are relaxed when together and leash trained.Dogs who do not stop when commanded to do so, or come when beckoned, should not be brought on walks with another dog.;
, You can buy double walker leashes which branch out at the end, allowing two dogs to be attached. Alternately, you could employ a coupler. A coupler is a small V-shaped leash extender which allows your leash to accommodate two dogs instead of one. It will save you money that you’d otherwise have to spend on an entirely new leash. Couplers and double walker leashes are equally good options for the individual looking to walk two dogs on one leash.


Attach each dog, one at a time, to one side of the V-shaped branch. You can place your dogs on either side of the leash coupler.
Whether you buy a coupler or a double walker leash, ensure it possesses appropriate level of tensile strength and will not break.

, A thin, lightweight leash is best for a smaller dog. A larger dog, by contrast, requires a more heavy-duty leash with a strong clip. The clip must be strong enough not to break under pressure when pulled against the metal ring on the dog’s collar.If the leash clip breaks, your dogs might run off.


The basic leash is 6 feet long and is the standard leash with which people walk their dogs.
A retractable leash consists of a spring-loaded device within a a plastic case. When the dog runs out, the leash will, with slight resistance, extend in length (up to its limit). If you wish to keep the dog nearby, you can lock the leash so that the length does not extend at all. Be careful with these because a dog who takes off at a full run might be able to break the leash. The handle might be uncomfortable in your hands as well. Try one or several retractable leashes out before buying.
A bungee leash stretches and retracts. Made of rubber or elastic, bungee leashes are good for doggies who vigorously pull on their leashes.
Long line leashes are extra long for dogs who like to roam and explore. They vary in length from 10 to 60 feet. Be careful with these leashes; dogs who run too far afield might end up in traffic or encounter other dangers.

, For instance, do not get a brown collar for a brown dog. You’ll want people to see that he has a collar in case he or she runs off while unleashed. Pick a collar which accommodates the width of your dog’s neck. Collars should be adjusted so as to allow you to slip one finger between the collar and your dog’s neck. There are many varieties of collars available.


A standard flat collar is usually made of nylon or leather. You can purchase these at most stores. Some dogs whose necks are larger than their heads -- such as Greyhounds and Whippets -- might slip out of them.
Martingale collars are ideal for larger dogs like Greyhounds. These collars are looped around a dog’s neck just as normal collars are, but will tighten as a dog pulls away.In this way, dogs are unable to escape or remove the collar on their own.
Back-clip harness collars fit over the dog’s chest and attach to the leash by a clip on the dog’s back.
Front-clip harness collar are similar to back-clip harness collars, but with the difference that the clip to which the leash attaches is located in the front of the harness, not on the back. These harness collars give you more control over the dog than a back-clip harness.
Head collars consist of one clip for the neck and one for the muzzle. Along with front-clip harnesses, head collars are favored by dog owners because they allow you to lead the dog in whatever direction you want, rather than pulling on its neck.
If you want your dogs to walk side-by side, try the short chain method. The short chain method involves clipping the two dogs’ collars together with a chain link so they are closer together. This will get them used to walking near each other. Later, extend the chain to full length.

, They might become rambunctious in the presence of a canine companion, and forget all their training. The potential for misbehavior is compounded when there are other distractions about.


Do not walk your dogs on one leash around a public park or area where they are liable to encounter other dogs or other novel fauna. Walk your dogs instead, at first, around a quiet, relatively deserted space such as a woodland path or suburban neighborhood. Your back yard is also a good place to start practicing.

, For instance, if you’re walking a dog who lunges or barks at passers-by, your other dog might pick up the bad behavior.


Walk each dog separately before walking them together.This will ensure each dog is already familiar with your expectations and commands when being walked, and prevent potential misbehavior.
Be consistent when punishing or correcting misbehavior. Inconsistencies will confuse your dog and make training more difficult.

, Only allow your dogs to walk forward when there is some slack in the leash.This “loose-leash training” will prevent pulling, which can restrict your dog’s breathing. Also, look for signs of aggression or tension in your dogs, such as an arched back, growling, biting (not friendly nipping), and bared teeth.Remove one or the other of the two dogs if either starts showing signs of aggression.

, Let them get excited about going on walks together by announcing, for instance, “Walk time!” right before you attach their collars to the leash. Give them time to get used to walking together. Walk your dogs together regularly on one leash to afford them continued opportunities for mutual enjoyment.

Lure them inside with a toy.,
Tempt them with a treat.,
Put the dog on a leash.,
Take the dog for a walk.",How to Get Your Dog to Come Inside the House1," Some dogs may be persuaded to come into the house for a toy. Take the toy and stand at the door with it. Call your dog while waving the toy. Many dogs will be interested in the toy and want to play. If the dog comes towards you, step into the house or toss the toy inside to get your dog to go after it.Make sure to continue playing with the dog when they get inside so as not to make them think it’s a trick. Instead, show them that coming inside is fun and rewarding for them.
You may want to try a toy that makes noise, like a squeaky toy.
Try playing tug-of-war with the dog until you herd the dog inside.;
, You can try to get your dog to come inside by giving them a treat. Choose their favorite treat and stand at the door. Call them to you while holding the treat. As soon as they come towards you, step inside the house and make them come to you for the treat.Don’t immediately shut the door. This could scare the dog or make them feel trapped. Instead, put a couple of treats on the floor and walk further into the house. You may want to give them an additional treat when they come seek you out.
After the dog comes inside for the treat, praise them and pet them. Grab a toy and play with them. Help them realize that being inside is a good experience and they won’t be punished.

, You can bring your dog inside by going to them and placing them on a leash. This puts you in control of your dog by giving you a way to coerce them into the house. Walk out to where your dog is, clip the leash to the collar, and walk them inside. Give them a treat or praise for coming in with you instead of being angry. Don’t make them think they are being punished by coming with you.This method requires you to go out into the yard after your dog. Though it will get your dog into the house, it won’t train your dog to come when you call.

, If your dog isn’t coming inside, you may want to take them for a walk. Dogs need exercise and mental stimulation, so by taking the dog for a walk, you can tire them out and keep them stimulated. After the walk, you will have them on the leash so you can just take the dog directly into your house and give them a treat. This also shows them that they will be rewarded through positive reinforcement by coming into the house.

Choose a friendly environment for training.,
Avoid distractions.,
Play with your dog before getting started.",How to Enhance Your Dog's Recall1," Your dog will learn best in an environment where it feels comfortable and stress free. If you try to train your dog’s recall in an unfamiliar or stressful environment, your dog will have a hard time paying attention to your commands.The best place to train your dog is in your own yard, since your dog is very familiar with this area and won’t feel stressed out. If you don’t have a yard, you can take your dog to a familiar park. The park should be fenced-in to keep your dog from running off. Ideally, you and your dog will be there alone.
Avoid taking your dog to a crowded park or large area while you’re trying to enhance their recall. If your dog gets far away from you before you’ve trained at that distance, they may not understand that your command still applies. And they may stop associating the command with positive things.;
, You want your dog to have its full attention on you when you’re training their recall. If there are lots of noises or other animals around, you dog will be distracted.If you have other animals, remove them from the yard before you train your dog’s recall.
Choose a time of day when traffic is low and there aren’t lots of people making noise.

, Dogs naturally get excited then they’re taken outside. To get your dog’s full attention, play with it throughout the day so that when the time comes to train it, it will not have all that pent-up energy.For instance, you could toss a ball or favored toy across the room for your dog, or play a gentle game of tug-of-war with a knotted rope toy.
If you have a yard, let your dog run around the yard and explore before starting recall training. Throw a ball or stick for them to fetch. Let your dog do whatever it wants.
After five to ten minutes, begin recall training.

Dogs who are overly coddled, or whose behavior is not corrected, never develop social skills. Pay attention to how your dog interacts with other dogs, whether in your home or when going out.A small dog may see himself as the boss. He may bully other dogs to get his way. He may, for example, chase other dogs away from the food bowl, or growl at dogs attempting to get on the couch with him.
Your dog may be very aggressive on walks. He may bark, lunge, or growl at passing dogs.;
, Small dogs are often ignored when they disobey rules, leading them to have poor impulse control in the home. Your dog may behave poorly in general due to the double standard for behavior many owners have for small dogs.Does your dog beg for food? While many dogs beg for food, dogs with small dog syndrome are particularly persistent. They may whine, bark, and stare until they get their way, despite being told to quiet down. In extreme cases, a small dog may start refusing his own food in favor of table scraps.
A small dog may have a general disregard for household rules. He may not listen when he's told to get down, get into things frequently, and have poor impulse control in general.

, How does your dog react to guests? A small dog may ignore guests who do not want to be jumped on or licked. A small dog may also be aggressive with guests. He may growl when guests come in, and may occasionally nip at people. Much like other problems, this stems from poor socialization and a lack of boundaries early on., Dogs with small dog syndrome may be particularly difficult to housebreak. Dogs generally pee to assert dominance and control in a home. As small dog syndrome can spoil a dog, urinating inside the home is a common symptom.Your dog will not just urinate in your home. Your dog will also pee when visiting the homes of friends or family members.

, Part of the reason small dog syndrome occurs is that small dogs are treated differently due to their size. Behaviors that would seem like a nuisance in larger breeds are ignored in small dogs as they're seen as less threatening.A small dog is not seen as a threat to people or other dogs, for the most part. If a large Labrador jumped on a guest, the dog would be told to get down. Its size may frighten someone. If a small terrier did the same thing, the behavior is less likely to be corrected. Small dogs are not seen as inherently threatening as larger breeds sometimes are.
This leads to behavioral problems overall. When a small dog feels he can get away with certain behaviors, he's less likely to respect owner authority in the home.

, Another factor contributing to small dog syndrome is that owners feel they must protect smaller breeds. You may, for example, pick your dog up quickly if you see a bigger dog on a walk. You may also not allow your dog to interact with larger breeds at all, even when larger dogs are well trained and generally friendly. This can lead to poor socialization, causing some of the problems associated with small dog syndrome. Small dog syndrome may cause excessive barking and aggression towards other dogs., You may be reinforcing the behavior if your dog has small dog syndrome. Early on especially, behaviors that lead to small dog syndrome are often inadvertently encouraged.A tiny dog may bark at a larger dog on a walk or a park. Instead of correcting the behavior, you may be inclined to try to calm your dog down. You may say something soothing like, ""Shhh, it's okay."" Your dog can interpret this as praise, and feel aggression and barking are correct behaviors in the future.
You may also be more inclined to let small dogs break household rules. A small dog jumping on someone may be seen as cute. A small dog hopping into your lap during dinner may also not be seen as a major issue. Therefore, the dog learns these behaviors are appropriate. The dog never learns to respect you as an authority figure in his home.

, Small dog syndrome should be treated, as it carries certain risks. The biggest risk is behavioral problems. Small dogs may be harder to train, and may not obey as easily, as they're not held to the same standard.Small dogs also may develop problems with nerves. If you constantly feel the need to protect your dog from danger, he may learn to see the world as a dangerous place. Your dog may become nervous easily, which can sometimes lead to trembling when startled.
There are some physical health problems associated with small dog syndrome. If you're carrying your dog around a lot to protect him, he may become overweight. This can lead to joint pain, as well as extra pressure on the organs.

, It can always be helpful to seek professional advice, especially if your dog's issues are becoming a real problem. A vet may be able to offer you some advice on how to reverse small dog syndrome.


You can wait until your dog's regular appointment to ask questions. Small dog syndrome can often be treated at home, and is not usually a medical risk right away.
However, excessive urination may be a symptom of other conditions. If your dog is urinating a lot, you may want to make a vet appointment early., If your dog has small dog syndrome, you will want to take steps to correct the problem. You want to avoid long term health and behavioral problems associated with small dog syndrome. To start, avoid picking your dog up too often.A dog needs to walk for exercise. Do not pick your dog up on walks, even when he becomes aggressive or difficult. You should only pick your dog up when it's necessary for your dog's safety. For example, if an aggressive dog is running at your dog, it's appropriate to pick your dog up.
Small dogs will also get spoiled when being carried all the time. Your dog may decide he or she is too good to walk, and start refusing to do so when taken out. Regular walking is necessary to a dog's well-being, so make sure your dog walks frequently.

, Small dogs should be held to the same standards of behavior as larger breeds. While your small dog's jumping or aggression may not be that much of a nuisance, ignoring the problem leads to many behavioral issues associated with small dog syndrome.Do not let small dogs get on the couch or on someone's lap without an invitation first. Correct behaviors like barking, growling, or aggression.
Never hand feed a small dog. While the occasional table scrap is okay for a treat, put the food in a dog's bowl. It's important your small dog can separate your food and eating area from his food and eating area.

, In addition to correcting negative behaviors, reward positive ones. Give your dog a treat if he stays off the couch when told. Give your dog verbal praise if he stops jumping on a guest when instructed. Eventually, your dog should begin to understand appropriate versus inappropriate behavior., Larger dogs who are socialized properly rarely pose a risk for small dogs. When a small dog becomes nervous around a larger breed, you want to correct that problem rather than inadvertently encouraging it by panicking yourself. When walking your small dog, start taking a bag of treats on walks.When you pass a larger dog, feed your dog treats. Talk to him in a soothing voice. Repeat this behavior every time you're passing a larger dog.
Your dog will learn to associate larger dogs with good, happy things rather than danger. This can ease some of the anxiety and aggression associated with small dog syndrome.

, You want to make sure a visit from a friend or family member does not undo your dog's progress. Let other people know the rules for your dog.


Explain basic rules. Inform guests not to let the dog jump on them, and not to let the dog up on the couch uninvited.
Let visitors know that table scraps are not okay for your dog unless they're placed in his bowl.

, A dog trainer can do wonders for a dog suffering from small dog syndrome. Seek out the aid of trainer in your area if your dog's issues are not improving.Go for a trainer that values positive reinforcement over punishing a dog. Punishment-based techniques have proven to be ineffective. Most trainers have a website that overviews their training process.
You can also read reviews of trainers online, or contact past clients. This can help you make sure a trainer's techniques are effective.
When meeting with potential trainers, make sure the trainer is friendly and listens to you. You do not want to hire a trainer who disregards client's concerns.

If one or both of your dogs are not leash-trained, walking them together will be very difficult. To start, leash train your dogs together. Make sure you have the right types of leashes and colors for effective training.


When it comes to leashes, make sure you get two leashes of the same material. Leashes made from similar material are less likely to tangle. Leashes made from nylon, leather, and rope tend to work best for walking two dogs at once. Chain leashes or retractable leashes tangle easily when used together, so these are better avoided.When it comes to collars, you can use your dog's regular collar. However, if one or both of your dogs is new to leash training, consider a gentle leader. This fits over a dog's snout, preventing strain on the neck from pulling and allowing you more control as an owner. A walk harness may also work.;
, If you want your dog to be well-behaved during his walk, make sure he behaves beforehand. If you allow your dog to jump, bark, or otherwise misbehave prior to walking, this sets the tone for poor behavior. You want to work on training your dog to behave before and during his walk.Dogs often act out to get a response from you of any kind. If your dog gets excited before a walk, and begins jumping and whimpering, ignore it. Do not scold your dog, as this is the attention he's craving.
Stand completely still. Wait until your dog is standing with four paws on the ground before clipping on the leash. If your dog starts jumping and acting excited as you lean down to put the leash on, stand back up again completely. Once again, remain still until your dog is calm. Repeat this process as many times as needed. You should not clip your on your dog's leash until he is completely calm.

, When you're first beginning to train, practice loose-leash walking in short sessions. Loose-leash walking is when you hold the leash with some slack. You allow your dog to sniff and explore, but pull the leash gently if your dog is pulling or resisting your direction. When you first start, keep training sessions brief.You can practice a technique called ""red light, green light."" Walk with your dog and, as soon as he pulls, stop in your tracks.
Keep standing still until your dog stops pulling and call him towards you. When he comes, reward him with a treat and praise.
Continue this pattern throughout the walk. This will teach your dog he needs to follow your lead on walks, and obey the direction and signals from his leash and collar.

, Treats can also help with leash training. The use of a treat can teach a dog to walk near you rather than pulling on the edge of the leash. To start, have several treats in your hand when you begin the walk. You should also have extra treats in your pocket, bag, or purse.Hold the hand with the treats in front of your dog's nose, about one inch away. Start walking. Every few seconds, praise your dog for walking near you and give him a treat. When you run out of treats, pull more out of your bag or pocket. Increase the distance you go each day.
After a week, stop using treats as a lure. Just keep your hand at your dog's side, with some treats in your pocket. Reward your dog every once in awhile with a treat, but not as often as you were before. Gradually, decrease the amount of treats per walk. Eventually, your dog should walk at your side without expecting a treat as a reward.

, Remember, dogs respond to positive and negative reinforcement. When your dog behaves, reward in the immediate moment with treats and praise. When your dog misbehaves, simply ignore the behavior until it stops.


Make sure to reward good behaviors the moment they occur. Dogs live in the immediate moment. They need to be rewarded right away to understand why they're receiving praise.

, If you want to walk your dogs together, make sure they get along first. If you've had both dogs for awhile, you may already know how well they get along. If your dogs are generally friendly with one another, they'll probably adapt well to walking together. If one dog is new, however, you may want to wait a bit before attempting to walk them together. They may need time to get used to another before they can be good walking companions.You should also make sure your dogs are friendly with other dogs. If your dogs sometimes get territorial on their own during walks, they may develop a pack mentality when walking together. This can result in a lot of aggression. If one or both of your dogs tends to be territorial, keep in mind you'll have to quickly correct any aggressive behavior during the walk.

, If your dogs have never walked together before, it's a good idea to start out walking the dogs with another person. You can walk one dog, and a friend or family member can walk the other. You can walk side-by-side, keeping the dogs parallel. Do a few brief training sessions, in calm areas, with another person to walk one dog.If your dogs are already friendly with each other, this may not be necessary. If one dog is relatively new to the home, however, this step can really help your dogs get used to one another while walking.

, There is no strict right or wrong answer when it comes to holding two leashes during a walk. A lot depends on the size of your dogs, and your sense of control. Some people feel like they have adequate control holding the leashes in a single hand. However, with bigger and stronger dogs, you may feel better holding one leash in either hand.If one dog is bigger or stronger, you may want to hold his leash in your dominant hand.

, Once your dogs are comfortable walking side-by-side, you can start walking them together. However, you should start slow. Have brief training sessions in areas free of outside distractions.Choose a calm area free of distractions. You can practice walking your dogs in your backyard, for example, or a portion of your neighborhood that is usually free of traffic and people.
Keep sessions brief. Short walks are best at first, as it will take time for both you and your dogs to get used to walking as a group. If one dog gets antsy or distracted, you may want to end the training session and do a quick practice session with the problem dog. He may need a quick refresher about basic leash manners.

, As with leash training dogs alone, you'll gradually work your way up. Once your dogs are behaving well in a calm area, practice walking them on busier streets. Gradually increase the duration of walks. Over the course of a few weeks, experiment with different areas and walk your dogs a little longer each day. Eventually, they'll learn to cooperate together on a variety of types of walks., Dogs may sometimes get competitive with one another during walking sessions. They may fight with one another to sniff a certain spot first, for example. Work to correct these behaviors as they occur to get your dogs to work well together during walks.You can correct problem behaviors as you would correct them when walking one dog. As soon as one or both dogs misbehave, stop dead in your tracks. Do not move until both dogs calm down.

, If you have a new dog in your home, gradually introduce him to other pets. You should do this well before you attempt to walk your dogs together. Dogs are territorial by nature, and need time to adjust to a new family member.Keep the dogs separated at first. Allow the new dog free range of the house for only 15 to 20 minutes several times a day, at first. Allow the old dog to explore the house after the new dog is put away. This will let both dogs get used to one another's scent.
The first face-to-face meeting should occur outside of the home. This will minimize potential aggression over territory. Keep both dogs on a leash and allow them to sniff one another and gradually make introductions.

, Not all dogs are going to walk well together, even if you strictly follow a training regimen. Some dogs are simply a poorly suited match, and should not be walked together.Dogs should be around the same energy level and age. An elderly dog is not going to be able to keep up pace with a young, rambunctious puppy.
You should also keep size in mind. Physically, a toy poodle is not going to be able to keep pace with a Great Dane.

, You don't want to walk with dogs if they're getting aggressive with one another. If you notice any negative body language during training, this is a sign your dog is stressed and agitated. You should cease training for the day and try again when your dog is calm.Keep a close eye on both dogs' faces. An agitated or aggressive dog may have rounder eyes, dilated pupils, and may be showing a lot of the whites of his eyes. You also may notice his mouth is closed with lips wrinkled slightly. This is a sign of agitation. If your dog starts wrinkling his muzzle, this is a sign of aggression and you should separate the dogs.
Pay attention to the rest of the body. A tail that's between the legs or held up without movement could indicate fear or aggression. If your dog is upset, his hair may rise along his back. He may also tremble or crouch when scared. When aggressive, a dog will try to make himself look big by standing with his head raised above the shoulders.

Praise your dog when they come inside.,
Make your home a comfortable place.,
Spend time with your dog outside.",How to Get Your Dog to Come Inside the House2," You want your dog to be happy to come inside. To do this, you need to give positive reinforcement when they come inside. Give praise, pets, or a treat to let them know that they have done well. This also helps them see inside the house as something good and happy instead of scary or punishing.For example, when the dog enters the house, pet them and tell them, “Good dog!” in a happy voice.

, Your dog may not want to come inside the house if they do not feel comfortable there. You want to make sure that your dog has a place to sleep, toys, and things to do. Feed them inside, spend time with them, and make them part of your family. This will encourage them to want to be inside and think of it as a happy place.You should also make the house a comfortable temperature, make sure there aren’t loud noises that would scare the dog, and give your dog somewhere for them to go if there is too much noise or activity in a room.

, Don’t just always put your dog outside and leave them alone. Instead, spend some time with your dog when they are outside. Walk with them, chase them around the yard, play games with them, or play with toys. If your dog runs off, give them a treat and praise when they return to you.This helps your dog bond with you and want to be around you. Your dog will start to associate being called with getting a treat.

"
"
Teach your dog the come command.,
Avoid calling your dog to you for punishment.,
Avoid being physically aggressive with your dog.",How to Get Your Dog to Come Inside the House3," Another way to help your dog come inside is to train them to come when called. Place them on a long rope lead, long enough that they can run around and play. Start by making it into a game by getting your dog to chase you while saying, “Come!” Give the dog a treat, enthusiastic praise, and a special toy when they come to you. Start when the dog is close to you and expand the distance between you as they learn.Start moving towards the house as you call them. Wait to call them inside until after they learn to come to you while out in the yard.
If the dog doesn’t comply with your command, gently pull them towards you. Don’t punish the dog, yell at them, or hit them. Just pull them to you enough to nudge them towards you.
This helps the dog learn how that coming when you call them results in happy things, like treats or praise.

, You should make your dog associate coming to you with positive experiences, like getting pets, praise, a toy, or a treat. If you call your dog to you to punish them or do something unwanted like a bath or nail trimming, you are giving your dog a negative association with coming to you.For example, never call the dog to you in an angry voice.
After calling your dog to you, don’t hit them, punish them, or do something unpleasant.

, Sometimes, you may be so frustrated with your dog that you want to drag them inside by their collar. This is a negative response which will make your dog fearful of you and being inside the house. You want to avoid making your dog scared of the house.Don’t yell at your dog when they come inside the house. This will make them associate coming into the house with punishment.

Take one dog for the loose leash walk at a time.,
Practice loosening the leash and tightening it for each dog.,
Repeat the loose and tight leash walking technique.,
Use the loose leash technique in other locations.,
Reward your dog during and after the walk.",How to Walk Two Dogs1," You want to train each dog to obey the leash pull signal first before getting them together.Remember to carry necessary supplies with you as you would for any dog walk such as the leash, water, poop scoop, and disposal bag.
Typically, you should walk up front with your dog. This won't be as easy when walking two dogs at once, but will be better for the training phase.
Think about using a shorter leash during this phase if you need more handling control of each dog.
Allow for 30 minutes to one hour for the walk.;
, You want to do this for one dog at a time.As you proceed with the walk, if the dog shows signs of pulling, you need to stop walking.
Resume the walk when the leash goes slack again.

, If you keep doing this during the session then the dog should learn that it can only move when the leash is loose.Make sure anyone who walks the dog knows to use this technique so the lesson is reinforced.

, This training method should be used even in situations other than the daily walk--whenever the leash is on.This will allow both dogs to continually absorb the lesson and get comfortable with walking calmly with the leash without pulling.

, This is positive reinforcement to the leash lesson, but should not be excessively long in duration.Allow the dog to relieve themselves, and sniff in safe areas during the walk. But don't let this go on too long.
Set a meal and water for the dog as a reward when returning home.

"
"
Use one word for recall.,
Change the recall word if necessary.,
Involve friends and family.,
Never punish during training.",How to Enhance Your Dog's Recall2," The key to enhancing your dog’s recall is to get them to form a strong association between the recall word and obeying the command. If you use multiple words, your dog will get confused and won’t form a strong association.Choose simple words like “come,” or “over here.”

, If the word you currently use to recall your dog doesn’t work, choose a different word. It’s much harder to retrain your dog to respond differently to a word than it is to teach them a new word.Be consistent in your use of the words. Make it your mantra that when you recall your dog you always use the same words.
Additionally, encourage your family members to use the same recall word you do.

, Say to your friends and family, “I am enhancing my dog’s recall. Would you like to help me?” Invite them to join you in a recall enhancement session. For instance, get a few friends or family members together and form a circle around your dog. Give each friend or family member a treat. Take turns asking your dog to come. When the dog goes to the right person, the person who commanded it to come can give it verbal praise and a treat.Remind your family and friends to use the same recall word you do.
Insist that any children in your household do not play chasing games with your dog. Dogs who develop a taste for evasion will be difficult to train for recall.

, If you get angry at your dog or attempt to punish it during training, it will immediately lose positive associations with the recall word. Do not get frustrated when your dog doesn’t respond the way you want it to. Instead, focus on rewarding compliance.If your dog is not responding to a recall command, change the wording. Once your dog has consistently not responded to a particular command, they will not be able to form a strong positive association with obeying that command.
If your dog fails to respond to a command for a long time, but finally comes, you should still reward your dog. Do not grab your dog by the collar or say “bad dog.” This will make the dog think that obeying your command will get them negative attention and they will learn to avoid you when you recall.

"
"
Reward compliance.,
Use a variety of rewards.,
Reward your dog before it arrives.",How to Enhance Your Dog's Recall3," Teach your dog that responding to your commands will earn it positive attention. The positive attention must be enough to overcome whatever else was occupying its attention at the time. Thus, choose a reward that will make your dog happy and excited every time it receives it.For positive attention, when your dog responds to your command, say “Good dog” and rub its head and belly.Keep in mind that many dogs don’t enjoy being hugged or roughly patted on the head.
You could also reward your dog with a treat. Use a doggie biscuit or jerky. You could even give your dog a human snack that it likes, like cheese, chicken breast, or a bit of hot dog. However, do not give your dog chocolate, avocado, candy or any artificially sweetened foods, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, peaches, plums, or persimmons.If your dog is not very food-motivated, consider using a favorite toy as a reward. When your dog responds to your command, you can reward him with a quick throw of a ball or game of tug.
Another way to reward your dog is by making the release a reward. In other words, when your dog successfully completes a round of recall training, let it run about in an enclosed yard or park without a leash on.

, Dogs will get bored if they are given the same reward every time they successfully complete recall training. Vary the rewards you give your dog to maintain its interest.For instance, if your dog comes to you when called, use verbal praise to reward it. Then, the next time it comes to you, give it a doggie treat.

, After you call out to your dog with your recall word, it should turn its head to acknowledge it heard you. When it does this, give it a verbal affirmation that you did indeed issue the recall command and expect that it will return to your side. For instance, you might say, “Come on.” As your dog continues to trot back toward you, continue to lavish it with verbal praise such as, “Good dog” or “Yes, come on back.”Use a friendly and approving tone when verbally rewarding your dog before it arrives.
If your dog is clicker-trained, you can click your clicker a few times instead of (or in addition to) offering verbal praise before it arrives.

"
"
Start with short distances.,
Increase the distance incrementally.,
Stop when your dog loses interest.",How to Enhance Your Dog's Recall4," Recall needs to be taught with baby steps. Starting out at five or ten feet gives your dog the opportunity to see exactly what you’re asking them to do to. If you start too far away, your dog won’t understand what your recall words mean.Base the starting distance on how your dog responds. If you start at ten feet and your dog doesn’t obey, move forward to five feet and try again.

, Once your dog understand that your recall command means they should come to you, you can slowly increase the distance. Again, use baby steps. If you started out with five feet, move back ten feet, and only increase the distance again when your dog consistently obeys., Your goal should be to get your dog to obey your command throughout the training session. If your dog stops obeying the command and you keep repeating it anyway, they will lose the positive association. Follow your dog’s lead. The moment it loses interest, stop the session and try again later.Fifteen minutes is a good length for a session. If your dog can’t make it that long, stop early. Otherwise stop at the fifteen minute mark.
Wait at least a few hours before starting up a new session.

"
"
Use a clicker, word, and treat to mark the heel position.,
Get your dog to catch up to you and heel.,
Add the word ""heel."",
Use a release word.,
Vary the time between the heel and release commands.",How to Walk Two Dogs2," The heel position is when the dog's shoulder is lined up with your legs. The clicker is optional, but using that or a simple word will help in the reward phase.Clickers can be found in most pet stores.
You want to get in the habit of rewarding the correct position frequently so the dog remembers it.
Deliver the treat near your leg in the area you want the dog to walk.

, During a leash walking exercise, if your dog walks out ahead, try turning around quickly and getting the pet's attention.Do something such as calling the dog's name and moving in the opposite direction to get the dog to follow you.
When the dog catches up, and assumes the heel position, use the sound and treat reward technique.

, Once the dog is reliably walking by your leg into position then you can add the command word.Do this in low distraction areas at first.
You might want to try this in your home before attempting it on a walk outside.
Remember to reward the correct behavior and position with the clicker/word and treat.

, This should be a simple command like ""free dog"" that lets the pet know he can walk again.Work this into the training of the heel command.
Don't allow this to ruin the leash control you have over the pet.

, Do this during the heel training of each dog.This will teach the dog to respond to the command and not just expect a routine.
Remember to use the reward techniques for correct behavior.

House your dogs separately, as a temporary measure.,
Assert your dominance, one dog at a time.,
Train your dog with verbal commands.,
Set boundaries.,
Communicate with your pack as a whole.,
Integrate each dog into the pack one at a time.,
Observe how the dogs interact with each other.,
Reward your pack for good behavior.,
Establish a hierarchy in your pack.,
Observe your dogs as a pack.,
Target the specific problem that undermines your calm and submissive pack.,
Retrain individual dogs, if one or more are not calm and/or submissive.,
Reprimand individual dogs, not the pack.",How to Train a Dog Pack to Be Calm and Submissive," Before you even begin training your dogs, you’re going to have to adopt them. However, when you adopt them, make sure to house them separately. This way, you'll be able to train them and incorporate them into your pack individually.


The best way is to adopt one dog at a time.
Make sure each dog gets love and attention while they are isolated from each other.
Make sure the period of isolation is not too long. Isolation should not occur for more than a couple weeks at the very most.
Never conduct total isolation. While you may be isolating your dog from other dogs, do not isolate him or her from people.;
, The first step in training a calm and submissive pack is to begin one dog at a time and assert your dominance as pack leader. Beginning with one dog will enable you to master your relationship with that dog and to build a relationship in which you are the dominant party.


Always talk to your dog in a commanding tone.
Always keep calm (but be assertive) when you are training individual dogs.
Always have direct eye contact with your dogs.
Stand tall over your dogs.
Avoid trying to train multiple dogs at one time, since they might try to establish themselves as pack leader or build a hierarchy that undermines your position., During and after you’ve established dominance, you need to begin to train your dogs with verbal commands. Verbal commands are an extremely important tool in your arsenal of creating a calm and submissive pack.


Master commands such as “sit,” “down,” and “no.”
Move on to more complex commands such as “roll over”,” “run,” and “play dead.”
Make sure your dog can understand verbal rewards and positive reinforcement such as “good boy” or “good girl.”, After you’ve begun building a relationship with an individual dog based on you being the pack leader, you should quickly begin to set boundaries. Setting boundaries will help create a calm and submissive pack.


Perhaps the most important boundary is the way you act. If you act calm and are assertive, your dog and your larger pack should be calm and submissive. They should emulate the way you behave.
One important boundary is that you should always lead and/or walk first. Your dog should never go in front of you.
As pack leader, the space around your pack is yours, not that of any individual dog.
Make sure your dogs respect your personal space, too. Jumping up on you, sitting on you, or getting in your face are signs that they do not recognize you as pack leader and do not recognize the boundaries you are trying to establish.
Your dogs need to be able to read your body language in addition to understanding your verbal commands. They should be able to understand if you are unhappy that they are violating the boundaries you have established., Communication is key in creating a calm and submissive pack. As a result, you need to be able to master the art of communication with individual dogs and the pack as a whole. Make sure to:


Teach your dogs a wide array of verbal commands that they can take. Make sure they obey commands as ""sit"" or ""stay"" as a pack.
Know how to signal to your dogs non-verbally.
Listen and watch your dogs. Often, your dogs will communicate with you both verbally and nonverbally as well. Looking for their communication is almost as important as your way of communicating with them., Once you’ve trained each dog individually, you need to start integrating the individuals into your pack. As pack leader, you are the core of the pack. Making sure you integrate one dog at a time is a sure fire way to maintain your dominance.


Integration should be a positive and calm event. Dogs should not freak out or growl at each other. If you’ve done your job and have established yourself as pack leader, it should go without a hitch.
Once each dog has been trained individually, progress to training two dogs together as a pack.
Once this has been mastered, continue adding dogs to training sessions until all are calm and submissive together.
If you have any potentially problematic dogs, integrate them last. You don’t want them setting the tone for the entire group.

, A very important part of training and maintaining a calm and submissive dog pack is knowing your pack. If you don’t know your pack and the specific personalities of each dog, you won’t be able to manage your pack and exert your dominance as alpha.


Observe your pack and see how they interact. You could write this in a list, too: Sawyer see another dog, begins to get aggressive; Huck then jumps the fence; Bella barks continuously.
Situations can escalate because each dog prompts bad behaviors in the others.
Spend time with each dog individually to get an idea of each dog’s personality.
Think about your dogs not just as a pack, but as individuals within a group. , Rewarding good behavior is essential in creating a calm and submissive pack. If you don’t reward your pack, then your dogs will be confused about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. They also won’t try as hard to please you, as alpha.


Reward your dogs with treats and food.
Reward your dogs verbally. Say things like “good boy” or “good girl.”
Reward your dogs physically. After your dogs do something good, tell them they are “good” and then pet them or pat them.
Positive reinforcement is much more effective than negative reinforcement., After you’ve asserted your dominance and established yourself as alpha, you should begin to create a hierarchy in your pack. Use your dominance to create hierarchy. A hierarchy will help you maintain a calm and submissive pack.


Establishing hierarchy does not involve specific training, but results from the way you treat your dogs and from natural dynamics within the pack.
Feeding dogs in order is a good way to establish hierarchy.
Allow your lead dog to walk first or ahead of other dogs.
Praise your lead dog first.
Make sure that the dogs you pick to be higher in the pack are the dogs that respect your authority the most and are very good at taking commands and following your example., The best way to troubleshoot issues is to spend some time observing the pack interact and taking direction from you. After you’ve observed your dogs for a while, you’ll have a good idea of problems and what needs to be done to improve your pack and make it more submissive and calm.


Notice first what ""problems"" each specific dog has and make a written list with the worst problem at the top of the list.
The list might say Sawyer is aggressive towards other dogs, Huck jumps fences, Bella barks all the time, and so on.
If you notice that the pack has problems that stem from how the dogs interact with each other, the issue may be that you’re not exerting yourself as alpha well enough. Spend more time working with each dog and asserting your dominance., Pick the problem that begins the situation and address it first. Targeting a specific problem instead of targeting a specific dog or the pack in general is usually the best way to trouble shoot problems in a pack.


If the problem is an individual dog’s actions, target that dog for retraining. So, if Sawyer is aggressive towards other dogs and that is what creates a pack situation, start by training him not to be aggressive through one-on-one training.
If the problem is the way two dogs interact, work with each dog individually, then work with them as a team.
If one problem is potentially dangerous to another human or animal, always address it first., If one of your dog still tries to exert its role as alpha after you’ve integrated him or her into the pack, you need to remove and retrain that dog. This way, when you are successful in retraining the dog, he or she can be reintegrated into the group.


Remove the dog and devote time to training the problem dog.
Focus on setting boundaries that your dog respects. If your dog respects your boundaries, your dog will respect your role as alpha.
Your goal will be to assert your dominance., When an individual dog does something wrong or behaves poorly, reprimand that individual dog. If you reprimand the pack, the dogs who are behaving appropriately may be confused about what they did wrong. As a result, always work with the problem dog to correct his or her behavior.


Make sure to deal with problems quickly when they happen. In most cases, dogs have short memories. Issues need to be dealt with quickly.
Reprimand verbally with commands like ""no"" or ""bad.""
Never strike your dog.
Use your hands, but not with anger. Use your hands and body to instruct the dog, not to punish him or her. For example, use your hands to guide your dogs in a certain action or direction. But remember, always move your hands slowly."

The trainer squishes the smelly food treat into the space between the second and third fingers down near the palm of their hand.,
Standing sideways with the target hand nearest the dog, the trainer waits for the dog to sniff her hand.,
Then the food reward is removed from the hand and you begin again.,
The next step involves having the dog transfer the target to an object.,
Your shy dog should be confident enough about what he gets for targeting that you can try making a ""new"" person target.,
Now the stranger has NO treat in her hand.,
Be sure to take your targeting outside.",How to Help a Shy Dog Blossom Using Targeting and Clicker Training,";
, When he sniffs, he gets a click or ""Yes"" and then can lick out the treat from between the fingers or she can just open her fingers and let the treat fall to the ground. This step is repeated 10-15 times.

, When the dog sniffs/touches your hand, he is clicked and treated BUT now the treat comes from the other non-target hand. If the dog is confidently reaching out to touch your hand, then start moving the hand a little so his nose has to follow it before the click/treat. This step is repeated until the dog can follow your hand around the building in all directions. Before moving to #4 the dog should be able to ""touch"" repeatedly before the click/treat. The ""touch"" to your hand should be a nice strong push, not just a soft touch.

, A chair works great for this step. For some dogs you may need to help them at first by going back to putting a treat between your fingers. Rub the treat on the surface of the chair and lead the dog's nose to chair with your smelly target hand. Click when his nose touches the chair. When the dog gets the idea of touching the new object with his nose you can begin to work on sending him from greater and greater distances. Once the dog becomes ""hooked"" on touching his nose to the target it's time to take it on the road.

, This stranger needs to be careful not to make any eye contact and to be relaxed, sideways to the dog, and maybe even to yawn! Have the stranger sit in the chair with its hand down by one side with the palm outwards. The yummy treat is squished between two fingers, but is easy for the dog to lick out. Don't click when the dog takes a treat. Just let him make his own approach, replace each treat until he has taken a treat from the stranger 10 times.

, You should be standing still just looking and calmly talking to the stranger. Wait for the dog to ""touch"" the stranger's now empty palm. Click/treat for the touch. As soon as the dog finishes his treat, ask for ""touch"". If the dog goes to the stranger's palm, click and a big jackpot would be well deserved. Build on targeting stranger's hands - changing posture, location, gender, etc. Targeting a hand make contacting strangers a comfortable behavior providing us with a positive way to reward social interaction.

, Start someplace safe, then go on walks. Have other volunteers come up and have your dog target their hand. Remember, when you're first training in a new environment you may need to go back to the first step for a while until your dog can perform the behavior reliably. Never be afraid to back up! Fearful dogs have a much harder time becoming operant. Much of the environment is aversive to them which is why developing a reward for touching through targeting the hand gives you a way to move them around the environment and feel safe and reinforced. Don't expect too much too soon.

Practice loose leash and heel techniques with both dogs.,
Use loose leash techniques for most of the walk.,
Mix in loose leash, heel, and relaxation with the walk.,
Reward good behavior.,
Prepare a meal for both dogs when the walk is over.",How to Walk Two Dogs3," Do this in low-distraction areas.If one or both dogs appear distracted you should try more practice with them individually.
You can also try having a second walker more gradually introduce the second dog by walking the other pet in parallel on their own leash. Gradually bring the dogs closer until only one person is holding both leashes.

, This is usually fine once both dogs are trained.With loose leash techniques the dogs can sniff and explore a bit.
Use heel commands to avoid major distractions such as another dog or traffic.

, Continue to use the loose leash and heel techniques until the dogs become accustomed to it. But don't forget to rest them and let the pets enjoy the walk.Find shady spots, dog welcoming parks, water spots, and the like where your dogs can rest and explore under your supervision.
With two dogs under your care it will take more effort to watch that they don't get into trouble with other animals or people.
You will need to take extra care watching that the two of them don't tear up the landscape such as digging holes, tearing through fences, or jumping in public water features.

, Keep water and treats with you for both dogs.Water is necessary for the walk, but also keep some treats with you to reward the dogs for good leash behavior and obeying commands.
Make sure you're rewarding both dogs equally.

, When returning home you want to reward the dogs for a good effort.Have enough food and water for both pets in separate bowls for each.
Even though the bowls are separate you can have the eating area in the same room.
This is also a good time to give the dogs a break from the leash.

Begin by having the clicker and your canine's favorite treats handy.,
Get your canine used to what a clicker entails.,
When your canine understands what the click sound entails for them, instruct them to do a command.,
Immediately after your dog has completed the command successfully, you first sound the clicker, then reward with a treat!,
Once your canine has mastered the command, beginning rewarding them with no treats, only a simple ""good boy/girl.""",How to Clicker Train a Puppy," (Try using something besides their daily kibble.);
, To begin, make sure your canine is calm and not excited. When you have their full attention, sound the clicker and immediately give them a treat. Repeat this several times, until your canine understands that ""click"" simply means ""treat""!

, Be patient, as they may still be focused on the treats! Repeat the one-word command as many times as possible until your canine performs it.

, It is not necessary to hug and kiss and overjoy them! In fact, too much praise can lead to misbehavior.

, When they have continued to do good, take the clicker away from the equation as well. By this point, your canine will do as you ask, and your praise will be enough, eliminating the need for the clicker or treats. This will also allow new commands to be more exciting for them, as they will begin getting treats again!

Click when your dog is in the act of good behavior.,
Use the clicker at each small step of a new behavior.,
Use a food lure.,
Add a verbal cue.",How to Clicker Train Your Dog," A clicker, which is available at your local pet store, is a small, handheld plastic device with a button or small metal tongue that you press down on to make a clicking noise. The key to using a clicker is to use it at the exact moment that your dog performs the expected behavior. The sound of a click should always be followed by some type of reward (eg, food, toys, verbal praise).Keep in mind that the clicker is the signal that a reward is coming, rather than being the reward itself.
With the clicker, your dog will learn two main things–the exact moment that he is doing the right thing, and that a treat always comes after the click.
The clicker can be a much more precise method than verbal cues (""good"" or ""thanks"") to communicate with your dog during a training session. This can help speed up the pace of training.You could think of the clicker like the winning buzzer on a game show–the noise signals the exact moment that the correct behavior or action is being performed.;
, Before you can use the clicker for training purposes, you will need to teach your dog what the clicker means to him. This is known as “charging” the clicker.While you are in the room with your dog (any quiet room will do), hold a treat in one hand and the clicker in the other. Press down on the clicker once. When your dog turns to you at the sound of the click, immediately give him the treat.


You will need at least a handful of treats, since you will be practicing this over and over.
Repeat this several times. Vary the amount of time that you hold the treat in your hand before using the clicker so that your dog does not begin to expect when the treat will come.
If your dog wants to sniff and try to get at the treat, keep your hand closed and wait until he loses interest in the treat before using the clicker.

, Some dogs may be sensitive to the sound of the clicker. If your dog runs away when he hears the clicker, the sound is probably a little too harsh for him. To soften the sound, you could wrap a towel around the clicker. You could also use a different clicking device, such as a ballpoint pen, that would have a quieter clicking sound.


If he continues to run away from the clicking noise, you will probably need to rely more on verbal cues to train him.

, Once your dog has learned what to expect with the sound of the clicker, you can use it to train him to do different commands (e.g., sit, down, stay). It would be best to train him in quiet location without other people or distractions around.If you have a fenced in backyard, you could also clicker train him outside.


As your dog becomes more comfortable with clicker training, you can use the clicker in areas that are louder or have more distractions (e.g., room with a TV on, dog park).

, One method of clicker training your dog is called “catching”– you will click as soon as you catch your dog doing a good behavior that he’s already pretty good at doing on his own. For example, if he is in the room with you and decides to lie down to get more comfortable, click as soon as he lies down and immediately throw him a treat. When he gets up to eat the treat, wait until he lies down again and repeat the process.


The “catching” method will only work when your dog already knows how to do the good behavior without being commanded to do so.
The clicker training will reinforce to him that he is doing the right thing, which will encourage him to repeat the good behavior.

, This is called “shaping”– by using the clicker and immediate reward at each small step, you are shaping the new behavior as a whole. For example, if you want to train your dog to go lie down in a specific area, click and reward him as soon as he turns his body in the direction of that area. You can then click and reward him at each small step: beginning to walk to the new spot, arriving at the new spot, starting to lie down, and fully lying down on the floor.


By using the clicker and reward at each small step, you will be providing him with continual positive reinforcement as he is learning the new behavior. He will think that this learning is fun and will likely perform the new behavior with eagerness.
You may need to practice each step of the new behavior over and over again before moving to the next small step.

, For this method, the treat is used to lure your dog into doing the expected behavior. A food lure is commonly used when training a dog to lie down. For this behavior, you would hold the treat right in front of your dog’s nose and slowly move the treat down to the floor. Your dog will follow the treat down. When his elbows hit the floor, immediately click and reward him with the treat.


When you see that your dog consistently responds with the food lure, remove the food lure but continue to hold your hand in front of his nose as if you have a treat. When he lies down, immediately use the clicker and give him a treat.
Eventually, your dog will learn how to lie down by following only your hand signals without the lure of a treat.
The “lure” method can sometimes be quicker than the “shaping” or “catching” methods.

, Adding a verbal cue is helpful regardless of which method of clicker training you have been using to train your dog. You will say the cue first and then wait for your dog to do the desired behavior. As soon as he does the behavior, click and reward him with a treat.


Your verbal cue should be short and direct, such as ""sit"" or ""down."" Sentences, such as ""Be a good boy and stay"" or ""Roll over for mommy"" would be too long.
Make sure that you give the verbal cue before your dog does the behavior so that he knows to listen for your command and then respond to it.
If you have used the “lure” method, give the hand signal after saying the verbal cue.

Consult with a dog trainer or behavior specialist.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Eating Dirt," Eating dirt is a form of pica, or eating things that aren't food. In some cases, pica is caused by a mineral deficiency in your dog's diet or a parasite infestation. In other cases, however, eating dirt may simply be a sign of boredom. This is especially true in puppies and young dogs.A dog may also eat dirt to alleviate intestinal distress caused by eating something he shouldn't have.;
, Were there any recent changes in the dog's diet, level of activity, or environment? Does the dog show any other unusual symptoms or behaviors that might help explain the problem? If you have multiple dogs, are they all eating dirt?


If your dog eats an unusual quantity of dirt, keep a close eye on him in case he did eat something he should not have and is experiencing signs of poisoning.
If multiple dogs in a household are all eating dirt, it could be a sign of a deficiency in their diet.
If multiple dogs are all eating dirt from the same location, however, it could be that there is something delicious in that dirt.

, Eating dirt may be a sign of anemia caused by dietary deficiencies or parasites. If the dog's gums are pale or jaundiced (yellow in color) take him to the vet right away for further diagnosis and treatment., Most commercial dog foods contain enough vitamins and minerals to keep a dog healthy, but some brands contain less minerals than others. Check the label of your dog food and compare it to other brands to make sure it has similar amounts of minerals like iron and calcium. If your dog eats a raw or home-cooked diet, he may not be getting the nutrients he needs. Talk to your vet about mineral supplements in that case.A dog may also eat dirt because he is hungry. If you have cut back on your dog's food because he is overweight, consider a lower-calorie food that keeps him feeling full instead of less of his normal food.

, If you can't figure out the cause of your dog's dirt-eating, or suspect it may be a sign of a more serious problem, bring the dog in for a check-up. During an exam, the vet can check the dog's overall health, order lab work to rule out deficiencies and diseases, and look for signs of parasites.


Some veterinarians may be willing to offer advice over the phone. You can try calling your vet first to talk about the behavior and get some suggestions of things to try.
Check out the dog's feces. If he has diarrhea or produces a greasy stool it might be he isn't digesting his food properly. This can lead to an nutritional imbalance and the dog eats dirt in an attempt to remedy this. This being the case, a vet consultation is essential since the problem needs investigating and a solution found.

, Increase the amount of attention you give your dog, and give him a selection of new and interesting toys to play with. If possible, take your dog on extra walks. A busy, tired dog is less likely to try to entertain himself by eating dirt., If you suspect that your dog food contains insufficient minerals, try a different brand. There are many kinds of dog food available. If you can afford them, premium brands tend to offer better, more easily-digestible ingredients. Be sure to look for a food that addresses any special needs your dog might have (age, size, activity level, medical issues). When in doubt, call your vet for a recommendation.

, Intestinal parasites like roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms can absorb nutrients your dog needs and cause anemia and intestinal distress, both of which can lead to dirt-eating. Visible worms in your dog's feces are a definite sign he is infected, but other symptoms include diarrhea, low appetite, loss of energy, etc. If you suspect worms, you can get dewormer tablets at your local pet store, or from your veterinarian.


Some breeds of dogs (especially Australian shepherds and collies) are sensitive to the ingredients in some dewormers, so it's a good idea to check with your vet first., This is most likely a sign that your dog is interested in eating something in the dirt, and not the dirt itself. But if the behavior bothers you, keep him away from that patch the dirt.

, Walk your dog on a leash, and keep an eye on him while he is in the yard. Discourage your dog verbally when you see him start to eat dirt. Try to distract him or redirect him, and give him praise when he leaves the dirt alone.


If your dog only eats dirt from a specific are of your yard, you can try treating the area with a taste deterrent like cayenne pepper, hot sauce, or a bitter apple spray (available at pet stores). , If your dog eats the dirt from houseplants, remove them from reach, if possible. You can also try spraying them with a taste deterrent.If you see your dog approach the plants, tell him firmly to ""sit."" When he does, reward him with a small treat to reinforce the positive behavior.

, Carry a spray bottle filled with cool, clean water when you go on walks, and keep it nearby when your dog is in the yard. When you see your dog begin to eat dirt, approach him and scold him with a firm ""No!"" Wait one second, and then spray him in the face with a spray bottle.Never use hot water, or add anything to the water that could hurt the dog or sting his eyes.
Never use a spray bottle on a dog that might bite you.

, These devices are triggered remotely so the dog does not associate the punishment with you personally. Popular choices include an air horn, or a citronella collar that can be activated to release an unpleasant smell when remotely triggered.Many dog owners are against using punishments of this nature, whereas others think it is justified if the behavior they are trying to stop could be harmful to the dog. Use your best judgement and do what's right for you and your dog.

, If you are unable to supervise your dog when he is outside and can't get him to stop eating dirt, you may need to keep him indoors while you are away. Make sure to keep all houseplants out of reach, or he may still find a way to get his dirt fix indoors.

, If your dog won't stop eating dirt and exhibits other signs of anxiety, first try adding more entertainment and removing any stressors from his life that you can. If this is not possible or does not help, talk to your vet about the possibility that he needs an anxiety medication., If your vet finds nothing physically wrong with your dog, and none of these at-home remedies are successful, an experienced trainer or animal behavior specialist may be able to help. Ask your vet for a recommendation, or call your local pet store. You can also do a web search for ""animal behavior"" or ""dog training"" in your area."

Make sure it's getting plenty of exercise.,

Use positive reinforcement to encourage calm behavior.",How to Tame Your Dog," One of the best ways to show your dog that you're in charge is simply to make it obey you on a regular basis. Getting it used to following your orders will quickly teach it that you are not to be disrespected. To start, try teaching your dog the most basic, simple commands. When it learns the commands below, you can move on to more complex commands and tricks, which will further reinforce your dominance.


Sit
Stay
Come
Lie down;
, Humans use words to communicate. Because dogs can't do this, they use their bodies instead. Many humans have a hard time recognizing the body language dogs use to show dominance, so they may not put much thought into the way they act around their dog. A good guide to this sort of behavior is available here. A few ways you can show dominance include:Refusing to let your dog walk through doorways before you. Use the ""stay"" command to keep it still until you are on the other side. You can also use baby gates to control its movement in the house until it learns to obey.
Refusing to let your dog pull you when you are out on walks. Pull your dog near you (without whipping it or violently jerking it) and force it to walk at your speed. If it's too strong for you, use a head halter or another control device until it learns to heel.
Refusing to let your dog jump on you or mount you. Ignore it and reward an incompatible behavior (see below).

, Most dog trainers (though not all) now agree that punishing a dog's bad behavior with pain is a bad idea.Besides ethical reasons (many believe this to be cruel), it is thought that this can be confusing and anxiety-inducing for dogs. A more effective idea to discourage shows of dominance in your dog is to reward activities that it can't do at the same time as the display of dominance.


For example, if your dog tries to climb all over you when you come home, first, ignore it, turning your back on it when it jumps on you. Grab a small treat and order your dog to sit. When your dog sits, reward it with the treat and lavish praise, but ignore it as soon as it starts jumping on you again. Repeat this and, over time, it will learn that it gets the most attention when it doesn't try to dominate you.

, Forcing your dog to jump through hoops to get its daily needs met is a good way to establish dominance. Once it knows a few basic commands, have it perform one before each of its daily tasks (like going for a walk, getting fed, getting let out to go to the bathroom, and so on). In addition, try to have it perform each of these tasks at roughly the same time every day. These actions will teach your dog that you are responsible for its basic needs, encouraging it to obey you.

, Once your dog knows this command, you can use it when it is showing dominant behavior or when you notice that it is about to. You can also use it to discourage rudeness. A single, sharp, clear command will get the dog's attention and communicate your message instantly.


See our article on teaching the ""no"" command for step-by-step instructions.

, This is one of the most common causes of bad behavior in dogs. A lack of exercise will leave a dog with lots of excess energy, which it may ""act out"" to expend. If you can't be personally present to ensure that your dog gets enough exercise every day, hire a dog-walking service to ensure that its needs are met.


Most dogs will need at least half an hour of walking per day, but many larger or more energetic breeds will need much more. This site has information on many breeds' exercise needs., Dogs are like people — to avoid restlessness, they need to use their minds in addition to their muscles. If a dog doesn't get regular chances to play and expend a little mental energy, it may start barking or trashing its surroundings. Over time, it may even develop depression or anxiety-like symptoms.


Playtime with other dogs is great for this. Dogs are social animals and enjoy frequent play dates with neighborhood dogs or new friends at the park.
If you can't arrange a date, try giving your dog a new toy to play with. For example, toys that allow you to put a small treat at the center of a durable plastic puzzle can provide a satisfying challenge.

, Often, the aim of a misbehaving dog is simply to get attention from its master. This is especially true if boredom is the root cause of the misbehavior. The dog doesn't care as much about what kind of attention it gets as it does about whether it gets attention or not. For this reason, reacting to bad behavior with yelling, gesticulating, and so on can actually be rewarding the bad behavior. Remember: dogs can't understand your words, so yelling something like ""Why did you chew up my slippers again?!"" will just seem like barking to them.


Instead, punish unruliness with your ignorance as noted above. Dogs that want attention hate to be ignored, so this is a great way to teach them that their behavior is not okay.

, The best way to to stop a dog from misbehaving is to encourage it to do the right thing instead. In this case, the ""right"" behavior is being calm and quiet with all four paws on the floor and without displaying any dominated behavior.When your dog is misbehaving, wait for it to stop and exhibit proper behavior naturally, then give it a treat and praise it. Be consistent with your positive reinforcement and your dog will learn that acting ""polite"" gets the most pleasurable outcome.


Use healthy treats to reward your dog without giving it a huge amount of extra calories. Small vegetables like peas or bits of baby carrots make healthy choices. A tough rawhide treat can also be satisfying for a dog to chew on.If you use meat, use very small pieces without an bones in them to reduce the risk of choking and keep calories low.

Make sure to go outside next to the clothesline with your friend and wait for his or her bad behavior. You can do this at a time that you are hanging up clothes, or just at another time that might be convenient.


If your dog lunges toward an article of clothing, tell him to “sit” or “stay” or “down.” Use whatever command you want.
Practice this over and over again. Use a treat to reward your dog when he or she sits after your command.
Don’t yell. You want your pup to stay calm and relaxed during this process.;
, This might take some time, so just make sure you’ve always got a pocket full of treats when you are around your clothesline with your dog. If your dog makes any movement that suggests he or she is about to take something off the line, tell him or her to “sit” and then provide a reward. , It is possible that your dog is also demonstrating this bad behavior inside under other situations. If your dog likes to steal your clothes inside, too, then this will provide an opportunity to reinforce your obedience training in another environment. The important thing here is to make sure your dog knows it is not acceptable behavior to chew or pick up clothes, shoes, or other objects.


Use your verbal commands inside of the house, too.
Never yell at your dog (out of anger) for stealing an item.
Don’t run after your dog if he or she steals an item like a sock. Wait for your dog to drop it. After your dog drops it, pick the item up and tell your friend “no!”, Part of the issue with your pooch pulling clothes off the line might be that he or she is bored. The best solution to this is to provide alternative entertainment for your buddy to engage in. This way, your buddy will have something fun (that is sanctioned) to engage in instead of ruining your clean clothes.


Buy some squeaker toys for your dog to play with.
Buy interactive games for your dog. There are a variety of interactive toys on the internet that you can buy. Many of these are treat-based and will keep your dog occupied with minimal attention from you.
Play with your dog on a regular basis. Playing with your dog, and providing a positive outlet for nervous or pent up energy will decrease the chances of your dog creating havoc in your backyard or elsewhere., If your efforts with positive training tactics have failed, and your buddy is still messing with your drying clothes, you can take a different approach and provide some negative reinforcement. The first step here will be to buy a spray bottle.


Only use negative reinforcement (and a spray bottle) once positive reinforcement training has failed.
Look for a spray bottle with multiple settings. You want one that can mist and shoot a single stream. Spray bottles used for fixing your hair will usually work.
Make sure your spray bottle has no residual chemicals in it. Wash it thoroughly.
Test the spray bottle. Test the spray bottle a few times on a plant or on your hand. You want to make sure that it’s not too hard and won’t hurt your friend.

, Noisemakers are another good way to provide negative reinforcement when your pup does something you don’t want him or her to do. Making a lot of noise – often times noises that provides displeasure – can and may discourage your dog from doing certain behaviors. Remember, though, your dog has sensitive hearing and you don’t want to make noises that could cause your pooch pain. Consider:


A whistle.
A can filled with pennies or beans.
A jar filled with screws.
Remember that using a noisemaker is different than yelling at your dog. Yelling conveys anger, whereas using a noisemaker is simply a way of modifying your dog's behavior in a deliberate and non-emotional way., After you’ve got your water bottle or noise maker, just sit back in a lawn chair, by the window, or somewhere else and wait for your dog to try to steal clothes off the line. This could be the frustrating part, and you’ve got to have a lot of patience. It might take your dog a good while to decide to cause some mischief!

, When your dog starts tugging the clothes from the line, approach your dog shaking the can or spraying the bottle at him saying ""NO! NO! NO!"" This will ultimately help modify your dog's behavior as he or she will associate the action with getting sprayed or hearing the noise.


Never show anger when spraying your dog or shaking your noisemaker. Negative reinforcement is not about punishment or showing anger, but about behavior modification.
Be fierce or confident and show your dog that you're the boss. This usually helps the dog know that he or she has to listen to you.
Only spray your dog when he or she is very close to or at the clothesline.
Only spray your dog on the body. Avoid the head and eyes at all cost.
Don’t follow your dog as he or she runs away and continue to shake the can or spray the bottle., Keep following up with this training routine. Eventually, after a few attempts, your dog will grow wary of this and will probably stop taking clothes off the line. Remember, though, patience and persistence is key to making sure your dog stops stealing clothes from the clothesline. If you need to repeat training, do so.

, Before you jump to conclusions and blame the family dog on the clothes being torn off the clothesline, make sure you actually identify the culprit and rule out other possibilities. The best way to do this is to spend some time actually watching the clothesline to see what is going on. If you don’t have the time to do this, consider a camera of some sort. Cameras can be purchased online relatively inexpensively these days. You might even be able to monitor the camera from your smartphone. Make sure to consider:


Small children.
Teenagers.
Cats.
Raccoons., The first step in stopping your dog from pulling clothes off of the line is to let your dog watch you hang the clothes. This way, your dog will see what you are doing and that you are hanging them up. The clothes hanging will no longer be a mystery after your friend watches you. This is also a good opportunity to spend quality time with your pooch., Make sure to watch your dog as you are hanging up the clothes and at other times when you are not hanging up clothes. As you are hanging up the clothes, your dog might be fascinated with what you are doing. If you’re not hanging up clothes, your dog might be investigating the newly hung up clothes. Make sure to monitor his or her behavior so you have an idea of exactly what is going on.


If hanging clothes, glance over periodically to see what your dog is doing.
If you’re not hanging clothes, watch your dog carefully from inside a window.
Observation is the best thing in order to gain more information about how to proceed. "

Catch your dog in the act.,
Call it from the area.,
Close the toilet lid.,
Give your dog a fresh bowl of water.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Drinking from the Toilet1," The best way to train your dog to stop doing anything is to catch it in the act. Once you hear your dog slurping from the toilet or you see it drinking out of the toilet, it is your chance to act.Because dogs have short attention spans, it is pointless to reprimand your dog after the fact. You will need to catch your dog in the act in order to correct the behavior.;
, Once you hear or see your dog drinking from the toilet, call it away from the toilet. Make sure you say “no” or “stop” when you catch your dog in the act. This will reinforce the idea that drinking from the toilet is an undesired behavior. Your tone of voice should be serious and calm.You can say, “No, Fido. I do not want you drinking from the toilet. Come here,” or “Stop, Fido. Do not drink from the toilet. Come here.”

, If your dog ceases drinking from the toilet when called and/or reprimanded, close the toilet lid. Make sure your dog sees and hears you closing the toilet lid. Closing the toilet lid will further reinforce the idea that you do not want it drinking from the toilet., After you have reprimanded your dog, redirect its behavior. Bring your dog to the kitchen and give it a fresh bowl of water. Verbally and physically praise your dog for drinking from its water bowl.For example, while petting your dog say, “Good boy (or girl)” in a praising tone.
To further solidify the behavior, reward your dog with a treat for drinking out of its water bowl.

Get help.",How to Discipline Your Puppy," You should start disciplining your puppy as soon as you bring him home. Puppies learn quickly and should be shown what behavior is unacceptable in your house. This also means that you must be consistent when responding to bad behavior. If not, your puppy will be confused, making it harder to prevent the bad behavior.For example, say your puppy barks at the neighbors and you command him to stop. Then, he starts barking at the postal carrier, but you say nothing. Your puppy will be unsure about when he shouldn't bark, making it likely that he'll bark whenever he feels like it.;
, Reward-based training uses discipline to help the puppy understand that he's made a bad choice. Any type of reaction can be a reward in the dog's mind, so often the advice is to completely ignore bad behavior. However, if your dog is exhibiting behavior that's self-rewarding (for example, the dog enjoys chewing shoes) then this doesn't really work. That being the case, a short but sweet guiding command is appropriate. When he exhibits behavior you don't like, simply say ""Not that"" or similar words in a disapproving voice. The aim is not to scold him, but to guide him.

, When your puppy tries to get your attention by barking, jumping up, or nipping at your fingers, it's best to ignore him. Consider what reward your puppy is trying to get when engaging in bad behavior in order to determine when to ignore him. If he's jumping up on you when you come home, he probably wants your attention. Withholding your attention sends the message that he needs to act differently to get your attention. Eventually, your puppy will learn that good behavior earns your attention and affection.For example, if your puppy starts barking at you, turn your back to him and take away any attention. He'll learn that he gets nothing from you when he behaves poorly.

, Get your puppy's attention by making a loud noise. You might try clapping your hands and firmly saying ""no"" when you catch your puppy doing something undesirable, like chewing on your shoe or squatting to urinate on the carpet. The noise and disapproving tone will distract your puppy from the bad behavior. Redirect your puppy's attention on desirable behavior.For example, if your dog was urinating inappropriately, pick up your puppy and immediately take him outside to the appropriate toilet spot.

, If your puppy is engaged in bad behavior, remove him from whatever is causing the behavior and place him in a different environment. You might put him in a quiet room in the house away from distractions or outside in the yard. Leave him in time-out for 10 to 30 seconds, then remove him and act as though nothing happened, if your dog has stopped the bad behavior (like barking). If your puppy hasn't stopped, wait until he does.Respond immediately and consistently to the bad behavior. As soon as you see your puppy acting up, remove him to the time-out spot. Be sure to do this every time you notice the bad behavior.

, Ignore your puppy's barking. If he's just trying to get your attention, he should soon stop. But, if he continues barking despite your inattention, figure out why he's barking and remove it. For example, if your dog is barking at the traffic out the window, pull the blinds. If the behavior continues, remove your dog to another room for a few minutes.You can also try to quiet him by giving him something to chew like a rope toy.

, Puppies are naturally playful and have to learn limits when it comes to playing rough. As soon as your puppy nips, say ""ouch"" and yelp. Ignore him for up to 20 seconds after he lets go of your hand. This will teach your dog that you won't tolerate rough play.Avoid pulling your hand away when your puppy nips. Your puppy will see this as part of the game and will continue to chase you.

, Studies have shown that physically punishing your puppy (like hitting, kicking, growling, or staring down) actually increases aggression in your puppy.You should never use physical punishment to correct undesirable puppy behavior.


Physical punishment could injure your puppy and ruin your relationship., Puppies are very social creatures. They want your attention and affection, whether it's simply a glance, talking to them in a fun, upbeat voice, giving them a special toy, rubbing and petting them, or giving a delicious treat. Pay attention to what your puppy best responds to. When you notice your puppy showing good behavior, immediately reward the action, so you puppy makes a positive association with the behavior.


Be consistent when you positively reinforce good behavior. Your puppy will quickly learn what behaviors you approve of and which won't get him your much-wanted attention., Puppies like knowing what to expect. Establish a daily routine with set times for meals, toileting, walks, and training sessions. This way, your puppy knows what is coming and what to expect.A routine will help regulate your puppy regulate his behavior. For example, if he knows a walk comes after mealtime, he may save his energy for the outing.

, Your puppy will respect you more and respond to your discipline if you take clear control over him. To do this, give your commands in a stern tone of voice. You may also want to make him follow commands outside of training sessions. For example, make your puppy sit and wait briefly before setting down his food dish.


Give your puppy time to fulfill your command. If it looks like your puppy isn't going to respond to your command, don't back down and give in. You need to show your puppy that he has to listen and obey your commands. Project your authority in a calm and assertive manner., Once you have a routine in place, make sure regular outings to eliminate are included. For example, try taking your puppy out to eliminate first thing in the morning, 15 to 20 minutes after meals, and consistently after naps or play periods. Your puppy will learn to understand when it's appropriate to eliminate, reducing chances of accidents.You may want to start by crate training your puppy if you don't plan on taking him outside to eliminate.

, Teach your puppy a few basic commands (like ""come,"" ""sit,"" ""stay""). This way, when you notice your puppy engaging in bad behavior, you can immediately redirect his attention. For example, if you notice your puppy running up and jumping on someone, you can quickly command him to ""come."" He should stop jumping up on the person and come to you instead.Teaching your puppy a few simple commands can also keep him safe. If he's about to do something dangerous, like run into traffic, you can command him to ""sit"" or ""stay"" so that you can reach him.

, If you've been patient with your puppy, but he still resists training or responding to your discipline, get help. You can ask your veterinarian to recommend a professional trainer or canine behaviorist.


You might want to enroll your dog in an obedience training class taught by a professional. You'll learn helpful tips and your puppy will begin to understand what you expect from the training sessions that you also do at home."

Close the bathroom doors.,
Keep the toilet lid closed.,
Use toilet lid locks.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Drinking from the Toilet2," You may be able to stop your dog’s toilet drinking habit by keeping the doors to the bathroom closed at all times. However, in order for this method to work, all of your family members must be on board.Convene your family members and inform them of the agenda. Let them know why you do not want the dog to drink out of the toilet and what the solution is, i.e., keeping bathroom doors closed at all times.
To help your family members (and guests) remember to close the bathroom door, place a sign on the back of the door.

, Another preventative measure is to keep the toilet lid closed. Tell your family members to close the toilet lid once they are finished using the toilet. Place a sign on the toilet saying, “Please close the lid once you are done,” to help them remember.If you have small children in your family who cannot remember to close the toilet lid or the bathroom door, then you might want to install baby gates in your bathroom’s entry way. This will ensure that your dog will not be able to get to the toilet.

, If your dog is pretty savvy, closing the toilet lid might not prevent it from drinking toilet water. These dogs use their paws or their nose to lift the toilet lid. If this applies to you, then you might want to install a toilet lid lock. These locks will prevent your dog from getting into the toilet bowl.You can find toilet lid locks at your local hardware or home improvement store.

Provide fresh water regularly.,
Place water bowls throughout the house.,
Raise your dog’s water bowl.,
Purchase a different water bowl.",How to Get a Dog to Stop Drinking from the Toilet3," Warm, stagnant water in your dog’s water bowl is a major reason for why dogs resort to toilet water. By providing fresh, cool water throughout the day, you can prevent your dog from drinking toilet water. Your dog’s water bowl should be washed and refreshed at least twice per day.Add ice cubes or frozen blueberries to the water bowl to keep the water cool and fresh.
Try using filtered water instead of regular tap water.
If your dog frequently drinks from the toilet after emptying their water bowl, this may be a sign of a medical condition, such as diabetes or Cushing's Disease. You should take them to the vet for a check up.

, Your dog should always have access to fresh water. Place several water bowls throughout your house. Place a water bowl in the kitchen, laundry room, and one in the bathroom to serve as an alternate to the toilet water.If your dog plays in the back yard regularly, place a water bowl outside as well.

, Some dogs, particularly older dogs, may develop arthritis in their neck or shoulders. This can make it painful to bend over to reach a water bowl that is sitting on the floor. Try placing your dog’s water bowl on a raised platform so that they do not need to bend very far down to reach the water., Another reason why your dog might be drinking toilet water is because it does not like its bowl. If you use a steel or metal bowl, your dog might dislike the noises or reflections produced by these bowls. If you use a plastic bowl, the plastic could be tainting the water’s taste.Opt for a ceramic bowl. Because these bowls are heavy, they do not move around or make noise while your dog is drinking. They are also easier to clean and do not taint the taste of the water like plastic bowls.
Alternatively, you can purchase a pet fountain. These devices provide a constant source of fresh, running water, which is particularly attractive to dogs.

Designate a spot for the puppy to use the bathroom before bringing the puppy home.,
Take your puppy to the potty spot often.,
Show consistency with the schedule.,
Offer plenty of praise.,
Stay patient.",How to Discipline a New Puppy1," House training your puppy to go potty in a spot designated by you is one of the first training lessons a puppy needs to learn. Most people will designate a spot for the puppy to use the bathroom outside. However, you can use this same method whether you’re training the dog to go outside or inside—such as on pads or paper or even in a litter box if the breed is small enough when full grown.;
, You should take your puppy to the potty spot every half an hour (for an eight week old) or every two hours (for an adult that is not house trained). If the puppy does not go within five minutes, then she does not want to go. Bring her inside and try again half an hour later.


Try introducing a phrase such as, “Go potty,” to help the puppy associate the desired behavior with a specific command.You will likely have to get up several times during the night to take puppy out to the designated spot at first. If the puppy starts whining at night, he likely needs to use the bathroom. Take the puppy directly to the correct spot and resist the urge for any playtime. You want to make sure the puppy understands that nighttime bathroom breaks are not playtime.

, To start, you should bring your puppy to the potty spot after all sleeping, eating, and playing activities.The key to helping a puppy catch on initially is to have him coincidentally use the spot when he has to go anyway. Then you can start associating the act with praise.

, You should offer both treats and praise when the puppy goes to the bathroom in the appropriate spot. Though, don’t overdo it on the treats. The positive reinforcement will strengthen the puppy’s understanding of the desired behavior. Make sure you offer the praise as soon as the puppy finishes, so he understands why you have administered the praise. You also want to wait until he finishes so you don’t risk interrupting him, which can lead to an accident shortly after.


Be consistent with your praise as well. Try using the same phrase, such as, “Good boy,” or “Good girl,” to make sure the puppy understands the behavior in that specific spot is a good thing.
Never punish a puppy for an accident. Unless you catch the puppy in the act of urinating or defecating, he will have no idea that what he did was not appropriate. If you do catch the puppy mid-accident, try to get the puppy to the appropriate potty spot and praise him for going there.

, Some puppies will not have full control over their bladders for up to six months of age. Accidents will happen, even after you think you’re making a lot of progress with house training. Remain patient and consistent, and the puppy will eventually have the behavior down completely.

Withhold attention until your dog stops annoying behaviors.,
Avoid “giving in” to pushy dogs.,
Stop activities if your dog misbehaves.,
Be consistent with your dog’s training.,
Replace their undesirable behavior.,
Keep your dog busy.,
Wear your dog out.,
Reward preferred behaviors.,
Ask friends and family for help.,
Educate people who visit your home.,
Take your dog to an obedience course.,
Get a pet sitter.,
Go to the vet.",How to Deal with Your Annoying Dog," It may be difficult, but in many situations, turning a blind eye to your dog’s annoying behaviors may be the key to solving the problem. Of course, if your dog’s annoying behavior is destructive, letting them continue to chew or rip up items is a reward. However, if your dog’s behavior is something like barking, nudging you, dropping a ball in your lap repeatedly, or jumping up on people at the door, the best immediate option may be to ignore the dog’s behavior.For example, if a dog jumps up to greet you, do not pet the dog until it puts both feet on the floor.
If a dog barks to get you to feed them, don’t feed them until after they stop barking.
If your dog drops their ball in your lap repeatedly until you throw it, put the ball away until your dog is calm.;
, When your dog is persistent in trying to get you to take them for a walk, throw a ball, or feed them dinner at a specific time, don’t do what they want until they stop the behavior. Pushy dogs are the way they are because they’re used to getting their way. The only way to stop that behavior is by not giving in. The moment you do what they expect, you reinforce their belief that their pushy behaviors will work., Whether you’re walking to the park with your dog pulling your shoulder out of socket or playing tug of war with a pup that nips your hand, the best response is to stop. In cases like these, the dog will see continued walking or playing as an indication that the behavior is acceptable. If the dog is behaving in an unacceptable way, stop the fun.


Leash pulling is one of the most common annoying habits. People are often surprised to find out that not walking is the easiest way to fix the problem. As soon as your dog starts pulling, stop. Once the dog calms down and returns to your side, start walking again.
Biting, nipping, and mouthing are also behaviors many dog owners struggle with. This typically starts when dogs are puppies and it’s important to start discouraging this at a young age. As soon as the dog bites or nips, let out a high pitched yelp and go limp. This tells the dog they’ve done something that has hurt you, and they will stop., The first time you or someone else rewards your dog’s unacceptable behavior again, all of your hard work will go out that window. Rewards aren’t just things like treats. A reward can be as simple as petting the dog when it jumps up to greet them or throwing the ball that your dog keeps repeatedly dropping it in their lap. Make sure that you are consistent, and work with friends and family to be consistent as well., While getting your dog to stop an annoying habit may be your goal, it’s important to remember your dog has a goal too. They aren’t barking, pushing, bringing you a toy, or engaging in other annoying behaviors for no reason. Figure out what your dog is trying to tell you, and teach them a new and better way to communicate.


A great example is dogs who jump up to greet new guests. Instead of petting the dog and saying hi when it jumps up, ask your guests to wait to pet the dog when he sits down.
If your dog barks to tell you it’s time for dinner, teach them to sit by their bowl, and don’t feed them until they do so. Use a simple command like “bowl.” Say, “bowl,” and if your dog goes to the dinner bowl, give them a treat, pet them, and tell them good job. Rehearse this regularly, and keep practicing until they know that sitting by their bowl is how they get fed., In many cases, annoying behavior is caused by boredom. Give your dog a puzzle toy, take them for a walk, or play a game with them. Dogs, like small children, need a lot of stimulation to avoid getting bored. The more activities you can give your dog to do on a daily basis, the better. Try giving your dog a job.


Give your dog things to carry. Are you weeding the garden? Give your dog a handful of weeds to carry off. Are you brining in groceries? Give your dog a small bag to bring in (even if it’s an empty one).
Make your own puzzle toys. Use old socks and fill the toes with treats. Your dog will have to work to get them out, and this will keep them occupied.
Buy toys that take time for your dog to chew through or that are designed to hide treats that your dog will work to get out., A tired dog is a happy dog. Take them on a long walk. Play fetch. Go on play dates. Visit the local dog park. Do whatever you can to tire your dog out. If you burn off your dog’s excess energy, it will be less likely to engage in high energy and annoying behaviors.Additionally, interacting with your dog more is all dogs expect from many of the most annoying behaviors.
These activities are also great training opportunities. If you want to teach your dog to sit when the doorbell rings, practice the ""sit"" command in the home or park or other areas, so it becomes natural for your pet. Reward learned behaviors during training.
Best of all, you'll be spending more time with your pet!

, This is essential to training your dog. It’s not enough simply to ignore or stop rewarding the annoying behaviors. You have to teach your dog to get what they need from you in a better way. Then, reward them over and over for this preferred behavior.


If you want your dog to stop jumping up on visitors, ask your visitors not to pet them until they sit. Then, give them lots of attention and maybe even treats.
If your dog is pulling on its leash, stop walking, but when your dog is following your directions to stay by you, reward that behavior by picking up the pace a little.
Treats are a great way to reinforce your dog’s preferred behaviors, especially during the training process. Giving the dog the thing his annoying behavior was asking for may be plenty of reward., Building a new habit that your dog will only do when you’re around is not actually going to change the dog’s behavior. Whatever the behavior is, do what you can to make sure the dog will behave consistently with other people by recruiting your friends and family to help.For instance, if the concern you have is with a dog jumping on visitors, ask your partner to answer the door and a friend to stop by. Your dog should respond to your partner’s sit command, and your friend should not pet the dog until it does so.
If you’re working with your dog to be more comfortable while riding in cars, bring a friend or family member along to help you entertain and distract the dog on your trip.

, You should be consistent, and having a new person come over who doesn’t know the rules can quickly undo your hard work training your pup. If you notice your dog engaging in one of the behaviors you’re trying to change and see the friend rewarding the dog with attention, intervene quickly to redirect the behavior, and let your friend know what you’re doing.If jumping up to greet people is the behavior you're changing, say something like, ""Sorry about that. Could you wait to pet him until he sits down? We're trying to train him not to jump up.""
If your friend wants to take the dog for a walk, let them know about pulling in advance. Say something like, ""He's been pulling on his leash, so anytime he pulls, we stop. Can you make sure to do that on your walk?""

, If your dog’s behavior is severe, obsessive, or could cause harm to someone in your household, it may be time to recruit a professional. Dog trainers have years of experience working with animals to change even the most deeply engrained behaviors. Before you take the time and money to put your dog through obedience training, make sure you are committed to continue reinforcing this training in the home., It’s important that your dog is not able to continue the annoying behavior when you’re not at home. If you need to leave your dog at home for long hours, hire a professional pet sitter or ask a friend to watch the dog for you to make sure they’re not engaging in the old behavior when you’re not there.There are a number of online resources available to help you find a trustworthy pet sitter to care for you dog. Care.com has offered help finding babysitters and nannies for years, and now you can even use the site to find people to care for your pets.
If you’ll only be out of the house for a few hours at a time, you may be able to keep your dog in a crate while you’re gone. However, if you’re going to be out of the house for more than four hours, you may need to bring in a sitter.

, If your dog suddenly develops an annoying habit, it may be trying to tell you it’s not well. Dogs can’t speak to you, so their behavior is all they have to indicate what they need. Pay attention to this, and always take your dog to the vet to make sure their “annoying” habit isn’t actually a serious health concern.While you're at the vet, ask for advice on how to improve your pet's behaviors.
Vets are also a great resource if you're interested in finding a pet sitter, dog walker, or obedience course.

Use reward-based training.,
Keep commands short.,
Provide plenty of toys.,
Tap the puppy’s nose when it tries to bite anything other than an appropriate toy.,
Teach the puppy when not to bark.,
Teach your puppy not to jump on people.",How to Discipline a New Puppy2," One key to training puppies properly is to help them learn basic obedience commands. Sit is probably the easiest and most useful command. Reward-based training is one of the best ways to train your dog. In this system, positive reinforcement (usually in the form of a small bite of a tasty treat) is given immediately when the puppy complies with your command. The puppy then learns to associate the action (to sit) with the command (“Sit”) given.


Remember to reward the puppy as soon as he performs the action. Failure to reward immediately will confuse the puppy as to what you expect of him.

, Don’t say, “Now I want you to sit,” as the puppy won’t understand what you expect. Keep all commands short and simple. Simply say, “Sit,” for example. Use treats and praise every time when teaching a new command.


Once the puppy consistently obeys the command, you can give treats intermittently. However, make sure you always stay consistent with the praise every time regardless of treats.
Apply these same principles for other commands, including “Come” and “Stay.” The key is to reward immediately, be consistent, and use simple command words.

, Puppies love to bite and chew. Chewing is a natural behavior for a puppy. However, you must teach the puppy items that are okay to chew versus ones that aren’t okay to chew. To help teach them the correct items to chew on, keep plenty of toys on hand, such as toy ropes. You can purchase these from the dollar store.


Puppies love chewing ropes, and it’s a great way to help them get through the teething stage.
For example, if you find the puppy chewing on a shoe, take the shoe, put it out of reach, and give him a toy to chew on. As you take the shoe away, say, “No chew.” The puppy will eventually understand what he can and cannot chew., When your puppy tries to bite your fingers or hand, tap his nose lightly with your free hand and say, “No bite.” As you pull your hand from your puppy’s mouth, be sure to put a chew toy or rope in their mouth and encourage them to bite the toy instead.

, Some owners enjoy knowing their dog will bark to alert them of guests or other visitors. However, a puppy should learn the command, “Quiet,” for those times when barking is a nuisance. When the puppy begins to bark say, “Quiet.” When the puppy complies (this may take some time), immediately give him a reward in the form of a treat and praise.


This will take some time, but the puppy will eventually understand what you expect. Consistency and patience is the key in making this work for the both of you.

, Jumping on people can also be a problem with some dogs. This is a behavior that can be stopped. If your puppy or dog has a tendency to jump, keep a leash on him to be able to correct him as he starts to jump. Give him the command to sit. Reward him when he promptly responds with a tasty treat. He will soon learn that jumping is not an acceptable behavior."

Decide if crate-training sounds right for your puppy.,
Purchase a kennel before bringing your puppy home.,
Place the crate in an area of the home where you spend a lot of time.,
Introduce the puppy to the crate.,
Feed the puppy meals inside the crate.,
Teach the puppy to stay in the crate for longer periods.,
Do not leave the puppy in the crate for too long.,
Do not use the crate as punishment.",How to Discipline a New Puppy3," Crate training uses a dog's natural instincts as a den animal. A wild dog's den is his home and a place to sleep, hide from danger, and raise a family. A crate allows you to harness these natural instincts while training the puppy.The primary use for a crate is house training. Puppies will avoid soiling their dens for as long as they can manage to hold their bladders.
The crate can also limit access to the rest of the house while the puppy learns other rules, including not to chew on furniture.
Crates are a safe way to transport your dog in the car as well.

, Have your puppy’s kennel situated in the home before bringing the puppy home. The crate needs to be large enough for the puppy to comfortably stand, lay down, and turn around.You also don’t want the crate so large that the puppy can use one side of the crate as a bathroom before laying on the other side. If you buy a larger crate (so the puppy can grow) or if you cannot find a crate small enough for the puppy, partition off the back of the crate initially, enlarging it as the puppy grows.

, You should place the crate in a spot of your home where you spend a lot of time, and the puppy won’t be isolated.You should also place a soft blanket or towel inside.

, Leave the door to the crate open, speak to the puppy in an encouraging voice, and place several treats inside.Your puppy will start instinctually taking to the crate as its new den.

, To continue teaching your puppy that the crate is a safe place, begin feeding him meals near the crate.Gradually move the food into the crate over several days. Once the puppy is comfortable eating meals inside the crate, close the crate door for the duration of mealtime.


Open the door again immediately after the puppy finishes eating initially. Increase the amount of time you take to open the door slowly over several more days and weeks.
If the puppy starts to whine or cry, you may have increased the amount of time in the crate too quickly. Try using a shorter amount of time next time you crate the puppy. You should usually wait until the puppy stops whining before letting him out of the crate as often as possible; otherwise the puppy quickly learns that whining is all it takes to make you let him out of the crate., After the puppy is eating his meals in the crate regularly, start teaching him to stay in there for short periods of time. With a treat in hand, call him over to the crate. Give him a command (usually ""crate"" or “kennel”) to enter by pointing and tossing the treat inside.Praise him when he enters and close the door.


Start with short periods of time (5-10 minutes). Gradually lengthen the time period over a week or so.

, Puppies under six months of age should never be crated for longer than four hours as they cannot hold their bladders that long. You should never lock a dog of any age in a crate for long periods of time.

, Since the crate mimics a den, it should be a pleasant place for the puppy to stay and not used as a punishment.In cases where the dog has separation anxiety or other ingrained behavior issues, it is best to consult a professional before attempting to crate train.

Recognize that chasing birds is normal behavior.,
Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise.,
Decrease your dog’s territorial behavior.,
Discourage your dog from chasing or barking at birds.,
Distract your dog from the birds.",How to Calm a Dog when It Sees Birds1," Like all predatory animals, dogs are stimulated by seeing bursts of motion and creatures—especially prey-sized creatures—running or flying away from them. Your dog may instinctively see the birds as prey, and will consequently bark and chase the birds.You’ll notice that the same instinct kicks into effect when your dog sees other fast-moving or loud animals, including squirrels, rabbits, snakes, and chipmunks.;
, Dogs who display excessive barking or hyperactivity—including when they see birds—may simply need more exercise. A lack of exercise often leads to loud, poorly behaved, and easily distracted dogs. Make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise each day; this may diminish their excitement when seeing birds.Although the amount of exercise your dog needs will vary by breed, puppies should be given multiple, short walks or play-sessions throughout a day, while adult dogs may benefit more from a single, longer and more rigorous walk.
Take time to walk your dog daily (unless you live in an area where your dog can run on its own), and be sure to play with your dog—whether indoors or outdoors—daily also. If your dog is of an especially active breed, consider training your dog to compete in agility, rally, or dog shows., Dogs are naturally territorial creatures, so your dog may bark or act aggressively because it’s afraid that the birds threaten its territory. If your dog is barking to defend its territory, teach it to stop barking after 3 or 4 barks by giving the command “quiet” and then gently holding the dog’s muzzle shut.Once your dog remains quiet, give it a treat, and praise and pet the dog.


Continue this behavioral training until the dog remains calm once you have given the “quiet” command, or until the birds have left the vicinity.
You may also need to restrict your dog’s field of vision when it’s indoors, so that it can’t see out of the windows and feel obliged to protect its “territory.”, You can do this by walking your dog around your backyard, or a nearby park, with a leash on. If there are birds in the area and your dog starts to bark or run after them, simply bring the dog back inside (or back to your car).On the other hand, when your dog is quiet or well behaved around birds, praise the dog and give it a treat or a piece of food to encourage its good behavior.
Eventually, your dog will learn that it receives a reward when it is calm and well behaved around birds, and should change its behavior accordingly.

, If you can capture your dog’s attention and direct it away from the birds, you can help your dog to behave calmly when it is tempted to run or bark. If your dog is barking at nearby birds, instead of dragging it away, simply walk over holding a dog treat—or a piece of meat or hot dog—in your hand. Then, lead your dog away from the birds—this will distract your dog, and it should quiet down.Teach your dog a ""Look"" or ""Watch me"" command to make this easier.


Give the dog the meat once it has quieted down, and praise its good behavior.
If you want to bring your dog indoors (or back to the vehicle if you’re on a walk), you can lead it inside once it’s quieted down. Over time, the dog will learn that its calm behavior is rewarded, and will be less inclined to bark at or chase after birds."

Do not reward the barking by shouting.,
Ignore the barking.,
Distract your dog.,
Redirect to something you can positively reinforce.,
Bring the dog inside if the barking happens outside.,
Provide plenty of exercise.",How to Train Dogs Not to Bark1," Training a dog not to bark early on is much easier than breaking the habit once your dog has developed it. One of the keys to this is to avoid ever reinforcing or rewarding barking in the first place. If your dog barks and you shout for quiet, you are rewarding the barking with attention in your dog’s mind.Your dog may even interpret the shouting as your version of barking in response. By mistaking this for approval, your dog is more likely to repeat the behavior.;
, Instead of shouting at your new dog for quiet, try first ignoring the barking. If the dog never starts associating barking with attention and responses from you, then the dog is less likely to use the behavior., If ignoring the barking doesn’t stop the behavior after several minutes, then try to distract your dog from the behavior. Continue ignoring the barking, but then drop something on the floor, open the pantry, or something else that usually gets your dog’s attention and causes the dog to investigate.

, Once you have distracted your dog from the barking and the dog has approached you to investigate, then use a familiar command to the dog, such as “sit.” Reward the positive behavior immediately, which will reinforce the commanded behavior instead of any barking.This highlights the need for basic training with your dog as well. Distracting your dog with other basic commands that the dog understands is a great way to avoid reinforcing barking by accident.To learn more about teaching your dog commands, check out How to Teach Your Dog Basic Commands.

Clicker training your dog is another great way to help positively reinforce desired behaviors.

, If your new dog’s barking takes place in your yard at passersby, then bring the dog inside in a way that ignores the barking. wait until the dog stops barking at a passer and put his or her leash on. Next time the dog starts barking at another passer, immediately lead the dog inside by the leash. By doing it mid-bark, you teach the dog that barking means the end of having fun out in the yard., Barking is a manner of expression for your dog, and the dog may bark in response to emotional states, especially boredom. Providing plenty of exercise and attention to your dog will help stop the dog from developing a habit to bark in response to boredom.Spend at least two fifteen-minute training sessions with your dog each day, and take your dog out for exercise twice a day to play fetch and run—up to an hour a day for large, energetic breeds.If your dog still seems to bark due to boredom despite being out twice a day to expel some energy, try ramping up the amount of time you spend out for each exercise session.

"
Play a quiet recording of bird sounds for your dog.,
Increase the volume, and eventually take your dog outside.,
Reward your dog’s calm behavior.",How to Calm a Dog when It Sees Birds2," The idea behind this method is that, if your dog hears birdsongs frequently—especially in locations where the dog is otherwise calm—it will be desensitized to the sound of birds and no longer chase or bark at birds outdoors.Find a bird recording online on a site such as YouTube, and play it around the house at a low volume.


If your dog is initially excited and tries to “find” or “chase” the bird, play the recording at a lower level.
At this point, your dog will start to acclimate to the soft birdsong and will stay calm while the sound plays.

, As you increase the volume of the birdsong, your dog should become desensitized to louder levels of birdsong.Once you can play the sounds at a “normal” level—approximately the volume of birds outdoors—try bringing your dog outside. The outdoor sounds of birds should stimulate your dog no more than the indoor bird recordings.


Your dog should be desensitized to the birdsong, since it has heard it so frequently indoors.

, Once your dog is outdoors and is well behaved, calm, and is less inclined to bark at or chase birds, you should reward the dog. Praise your dog for its good behavior, pet it, and give it treats to reinforce its calm behavior.If your dog continues to act out by barking at or chasing birds, bring it back inside. Vary the types of birdsongs that you play. This will desensitize the dog to a variety of types of birds. The next time that you bring the dog outdoors, it is more likely to disregard the sound and presence of chirping birds.

Do not yell at your dog to quiet it.,
Give your dog attention when it has quieted down.,
Bring your dog indoors if it does not calm down.,
Repeat the procedure as many times as needed.",How to Calm a Dog when It Sees Birds3," Dogs are naturally vocal animals and, if they hear you loudly vocalizing back at them, they’ll feel stimulated and continue barking and running at the birds. Even if you take an angry tone with your dog, or yell “No!” or other loud commands, your dog will interpret your shouting as a reward.Dogs feed off of your own excitement, and appreciate the attention you’re giving them (even if it’s negative attention).

, Wait until your dog’s excitement over the birds has passed (the birds have flown away or your dog has lost interest). Then, wait about five minutes, and pet and praise your dog. Over time, your dog will come to understand that you praise them for their silence and good behavior.The same principle applies when you’re out on a walk with your dog, although it can be harder to implement. If your dog barks at or chases birds while you’re walking, do not yell at or discipline your dog, but keep it close to your side (don’t let the dog run). Then, once the dog has quieted down, praise the dog and give it a treat. This will positively reinforce its quiet behavior., Rather than shouting at a dog that is barking at or running after birds, simply bring it indoors. Wait until the dog has calmed down sufficiently (try waiting 10 minutes), and let the dog out again only once it is quiet.Even if there are still birds outside, your dog will eventually that learn that, in order to be left outside, it needs to remain well behaved.

, Dogs can be slow to learn and may have a strong drive to chase and bark at birds, especially if the dog is of a hunting breed. Whether you’re at your home or out on a walk, continue to reinforce quiet, calm behavior. Bring your dog back inside (or back from the walk) as often as needed for it to change its behavior and remain calm around birds.Although at first it may be inconvenient to bring your dog inside the house every time it barks at or chases birds, it will reinforce the behavior and help your dog to remain quiet around birds.

Investigate your dog’s barking.,
Determine the cause of the barking.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.",How to Train Dogs Not to Bark2," The first step to stopping your dog’s barking is to find out what’s causing the barking. You may need to do some deducing, particularly if your dog tends to bark when you aren’t around.


To help you track the barking behavior, talk with your neighbors. Ask when they notice your dog barking and if there’s any pattern to the behavior. Demonstrating to your neighbors that you’re aware of and working to address your dog’s barking will also help them see you as an ally rather than a part of the problem.
Leave a tape or video recorder running while you’re away. Taking video may be preferable to only taking audio as it will allow you to investigate potential visual as well as aural triggers of your dog’s barking. Record your dog at home over the course of several days and review the recordings so you’ll be able to get a better representation of your dog’s behavior.

, After gathering evidence, begin looking for patterns and triggers. Common triggers include:Drawing your attention to a need. Your dog may be looking to get your attention because of an immediate need—to use the bathroom, hunger, thirst, etc.
Feeling bored or frustrated. A dog may be bored or frustrated because it has been confined to a particular area or has no outlets for its energy. Barking may be a way for the dog to release anxiety or create a distraction.
Feeling afraid. If a person, thing, or noise frightens your dog, it may be barking as a response. You can tell from your dog’s body language whether it’s responding out of fear—a fear posture will include the ears pulled back and the tail lowered.
Feeling territorial. If a dog perceives a person or other dog as intruding on its territory, it may bark as a way of asserting a claim to that territory. You can often tell when a dog is barking territorially because its ears will be forward and its tail held up high.
Feeling excited. Dogs may bark when they’re excited to see you as an expression of their eagerness.
Experiencing health issues. If a dog is dealing with health issues like deafness, pain, or mental distress, it may bark as a sign that something is amiss., If you have any reason to suspect that your dog may be barking because of a health concern, make an appointment to see your vet.


Keep in mind that older dogs may bark as a result of dementia. If that’s the case, your vet may be able to prescribe a medication to help your dog cope with the symptoms."

Eliminate the motivation.,
Ignore your dog’s barking.,
Reward quiet.,
Redirect your dog’s attention.,
Minimize the effect of the dog's barking on the neighbors.",How to Train Dogs Not to Bark3," Once you’ve determined what’s causing your dog to bark, work on removing the incentive.


Your dog barks because it experiences some kind of reward from that behavior. If you remove that payoff, your dog will lose incentive to bark.For example, if your dog barks at passersby while in the house, close the blinds or curtains to block their view. If your dog barks at passersby while in the yard, bring the dog inside when it begins barking at someone., When beginning to re-train your dog, you need to start by not reacting to the barking. Dogs interpret your yelling at them or telling them to stop as attention, which in and of itself reinforces the behavior, regardless of whether you’re angry at or scolding your dog.When your dog barks, don’t acknowledge it in any way. Don’t look at your dog, talk to your dog, pet your dog, and definitely don’t feed or give your dog treats.
Be aware that you dog's barking will get worse before it gets better if you need to break an existing habit. When you fail to react after your dog is used to you responding to barking, then the dog will interpret that as a need to bark more because it didn’t work. Avoid the urge to acknowledge the barking in any way.
You may want to explain to neighbors that you are trying to stop the barking issue and apologize for the inconvenience in the meantime. If they understand you are trying to do something constructive—rather than just being incredibly irritating—hopefully they will be more sympathetic.

, As soon as your dog stops barking, wait a minute to ensure that the dog doesn’t confuse the reason why, and then reward the silence with a treat. If you do this consistently, then your dog will begin to understand that the barking does not receive a reward but the quiet does.


Your dog will begin to associate being quiet with receiving a treat. As that happens, begin to lengthen the amount of time the dog must be quiet before receiving a reward.
If you are utilizing clicker training with your dog, then remember to mark the silence with a click before rewarding the quiet.

, When your dog begins to bark, redirect it to do something that will distract it from the stimulus.


Telling your dog to lie down is a good way to redirect, as it won’t be construed as a reward for barking.
When you dog lies down quietly, reward it with a treat--but only once it’s quiet.

, While in the process of re-training your dog, keep your dog out of hearing range of the neighbors as much as possible to minimize nuisance.


Keep in touch with your neighbors and let them know you’re aware of your dog’s barking and are working to fix the problem.
Having your neighbors on your side is the best way to maintain good will and avoid nuisance calls."
"
Allow your dog to get enough exercise.,
Give your dog enough attention.,
Be consistent.,
Teach your dog to respond to a “quiet” command.",How to Train Dogs Not to Bark4," Dogs are social and need environmental stimuli to stay healthy and well-adjusted.


Take your dog for regular walks around the neighborhood.
Whenever possible, take your dog to parks or open spaces where it can run around freely.

, Dogs are pack animals and need to feel part of a family, so when you come home, bring your dog inside and allow it to socialize with you and your family.


Don’t leave your dog outside or unattended while you’re home; it will likely lead your dog to become anxious and frustrated, leading to poor behavior.

, Dogs are often confused by human inconsistency--sometimes when they bark, you yell, but at other times you don’t respond. As a result, your dog can’t tell whether barking is a good or a bad thing.


The only way to train your dog in the behavior you want is to be consistent, so it will be able to learn the behaviors you want and don’t want it to have., Teaching your dog how to respond to a “quiet” command is more productive than yelling at your dog to “be quiet” or “shut up.”


As with any behavior you want to instill in your dog, consistency is key.
Begin by teaching your dog to “speak” on command. You can do this by knocking on the door to simulate a visitor. When the dog barks, provide a treat (and remember to use the clicker if you’re clicker training). Once the dog responds regularly and looks for the treat, give this behavior a cue word, such as “speak.”
Once your dog can reliably bark on command, teach the “quiet” command. Find a quiet environment with no distractions. Tell your dog to “speak,” then say “quiet,” wait for the to stop barking, use the clicker if you’re clicker training, and reward your dog with a treat.
Repeat as necessary until your dog learns to associate the command “quiet” with stopping its barking and with being rewarded for the quiet."

Purchase a water gun.,
Catch your dog in the act.,
Spray your dog’s body.,
Give a verbal addition.",How to Deter a Dog from Misbehaving Using a Water Gun1," Visit your local pharmacy, toy store, or discount retailer to purchase a water gun. Buy a smaller gun that you can carry around with you, and one that you can easily hide in your pants pocket or in your waistband.


Purchase water guns that shoot streams of water as opposed to mists of water.
Alternatively, you can purchase a spray bottle, but these are more difficult to carry around with you.;
, When punishing your dog with a spray bottle, it is very important that you punish it while it is in the act of misbehaving. Punishing your dog after the fact can cause confusion, or even make your dog think it is being punished for no reason.For example, if you find that your dog has chewed up your shoe, but you did not see your dog doing it, then going over to your dog and squirting it with the water gun will not do any good. Instead, wait for the next time you see your dog chewing on your shoe or the furniture. Use the water gun to punish your dog then.
Keep your water gun hidden in your pocket or waistband at all times so that you can punish your dog in the act, and use the element of surprise to your advantage.

, When you catch your dog in the act, and you have your water gun handy, avoid spraying your dog in the face. First off, by spraying it in the face, you can inadvertently harm its eyes. Secondly, your dog will be able to see that you are spraying the bottle. Thus, it will come to associate you with the punishment, and might begin to fear or resent you.Instead, spray your dog’s body, like its back or its behind. Or, try spraying your dog in the back of the head.
Do not use the water gun forcefully, for example, use a high-pressure setting to spray the dog, or spray too much water. You might harm the dog this way.

, As you squirt your dog, you must give a verbal addition, like “No,” “Stop,” or “Stop, bad dog.” This way, the dog can begin to associate the punishment with the verbal correction. Once it has made a connection between the word and the punishment, you will only need to use the word to get it to stop misbehaving.Make sure your voice is confident, loud (but not yelling), and firm so that your dog understands that you are in charge and do not approve of the behavior.

Recognize the causes of your dog’s territorial barking.,
Don’t yell or shout at your dog for barking.,
Avoid depending on a muzzle to stop your dog from barking.,
Obscure your dog’s view of strangers at the door.,
Secure your yard with a tall fence.,
Distract your dog from barking by shaking a set of keys.,
Use the “quiet” technique by holding your dog’s muzzle.,
Try the “quiet” technique without holding your dog’s muzzle.,
Use treats to prevent your dog from barking during a walk.,
Train your dog to ride in a crate if he barks in the car at strangers.,
Take your dog to a professional dog trainer if he continues to bark.",How to Stop Your Dog from Barking at Strangers," Often, dogs who bark at strangers are demonstrating territorial barking. This type of barking occurs because your dog is fearful and sees strangers as a potential treat. Dogs are wired to defend their territory, so they will use their bark when they detect unknown people in familiar places like their homes and their yards.In fact, your dog may be so motivated to bark at the perceived threat that he may ignore your shouts to stop barking or any scolding you might give him. Even if you use harsh punishment to stop your dog from barking, he may try to take control of his territory by biting someone.
Some dogs also bark at strangers to alarm their owners of a potential threat. Alarm barking is triggered by sights and sounds. Dogs who alarm bark may react to strangers even when they are not in their home or yards. Your dog may bark when he sees strangers in the park, on the street, or in an unfamiliar place.;
, Most canine experts agree that yelling, scolding, or even hitting your dog for barking can in fact make his barking worse. If your dog is barking out of fear or anxiety, punishing him will only add to his stress. Instead, you need to train him to respond to strangers in an appropriate way, and to only bark when necessary.We bred dogs to bark, so do not get upset if your dog barks at sudden sounds like car doors slamming and loud noise in the street. However, dogs who bark at strangers require training to ensure they do not become too aggressive towards others.

, Some dog owners may consider using a muzzle to curtain their dog’s barking. Often, anti bark collars are a form of punishment for your dog that should be a last resort, not a first option. Anti bark collars and muzzles are not as effective as training your dog properly and can lead to other behavioral issues., It’s important that you manage your dog’s barking by creating an environment that will limit his sight of others. Keep your curtains or blinds closed during the day when your dog is home. You can also set up a baby gate so your dog cannot get into rooms that have large bay windows where he can see outside.For a more permanent option, place a removable plastic film or spray a glass coating on the windows so its harder for your dog to see people outside. Doing this will limit your dog’s ability to see people so he is less motivated to defend his territory and bark.

, If your dog enjoys running around outside in the yard, place a tall fence around the yard to your dog cannot see strangers across the street or in the neighborhood. This will give him less of a need to bark and allow him to play without being distracted by strangers.The fence will also obscure your dog’s view of the street when he is inside, so he won’t be able to spot strangers and bark at them.

, The sound should startle your dog and cause him to stop barking. Then, call him away from the door or the window and command him to “sit”. Give him a treat and then tell him to “stay”. If he remains seated and quiet, give him treats for the next several minutes until the stranger is gone.If he starts barking again after he is seated, shake the set of keys again and repeat the sequence.
Avoid encouraging your dog to bark at people at the door by saying “Who’s there?” to your dog and then walking to the door. This will cause your dog to be on guard and will likely lead to alert barking.

, This technique will teach your dog that he is allowed to bark when someone comes to the door until you say “quiet”. Your dog should bark no more than three to four times and then stop when you calmly give him the command: “quiet”.Practice this technique when a stranger comes to the door, for example, a delivery man. Let your dog bark three to four times. Then, stand over him and say “quiet”.
Go to your dog and gently hold his muzzle closed with your hand. Then, say “quiet” again.
Release your dog’s muzzle and step back from him. Then, call him away from the door or the window by saying his name and “here”.
Command your dog to sit and then reward him with a treat. If he remains seated and quiet, give him several more treats for the next several minutes until the stranger is gone.
If your dog starts barking once he sits down, repeat the sequence again and do not reward him until he sits and remains quiet.

, If you feel uncomfortable holding your dog’s muzzle or if you feel doing so might scare him, try the “quiet” method without holding him.Allow your dog to bark three to four times. Then, approach him and say “quiet”. Encourage his silence by feeding him pea-sized treats like cooked chicken, hot dogs, or pieces of cheese. Repeat this sequence several times over a period of several days until your dog seems to understand what “quiet” means. Your dog should stop barking once you say “quiet”.
After several days of training, extend the time between giving the cue “quiet” and giving your dog his reward. Say “quiet” and wait two seconds before feeding your dog his treats. Gradually increase the wait time to five seconds, then 10 seconds, then 20 seconds. Work up to 30 seconds of wait time before rewarding your pup.

, If your dog tends to bark at strangers when he is outside of his home, you can distract him from barking by using special treats that are soft, like cooked chicken, cheese, or hot dogs. Learn to read his body language and the cues that indicate when he is about to bark. This differs from dog to dog but may include: his hackles rising, ears pricking, or a change in the way he walks. When you notice these changes then distract him before he barks.Hold the treat in front of his nose so he can see the treat. Instruct him to nibble the treat as he is walking past a person who might cause him to bark. You can also command your dog to sit and eat the treat as people pass by him.
Always praise him and reward him again if he does not bark as people pass by.

, Some dogs tend to bark while riding in the car and can feel anxious or fearful of strangers on the street or in other cars. Keeping your dog in the crate during a drive will restrict his view and give him less cause to bark.If your dog isn’t comfortable riding in a crate, you can train your dog to wear a head halter in the car. A head halter can have a calming effect on your dog. You can also put a head halter on your dog during walks or around the house if he tends to bark. But you should avoid depending solely on a head halter to stop your dog’s barking. A more permanent solution to the problem is training your dog not to bark at strangers.

, If you try several training techniques and reduce your dog’s exposure to triggering sights and sounds, but he continues to bark at strangers, it may be time to speak to a professional dog trainer for guidance. The trainer can meet with you and your dog and conduct one on one training sessions and help you find ways to stop your dog from excessive or unnecessary barking.A listing of certified dog trainers can be found here.

Do not call your dog over.,
Don’t let your dog see the water gun.,
Be consistent.,
Use a different method.",How to Deter a Dog from Misbehaving Using a Water Gun2," When punishing your dog with a water gun, do not call your dog over to receive the punishment. By doing this, you are not catching your dog in the act. Instead, your dog will think that it is being reprimanded for coming to you when called, which you do not want., Try not to let your dog see the water gun, or see that you are dispensing the water from the gun. The punishment should not be associated with you, but with the misbehavior. If your dog comes to associate you with the water gun, then it is more likely to engage in the behavior when you are not around.Keep the water gun in your back pocket, and make sure your dog does not see you using it.
To prevent your dog from seeing you use the water gun, approach your dog from behind and spray the back of its head or body.

, Try to punish your dog every time the misbehavior occurs. If you only punish your dog sporadically, then it will learn that it still occasionally gets to do the unwanted behavior.This can cause your dog to either do the behavior when you are not around, or decide that performing the behavior is worth the risk of getting punished.

, This method of punishment does not usually work on dogs that enjoy water, like Labradors, Golden retrievers, American and Irish water spaniels, Portuguese water dogs, labradoodles, and general retriever dogs. Therefore, you will need to use a different method of punishment if your dog likes water, or is one of these dogs.Instead, take away one of your dog's favorite toys, or place it in time-out (time-outs should not be longer than a minute). Make sure to accompany the punishment with a verbal addition like, ""Bad dog"" or ""No.""On the other hand, dogs that dislike water are Chihuahuas, pugs, Yorkshire terriers, Pekingese breeds, Dachshunds, Maltese breeds, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Chinese cresteds, and Lhasa Apsos.

Make a list of everything that triggers bad behavior.,
Take note of how your dog reacts to triggers.,
Take your dog to a vet.,
Avoid rewarding bad behavior.,
Use clear, simple words like “no,” “bad dog,” and “good dog.” You need to communicate to your dog that it’s engaged in bad behavior and then redirect it to a good behavior and reward it for that behavior.,
Desensitize your dog to stressful stimuli.,
Stick to a regular training schedule.,
Minimize stressful stimuli.,
Keep your dog entertained.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Cope With a Bad Dog," Chances are that your dog isn’t bad all around. Rather, your dog responds badly to certain stimuli. Before you can correct your dog’s bad behavior, you need to know what triggers it.Pay attention when your dog behaves badly. Ask yourself what was happening right before the bad behavior.
Observe your dog closely at all times for about a week. You might be surprised to find out what small things trigger bad behavior.
Common triggers for dogs are other dogs, people, other animals, cars, loud noises, and being left alone.;
, If you’re going to retrain your dog’s bad behavior, you need to know exactly what behaviors you want to change. Note how your dog responds to triggers.You’ll probably recognize the response right away since you’ve seen it before. If your dog barks when someone knocks on the door, notice if your dog shrinks into a corner in fear or lifts up its ears in excitement.
If your dog tears up furniture when you’re away, pay attention to what kinds of furniture your dog goes for.
Note whether your dog reacts differently to similar kinds of triggers. For example, note if your dog pees on the floor when there’s a knock on the door, but whimpers when there’s a thunderstorm.

, Bad behavior can be the result of an underlying health issue that is making your dog uncomfortable. Sometimes treating the health issue will cure the bad behavior.


Ask the vet to do a full check-up.
If no health issues are found, ask the vet for their advice on how to deal with your dog’s bad behavior.

, For a dog, most attention is seen as a reward. Thus, if you give your dog lots of attention after it has acted badly, you’re reinforcing the behavior.If your dog jumps up on you, don’t push it away. Instead, refuse to look your dog in the eye or give it any attention.
If you come home and find your dog has dug up the backyard, calmly approach your dog and place it in time-out in a kennel.
Don’t yell at your dog when it’s bad. This will only provide reinforcement for the behavior.

, After your dog does something bad, say “no” and then ask your dog to do something positive like sit. If your dog performs the good behavior, say “good dog” and give your dog attention.If your dog jumps on the furniture, say “no, down.” If your dog stay on the furniture, approach it without looking it in the eye and pull it off the couch. Calmly place your dog in a time-out without saying another word. This will tell the dog that it will not get attention by jumping on the furniture.
Always follow negative reinforcement with positive reinforcement. After you let your dog out of a time-out in its kennel, tell it to lie down and pat its belly when it complies. This will tell the dog that it will get attention when it follows commands.

, Most stressful stimuli cannot be avoided altogether, so it’s important to train your dog to stay clam after being triggered. The best way to do this is by slowly introducing your dog to the stimulus. Begin by making sure you’re in a controlled environment like your house. Otherwise, other factors can influence your dog’s behavior.Start with a very low-level stimulus. For example, if your dog is scared of thunder, play a quiet recording of thunder on your stereo.
If your dog stays calm with the low-level stimulus, reward it with attention. If not, reduce the stimulus and start over.
Slowly increase the level of the stimulus and reward your dog each time it stays calm.

, If you want to change your dog’s behavior, you need to be consistent with your approach. Otherwise, your dog won’t learn which behaviors you really consider good and bad.


You can’t take time off from retraining your dog. You need to consistently discipline your dog when it misbehaves and follow up the discipline with positive reinforcement of good behaviors.
Make sure everyone in your household is on board. Tell everyone about the plan to retrain your dog and explain that you want them to follow your lead.
If you’ll be out of town for a few days, get someone you trust to care for your dog while you’re gone. Explain that you’re retraining your dog and how the caretaker should respond to your dog’s behavior.

, Not all stresses can be avoided, but you can manage your dog’s environment to avoid the worst triggers. Doing so will cut down on the amount of retraining you need to do.If your dog tears up the house when you’re away, keep your dog outside. Even better, hire a dog sitter or a dog walker.
If your dog is afraid of strangers, keep it in another room when strangers come by your house.
If your dog is afraid of thunderstorms, turn on music during a storm and close the shades.

, Dogs often engage in undesirable behaviors because they’re bored. If you keep your dog entertained with fun activities and lots of exercise you will see a large drop-off in bad behavior.Walk your dog every day. Dogs need exercise. If you can’t walk your dog because you’re at work, hire someone to walk your dog.
Take your dog to the park to play with other dogs. Dogs need to socialize with other dogs every now and then.
Let your dog play outside if you have a fenced-in yard.
Provide your dog with toys and activities. If your dog doesn’t have anything to play with, it will find something on its own—and that will usually be your stuff.

, Your dog wants your attention. If you give it positive attention when it's a good dog, it won’t feel the need to act out in order to get your attention.Spend time with your dog every day, petting it and giving it belly rubs.
Never miss an opportunity to reward your dog when it stays calm during a stressful stimulus. This will reinforce the good behavior.
Buy treats to feed your dog when it responds to your commands.
Get your dog excited with words like “dog park” or “outside” when it’s been good. Of course, always follow-up these words with action—taking your dog to the park or letting it play outside.

See a certified trainer.",How to Teach Your Dog the Stop Barking Command," Doing this will allow you to control when your dog speaks or barks and when he is silent. Practice this command in a quiet place in your home with no distractions. Put a few treats in your pocket so they are on hand during the training session.Start by telling your dog to “speak.” Wait for him to bark two to three times.;
, If your dog does not bark when you command him to speak, you may try triggering him so he barks. Ring the doorbell to get him to bark or make a noise at the door. Once he starts barking, say “speak” and use a hand signal to encourage the barking.You can use a hand signal like clapping or snapping. You can also use a clicker when you say “speak” if your dog uses clicker training.

, Once your dog starts barking, place a treat in front of his nose. He should eventually stop barking to sniff the treat. Praise your dog with a “Good job” or “Good work” and give him the treat.Repeat these actions several times until your dog starts barking when you say “speak”. You may also do the necessary hand gesture or click the clicker to trigger him to speak.

, Start by getting your dog to bark with the “speak” command. You want to make sure you can control when your dog barks with this command. It will make it easier for you to get your dog to stop barking if you can control when he barks.If your dog struggles with the “speak” command, you may need to practice this command a bit more with your pup before you move on to the “stop barking” command. Be patient and give your dog time to learn the “speak” command before you move onto the “stop barking” command.

, Once your dog starts barking, say “quiet.” Place a treat in front of his nose and wait for him to stop barking so he can sniff at the treat.You may try practicing the “stop barking” command by the front door or by another area where your dog tends to bark uncontrollably. This can help to teach him that he needs to be quiet and stop barking no matter where he is in your home.

, Let your dog see the treat but do not give it to him until he stops barking and is quiet. When he stops barking, give him the treat and praise him. You may say “Good job” or “Good work” and give him a pet on the head., Start by commanding your dog to “speak.” Then, put a treat in front of him and say “quiet.” Only give your dog the treat if he stops barking. You may need to repeat these cues several times to ensure your dog understands and has learned the commands.You may also delay the reward for “quiet” for longer periods of time to ensure your dog understands that “quiet” means to stop barking for a continued stretch of time. You may delay the reward for 30 seconds and then for one minute to ensure your dog understands he needs to be quiet.

, When you feel confident that your dog understands the “quiet” command, you should test it out. Have someone ring the doorbell while you and your dog are inside. Your dog will likely bark at the presence of someone at the door and at the sound of the doorbell. Say the “quiet” command to your dog. Wait for your dog to stop barking, even while the doorbell is ringing, and give him a treat as a reward.You can also test this command at the dog park when the dog is around other dogs. You may do the “quiet” command when your dog spots another dog to ensure he does not bark.

, You can prevent your dog from barking by adjusting his environment so he is less likely to get agitated or territorial. If your dog tends to bark at people passing by on the street from the window, close the curtains or the blinds so he cannot see outside and be triggered to bark. You may also try keeping your dog indoors when you are not home, as leaving your dog in the front yard or backyard can expose him to people and other triggers that can lead to barking.Try not to get your dog riled up when someone is at the door as this can lead to barking. Do not ask, “Who’s at the door?” or “Who’s that?” when someone rings the bell. Instead, act calm and give the “quiet” command so your dog does not bark when someone is at the door.

, A tired out dog is less likely to get agitated and bark at people at the door or people passing by. You should take your dog for daily walks and have play sessions with him on a consistent basis. Doing this will ensure your dog is healthy and suitably worn out, which can make it easier for him to stay quiet and calm at home.Smaller breeds may require only a short walk outside or around the neighborhood on a daily basis to go to the bathroom and get some exercise. Larger breeds may need longer walks outside and trips to the dog park to get some exercise.

, A big part of training your dog properly is sticking to the same commands and rules. Changing up the rules can confuse your dog and lead to erratic behavior from your dog. Stick to the same commands and rules for your dog to ensure he behaves at his best and is not prone to barking.You should also make sure everyone in your household also uses the same commands and rules for your dog. If you live with others, you may need to have a house meeting where you outline the rules for the dog so everyone is on the same page and agrees to stick to a consistent set of commands.

, If your dog still struggles with the ""stop barking"" command, you may need to bring him to a certified trainer. The trainer can help your dog get used to the command and tell you about obedience techniques you can try with your dog. You can find a certified trainer by speaking to your vet or to other pet owners.

Identify the specific problem behaviors.,
Take a close look at your past behaviors.,
Talk with your vet.,
Establish clear rules.",How to Control Disobedient Dogs1," Not all dogs disobey in the same way, so it is important to figure out exactly how, and in what situations, your dog acts in an unruly manner. Do they cause damage to the home? Do they jump on or attack your guests? Do they bark constantly? Pull out a notebook and write down every time your dog acts disruptive. Then, look over the log after a few days to determine any patterns.Using these notes, you may be able to address some of these problems on your own by removing your dog from certain environments. For example, if your dog acts rowdy at the dog park, perhaps visit the park when it is less crowded in the morning.;
, There is a possibility that you’ve prompted, or contributed to, some of your dog’s negative reactions. Try to think of those moments where you encouraged disobedient behaviors or perhaps failed to reward positive ones.For instance, if you give your dog a treat immediately after it has just jumped on your friend, then you are rewarding your dog for a poor interaction. You can expect that your dog will then continue this type of behavior in the hopes of receiving another treat.

, If you’ve tried to make a few minor lifestyle changes and they seem to have no effect, then it is time to talk with your vet. Make an appointment and bring your behavior log for them to view. Depending on the discussion, your vet may order some tests to rule out any medical reasons for your dog’s actions.Some dogs act badly when they are in pain. Intestinal disorders and allergies are some of the health concerns that can cause a normally well-behaved dog to ‘go bad.’
Make sure to talk with your vet about how any medications may impact your dog’s behavior over the long term. Some have side effects that can be worse than the current situation.

, Your vet may be able to suggest some boundaries that you can establish in the home to make for a more comfortable living situation for both you and your dog. Perhaps you can keep the furniture off-limits and instead buy a nice dog bed or lounger. Maybe you stop feeding your dog table scraps and instead invest in a good dog food. The backyard could be off-limits for play until the day’s training is done.Whatever rules you set, you must be consistent in their boundaries and application. Otherwise, you will confuse your dog and lead to more frustration and disobedience.

Get a well-fitting collar and leash.,
Try out head halters.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Ignore bad behaviors.,
Use a disruption device.,
Catch your dog by running away.",How to Control Disobedient Dogs2," These devices will allow you to somewhat control the movements of your dog, especially when they are misbehaving. Go to the pet store and test out the strengths of various leads. You want a lead that your dog cannot break, but it shouldn’t be too heavy either. Make sure that the collar fits well enough so that your dog cannot slip out of it.You can do a “finger test” on the collar to determine tightness. You should be able to insert a finger or two into the space between the collar and your dog’s skin.

, For those dogs who are particularly unruly, a head halter may be a good option. This is a series of straps that fit around the face, with or without a muzzle piece, which allows an owner to control the movements of the dog’s head. Some head halters are designed for long-term wear and you can keep them on your dog while you continue indoor training., This method of training involves rewarding your dog’s good actions and paying little or no attention to the bad behaviors. You can reward by providing tasty treats or by giving tons of affection. After your dog does something good, you want to reward it immediately in order to get the maximum benefit. It is also a good idea to reward your dog when they are behaving calmly., Some dogs behave badly in order to get attention, even negative attention. To remedy this type of interaction, give your dog plenty of positive chances to play and learn with you. However, when they do misbehave, turn your shoulders away and make a point of paying them no attention., When a dog starts to misbehave they might lose control of themselves and just continue until they are exhausted. One way to stop this snowball effect is to disrupt it mid-cycle. You can keep a can filled with coins nearby or an air horn and give it a quick go whenever your dog starts to act out.However, be warned that distraction tactics are only temporary. You should still give your dog a positive outlet for their emotions.

, This may sound a bit odd, but it often works. If your dog enjoys running away from you, then make a bunch of noise and run in the opposite direction. This will usually incite their hunting instinct and they will turn and follow you. However, only do this if it is safe to do so."

Start training early.,
Give your dog plenty of exercise.,
Avoid potentially problematic situations, at least at first.,
Look into dog obedience courses.,
Do not physically punish your dog.,
Focus on the positives of dog ownership.",How to Control Disobedient Dogs3," If you adopted your dog or purchased it from a breeder, you may not have too much control over the initial training schedule. However, it is best to start training your puppy prior to 9 weeks, if possible. This is a crucial time for socializing with other puppies and humans. It is also a good time to introduce some of the rules of self-control, such as refraining from jumping or biting.Old dogs can learn new tricks, however. You’ll just need to be patient and methodical in how you introduce any desired changes.
It might be helpful to choose one trick or behavior to focus on before moving on to something new. For example, you can work on teaching your dog how to sit. Or, maybe you'd like your dog to stop jumping on others.

, Some breeds, such as border collies, are highly intelligent and require daily stimulation. If you fail to give them that attention, then they will find trouble elsewhere. If your dog is an active breed and begins to act in an unruly way, you may want to add in a few extra play sessions somewhere., Place your dog in scenarios where they can ‘win.’ This gives them the best possible chance to behave in a good way and reap the rewards. This will also reduce your stress as well, as you can simply watch them behave in a good way. For example, you might close doors in your home so that your dog’s unsupervised time is limited.Or, if your dog is afraid of loud noises, you might be careful when planning trips outdoors.

, Search your city and “dog obedience” to find classes in your area. This is a good way to teach your dog new skills or to reinforce lessons that they have learned, but forgotten. You can also look for a class that will address specific behavioral problems, such as biting or jumping.

, No matter how frustrated you become, do not hit or strike your dog. This will only make your dog fear you and can prompt a whole new host of problem behaviors. Instead, take a deep breath and think about what you would like to happen differently in the future. Then, make sure to be consistent in establishing rules for your dog to follow., With all of this effort and training, you may forget the joys of interacting with and owning your dog. That’s why it is important to sometimes simply relax with your pet without an ulterior motive. Lay on the couch and cuddle during a movie. Or, go outside a play a relaxed game of ball.It may also help to post happy, positive photos of you and your dog around your home. This will remind you of the potential that is there.

Fill a tub with a shallow layer of lukewarm water.,
Give the dog a favorite toy.,
Bring the dog to the tub.,
Slowly fill the tub if possible.,
Pour water onto the dog slowly.,
Massage shampoo into the dog's back.,
Rinse off with the cup.,
Sponge the face and other sensitive areas.,
Dry off the dog.",How to Wash a Dog Afraid of Water," A depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm) is about right. If the weather is warm and the dog is not likely to escape the yard, take the bath outside. Otherwise, use a bathtub or place a bucket in the shower.
, If the dog has a waterproof toy she especially loves, let her hold on to it in the bath., Bring the dog into the room and praise him in a gentle, encouraging tone. Place him at the edge of the tub, stroke him to help him calm down, and slowly introduce him to the water. It's ideal if he steps in on his own, but you may need to place him in the tub yourself. Give him a treat if he stops trying to leave.


If the dog has a full-blown fear reaction, you may need to take him outside and sponge him there instead, or wash under a thin trickle from a hose.

, If the dog is not panicking, turn the tap or hose on in a slow trickle. Just fill the tub to the level of the dog's knees if he can't stand a deeper bath.

Remember, the water should be lukewarm, not hot or cold enough to startle the dog.

, Scoop up the water from the tub with a cup and pour it in a trickle on the dog's back, or splash it gently onto the dog with your hands. If she doesn't try to jump out, praise her and give her a treat. Repeat until her whole back is wet, stopping to soothe her when necessary. If your dog is terrified of water, you may have to wash her this way in a shallow tub, at least the first couple times you give her a bath.


If the dog is still nervous, praise her and give a treat every time you move a little further down the back.

, Turn off the water and rub the dog shampoo into the dog's back, from the neck to tail., Pour water from the cup again over the shampooed fur. Rub the fur with your hands as you pour to rinse off the shampoo and comfort the dog at the same time., Dogs tend to be more skittish about their face. Sponge it with a damp cloth or sponge, minimizing the amount of running water. If your dog is skittish about his legs or belly, do the same for these areas.

Make sure to keep soap out of the dog's eyes.
If the dog panics when you try this, finish it as fast as you can. Next time, you may want to wipe these areas separately, not during bath time.

, Get the dog out of the tub and let him shake if he wants to. Dry him off with a big, warm towel while praising him. Give him a final treat or two so he associates a successful bath with a big reward.

Notice if your dog reacts to loud noises.,
Understand your dog may develop noise aversion.,
Identify triggers.,
Change up triggers.,
Put ear muffs on.,
Don't force loud noises on them.",How to Deal with Canine Noise Aversion1," Pay attention to your dog when loud noises happen. Your dog may jump, cower, or make noises like whining or barking. It may also chew on walls, furniture, or anything it can get its teeth into.Pay attention to less obvious signs. While you may notice your dog being extra whiny, you may not notice that it's following you around more because of a loud noise. Other less-obvious signs include excessive panting or drooling, hiding, or trying to escape. Your dog may also be on alert, looking around to see what's wrong.;
, While some dogs may inherit this trait, others may develop it. Usually, dogs who develop this trait do so because they had a bad experience associated with a loud noise, which in turn makes them fearful of loud noises., Not every dog with this condition responds to all the same noises. Therefore, it's important to pay attention to which noises bother your dog most. That way, you can work to alleviate the fear before it even starts, such as providing a safe space for your dog if you know a storm is coming.For instance, your dog may react to thunderstorms by running and hiding but only react to a loud truck outside by whimpering a little. In that case, your dog is more afraid of thunderstorms.

, One way to help your dog deal with some loud noises is by providing alternatives to the noise. Try turning on the television or some soothing music to help drown out the outside noises, for instance. You can also use white noise to the same effect.Try to cover up triggers as much as possible. For instance, you could play music your dog enjoys on days when there will be fireworks around.
Remove triggers if possible. For instance, if you know your dog doesn't like the vacuum cleaner, try to get someone to take it on a walk while you vacuum. Also, shut windows and blinds when there's a thunderstorm or fireworks outside to help block out the noise as much as possible., Ear muffs can help block out some of the sound, making it less scary for your dog. Of course, you need to get ear muffs made specifically for your dog, which you can find online and at some pet stores. Some dogs may not take to wearing ear muffs, though.Another option is noise-cancelling headphones for dogs.

, Some people think they can help their dog get over the fear by exposing the dog to more of it. While some noise-exposure programs do work to get your dog accustomed to loud noises, throwing your dog outside during a thunderstorm or taking it to a fireworks celebration will only terrify your dog, not make it better.If you do want to try to encourage your dog to be less fearful with noise, try a program developed for this purpose. You can find albums on the internet designed to help. The albums have noises that are disturbing to some dogs, but you can use them to acclimate your do to them. The idea is that you play the noises at softer levels and gradually move to louder levels, so your dog gets used to them."

Start socialization as early as possible.,
Ask about your older dog’s socialization history.,
Try to make introductions one at a time.,
Use treats to teach it to like new experiences.,
Ask a professional trainer for help.",How to Socialize a New Dog with Your Family1," Puppies are particularly open to new experiences between 8 and 16 weeks old. If you’ve just adopted a new puppy, expose it to adults, children, other dogs, and as many new sights and smells as possible during that timespan. Remember to make sure its vaccinations are active before bringing your puppy around other dogs.If you got your puppy from a breeder, ask how long they kept it with its littermates and how it got along with the other puppies. Ideally, the pup spent its first month or two in its litter, with the breeder handling it frequently to get it used to interacting with humans.;
, Knowing as much as you can about your new dog will help you create a specific socialization plan.If your new dog is older, try to learn about its history from the shelter, breeder, or previous owner.


Ask, “Has my new dog had any experience with children? Do you know anything about if and how it was socialized?” Regardless of its age, you’ll need to start making introductions promptly, but remember to be patient with an older dog that doesn’t have much social experience.
In addition, ask a shelter or rescue group, ""Has my dog had a history of abuse or neglect? Did it have previous owners? Do you know anything about its history before it ended up with your organization?""
If you've just gotten a new puppy, ask the breeder, ""Have you handled it every day, and how has it responded to human contact so far?""

, Introduce your new dog to your family members as slowly as possible, and keep introductions low key and unforced. Getting settled in a new home is an over-stimulating experience for you dog, and lots of petting hands, shouting, and excitement will be too much for it.Before bringing your new dog home, instruct your children and household members to remain calm and let the dog adjust to its new space. Tell them, “The new dog has lots of sights, smells, and other stuff to take in, and isn’t ready to be hugged and pet just yet. We’re all going to give it some time to get used to us and his new home so we don’t overwhelm it.”
First, introduce the dog one at a time to everyone living in your home. Avoid forcing introductions, and take a break if your dog is visibly uncomfortable. Over the course of at least a week, depending on how it responds, introduce it to other family members, regular visitors, your neighbors, and other people whom it’ll frequently encounter.

, Have every family member give the new dog a small treat during their calm introduction. You and your family should also reward your dog’s calm and friendly behavior with treats and praise throughout socialization. Offering treats will train your dog to associate acting calmly around new people with positivity.Have your regular visitors, neighbors, and mailman also offer your dog a treat. If you’ve trained your dog to sit, have the person give a sit command and reward the dog with a treat. Additionally, teaching your dog to sit when it meets new people will encourage it not to jump., Good introductions set the tone for positive socialization, and the majority of dogs adapt well to their new families. However, older dogs that were raised in isolation, neglected, or abused can be more difficult to socialize. If you run into trouble, the best solution is to consult a certified professional trainer or a certified animal behaviorist.If just need a little guidance or if your dog is submissive, anxious, or engages in non-aggressive behavior, consider taking it to obedience classes. More serious cases of biting or other aggressive behavior might need more significant behavior modification techniques in one-on-one appointments with an animal behaviorist.
Ask your vet or dog-owning family and friends to recommend a trainer. Look for a trainer accredited by the International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP), the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT), or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC).

Let your dog be with you.,
Don't overcompensate.,
Make a safe space.,
Don't yell at your dog.,
Try a thunder shirt.,
Provide chew toys.",How to Deal with Canine Noise Aversion2," If possible, try to be with your dog when there are loud noises around. Having you nearby will help your dog feel more reassured than if it were alone. You're part of its pack, and you help make it feel safer when things are scary.For instance, if you know there's going to be fireworks, like on the Fourth of July, try to be home, and make sure not to leave your dog outside.

, While you do want to be there for your dog, make sure you're not over-comforting it. That is, if you are acting anxious and nervous because your dog is scared, that will only make it more nervous. Dogs are sensitive to emotions, so if you're anxious, you'll make it more anxious.For example, if your dog is whimpering in the corner, you can pet it as you go by, but don't try to get down in the corner with it. Stay in the same room with it, and let it come to you if it wants to.

, To help your dog deal with the noise, try to create a safe space it can retreat to. The best option is a dog bed or kennel in a windowless room with some sound protection. If your dog doesn't already use a space like this one, get it accustomed to it by feeding it in that area or bringing treats over there. You can also add the dog's favorite toy and blanket., If your dog is chewing on the wall because its afraid, you may be tempted to punish it. Doing things like yelling or putting the dog outside will only make the dog more anxious. Plus, your dog will have another bad thing to associate with loud noises--being punished.Try distracting your dog with treats if possible. Otherwise, try to use the other tactics listed to distract your dog from the noise.

, Thunder shirts are a kind of tight vest that you put on your dog when there might be loud noises. It seems to help some dogs deal with the anxiety of loud noises. It may be that they perceive at as someone protecting them.Also, some dogs try to crawl into tight spaces with this phobia, so it could be it helps with that need., Chewing is a great stress reliever for your dog, which is why some dogs chew on walls and furniture when they're upset. While you don't want your dog chewing on your furniture, you can give it something to chew on. That way, you don't have ruined furniture, and your dog gets stress relief.Bones (from a pet store) and pig ears are great for this purpose, as they taste good as well as keep your dog occupied. You can also try a puzzle food toy to keep your dog occupied.

Consider pheromones.,
Ask about an anxiety medicine.,
Discuss Sileo.",How to Deal with Canine Noise Aversion3," Some dogs can be helped through the use of pheromones. You can use a collar or an oil diffuser to release the pheromone scents. The smells remind the dog of being with its mother, which may help comfort it.Both the oils you need and the diffusers or collars can be found online and in some pet stores.

, For dogs that are fearful of many noises all the time, an anxiety medicine may help. Your dog would need to take it every day for it to be effective. Talk to your vet about whether this is a good option for your dog.You could say, ""My dog has severe noise aversion. He tends to chew walls, whimper, or sprint away from me when there are loud noises. I've heard anxiety medications may help. What do you think of that option for my dog?""
While some dogs may require anxiety meds their whole lives, others can be weaned off of them in time.
Another option is sedatives, taken in the moment that the dog is being triggered., This medication hit the markets in 2016. It's an option designed specifically for treating noise aversion in dogs. The drug is designed to stop norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is somewhat like adrenaline, and it pumps up your dog's anxiety. This drug helps to block the increase of norepinephrine. Better yet, it wears off in a few hours.You could say, ""My dog has problems with noise aversion. He runs and hides every time there is a thunderstorm or fireworks, and he tries to burrow into tiny spaces. I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself. I've heard there's a new drug on the market, Sileo, meant for this issue. Do you think that's a good option?""

Get your dog used to being poked and prodded.,
Avoid leaving a child unattended around dogs.,
Have your child help out with command training.,
Bring your kids to your dog’s obedience classes.",How to Socialize a New Dog with Your Family2," Before you let your younger kids play with your new dog, try to poke, prod, and grab its fur. Imitate the sort of touching you might expect from a younger child. Give your dog a treat when you poke and prod it so it learns to associate this sort of touching with a reward.While you should of course never let your child hurt your dog, understand that curious kids have a certain way of touching things. Preparing your dog for these interactions will help avoid aggressive behavior in the future.

, You should avoid leaving babies and young children alone with any dog. Even well-behaved children and well-socialized dogs can do something that the other interprets as frightening or aggressive. Take additional precautions if you have a small dog, which aren’t the best choice if you have a toddler or small child.Toy breeds and other small dogs are typically very fragile, and well-intentioned child’s play can be too rough for them.

, If your child is old enough, have them train your new dog commands, under your supervision. Involving them in the training process will help forge a bond between your child and pet, and will help the pet learn to respect your child’s superior position.To teach a command, like sit, first say the command clearly then, if necessary, physically guide the dog into the appropriate position. Offer a treat as soon as it’s in the correct position, then repeat around twenty times per training session.
Say to your child, ""You should learn how to give the dog commands so it knows that it should obey you in general. Watch how I tell the dog to sit and reward it as soon as it sits. It's important to give a treat right when it does the right thing so it learns how to follow the command.""

, Even if socialization goes smoothly, consider taking the whole family to obedience classes with your dog. Going together can be a great bonding experience for all furry and not so furry family members. More importantly, it will help every member of your household learn proper handling techniques."

Use scent to make the first introduction.,
Introduce your dogs gradually, starting on neutral ground.,
Try not to make either dog jealous.,
Take it slow when introducing your new dog and resident cat.",How to Socialize a New Dog with Your Family3," From your resident pets to your neighbor’s dog, scent should always be given priority whenever you introduce your new dog to other animals. Avoid forcing two dogs into meeting face-to-face by pulling their leashes and bringing them too close to each other.While this is how humans meet each other, head-on physical posturing can be a sign of confrontation and will likely make your dogs uncomfortable.
Instead, let the dogs exchange physical places by walking around each other, showing each other their profiles, and sniffing each other. If you trust your dog, keep the leash relatively loose, but be prepared to hold tight and recall your dog if there are any problems.  

, When you introduce your new and resident dogs, start by offering them scent articles that smell like the other dog. This is how dogs shake hands. Then, bring them both to a neighbor’s yard or other neutral, fenced area.Keep both dogs leashed, but try to keep leashes loose so the dogs know they’re in a stress-free situation.
If all goes well, bring both the dogs into your home separately, and keep them in separate rooms at first. Let your new dog out of its crate or closed room and bring it around the house for about 15 minutes. Put it back in its crate or closed room, and repeat the process with your resident dog.
Finally, if the dogs have been calm thus far, introduce them through a sturdy baby gate. Keep them both leashed. If all goes well, allow them to interact without the gate for short periods of time. Try to keep them separated for the majority of the first couple weeks, depending on their response, and don’t leave them alone together.

, Give both your new and resident dogs equal attention. When getting your new dog used to all its family members, it can be tempting to give it a little extra affection. However, it’s important that you avoid making either dog jealous, or you’ll jeopardize the socialization process.Jealous dogs can act aggressively and identify the other dog as a rival, which could result in long term behavioral issues that will require professional assistance.

, If you want to get your new dog and resident cat used to each other, keep them separated at first. Offer the dog a scent article that smells like the cat. Give it a pat or positive praise so it understands this new scent is a good thing.


Let them into the same room, and keep your dog on its leash. Make sure the cat as a way out of the room if it feels the need to get out. Monitor their interaction closely, and be prepared to pull the leash and recall your dog if it starts to growl or if the cat hisses. Avoid forces the animals to interact, but allow them to sniff and meet each other on their own terms.
Be patient, and try to keep your new dog and cat separated most of the time until they get used to each other.

Assess whether pheromones might help your dog.,
Discuss the use of pheromones with your veterinarian.,
Have your dog's health assessed.",How to Treat Dog Anxiety with Pheromone Therapy1," Pheromones can be used for a variety of behavioral issues related to anxiety but they cannot treat all of them. In particular, pheromones are not very useful for treating aggression issues.If your dog is having a hard time dealing with separation from you, coping with loud noises, or meeting other people or pets, then trying pheromone therapy is a good idea.
Additionally, if your dog has general anxiety that is not caused by a specific medical problem, for instance they pace and are restless at night, then pheromone therapy may relieve some of their anxiety.;
, If you are considering using pheromones on your dog you should discuss it with your veterinarian first. Your veterinarian may have suggestions for if and when pheromones should be used, as well as suggestions for what specific brands to use on your dog.


Having your veterinarian suggest a brand of pheromones to use can be very helpful, as there are many products available and choosing one can be difficult.
Pheromone products for dogs are sold over the counter. You will not need to get them directly from your veterinarian.However, it is a good idea to discuss any veterinary treatment you are planning on giving your dog with its veterinarian.

, You should get your dog's anxiety assessed by the veterinarian before using pheromones. Anxiety can have medical causes, so it's a good idea to have your dog looked over for medical issues that could be causing bad behavior.For example, if your dog has joint pain, it may cause it some distress that looks a lot like general anxiety. This pain can cause restlessness and difficulty sleeping. If the pain is managed, then the anxiety may go away.

Be realistic.,
Don’t hesitate to seek help.,
Keep your expectations reasonable.,
Start young.,
Do a test run.,
Build up to it.",How to Make Your Dog Like Your Cat1," Some animals will just never get along. If you already have a dog, think carefully before introducing a cat to your house. No matter how badly you may want a new furry friend, it is unfair to both animals to make such a big change without knowing how it could affect their quality of life. The American Humane Society suggests that a dog that becomes aggressive in the presence of a calm, still cat, or utterly loses her ability to concentrate on anything else, will probably never be able to live peacefully with a cat.;
, This is a difficult, sometimes impossible behavior to train, and if you are relatively inexperienced you may be in over your head. There are many professional dog trainers who can help assess your dog’s limits, and work with you to develop a more detailed strategy., This will likely be a slow process. Do not expect too much too soon, and do not be surprised if your animals exhibit animosity or fear., Puppies and kittens that grow up together have the best chance of getting along as adults. If your dog is already fully grown, consider getting a kitten instead of a cat. A kitten is less likely to be afraid of a dog, or to trigger your dog’s chase instincts by scampering., If you know someone who has a particularly even-tempered cat, or one that is already used to dogs, ask if you can bring your dog over for a controlled test. This will give you an idea of how difficult it will be to get your dog used to living with a cat.

, If you are certain you want to bring a cat into your home, start by bringing in things that smell like the cat—grooming supplies, beds, etc. Bring things like baby gates, litter boxes, food bowls, and scratching posts into your house before the cat, to give your dog time to get used to these objects.

Pick a specific pheromone product.,
Identify when the pheromone is needed.,
Use the pheromone product as directed.",How to Treat Dog Anxiety with Pheromone Therapy2," Once you have decided to use pheromones, you will need to find the right product to use. Look at the label to see if it is appropriate for your dog. Some products, such as collars, come in a variety of sizes, so pick the right one for your specific dog.


There are a wide variety of pheromone products available at pet stores and online retailers.
You will need to decide between a spray, a diffuser, wipes, drops, or a collar.

, If you are using pheromones to help your dog with anxiety, you will need to assess when the pheromone is needed. It's important to know when to apply the pheromone so that it helps your dog stay calm before the anxiety arises.


For example, if you know that your dog will have anxiety during a holiday when people shoot off fireworks, then give your dog pheromone therapy medication before the fireworks begin.
If you are using a pheromone collar, you may just keep it on your dog if it has general anxiety., Follow the instructions that came on the product's label. This will tell you how much to use and when to apply it if you bought a spray-on pheromone product. The diffuser products are usually just plugged in to an electrical plug near your dog's favorite spot.


If you have multiple pets in your house, it is still safe to use pheromones. There have been no reported negative side effects from pheromone therapy and the pheromones might even help your other pet's mental well-being also."
"
Assess whether the pheromone therapy is helping your dog.,
Use a combination of solutions.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Treat Dog Anxiety with Pheromone Therapy3," For some dogs, the pheromone will be enough to help them manage their bad behavior and anxiety. For other dogs, however, pheromones won't work or will not be enough treatment.You need to assess whether the pheromones are working and, if they are not, decide how to proceed.


If you don't feel that the pheromones are having a positive impact on your dog's anxiety level then you can discontinue their use. There is no need to continue to pay for a treatment that is not effective for your particular pet.

, Pheromones sometimes work best when used in combination with other efforts to help the animal. If you do not feel that the pheromone therapy alone is helping your dog enough, then you should continue to look for additional solutions to its anxiety. It may be that pheromones alone won't solve your dog's problems but a combination of tactics will help it immensely.


For example, if your dog is being destructive in the house, it may need a combination of training, more exercise, and pheromone therapy to help alleviate its issues. In fact, using pheromones while working on training may calm the dog in a way that helps it to absorb the training more effectively., If the pheromones don't work, don't give up. Take your dog back to its veterinarian or discuss the problems you are having with a professional animal behaviorist. They may be able to suggest other treatments that could work for your dog. If the anxiety is very strong, then your veterinarian may even suggest the alternative of giving your dog a prescription anti-anxiety medication instead of pheromone therapy.

Expose your puppy to new people and experiences between the ages of 3 to 12 weeks.,
Help your puppy to feel comfortable during exposure sessions.,
Use your best judgement when introducing your puppy to a new experience.,
Keep in mind that your puppy will be less accepting of new experiences as he gets older.,
Consider enrolling your puppy in a socialization class.",How to Socialize Your Dog1," Puppies from the age of 3 to 12 weeks are the most accepting of new experiences. During this time you should expose your puppy to as many new (but safe) situations as possible, such as other pets and animals, humans of various ages and sizes, vehicle rides, the outdoors, etc. A short checklist of things your puppy should be exposed to includes:Unfamiliar people of different genders, sizes, ages, and ethnicities. Have willing people pet and handle the puppy in a positive manner. Also, make sure your puppy is exposed to people wearing hats, jackets and boots.

Children. If you don’t have children in your house, bring your puppy to a park where children are playing (making sure it’s okay to bring a dog to this park.) Let the puppy see and hear the kids playing.
Other animals/pets. If you don’t have another pet, ask a friend with a cat or other pet if you can expose your puppy to their pets. Don’t have the puppy play with the pet but instead have the puppy sit calmly by your side as the pet goes about its business.

People doing different activities. Make sure your puppy is exposed to people using roller blades, wheel chairs, canes, exercising, jogging, and running.

Different walking/sitting surfaces. Let your puppy walk and sit on mud, slippery surfaces, carpet, tile, metal (like a veterinarian’s examination table), gravel, bridges, dirt, wood floors.

Noises. Some puppies can become frightened of vacuums, fans, hair dryers, bells, yelling, singing if they are not exposed to them.

Traveling. Especially in a car so veterinary and grooming appointments aren’t as stressful

Odd things. Some puppies may be frightened of odd things like plastic bags, umbrellas, rain coats, or baby strollers if they are not exposed to them while they are young.;
, Remember that everything is new and strange to your puppy. It’s your responsibility to introduce new things to your puppy in a calm, reassuring manner to help him acclimate to our world successfully. Take time to reassure your puppy and offer him treats to reward him for good behavior.Keep these exposure sessions short so that you do not overwhelm your puppy.

, Some experiences can overwhelm a puppy and make him scared. Don’t make a big deal of it, nor try to soothe your puppy as he might associate the attention with his fearful reaction. Instead walk him away from what is overwhelming him, go to a quiet area, and let him play with a favorite toy or just sit with him until he is calm. Once he is calm, you can gradually introduce him to these experiences so he has time to adapt to the novelty of the situation.If the situation is out of your control (like a large, noisy crowd) it is best to take him home. If it’s something less raucous try sitting in an out of the way spot with your puppy and let him be an observer.

, After about 12 weeks of age until around 18 weeks, your puppy’s acceptance of new experiences will begin to wear off and your puppy will become more cautious. This change is normal and helps the puppy learn to protect itself from danger when it’s no longer dependent upon its mother to protect it.

, Socialization classes are offered at community centers, veterinarian clinics, and large pet stores. These classes introduce puppies to many experiences including other puppies, people, dogs, and a variety of sights, sounds, smells, and equipment. Puppies are allowed off their leashes to play and play-fight with other puppies and with owners of the other puppies. This helps them to get to know other people and dogs and, through the other puppies, to learn to be gentle with their mouths.Basic obedience lessons are usually included in the socialization classes. Depending on the leader some classes include an introduction to sounds like traffic, construction sounds, and other odd sounds through use of CD’s or other means to help them to temper their fear response to these noises.

Choose an appropriate place.,
Choose a new pet that will fit with your old pet.,
Keep the meeting stress-free.,
Introduce the two animals.,
Give them both praise.",How to Keep Your Dog from Chasing Cats1," It's best to introduce the pets in your home. Bringing a dog to meet a cat at an animal shelter or vice versa may be extremely traumatic, particularly for the cat. For this reason, most animal experts recommend introducing your pets at home., If you're bringing home a cat to a home that's always been a dog's home (or vice versa), chances are the dog will be more likely to chase the cat, and the cat will be more likely to antagonize and even attack the dog. If you're adopting a new pet to live at home with an existing pet, ask the staff at the shelter or adoption office whether they have any cats that will get along with dogs or dogs that will get along with cats, as the case may be. This way you know that bringing home your new pet will be more of a minor adjustment period, rather than an agonizing project., Though it may be difficult to make the introductions a relatively stress-free occasion, it's important for the wellbeing of both animals. Some basic training and reward reinforcement can go a long way towards getting your two pets acquainted.Use treats for both the cat and dog. Choose treats that you know each animal will enjoy, though cats may be more picky. Try tuna or chunks of chicken as a desirable treat for your cat.Train your dog, or refresh his training, on key goals like learning to stay, come on command, and ""leave it"". This training should be done before your bring home a cat, or before you bring the dog home to a cat, as it will be crucial in getting your dog to disengage when he begins to chase or pester your cat.Take your dog running or let him run around a fenced-in yard before introducing the cat and dog. This will help take some of the energy out of your dog, making him less likely to chase the cat during their introduction., This should be done under strict supervision. Keep your dog on a short leash, and if he seems like he wants to chase the cat, keep both cat and dog distracted by feeding them their respective treats.It may be helpful to have a second person in the room, so that you can focus on one animal while the other person focuses on the other animal.


Allow the animals to sniff each other. You don't want to keep them on opposite ends of the room; aim to merely act as intermediary, in case either animal becomes aggressive., If both animals are behaving well, give them verbal praise, pet them, and give them extra treats.Going forward for the first few weeks, you may want to continue praising the animals whenever they behave calmly around one another."

Start with an interaction with a single dog.,
Vary walking routes to meet new dogs.,
Consider a dog park, if it's a safe option.,
Remove your dog from situations if it becomes aggressive or nervous.,
Praise your dog for remaining calm.,
Offer treats as a reward.,
Stay calm when your dog gets aggressive or nervous.,
Consider professional training.,

Start young if possible.,
Understand an adult dog may never learn to play with other dogs.",How to Socialize a Dog with Other Dogs," A socially mature dog, which is a dog between one and three years, will not enjoy playing in a large group of dogs if it is already socialized. Something like a dog park would be overwhelming for your dog. You should start with small, structured interactions with a single dog. Find a friend or family member with a dog that's appropriately socialized and take your dogs on a walk together.Find a friend with a gentle, easygoing dog. Have the dogs meet in a neutral location and then walk them together, keeping them at an appropriate distance.
If the dogs seem calm and well-behaved on their walk, allow them to gently sniff and interact with one another. If any aggressive behavior occurs, talk to both dogs in a soothing voice until they calm down.
After awhile, the two dogs may get to the point that their bodies and their tails are wagging in one another's presence. At this point, you can let them play together in an off-leash setting like a fenced in yard.;
, Part of the socialization process is introducing your dog to a variety of new animals and situations. Taking the same walking route each day will limit your dog's experiences. Take a different walking route each day so your dog can see new sights, smells, and dogs.Try a lot of different types of environments. A dog should be calm and well-behaved in a variety of places. Try sidewalks, walking paths, dirt roads, and concrete. Vary the amount of activity. Take your dog through a quiet neighborhood one day and a busy part of your city another day.
If possible, drive to an entirely different neighborhood certain days.

, Dog parks can be a great opportunity for a dog to socialize. However, your adult dog may not have been previously socialized. In this case, a dog park may cause it anxiety. If you know your dog has been previously socialized as a puppy, it may benefit from a trip to the dog park. You may not know a lot about your dog's history, especially if you got it at a shelter. If you're unsure whether your dog was previously socialized, keep an eye on its body language at a dog park. Keep your dog on a leash at the park until you get a read of its reactions.If your dog stays close to you, avoids other dogs, and growls at any point, a dog park is probably not a safe environment for it. Your dog may not have been previously socialized with other dogs, and may dislike being in large groups of dogs.
In this case, you should avoid dog parks as a means of socialization. Stick to controlled interactions with individual dogs.

, Barking, growling, and other aggressive behaviors are frequently thought of as a way of exerting dominance. Therefore, many people are inclined to punish these behaviors. However, these are actually fear-based behaviors. If your dog becomes aggressive during the socialization process, remove it from the situation and calm it down. This is more effective than punishment.Try to distract your dog when it barks at another animal. Call your dog's name or use a treat or a toy as a diversion.
Remove the dog from the situation. Get it at a safe distance from the other animal. From here, talk to your dog in a soothing voice until it calms down. Once your dog is calm, return it to the situation.

, Positive reinforcement works better than punishment when you're socializing a dog. When you walk your dog, especially in new environments, praise your dog.Remember, an older dog may never be entirely friendly or enthusiastic about other dogs. The goal is to reward calm behavior and not necessarily playful behavior.
On a walk, each time your dog passes another dog without incident, praise your dog. Offer verbal praise and also give your dog a small pat on the head.
You do not need to encourage your dog to interact with each dog it meets. This is not necessarily an effective form of socialization. Leash interactions can be stressful for both dogs. Simply work on getting your dog to walk by without incident.

, Treats or food are a great way to reward your dog for positive behavior. In situations where you're likely to bring other dogs, bring a bag of small treats. Each time your dog behaves in the presence of another dog, reward it with a small treat. Offer verbal praise as well.Remember to reward right away. Dogs live in the immediate. You need to make sure they understand why they are being rewarded.

, Socialization of an adult dog can be difficult. It will take awhile for your dog to remain calm in the presence of other animals. In the event your dog gets aggressive or nervous, the worst thing you can do is panic. The dog will interpret your anxiety as a sign it is right to be afraid. Try to remain calm in the face of aggressive behavior.A dog needs to assess a situation for itself and determine how to react. If you react before your dog has a chance to, you will affect its behavior.
Do not change your behavior at all when you near another dog. Avoid tensing up your body, tightening the leash, or talking to the dog in a nervous voice. Keep walking as you were before and let your dog choose how it reacts.
In the event your dog does become aggressive, remember not to punish it. Simply remove your dog from the situation until it calms down.

, It is not easy to socialize an adult dog. This is especially true if your dog has other behavioral issues. If you're struggling to socialize your dog, professional training may be beneficial.You can either join a group class, designed to socialize dogs, or have one-on-one sessions with a dog trainer.
Make sure you find a trainer that applies positive reinforcement as a training technique.

, Fear-based behaviors will only be reinforced with punishment. Displays of aggression such as growling are almost always due to fear. Punishment will only reinforce your dog's belief it needs to be afraid.Instead of punishing your dog, offer an alternative command. For example, immediately say, ""Sit"" when your dog begins barking or growling at another dog.
Avoid putting your dog in situations where it may get scared. Do not force a dog to approach a friend or family member's dog if it appears nervous.

, Socialization can be stressful for adult dogs. As you socialize your dog, be vigilant for aggressive or fearful behavior. Socialization is only successful if it's a pleasant experience for you and your dog. If a dog is scared, you should not push the situation.For example, you bring your dog to a friend's house to meet another dog. Your dog stays close to your side, and its body appears tense.
Your dog is not enjoying itself. You may want to separate the dogs and try again when your dog is more calm. If your dog has negative experiences during the socialization process, this can reverse some progress.

, Ideally, the socialization process should start when your dog is a puppy. Puppies are generally less fearful and tend to respond to new situations with curiosity rather than fear. A puppy may be more easygoing somewhere like a dog park than an adult dog. If you do get your dog when its still a puppy, begin socialization as soon as possible., Many people adopt adult dogs from shelters. These dogs may or may not have been socialized as puppies. If your dog has not been previously socialized, it may never be enthusiastic about playing with other dogs. Keep your expectations realistic. Strive to keep your dog calm and non-aggressive in front of animals rather than overtly friendly and playful."

Master the basics.,
Have a reward marker.,
Teach your dog the command “leave it.” This behavior is trickier to teach than those mentioned above, and many dog-owners neglect it.",How to Make Your Dog Like Your Cat2," Learning to get along with cats is a high bar for many dogs to clear; they are simply hard-wired to chase small, furry things. If your dog is poorly trained this process will the doomed from the start. At a minimum your dog should reliably obey commands to sit, stay, lie down, heel, and come when called. If he or she does not, it is strongly advised that you Teach Your Dog Basic Commands before you continue.

, If you have ever watched a professional dog trainer at work, you have probably seen them use a clicker.The sound a clicker makes is called a reward marker. It tells your dog, “what you just did was great, and you’re going to get a treat for it!” This ensures that she understands exactly what behavior she is being rewarded for. You can use the word “yes” (or another word of your choosing) if you prefer, but a clicker is the most effective tool, because it is a sound your dog is unlikely hear in any other context. This is relatively simple to teach, and if you follow the instructions in the article Clicker Train Your Dog, your dog should figure it out pretty quickly.

, It is one of the most useful tools you can have in your obedience arsenal, however. It will enable you to stop your dog from engaging in dangerous, destructive, or generally unwanted behavior, and will be invaluable in teaching him or her to interact safely with a cat. As with any behavior, you will need to start simple, then gradually introduce elements of difficulty as your dog masters the basic concept."
"
Seek help from an animal behaviorist or veterinarian.,
Use a muzzle and head halter to control your dog.,
Ask a friend to help you introduce your dog to their dog.,
Select a neutral space to make the introduction.,
Introduce your dog to your friend’s dog.,
Observe your dog’s behavior.,
Distract your dog and offer treats to defuse any tension.,
Contact a professional if your dog shows extreme aggression or if he does not improve with time.",How to Socialize Your Dog2," If you have an older puppy or a dog which was poorly socialized as a puppy you will have to work with the dog to get it to be an acceptable canine citizen. Dogs that were raised as “puppy mill” breeding dogs, those which had poor puppy socialization, or who were raised from birth away from other dogs often become poorly socialized adult dogs.


Before you try to socialize an adult dog, you should seek the advice of an animal behaviorist or a veterinarian with training in dog socialization. Your local humane society may have an animal behaviorist on staff or a college of veterinary medicine will have trained behaviorists.If your dog shows any tendency to bite or be aggressive with another dog, do not attempt to socialize him on your own. Contact a professional. It is better to admit that you need help with your dog than to have him injure, maim, or kill another animal or even a human.
Do not attempt to socialize your dog unless you are capable of maintaining absolute physical control of your dog at all times. If you are unable or unwilling to do so, do not attempt to socialize your dog.

, To prevent your dog from biting another dog or a human, use muzzle and a head halter or gentle leader. The muzzle covers your dog’s mouth and the head collar attaches to the muzzle to help you control him better. The head collar fits around the muzzle and behind the ears of the dog. It applies gentle pressure and allows you to have control over the dog with subtle leash control.


Consider getting a basket muzzle instead of a nylon muzzle. A basket muzzle will allow your dog to pant, which is how dogs stay cool. He can also drink water while wearing a basket muzzle.Get your dog used to wearing the muzzle and head halter within the confines of your house before you bring the dog outside wearing these items. Follow the directions that come with your particular head halter.
You can also fit your dog with a harness so that you can also use that if needed to control your dog.

, You will need to have both dogs on leashes and kept about 10 feet away from each other, so it is necessary to have two people on hand to make the introduction. Only attempt to introduce your dog to a dog that is friendly to other dogs and that is under the control of an owner that you know well., Do not try to introduce your dogs in your house or in your back yard. These spaces are your existing dog’s territory and he is more likely to be aggressive when he is in them. Choose a neutral space like a friend’s backyard (not the dog owner friend’s backyard) or a nearby dog park., Walk up to your friend, with your dog next to you (on his leash). Do not allow your dogs to get too close. Stand so that you and your friend are between them. If your dog growls, turn around and walk away. Make your dog sit with his back to the other dog until he calms down. When he does calm down, reward him with a quiet “good boy.”


Depending on the dog, this process may need to be repeated for a few days to a few weeks.
Keep both dogs on leashes and separated from each other during this process. Make sure that your friend keeps his dog on its leash and stands about 10 feet away from you in the beginning and after any aggressive reactions. Increase the distance if necessary., Watch both dogs to see what they do when they are introduced, but pay special attention to your dog. If you notice that your dog looks relaxed and happy, then you should be able to bring him closer as long as your friend’s dog also seems relaxed and happy. If one or both dogs is displaying signs of aggression (baring teeth, growling, tense posture), then you should move them further apart.Watch for signs, such as play bows (putting out the front paws and lowering the head and shoulders) and a relaxed stance. These signs indicate that he is feeling playful rather than aggressive.

, If your dog becomes aggressive, stop the introduction by moving the dogs away from each other and distracting the dogs with a treat. Talk to your dog in a soothing voice and try to calm him down. Do not allow the dogs to get closer to each other if either one seems aggressive.If the first attempt resulted in aggressive behavior from one or both dogs, increase the distance between the dogs and try to introduce the dogs again.
If your dog does not have a positive reaction by the time you have attempted to introduce him to another dog for 15 minutes, stop and try again another day. You may have to do this several times before your dog has a positive reaction to the other dog.

, If your dog does not show any signs of acceptance after several attempts to introduce him to another dog or if his aggression is severe (lunging, growling, barking, etc.), contact an animal behaviorist or certified professional dog trainer."

Invite people over often.,
Take your dog on frequent walks.,
Use a muzzle if your dog bites.,
Seek help if your dog’s behavior does not improve.",How to Socialize Your Dog3," To keep your dog socialized, you will need to continue to introduce him to new people and animals. Making sure that your dog has regular exposure to many different types of people and animals will help to maintain the work you have done to socialize him. You can also use ongoing socialization as a way to help your dog conquer his fears about certain people or objects.


For example, if your dog has a fear of men with beards, invite a couple of bearded men over to dinner. After your dog has gotten used to how they look, have them feed your dog a few treats. This will help your dog to feel more comfortable with bearded men., Walking your dog is a great way to socialize him and get him used to new sights and sounds. Try to take your dog for a short walk around your neighborhood every day. Take different routes every day to expose your dog to new sights and sounds.Try finding a quiet bench in the park and allow your dog to observe the sights and sounds around him.

, If your dog is aggressive and prone to biting, you should use a muzzle whenever new people or animals will be present. This will help prevent your dog from seriously injuring or even killing another animal or person. Muzzles are also great training tools because they allow your dog to experience new people and animals in a low-risk way., Some dogs may not respond well to socialization efforts. If your dog does not improve with continued socialization efforts, seek the help of an animal behaviorist or certified professional dog trainer. Ask your veterinarian for a referral if you are not sure where to look.Consider group training or one-on-one training for your dog. Ongoing obedience training is a great way to get your dog to behave around other animals and people. Taking your dog to group obedience classes can also help to introduce him to new animals and people, but many dog trainers offer one-on-one sessions as well."
"
Hold a treat in each hand.,
Say ""Leave it."",
Praise and reward your dog.,
Repeat the process.,
Begin using ""leave it"" around your cat.",How to Keep Your Dog from Chasing Cats2," Only let your dog sniff one hand. He will most likely become excited when he realizes that the treat is for him, but it's important to ignore his attempts at getting the treat., The most important part of this exercise is to ignore your dog until he stops actively trying to get the treat. Keep saying ""leave it"" until he responds to your command. It may take a moment, but eventually he should give up and sit in front of you., Once your dog has stopped pursuing the treat he knew you had, say ""good boy,"" and give him the treat from your other hand. It's important that you not give your dog the treat used when you say ""leave it,"" as this will only teach your dog that he will eventually get whatever you tell him to leave., It's important to be consistent in your training. Repeat the process until your dog immediately backs away from your hand when you tell him to leave it., Once your dog has mastered the ""leave it"" command, you can begin to use that command around your cat. You should still be cautious and supervise both animals, as your dog may have learned to leave a treat but may be less willing to leave something he perceives as prey. Be patient, and continue training until your dog learns to leave the cat alone on command.

"
"
Buy a training clicker.,
Introduce your dog to the clicker.,
Immediately give him a treat.,
Mimic the cat's movement.,
Celebrate your dog's progress.",How to Keep Your Dog from Chasing Cats3," A clicker is a small plastic ""box"" with a retractable metal tongue, which can be used as an aid in behavior training. A trainer holds the clicker in the palm of her hand and rapidly presses the button, causing a clicking sound, and the dog becomes conditioned to hearing a clicker every time he does something good.Training clickers can be purchased at many pet stores and online.

, The clicker should only be used when your dog is behaving the way you want him to, and it should be activated immediately, in response to his good behavior. You want your dog to associate his good behavior (in this case, not chasing the cat) with the sound of your clicker., The final component in clicker training is giving your dog a treat immediately after the click. Response time is imperative, as your dog needs to associate his good behavior with the clicking sound, and the clicking sound with a treat., As you progress in your training, you may want to gradually incorporate an added challenge wherein you mimic the cat's movement. This will help your dog more easily adjust to the real scenarios that may arise as your dog and cat adjust to one another.


While he is paying attention to you, begin to suddenly move backwards at a rapid pace.Stop suddenly. If your dog stops and sits rather than chasing you, use the clicker and give him a reward., He won't learn a new way to behave overnight. But with time, your dog will learn to complete part of the task you're trying to teach (in this case, not chasing after cats). It's important to reward even partial progress, or steps, towards meeting that goal, because in order to break your dog's instinctual behavior you are, essentially, breaking down the components of that behavior. Any time your dog starts to chase the cat but stops, use the clicker and give him a reward. Eventually he should be able to break the habit of chasing cats altogether."
"
Keep your dog on a leash.,
Confine your dog to your yard.,
Keep cats out of your yard.",How to Keep Your Dog from Chasing Cats4," If your dog has a tendency to chase cats in your neighborhood, it's best to keep your dog on a leash during walks. If you feel inclined to let your dog off-leash during walks, you should do so only in places where you know there will be no cats around, such as a dog park or a quiet place away from other homes. You should also try to only let your dog off-leash at the park during times when you know there will be no cats around. Remember that cats are most active at dusk and dawn, as they often come out to hunt during the night.Use the ""leave it"" method on your dog during walks. Even though your dog is on a leash, he may still try to run and pull on the leash whenever he sees a cat. Teaching him to leave it when he sees a cat will help take the stress out of walking your dog in a cat-friendly neighborhood.If your dog pulls hard or barks while on his leash, he may have what's known as leash aggression. Put simply, he perceives that you're anxious about how he'll react to an animal, and he assumes that animal is a threat. To train your dog out of this, practice getting your dog's attention no matter what is happening around you. Reward him when he keeps his eyes on you. Start out in a low-stress environment, such as your home, and gradually work toward keeping your dog focused on you (and on the treat he'll come to expect) no matter what other animals are around on your walk.Another crucial skill to teach your dog if you plan to let him roam off-leash is to come when called. Try teaching your dog to come while you run away from him, as he will almost inevitably chase after you. This will make it easier for him to learn this command early on in his training, as he will associate your praise with his following after you. Reward him with treats and praise whenever he comes on command., If you have a yard at your home and you'd like to let your dog run freely in the yard, be sure that you either erect a fence around your property, or use a a tether and leash to keep your dog from leaving your yard. This will help ensure that your dog does not chase any outdoor cats that live in your neighborhood., If your neighbors have an outdoor cat that tends to get in your yard, the best way to keep your dog from chasing that cat is to keep it out of your yard. You can manually chase the cat away whenever you see it come into your yard, or use motion-activated water sprays along the perimeter of your yard. These devices detect movement and spray the target with water, which can be an excellent deterrent against intruding cats."
"
Understand why dogs chase cats.,
Always supervise the animals.,
Use timeouts when your dog chases the cat.,
Make cats undesirable for your dog.,
Consider working with a trainer or behaviorist.",How to Keep Your Dog from Chasing Cats5," The primary reasons a dog chases cats are because the dog wants to play with the cat (perhaps thinking it's another dog), or because the cat's movement triggers your dog's predator/prey instincts.Both scenarios require you as the owner to step in whenever necessary to prevent the animals from harming one another. Even if your dog is trying to play with the cat, it's possible that he may play too aggressively, and may try to chase or bite the cat as a means of playing with her. If your dog is chasing the cat for predatory reasons, it's even more important for you to step in, as your dog could easily kill your cat, and your cat could seriously injure your dog., The training and adjusting period will most likely take a while. Eventually, once your cat and dog have become accustomed to one another, it may be safe to leave the animals alone together unsupervised, but that will take at least a month, most likely longer. The important thing is to ensure that the animals will not harm one another if left alone., Any time your dog breaks the training and chases your cat, you may want to consider putting him in a time out. Timeouts should never be harmful to the dog; rather, you simply want to remove him from the situation, letting him know that he behaved badly in that situation.Choose a timeout room, and use that room consistently for timeouts. Someplace isolated, like a bathroom, would work well.But be sure that the room is not uncomfortable. For example, an unheated basement in winter would be a bad timeout location. Likewise, an unventilated or un-air-conditioned room in summer would be a bad timeout location.
Calmly say the word, ""timeout,"" when your dog begins to chase the cat.Gently lead your dog by the collar out of the room where he chased the cat and into the chosen timeout room.Wait a short while - about a minute or two should be sufficient - and then calmly release your dog from the timeout room. If he repeats his bad behavior, calmly and promptly return him to the timeout room., If none of your training has worked, you may want to make cats less desirable for your dog. This should only be done as a last resort, and should not involve injuring or harming your dog in any way. Experts recommend simply making your dog associate chasing a cat with a mildly unpleasant experience, like an annoying sound or a gentle repulsive spray scent like citrus.Even a spray bottle filled with clean, cold water may be enough to deter your dog. Over time, your dog will come to associate his chasing of the cat with, say, an unpleasant burst of (dog-safe) citrus spray or a quick blast of cold water to the face, and he will no longer wish to chase the cat.

, If nothing else has worked in deterring your dog from chasing the cat, you may want to consider working with a specialist. Make sure that the specialist you work with is certified, such as a certified professional dog trainer (CPDT) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist. Though it will take many sessions, a certified specialist with education and training in animal behavior will be able to determine what is driving your dog to chase the cat, and what can be done to break him of that habit.You can find CPDTs and board-certified veterinary behaviorists by searching online for a specialist in your area. Make sure you check a specialist's references, and look for online reviews from other dog owners who have worked with that specialist."

Start in a neutral outdoor area.,
Make the introduction in your home, using a baby gate to keep the two in separate rooms.,
Use a crate to keep the two separate during their introduction.",How to Make Your Dog Like Your Cat3," Your dog thinks of your home as her territory, and may feel threatened and defensive if a new animal is suddenly brought in. It can be helpful to begin outside, with the cat in a pen and your dog on a leash.Start at a distance and gradually approach the pen with your dog. When you get close enough that she notices the cat, stop.
Let your dog look at the cat for a few seconds, then say your dog’s name. When she looks at you, click and treat. Repeat this process—let her look at the cat, say her name, and reward her when she looks at you. The idea is for her to associate remaining calm at the sight of the cat with being rewarded.
If your dog is too distracted by the sight of the cat to focus, move away from the cat until your dog will reliably look at you every time you say her name.
Gradually move closer to the pen, continuing this process as you go. Make sure you give your dog plenty of treats; it’s important that you make good behavior more rewarding than bad behavior.
Keep practicing until your dog can do this while standing right next to the cat’s pen. Be patient. The amount of time you will need to spend on this will vary depending on your dog.

, This is a good option if you are unable to have them meet in a neutral area, or if your cat is distressed by being in a pen outside.


Get the cat set up in a designated room of the house that the dog does not have access to. Put his bed, water and food bowls, scratching post, liter box, and toys in this room. The idea is to create a space that feels safe to him. Give him at least a couple days to acclimate before you begin introducing the dog.
Put your dog on a leash and fill your pockets with her favorite treats, as well as a couple treats for your cat. The door to the cat’s room should be open, but blocked by a baby gate. For the first couple days, just practice walking past the door with your dog. Click and treat for a calm demeanor, and throw your cat a treat as well to help it associate the dog’s presence with good things happening.
Practice basic obedience with your dog in proximity to the cat. You want your dog to become used to keeping her focus on you even in the cat’s presence, and your cat to see your dog as non-threatening. If your dog is too distracted to focus on you, move further away from the cat until you have her attention. Move gradually closer as she gets used to this activity.

, Only use this option if your dog is crate-trained—if she does not have positive associations with being crated, she will probably become too worked up to learn effectively.


Have your dog go into her crate and shut the door. Bring the cat into the room. Your dog may start whining, yipping, pawing at the door, or even growling. Let her react in whatever way is natural to her. Again, let the cat set the pace of this interaction. If he does not want to approach the crate, do not force him. Click and treat for moments of silence or calmness from your dog.
Let them do what they want for 10 or 15 minutes, and then separate them. Continue these training sessions until your dog remains calm in the cat’s presence. At this point, proceed following the steps described above.

"
"
Let the cat set the pace.,
Keep your dog on a loose leash, but be ready to react if she tries to chase the cat.,
Continue this practice for a few weeks.,
When you feel absolutely confident, take your dog off the leash.",How to Make Your Dog Like Your Cat4," When he is comfortable enough to become curious, he will approach the baby gate to investigate when you walk by with your dog. If both animals seem calm and curious when interacting through the gate, you are ready to try having them in the same room.

, This would be an appropriate time to use the command “leave it.” If your dog begins whining or getting agitated and excited, remove the cat to its room and practice basic obedience with your dog until she calms down.

, Do not attempt letting your dog interact with your cat off-leash until you are absolutely confident that she will not become aggressive or chase the cat. This will undo a huge amount of the progress you have made.

, Continue to keep a close eye on both animals. Be sure to click and reward your dog for any positive behavior.

Train your dog not to bite.,
Be stern, but patient.,
Teach your dog more complex commands.",How to Train a Timid Dog," Your dog will not obey you if he doesn't trust you. To instill trust, you must show the dog that when something scary happens, it is going to be okay. Be patient. Give your dog space, and your dog will come on its own.;
, Never confuse empathy with allowing your dog to be dominant. Your dog doesn't determine what happens. You do. You must establish yourself as the alpha, which that means that your calmness and assertiveness are the keys to unlocking your dog's happier, more obedient self. When something scary happens, you need to project a calm and assertive energy.


Don't reward timidness or fear. Dogs can sense your energy. If your dog becomes afraid or scared, and you instantly begin petting him and making a fuss over him, you are now rewarding that undesirable behavior. Too much compassion can harm your dog's development even more.

, Your dog needs to be confident while still realizing that you are the alpha in this relationship. Remember: confidence is not dominance. To build this kind of confidence, you must introduce the dog to new situations where he can observe and learn from other confident dogs and people without feeling threatened. This can take the form of obedience training, obstacle courses, or breed-specific skills training.


Start off small and ensure that your dog achieves small successes. Each of these small successes build self-confidence, helping manifest a more confident and happy dog.
To do this, the dog has to experience many new situations every day. Even just walking down a busy street can help expose your dog to new activities that will help desensitize him to the world.
Remain calm and assertive throughout the process. If your dog senses that you are anxious or reacting negatively to his fear, it will only perpetuate his fear. Never deal with a timid dog when you are feeling short-tempered or distracted. Any dog, especially one that has such low self-esteem, is extremely sensitive to what you do.

, Hold a few dog treats in your hand and give him a few treats when he comes near you. This will teach him that you don't want to hurt him, and that being with his owners is rewarding. Praying your dog by saying ""Good boy!"" can eventually take over for treats. You dog will learn to admire you, and showing that you appreciate him goes along way.


Look for treats that are healthy, made without the use of any preservatives. Make sure that they're grain-free, and that they contain meat.

, Once your dog has started building a little bit of self-confidence by mastering new stimuli, you must ensure that he doesn't plateau or grow bored. New experiences are key. Whether there is a fair in town, or you take your dog to a new dog park, mastering unfamiliar stimuli is potentially the most important way for your dog to make progress. Over time, each success will build your dog's confidence.


Be patient. Eventually, this integration with the world can lead to a significantly less timid dog, one who can appreciate his surroundings without fear clouding his behavior.

, Your dog deserves the best version of you and you cannot be the best version of yourself if you are not prepared to have a calm, assertive mindset every time you work with your dog. Never give up on your dog. There is always hope. You may even find that as you help your dog achieve a calmer and happier state of mind, you ease your own mind.

, A leash is essential, since an unleashed shy dog will evade you as soon as he gets the chance. Getting a leash clipped onto a shy dog is a feat in itself. You may have to climb under the table or wherever the shy dog is hiding and reach gently to hook the leash without looking the dog in the eye. Pet the dog under the chin and speak brightly, without making eye contact, once you've clipped the leash.


Get up and walk confidently away, saying ""come!"" happily while holding the leash. Do not look at him, but look forward. Pull your timid dog gently along behind you. Try coaxing him out with the promise of a treat.
Don't even try working on any commands until your shy dog will follow you around without dragging on the leash. Once he's following you reliably, reach to pet him without making eye contact, and reward with plenty of treats.

, This is especially important with timid dogs. Never hit or hurt an animal to indicate bad behavior. Instead, use sharp sounds like ""Hey!"" or ""No."" Reinforce good behavior as much possible. Praise your dog with a relaxed, soothing tone, much like the voice you'd use to calm a crying baby. Make sure to have plenty of training treats on hand, and to give him lots of encouragement when he does the right thing.

, This is best taught right away. Once your dog is comfortable with you being near him and touching him, you can begin the training process. If your dog still pees in the house, yelling at him might affect his trust for you. Instead of yelling, watch your dog all the time so that you can catch him peeing in the house. As soon as he starts peeing, pick him up and bring him outside so he can continue to do his business there. Give him a treat every time that he pees outside, or continues to pee outside.


Give your dog plenty of time outside, especially if he is a larger dog. Give him time to pick his own spot to relive himself.
If you have a much larger dog and you can't pick him up, take the dog out more often. If you catch the dog peeing in the house, give a firm No, but do not yell. Lead the dog outside and reward the dog for continuing outside.

, If you already own a confident dog, this can smooth the training process. A shy dog will mimic a confident dog. Take them both out into an enclosed yard or living room, and bring lots of treats. Sit on the ground, and call your confident dog over by saying ""come."" Reward with a treat.


You may need to bring your timid dog out on a leash. You may need to gently drag him. The important thing is you establish a comfortable, low-pressure dynamic. Let your timid dog get used to sharing a space with both you and the more confident dog.
If your shy dog even takes a few steps toward you, reward him by throwing a treat toward him. Gradually throw the treats closer and closer to you, until the dog will come all the way to you!
Sitting on the ground makes you less scary, and the dog will be more likely to want to approach you. With a very shy dog, you may have to lay flat on the ground!

, Remember that you should never get angry or violent with your dog. Your timid dog will lose his trust for you if you hit him even once. If you catch him biting your clothes, hands, toes, or anything you're holding, grab his snout and rebuke him with a firm No.""


Don't hold on for too long–just enough that he gets the message. Don't grab too tight, and do not hurt the dog. You don't want him to feel threatened, you only want him to stop biting you.
Remember that biting is natural for dogs. If your dog is biting you, it doesn't mean that he doesn't like you. Do not be offended. Try to understand where your dog is coming from.

, Speak directly to your dog, in a commanding voice: ""Max, sit."" If he sits, reward him with a treat. If he does not sit, repeat the command firmly without elevating your voice or losing your composure until he sits.


When you are just beginning to train, you may need to show your dog that you want him to sit. Give the command, then push on his rear just enough that he relaxes and sits. Reward and repeat.

, As your dog becomes more comfortable interacting with you, your household, and the outside world, you can begin to train the dog to sit, come, stay, roll over, and beyond. Base your training on a reward system. Keep your dog thinking that what he is doing is good and that you are pleased with his behavior. It's much easier to train your dog to behave well than to punish for behaving poorly. Dogs don't respond to punishment, but they do respond to treats!


Consider bringing your dog to obedience school. A structured, rewarding learning environment can help some dogs progress much more quickly.
Consider visiting obedience-training tutorial websites. Look for YouTube tutorials. Some experienced dog trainers have posted step-by-step videos or instructions on how to teach your dog various tricks.

Develop your cues.,
Place yourself with your back to your dog, standing as described above.

,
Reach through your legs with a treat.,
With the treat, lure your dog forward until he is standing between your legs.,
Let your dog nibble or lick at the treat in your hand.,
Practice 10 times a day.,
Once your dog has mastered this trick, continue to practice it during sessions as a review, but don't push it.

",How to Train Your Dog to Play Peekaboo," For this trick, you will need a verbal cue: ""Peekaboo!"" You will also need a hand/body signal, in which you will stand with your hands on your hips and your legs spread apart.;
,, This could be a piece of hotdog or maybe a bit of cooked chicken, beef, or liver. You should always keep him guessing what the next treat will be so he will be motivated to do his best. To do this, you must vary the treats (example: first a cheese square, next some chicken, then bit of hot dog). You should never use dog food as a treat because your dog won't get as excited about dog food.

, If your dog is scared to be between your legs, don't force him. This trick requires him to be in a submissive stance between your legs, which requires trust. Allow enough leash for him to back out if necessary. Making things complicated, raising your voice, or forcing him to do the trick will just be a setback. He will be confused and he won't want to try again. Build trust and bond with your dog before you attempt this trick again.

, Praise him by saying, ""Good peekaboo"" and encourage him to stay in this position for 10 seconds. If he backs out, squeezing with your legs to keep him in position will only frighten him.

, Within a week your dog should start to understand this trick. Dog trainer Kyra Sundance says, ""Don't be surprised if this becomes his favorite way of getting your attention!""

Use a marker sound.Marker sounds are sounds that please the dog and let it know it has done something right.,
Practice the marker sound.The goal of using a marker sound, whether it’s a word or a clicker, is for the dog to create a positive association with the sound.,
Find a treat your dog likes.",How to Train a Dog to Stand Up1," The marker sound could be a word or a sound. The most common marker words are “Yes!” or “Good dog!” Marker sounds are usually made by a clicker, a small hand-held device that helps in dog training.


You can obtain a clicker at most local pet stores.
While you can use either a clicker or a word/phrase when deciding on a marker sound, clickers tend to be used by professional trainers and show dogs, while marker words offering enthusiasm and praise are more common for regular pets.
You could use both together. However, whatever sound you choose, ensure you do it the same every time. In other words, don’t say “Yes!” one time, then “Awesome!” another time. If you use both a clicker and marker word, don’t change it up and start using just one or just the other.;
, To do this, “ambush” your dog with your chosen marker sound 10-15 times each day for about a week.


When your dog is sitting down, playing outside, chasing its tail, or doing any other activity, deploy your marker sound and then immediately give your dog a tasty treat.
This way, your dog will associate the sound with a tasty snack and the good feeling that goes along with it.

, There are many dog treats available in pet stores. Popular treats include peanut butter, sausage, sweet potato, and bacon flavored treats. Let your dog sample a variety to discover which it likes best. The more enthusiastic your dog is about receiving a treat, the more willing he or she will be to learn to stand.


Avoid treats with artificial colors, artificial preservatives, and added sugars.
Treats made with organic ingredients are best.
If a sweetener is added, it should be natural, not corn syrup or sugar.Your doggie will love natural sweeteners like applesauce, molasses, and agave nectar.
All treats should be bite-sized.

Have realistic expectations.,
Prevent your dog from chasing your cat.,
Supervise all interactions.,
Respect your pets’ boundaries.,
Stay calm.,
Make sure the cat never feels trapped.",How to Make Your Dog Like Your Cat5," No matter how badly you want your dog and cat to love each other, you may never get them to do anything but tolerate each other. If they are already at odds, even that may not be realistic. First impressions are crucial to helping a dog and a cat live together in harmony, and once they’ve taken a dislike to each other it is very hard to reverse the relationship. Some of the methods described above could be used with animals already living in the same home, but it is important to remember that you cannot change an animal’s nature, and you cannot force two animals to be friends any more than you can force two humans., This is the most important facet of keeping the peace between dogs and cats. Allowing your dog to discover how fun it is to chase cats will give her positive reinforcement for behavior you do not want, and make her much more difficult to train.It will also make your cat see your dog as a thing to be feared. Be firm and consistent, and make sure your dog obeys “leave it” without hesitation.

, Until you are positive beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can be trusted, never leave a cat and a dog alone together. An altercation between them while you are gone could undo all the progress you have made. Always err on the side of caution if you are not 100% certain.

, Forcing them to interact will only cause your animals to associate being around each other with unpleasant feelings, and make them more likely to lash out.

, If you are tense and on-edge, your animals will sense it, and it will make them nervous as well. Keep cool, and if you, your dog, or your cat become upset, separate your animals and come back to training when you are all calm.

, A cat doesn’t understand the concept of a leash, and keeping your dog restrained will not necessarily make the cat feel any more at ease. An animal that feels trapped is a desperate animal, and if the cat does not feel he can get away to a dog-free area, he may lash out or flee.

Ask your dog to sit.Your dog should sit one to three feet away from you.,
Hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose.Get some treats that your dog really likes.,
Bring the treat toward you.Always move the treat directly out and away from the dog’s nose.,
Give your dog the treat.,
Add a verbal cue.,
Use the command.",How to Train a Dog to Stand Up2," It should be leaning on its front legs and sitting on its back legs. This will allow it to rise easily to a standing position.


If your dog cannot sit, teach your dog to sit before it learns to stand. Getting a dog to stand requires that it is sitting or lying down.
If you don’t want to train your dog to sit, you could simply wait for it to sit (or lie down) on its own before ordering it to stand.

, Grip the treat between your thumb, middle, and index fingers so your dog can see it. Place the treat about six to ten inches away from your dog’ nose.

, When moving it, do not raise it above the level of the dog’s nose or your doggie might be confused and think you’re taking the treat away.

, As you bring your hand toward you, your dog should track it with its eyes at first, then get up off its haunches to follow the treat. As soon as your dog rises, drop the treat so the dog can eat it. You could also choose to hand-feed the treat directly to your dog.


Praise your dog for standing and taking the treat.You might say encouraging phrases like “Good dog!” or “Wow, you did great!”
If your dog does not immediately rise when you move the treat away from it, encourage your dog to get up by patting your thigh or making a kissing sound.

, Once your dog is trained well enough that it will stand when you offer it a treat, add a verbal cue to reinforce the action. Say this phrase or word as soon as you extend your hand in front of the dog’s nose to offer the treat.


Since you want your dog to stand, it makes sense to use a word like “Stand” or “Up” as your verbal command.Your verbal cues should always be clear, direct, and confident. Speak clearly and forcefully so your dog responds immediately.

, Once your dog knows how to stand, you can use it in a number of situations. For instance, you could get your dog to stand (and come to you) when it is sitting in a location you don’t want it to be, like in front of a door or on the sofa. You could also use it at the vet’s office to help your vet check for responsiveness, or to examine the dog’s legs. It’s also a useful command when you want to brush your dog.Any time your dog is sitting somewhere and you want it to move somewhere else, the first step is always getting it to stand.

Start early.,
Know your breed.,
Know your dog.,
Get to know dog body language.,
Expose your adult dog to another dog in a relaxed, controlled setting.,
Don’t force your dog to socialize.,
Try visiting a pet store.",How to Make Your Dog Get Along With Other Dogs1," Socialization, or introducing your dog to people, other animals, and places, should start during puppyhood. When the process starts early, the results are longer lasting and more deeply engrained. Your dog will also be happier and more comfortable with everything it comes across in the human world.Dogs are most receptive to socialization training at 8 to 12 weeks. During this time, start getting your puppy used to going on nature walks, going downtown, or other places with lots of sights and smells.
Carry treats on you, and use them to reinforce good behavior and create positive associations with social situations.
Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations before letting it interact with other animals, especially at dog parks and places where other dogs go to the bathroom. Don’t bring a puppy less than 6 months old to a dog park.;
, If you don’t know your dog’s breed or mix of breeds, then find out. Do some research on that breed: find out why it was developed and learn about its heritage. Some breeds are more docile by nature, while others are typically less tolerant of being around other dogs.Dogs bred for protection make great guard dogs, but don’t always get along with other dogs and aren’t usually recommended for casual or inexperienced owners. These include mastiffs, Great Danes, Dobermans, German Shepherds, and Rottweilers.
Despite their typically small frames, terriers often have difficulty getting along with other pets.
Breeds including bulldogs, bull terriers, and pit bulls make great pets when they have strong, firm owners willing to put the time into training them. However, they can be aggressive or even dangerous around other dogs, especially smaller breeds.

, While you should know the general characteristics associated with your dog’s breed, it’s also essential to get to know your particular dog and its personality. Note how your dog interacts with you, your family, and any others with whom it might interact. Notice if your dog seems at ease with people, if it generally gets stressed out, or if it is typically aggressive with others.Keep in mind your dog’s background, too, noting in particular if you rescued your dog, if it was abused or neglected, or if it was in any other anxiety-provoking situations.
Depending on your dog’s breed and personality, you might find that you’ll have to avoid interactions with other dogs. All dogs have unique personalities and histories, and some are just intolerant of being around other dogs., Learn how to distinguish playfulness from anxiety or fear. Observe your dog to see when and why they exhibit particular body language. Look for how it responds to triggers and stimuli like a doorbell or knocking, people entering and leaving the house, and how it plays with toys.Playful body language includes bouncy gestures, open and relaxed mouth, wiggling body motions, and, when playing with other dogs, jumping around or exchanging positions.
Signs of anxiety include fast tail wagging, a tense body, whimpering, ears held back or up, and hiding.
Red-flag behaviors when it meets other dogs include trying to pin down the other dog, constant following, excessive mounting, or body slamming. Other general signs of aggressiveness include snarling, showing teeth, and staring with a fixed gaze.
Observe when and try to understand why your dog exhibits particular body language. Try to see (and hear and smell!) things from your dog’s perspective.

, If you’re socializing an adult dog, introduce it to a friend’s dog on neutral territory, like a park or a neighbor’s yard. Both handlers should hold leashes with a relaxed lead, since holding the leash too tightly can indicate that the dog should be anxious or on guard. Take note of how your dog behaves, and if it begins to bark excessively or acts aggressively, get its attention and calmly walk it away from the other dog.While puppies are much more open to social situations, adult dogs need to be exposed to another dog one-on-one at first.
The goal for socializing an adult dog should be calm behavior, rather than actively playing.
If they interact calmly while on their leashes, consider letting them off their leashes in a confined space to further gauge how your dog gets along with others.

, Keep socialization natural, light-hearted, and low pressure. Don’t force your dog into an uncomfortable situation, and keep initial social interactions brief. Try to frame interactions as a positive experience instead of a necessity or chore.Carry lots of dog treats, and give your dog a treat after it meets another dog and they calmly interact.
Offer plenty of positive vocal and physical encouragement. Congratulate your dog and give it a pat or rub on its rear to let it know it’s done a good job.

, Pet stores can be great places for early socialization. They’re full of stimuli and other animals, including other dogs, but in a controlled, safe space. Further, there are typically employees on site who are familiar with dog training and can offer guidance and assistance with supervision.Consider taking a training class with your dog if your local pet store offers a program.

Take your dog somewhere that is free of distractions.,
Face the dog.

,
Get a treat.,
Say ""SIT"" in a calm, but stern voice.,
Repeat five or six more times.,
Try again later.",How to Train a Dog to Sit and Shake Hands1," Be sure to bring a pocketful of treats with you.;
,, Hold it above your dog's nose. Most dogs will automatically lower their back end at this point.

,


If your dog sits, praise them extensively and give them the treat.






If your dog cranes its neck or jumps instead of sitting, put the treat back in your pocket. Then, try again, this time using your hand to push your dog's back end into the sitting position. Be sure to say SIT as your dog is sitting. Once they are sitting, give praise and reward them with the treat.







, Then, take a break.

, Continue this pattern until the dog sits consistently. Then, slowly scale back on the treats until you are giving only praise as a reward.

Practice the trick in various locations.,
Add distance between you and your dog.While you should start with your dog between one and three feet away from you, you should gradually increase the distance at which the dog obeys your command.,
Increase the duration of the trick.Instead of giving your dog a treat after it stands for just a second or two, wait three to five seconds before giving it.,
Cut back on the treats.,
Practice a variation.",How to Train a Dog to Stand Up3," Repeat the trick in many locations both inside and outside your house.This way, your dog will not come to associate standing with a particular location. Instead, your dog will learn to generalize the treat-giving action with the appropriate response.


Start in simple locations and build to harder ones. Simple locations are quiet with few distractions or strange smells. You should start in your own living room or kitchen. Ratchet up the difficulty level for your dog by doing the trick in your house with several friends or family members around. You can graduate up to an outside location like a public park or greenway.
This way, your dog will be able to perform the “stand” command anywhere at any time.

, Once your dog starts to understand the trick, move back to a distance of between two and four feet. Once your dog is successful at accomplishing the trick at this distance, move back further still.


Don’t maintain a constant distance when practicing. For instance, you can direct your dog to stand from a distance of three feet one time, then from a distance of just one foot the next time, then a distance of two feet the next time, and so on.
This will help your doggie understand that it’s not the distance between the two of you that determines what trick it is supposed to perform, but the command and action.
Be sensitive to your dog’s upper concentration limit. Once you move more than 10 feet away, you might not be able to get your dog to see your hand gesture.

, Once your dog has learned to wait three to five seconds, wait six to eight seconds before giving it a treat.


There’s no absolute maximum a dog will be able to wait before getting antsy, but be aware of the limits to your dog’s patience. If your dog is getting antsy, distracted, or sits back down after you’ve stretched the duration of the trick to a certain point, you should accept that your dog has probably reached its personal patience threshold.

, Once your doggie really knows how to stand, start to cut back on the treats. Instead of giving your dog a treat every time it performs the correct behavior, just make the motion of giving the treat by pinching your index, thumb, and middle fingers together in front of the dog’s nose. This will reduce your and your dog’s reliance on treats to stand.


Cut back from giving a treat every time your dog performs the trick to giving a treat just 90% of the time. Use the hand motion without the treat for the other 10% of the time. If your dog continues to obey, use the hand motion without giving a treat 20% of the time. Continue to reduce how often you give a treat as you see fit.
However, you should never entirely eliminate treats from the trick.
If you notice that your dog becomes less compliant with the command over time, increase the frequency with which you administer treats when getting your dog to stand.

, A variation of the simple “stand” command is the “stand up” command. Training your dog to stand up on its hind legs works exactly the same as the regular stand command, but instead of bringing the treat forward relative the dog (and toward you), you simply lift the treat in your hand up and over the dog’s head. Your dog should follow it and rise on its back legs to reach it.Use a different verbal command to differentiate this trick from “Stand.” Try a command like “Jump up” or “Up, up.”
Start slowly. At first, give your dog the treat as soon as its front legs come off the ground. Then, give it the treat when it can stand on its hind legs for about three seconds. Then reward it when it has stood for five seconds.
Don’t let your dog lean against you when doing this trick -- that’s cheating!
Smaller dogs (of less than 40 pounds) are better at standing and balancing on their hind legs than larger dogs.

Focus on reward-based training.,
Identify your dog’s ideal reward.,
Reward your dog immediately.,
Use a clicker to mark good behavior.,
Teach your dog to associate the clicker with a command.",How to Teach Your Dog Tricks1," Reward based training uses treats, praise, toys, and play as motivators to teach your dog new behaviors. This method of training teaches your dog that if he does what you want then he gets a reward. Reward based training is the best way to teach your dog new things because it is effective, simple, and it enhances your relationship.Do not use punishment as a training method. Older methods of obedience training rely on harsh treatment to train new behaviors, such as yanking on a choke chain. In this type of training, dogs behave out of fear, rather than making new connections between rewards and behaviors. Punishment based training is not advised because it can lead to other problems, such as anxiety and a poor relationship between you and your dog.;
, Reward based training works best if you know what motivates your dog. Common rewards include tiny pieces of food and special dog treats, but you can also use praise or reward your dog with a game or a special toy.Using reward-based training is simple. When the dog performs an action that you wish him to repeat, then acknowledge the good behavior and give your dog his treat right away.

, The timing of the reward is crucial because it helps your dog understand what behavior is being rewarded. Therefore, it is important to give your dog his reward at the exact same moment that your dog performs the desired behavior.


For example, when teaching a dog to sit, you should give the reward as soon as his behind touches the ground. This will ensure that he knows he is being rewarded for sitting down., A popular way to mark good behavior is to use a clicker. When the dog is learning a new action, the clicker works better than offering praise or a treat. Dogs are used to hearing us talk, so he may not associate your talking with his action. However, the clicker is a novel sound that your dog will hear only during training sessions, so it will help him know what he is supposed to do.To use a clicker, you will first need to train your dog to understand that the click-clack sound means a reward is on the way. You can do this by clicking the clicker and then giving your dog a food reward at the same time. Do this several times and your dog will begin to understand that the clicking sound means a treat is on the way.

, Use the clicker to get your dog to associate the sound of the clicker with commands as well. Command your dog to sit and click the clicker at the same time that you say sit. Repeat this exercise a few times to reinforce the connection between the clicker and the sit command.Always choose brief command words, preferably with a harsh first syllable such as ""Sit"" or ""Stay"". This is because only listen to the first one or two syllables and a harsh sound is easier to hear than a soft one.

"
"
Let dogs meet their own way.,
Don’t be an anxious handler.,
Practice good dog park etiquette.",How to Make Your Dog Get Along With Other Dogs2," Whether you’ve trained your dog for years or have recently become an owner, don’t force dogs to meet the way humans do. Humans meet each other face-to-face, look each other in the eye, and consciously use sight as their main sense. For dogs, face-to-face interaction is usually associated with a challenge, and they rely on smell much more than sight.Let the dogs show each other their profiles instead of meeting head-on. Let them walk around each other, and smell where the other has walked., When you meet another dog when you’re on a walk, don’t pull hard on the leash or make any other gestures that anticipate trouble. Try to remain calm yourself. Your dog will pick up you being nervous, afraid, letting your heart race, and other subtle behavioral cues. If you anticipate a problem, you’ll end up setting your dog up for failure.Let the dogs maintain distance, then cross paths, smell where the other has walked, and slowly approach each other. If they stare each other down, show teeth, snarl, or show any other aggressive behaviors, then give a verbal command to get your dog’s attention on something else and continue on their walk.

, Dog parks can be a great social activity for your dog. It’s particularly important, however, that you’ve already exposed your adult dog to others in a one-on-one setting before heading to a dog park. Otherwise, the experience might be overwhelming or even traumatic.Supervise your own and other dogs closely. Interrupt any rough or high-arousal play, like non-stop or fast running. Leave if your dog is being a bully, being bullied, or seems like it’s not having any fun.
Try to be aware if there are a number of intact males present, and be on your way if there are.
Don’t offer treats or toys to your dog at a dog park, and don’t encourage pack-forming or other competitive or domineering behavior.
Don’t ever let your dog off its leash in an outdoor setting if it doesn’t respond to your verbal commands.

Crate train and use scent articles.,
Let your new dog explore the house.,
Introduce the two dogs on neutral territory.,
Have the dogs meet on-leash.,
Have the dogs meet in your yard before coming inside.,
Continue to monitor their interaction at home.,
Consult a professional trainer.",How to Make Your Dog Get Along With Other Dogs3," If you want your old dog to get along with your new dog, the best strategy is to use scent to introduce them. Don’t immediately introduce it face-to-face to the dog you already have. Instead, place each in separate crates on opposite sides of the house. Introduce them to each other using the sense of smell by placing scent articles, or objects that the other has come into contact with, into their crates.During this sensitive time, don’t let the two dogs make visual contact in order to avoid territorial aggressiveness. Your resident dog will feel the need to defend its territory from your new dog.
Keep swapping the scent articles back and forth to deepen the initial bond. Scent needs to be the key facilitator of communication during this early introductory period.

, While keeping your other dog in a crate and out of sight, let your new dog explore its new turf. Give it 15 or 20 minutes to roam around and become accustomed to its new home and new human companions. Do this several times a day, making sure that your other dog is out of sight.When you return your new dog to its crate, make sure to place scent articles that have your other dog’s smell in with your new dog.
Let your other dog out after your new dog is secure in its crate, and alternate this pattern several times a day. Your new dog will leave its scent throughout the house, and when you let your old dog out of its crate, it’ll gradually become accustomed to this new scent.

, Your dogs will be ready to meet when they show signs of being comfortable with each other’s scent, like not sniffing and chasing furiously around the house after a new smell. When they seem accustomed to each other’s scent presence at home, take them somewhere that they won’t feel the need to be territorial, like a neighbor’s yard, enclosed park, or other confined space.Take them there separately and continue to keep them from making visual contact. First, let the old dog run around the outdoor space while the new dog is out of sight.
Then, get the old dog out of sight and let the new dog run around. Just like in your home, you are training your dogs to recognize familiar scents, and thereby “formally” introducing them.
Finally, after taking the time to let your dogs’ main sense and natural instincts guide them, you are ready to let them meet face-to-face. When they do meet, they’ll recognize each other’s familiar scents.

, Next, with both dogs leashed, bring them both into the confined area so they can make visual contact. Let them keep their distance, and do not use too much pull on the leash or force them face-to-face. Instead, allow them to walk around each other and become acclimated.If, after a couple minutes, they seem to be getting along, drop their leashes and let them freely play around for a few minutes.
If they stare, aggressively posture, or bark, then separate the dogs, repeat scent article training, and try having them interact again after a day or two has passed.

, After they’ve met on neutral turf, bring them back home separately. Have them interact as they did on neutral turf in your yard. If all’s gone well so far, bring both dogs into your yard with their leashes dragging and allow them to interact.If signs of tension arise, then separate the dogs and try letting them interact in your yard later.
If they play nicely in the yard, bring them inside separately and give them some time to chill out in their crates a bit. Then, let them both out in the house and allow them to get acclimated to each other’s presence inside.

, Once they’ve met, continue to keep them closely supervised and, use a sturdy baby grate to keep them separated until you are completely confident they are comfortable and safe with each other. Monitor their body language, look for signs of aggression, and use treats to reinforce positive behaviors and associations.Keep the dogs separated while you’re not home using crates or sturdy grates.
Make sure there are no treats or toys scattered around that the dogs might fight over.
Interrupt any situations where the dogs are barking loudly, staring each other down, running, or engaging in any other high-arousal activities.

, If your efforts at crate training, scent training, and gradual introduction aren’t working, you might want to consult a professional trainer. A trainer can also help you if you’ve acquired an adult dog and didn’t have the opportunity to begin socialization early or in a controlled settings as is typically recommended.Ask your dog owner friends, veterinarian, groomer, or local boarding kennel for trainer recommendations. Try to obtain a range of options and look for those that are highly recommended and fit your budget.
Ask your prospective trainer about their qualifications, educations, and techniques. Ask them how long they’ve been in business, and ask if they have client recommendations to validate their work (if they haven’t already listed such information on a website or brochure).

Use the command in different settings and situations.,
Practice the command with less treats.",How to Teach Your Puppy to Lie Down," Before your puppy can tackle the “lie down” command, he will need to be comfortable with sitting on command. Once you teach your dog to sit, you can move on to the “lie down” command., Conduct the training session in a spot that is free of distractions or noises that could interfere with your dog’s concentration. You want to ensure your dog’s focus remains on only you for the duration of the training session. If you usually use one area in your yard or home to train your dog, begin teaching him to lie down there.Some smaller dogs can be picky about lying down on a cold or hard floor. If possible, choose an area that has a carpeted floor or a surface that is soft, like a couch or a dog bed.The best time for training sessions is right when your puppy starts to get hungry, as this will motivate him to earn his rewards, or treats. Try to schedule training sessions right before dinner time., You can place several treats in your pockets before the training session if you tend to keep treats in your pockets while training your dog. You may keep the dog treats in a pouch attached to your belt or in your back pocket.It’s important that you place the treats in a spot where they cannot be seen by your puppy. You want your puppy to learn to respond to your command, not to a treat. You should keep the treats out of sight in a pocket or a pouch until your dog completes the command and earns his reward. However, in the early stages of training it is acceptable to use a treat as a lure.

, Once he is in the sitting position, say the cue “down”. Make sure you say the “lie down” or “down” cue in a calm, clear voice and maintain eye contact with your puppy as you say the cue.Use the cue “down” or “lie down” to teach your puppy to get down on the ground and not use it for other actions, like getting off of the couch or off of a step. Instead, use the command “off” in other instances so your puppy is not confused about which action you are asking for., Allow your dog to smell it and lick it, but not to eat it. Continue to hold the treat in front of your dog’s nose and move it down toward the floor, between his front legs. Your dog’s nose should follow the treat and his head should bend down towards the floor.

, Keep moving the treat until your hand lands on the ground, straight in front of your dog. Your dog will continue to follow the treat and ease himself into a down position. Once his elbows touch the floor, say “yes!” and let him eat the treat from your fingers.Avoid using your hands to push your dog down to the ground as this can be seen as an aggressive move by your dog and spook him or put him on edge. You want to teach your dog to lie down on his own.Your dog may stand up after eating the treat and move out of the down position. If he does not do this, move one to two steps away to encourage him to move out of the down position. If you dog’s back end pops up when you move him into the down position, you should not give him the treat. Instead, ask your dog to sit and try the sequence again until his whole body goes down to the ground. You can try allowing your dog to sniff or nibble at the treat as you move it to the floor to encourage him to lie down fully.
Keep in mind some dogs may not be interested in the treat you are using for the session and he may not follow the treat with his nose. Switch up the treat for something more enticing, like a small piece of chicken, a piece of cheese, or the end of a hot dog.

, Some dogs can move on to learning the hand signal after one session, and other dogs may need a few more sessions of practice.


Try to do at least two short, five to ten minute sessions, a day.

, Once your dog gets the hang of the down position with the use of a treat, you can move on to using a hand signal to get your dog to lie down. You will still use treats as a reward, but they will be hidden behind your back so your dog follows the hand signal, rather than the treat.Begin with commanding your dog to “sit”.
Say “down.” Make the same motion with your fingers and hand, but without a treat between your fingers.
Move your hand to the ground and as soon as your dog’s elbows touch the floor, say “yes!” and give him a treat.
Take a few steps back to signal to your dog that he can stand up.

, Try to have two five to ten minute training sessions a day where your dog follows your hand signal. Once your dog lies down as soon as you say the cue and make the hand signal, you can move forward in the training.If your dog doesn’t follow your empty hand into the down position, do not bring out a treat to encourage him. Be patient and make eye contact with him until he lies down on his own.

, Over time, you likely will not want to continue to bend all the way down to the floor to get your dog into the down position with the hand signal. You can try to shrink the signal so it is a smaller movement and you do not need to bend down towards the floor. Make sure you progress to a smaller hand signal slowly, and only once your dog is comfortable with the “lie down” command and the normal hand signal.Repeat the command and the hand signal, without a treat between your fingers. Instead of moving your hand all the way to the floor, move it down until it is an inch or two above the floor. Continue to practice the down command with this new, smaller hand signal for one to two days.
Once your dog responds to the smaller hand signal, adjust your movement so your hand is three to four inches above the floor. After practicing for a couple more days, shrink the hand signal again so it is farther and farther away from the floor and you need to bend over less and less.
Over time, you will not need to bend over at all and you should be able to say the “Lie down” command while standing up straight and pointing to the floor.

, Now that your pup has mastered the lie down command, it’s time to practice the new skill in different settings and situations. This will teach him to always follow the command, regardless of any distractions around him.Start by practicing the command in familiar places, like the rooms in your home, in your backyard, and in your front yard.
Move on to slightly more distracting areas, like in your home when other family members are around. You can also practice the command during a daily walk and in friend’s houses or yards.
Once your dog masters lying down on command in these situations, add on more distractions. Practice the command while someone makes noise or plays with a ball nearby. You should also practice the command when you are playing with your dog at the park, when someone rings the doorbell, and when your dog is playing with other dogs.

, If you’d rather not carry pockets full of dog treats every time you ask your dog to lie down, you can start to reduce the number of treats he receives during the training sessions. Only do this once your dog is very comfortable with following the lie down command in different settings and situations.Begin by giving him treats only when he lies down fast and with excitement. If he lies down slowly and with reluctance, give him praise and a head scratch but do not give him a treat. Withhold the treats for only the faster lie downs so he does not receive a treat every time he lies down.
You can also use other rewards besides treats for when he follows the command. Ask your dog for a down position before you attach his leash for a walk, before you give him his dinner, before you throw his favorite toy and before he can greet someone. This way, he will see the lie down command as a positive cue that leads to rewards other than treats.

A shallow lake or lake area is ideal. Or, a pond.
Avoid using a river unless you know the spot really well and it is neither fast flowing nor deep.
Avoid any water that is murky, contains a lot of plants that could catch your dog's paws or that leads to fast-flowing areas, rips or sudden drops (such as waterfalls).
A place that has other people around can be ideal if your dog loves company.
Choose a place that allows you to take a dog. Any anxiety on your behalf of not being where you're allowed to be will transfer to the dog.;
, Bring along some familiar gear, such as a ball and some doggie treats to soothe your training dog. Also bring your own swimming gear, as you need to get into the water with your dog to begin with.

, Some breeds do not like to be in water and some do not know how to swim. Be aware of your dog's breed limitations.

, Begin by tossing a ball into the shallows of the water. Let your dog run in to fetch it, still able to stand.


If your dog goes in the water to get the ball, reward her with a dog treat.
Keep repeating the exercise, until you see that your dog is happily familiar with the water.

, Wade out to waist deep water.

, Place her in the water.

, However, keep holding her until she develops a good form and seems steady and sure of her strokes.

, Start walking to the shore yourself and it's likely she'll follow you. Keep a close eye on her though.

, The dog's form will continue to improve and in no time, she'll be a swimming machine without a second thought to what she's doing.

Consider establishing basic commands first.,
Teach your dog to yawn.,
Teach your dog to spin in a circle.,
Get your dog to do a high five.,
Train your dog to speak and be quiet.",How to Teach Your Dog Tricks2," It is helpful to have a solid foundation of ""Sit"", ""Stay"", and ""Come"", before moving onto tricks, but it is not absolutely necessary. If you have a young puppy or just want to have fun, then don't be afraid to try some tricks., To teach your dog to yawn, carry a clicker and treats with you at all times. Watch your dog like a hawk and when he yawns of his own accord, immediately click when he is in mid yawn. Then, let him finish yawning and reward him. Try to catch your dog yawning as often as you can and mark and reward the behavior. After a few times, start to label the behavior as ""Yawn.” Soon your dog will understand the connection and will begin to yawn on command., A more complex trick that you can teach your dog is spinning in a circle. Training your dog to do this trick requires using a bit of wet food to get him to perform the desired action. Then you will need to reward the action and pair it with the command ""spin."" First smear a bit of tasty dog food on the tip of his tail. When he reaches around to lick his tail, click to mark the correct action of turning to one side.
Continue to reward him for reaching around to his tail and mark/reward the behavior. After a few times, begin to name the behavior as “spin.”
As you continue to train this behavior, your dog should start turning to continue to be rewarded. After a while, the turning will evolve into a full spin.

, Training your dog to do a high five is simple. Wait for your dog to lift a paw, then click the clicker to mark the behavior. Then give him a reward. If your dog seldom lifts his paw, then you can gently lift his paw and click to show him that this is a good thing to do., Knock on the door or do another similar action that might trigger your dog to bark. Then, click the clicker to mark the barking and reward him as well. After a few times of repeating the action, start saying ""speak"" along with the clicker, so that he knows what he's expected to do.The Speak command goes hand-in-hand with ""quiet."" Once you have trained your dog to bark on command, you can also teach him to be silent. To do this ask him to speak, then click and reward him. While he is eating the treat and being silent, click to mark the quiet, and then give him another reward. Then, start to label the action as ""quiet.” By teaching “speak” and “quiet” together, you can control when your dog barks and when he is silent.

"
"
Change up rewards now and then.,
Train often with short sessions.,
End on a high note.,
Train in a quiet environment free from distractions when starting out.",How to Teach Your Dog Tricks3," Once your dog has learned a command, start to make the rewards a bit unpredictable to keep him motivated. You can do this by rewarding every fourth or fifth time that your dog performs the desired behavior rather than every time. Changing up your dog’s rewards will help to prevent your dog from taking his rewards for granted. It will also help to keep his focus on working to earn a reward., Remember to train often for short periods of time. Each dog has his own concentration span, so work within your dog’s abilities. Your dog may only have enough attention for five minutes of training or he may be able to train for 20 minutes. If your dog starts to lose concentration or starts to make mistakes, then end the session., To help keep our dog motivated and happy, always try to end on a high note by asking your dog to do something simple at the end of your training session. For example, you can ask your dog to perform one of the tricks he has mastered, such as sit or speak. Make sure that you reward your dog with lots of praise and a treat to let him know he is doing a good job., It is helpful to start training your dog in quiet locations where he will not be distracted. Stick to a quiet, distraction-free place until your dog has mastered the trick. Once your dog gets the idea, you can begin to vary your location to reinforce the trick even more.It is important to use different locations so that your dog knows the commands apply wherever he is. For example, if you always ask your dog to “spin” in the kitchen, he may begin to associate spinning in a circle with standing in front of the fridge.

Keep encouraging the dog until it has managed to jump up and get the treats.,
Repeat this action a few times, then let the dog rest.,
Remove the treats from the equation.,
Keep training the dog until it jumps at the command, without you holding the hand up.,
Up the ante for your dog.,
Set up a row of boxes along a flat area in your backyard.,
Go on the other side of the boxes, away from your dog.,
Move the boxes up.",How to Train a Dog in High Jumping," Keep some of these in your hand.;
, Encourage your dog to jump up for the treats by making it obvious that you're holding them. Choose a special word to associate as your standard command for the high jumping and say it while holding the treats up high.

, Of course, the treats are the reward but some praise and petting will assist in reinforcing the desired behavior. Say ""good dog"" or whatever your usual phrase is, using a happy and energetic tone.

, Try again now and then over the next few days. Within a short space of time, the dog should get the idea that it's perfectly normal to jump high for treats.

, Use the command that you've associated with this action to encourage the dog to jump up high. You may still need to hold up your hand. When the dog jumps, reward after the jump by handing the dog the treats from a low position, even squatting.

, Always reward the dog with a treat afterward.

, Once your dog is happy to jump up high by command, make things more complicated if you wish. This Part can be useful if you're planning to show the dog and it needs to jump over items in the show ring.

, Keep the boxes about 5 feet away from each other, going in a straight line.

, Run along that side of the boxes, holding a treat out and using the jump command that the dog has learned. Encourage the dog to jump over one of the boxes in the row to reach you and the treat.


Keep trying. Your dog will make a lot of mistakes before it becomes clear that you'd like the dog to jump over the box to get the treat.

, Once the dog has become used to jumping over the boxes at a low level, increase the height. Place two boxes, one on top of the other. Use the command or whistle and treat holding as before, only this time, encourage the dog to go over two boxes. This will take longer to do (several weeks), as the dog can see the obstacle and will be slow to try it at first. Keep persevering until the dog manages it, and reward the dog well.


You can add more height as the dog learns but always consider how high the dog can jump without the boxes. Use this to gauge whether another level of boxes is likely to be successful.

Try shaking with the other hand.",How to Teach Your Dog to Shake Hands," You will need to reward your dog when he shakes. Bite-sized treats are good for training because you can give your dog more of them without feeding them too many extra calories. Also consider what your dog likes and what will motivate them: does your dog like soft treats or hard treats? Is there a certain flavor that your dog seems to respond to more? Figure out which treat works best for your particular dog and have them on-hand for training.Try making your own treats. These could be small pieces of cooked meat or even some fruits and vegetables.
Don't over feed your dog. Keep treat sizes as small as you can.
Do not feed your dog the following food items, as they can cause poisoning or illness: avocado, chocolate, bread dough, grapes, raisins, hops, ethanol, moldy foods, macadamia nuts, xylitol, onions, garlic.;
, The only way a dog can shake hands is if they are sitting. If your dog doesn't know how the command for sit, you will need to teach them to sit first.Don't reward the dog with the treat here, as you are teaching him how to shake, not sit.

, You won't be giving the treat to your dog just yet. For now, simply keep the treat in your left hand. Bring the treat in front of your dogs nose, showing it to him. Once you have his attention, close your fist around the treat.Don't let the dog grab the treat from you yet.
Hold the treat between your thumb and your palm.

, This is the command you will use to ask your dog to shake (you can also say something else like ""Shake"" if you prefer). Say this as you hold the fist with the treat in front of your dog., Once your dog realizes you have a treat in your closed hand, they will try to get it from you. When they make a move toward the behavior you want — such as lifting a paw to try and get the treat from your fist — say ""Yes!"" with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement and give them the treat.When your dog makes a move toward the behavior you want, immediately reward them with the treat.
Ignore any other attempts your dog may make, such as sniffing or mouthing your hand.Be patient.
Practice this way a few times until the dog is reliably lifting their paw when you say ""Paw.""

, Once your dog is lifting their paw on command, you will want to take it to the next step. You should begin reward the dog only as they do something closer to your goal of shaking. For instance, if your dog lifts their paw higher than before, that gets a ""Yes!"" and a treat, but not before then. Continue in this way until the dog is offering their paw.

, Use this additional step only if your dog doesn't seem to paw at the treat in your hand. By picking up your dogs paw, and praising them during and after, you start to show your dog that pawing at your hand is rewarded.Hold the paw for a few seconds before rewarding.
Be gentle and move slowly.

, After your dog beings consistently pawing at the treat in your closed hand, you can start to introduce your preferred verbal command. Wait until your dog paws at your hand and issue the command while giving him the treat.Your command could be any word, but “Shake” or “Paw” are commonly used.
Say your command clearly and loud enough to be heard by your dog.
Issue your command at the exact moment the dog paws at your hand.
Once you pick a command, don't change it, as this will confuse your dog.Keep any command short. Generally only one word commands will be the best., After you have begun using your verbal command when your dog paws at your hand, it's time to start saying it before it paws. As you move the hand with the treat towards your dog, say your command.This step helps him to realize the verbal command is now the signal to bring his paw up to shake.
Ideally, your dog will bring his paw up as soon as you say your command.
Only after he shakes should you reward him with the treat and praise him.
If your dog doesn't bring his paw up at the command, try again until he does. If he still doesn't after about fifteen minutes, stop for a while and try again later. You don't want to frustrate your dog.

, Rewarding your dog for any other behavior will confuse your dog. Never reward him unless he has completed the command successfully, or else he might view your rewards as bribes.


Avoid improper rewarding by always obtaining your dog's full attention before training.
Don't get frustrated and give your dog the treat if he isn't doing the “shake” command as you asked. Giving up like this will send the message that if he sits and ignores you he will be rewarded.
Realize that your dog is always paying attention. Any treat given to him will likely be associated with whatever he was doing at the time.
Your dog wants to earn treats. Once he makes the connection that a behavior will earn him something tasty, he will be ready to behave in that way. This counts for both good or bad behavior. Be aware of this when you reward your dog.

, Eventually you will need to stop issuing treats for the behavior. Do this gradually by offering treats only every other time he performs the “shake” command. Substitute praise or other rewards, such as a walk or playtime, in place of treats.Keep practicing until you are positive he will “shake” without a treat.
You can try offering an empty hand, with no treat, when first starting this step.

, Once you feel that your dog has mastered the “shake” command, try introducing challenges for it. Wait for a situation that usually bothers your dog, such as a visit to a busy place or someone coming to the door, and issue the command.The more situations you practice in, the better your dog will be able to perform this command.

, Follow the same order of training as you did with the first hand. The main difference will be that you hold the treat in your opposite hand and only reward when your dog shakes with the desired paw.Try using a different command word. If you used “Shake”, try using “Paw” for the opposite hand."

Select a treat.,
Choose a verbal command.,
Pick a training area.,
Command your dog to sit.,
Hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose.,
Wait for your dog to stretch out his paw to you.,
Use a verbal cue.,
Challenge your dog.",How to Train a Dog to Give You Its Paw," Treats are an important part of the training process. They serve as tasty rewards when your dog performs the desired action, no matter how small. In general, treats for training should be especially scrumptious to your dog, and should be reserved for training purposes.


Choose treats that are not crumbly. Your dog may take more interest in sniffing out and eating the crumbs rather than paying attention to what you are trying to teach him.Examples of treats include bits of cheese or hot dog and small liver cookies.While you are teaching your dog to give you his paw, rewarding your dog with treats should always be paired with verbal praise.;
, Verbal commands are another helpful component of the training process. Common verbal commands for this trick include ‘paw’ and ‘give your paw.’Whichever command you choose, use it consistently throughout the training process to avoid confusing your dog.If you have multiple members of your household, make sure that each person uses the same verbal command for this trick.Short, concise commands are preferable—your dog will understand and respond to these better than long phrases or sentences (e.g., ‘It’s time to give me your paw’)., Even though teaching your dog to give you his paw is relatively easy, your training sessions will go much more smoothly if he is not distracted. Inside your home, create a ‘distraction free’ zone—turn off the television, keep other pets and people outside of the area, and remove any distracting toys. The fewer the distractions, the better.If you have an enclosed yard, you can train him outside with relatively few distractions.

, Teaching your dog to give you his paw will be easier if your dog is already in the sitting position. If your dog does not already know how to sit, you can teach him by holding a treat in front of his nose, far enough away so that he cannot reach for it. Next, slowly raise your hand high over your dog’s head. As your dog raises his head to follow the treat, push down gently on his backside to get him to sit.Give him a verbal command (‘sit’ or ‘down’) as you press down on his backside. Immediately praise him and give him the treat when his bottom touches the floor.Do not give him the treat if he stands back up and reaches for it. Firmly say ‘no’ if he does this.Practice several times a day for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Eventually, your dog will learn to sit and remain seated to receive the treat., Unlike with training your dog to sit, your dog should not see the treat during the entire training process. Rather, you will show your dog the treat to get his attention, and then create a fist to hide the treat., This may not take long if your dog regularly uses his paws to get your attention or play. If this is not how your dog uses his paws, though, he may first try to grab the treat with his mouth instead. Do not respond if he uses his mouth—this is not the desired behavior.When he lifts his paw, even if it is just slightly off the ground, immediately give him verbal praise (‘good boy,’ ‘yes’) and open your fist to give him the treat.You can still reward him if he simply shifts his weight to lift his paw—this is still an effort in the right direction.If you are using a clicker, then you would click as soon your dog lifts his paw (or shifts his weight to lift his paw).Use your other hand to grab his paw when he lifts it.This will be easier if you are not using a clicker.
Do not reprimand your dog if he uses his mouth. Rewarding only the desired behavior (lifting his paw) and ignoring the undesired behavior (using his mouth) will teach your dog to the repeat the desired behavior.

, Once your dog consistently lifts his paw in response to the ‘fisted’ treat, add in a verbal cue to the trick.Use whichever verbal cue you chose prior to beginning your training sessions. Say the cue after you have closed your fist, and before he lifts his paw to get the treat.


Immediately praise and reward your dog when he lifts his paw in response to your verbal cue.
The goal is to teach your dog to give you his paw in response to only your verbal cue, without you holding a treat in front of his nose. Gradually phase out the treats over several training sessions.Do not repeat the verbal cue to get your dog to follow your command.If your dog does not respond the first time, it could be that he does not yet understand the command.If this is the case, continue to practice the cue over multiple training sessions.

, As your dog gets more skilled with this trick, add in some challenges. For example, practice the trick in different situations and locations where there will be distractions (e.g., cars, people, other dogs).You can also teach your dog to lift both paws. If you would like to do this, use a different verbal cue for the other paw to avoid confusing your dog as to which paw he should lift."

Identify over-activity or hyperactivity.",How to Stop Destructive Behavior in Dogs1," Dogs love to chew on stuff. While puppies can be destructive, their destructive play is more about exploring and testing their boundaries than about intentionally destroying things. On the other hand, a destructive adult dog displaying negative behavior such as chewing, digging holes in the backyard, or chewing up the shrubbery needs attending to., Does your dog bark constantly, chew on furniture, or urinate on the ground to get attention? We often reward this behavior by simply directing our attention towards the negative behavior, thereby reinforcing the dog's attention-seeking behavior. If this is the case, you’ll need to reprogram your dog’s expectations. You’ll need to give them more attention in general. Only give your dog attention when they are behaving positively., One of the best things about having a dog is the bond your create. Sometimes, this bond is so strong that your little furry friend might not know how to be independent. About 10% of all puppies and older dogs experience some level of separation anxiety. In the more extreme cases, a dog will throw a tantrum and start barking, pacing, defecating in inappropriate places, and destroying walls or doors in an attempt to get back to an owner., Your dog might respond with fear to such loud noises as thunder or fireworks by destroying doors, walls, or objects, in order to try to hide. Figure out your dog’s logic. It is trying to seem threatening to the unknown element that is making so much noise., Do you keep your dog locked in a white-washed, empty room all day? Are they forced to just sit in their cell without any form of exercise or stimulation? If so, your dog might resort to destructive behavior simply to entertain themselves. Give them toys to play with while you are gone. Give them a blanket to lay on. Relocate them to different areas to let them explore. In short, give them things to do in order to stop their boredom. You’d hate being in their place otherwise., Is your dog always full of energy and always active? Does your dog constantly chew on things, run in circles, bark, and wreak havoc? Hyperactivity is simply a matter of perception. Most experts insist that hyperactivity is rare in dogs. Most likely, your dog just needs more attention and exercise. Vets only diagnose a dog with hyperactivity if they have eliminated all other possibilities."

Walk your dog regularly.,
Play with your dog more.,
Give your dog some digging space.",How to Stop Destructive Behavior in Dogs2," While this may not seem like an answer for a destructive dog, it is important to first address the basics and ensure your dog's needs for mental stimulation and physical activity are met. If you have slipped in maintaining a walking routine with your dog, reinstate it. If you haven't yet developed a routine, start now. And if you're not free to walk your dog regularly, find somebody who can. Go for regular walks and try to include a variety of exercise options during the walk.Some ideas include:



Buy a leash that is only a few feet long. The closer your dog is when he walks with you, the more he'll know that you’re the one who has the authority and is in control. Never let him walk behind you or ahead of you, but always right by your side. This lets him know you’re in authority and he must submit.Take your dog on a walk in an area that is challenging. Try anywhere that has hills or an incline. Allow him to take breaks once in awhile and bring along water for him to drink as needed. Your dog may get in the habit of using the same trail, so switch it up to challenge him and keep him from getting bored.
Visit a beach that allows dogs. The sand is excellent exercise for the dog's muscles, and the sea offers a fabulous opportunity for swimming and fetching all manner of items you can toss to your dog. If you don't want to take a ball, use the beach flotsam to play fetch with your pooch.Vary the parks you're visiting to walk your dog. Find out which parks allow dogs and vary your schedule each week to visit different ones. This will be stimulating for both of you, as you see new sights and explore new places.

, Besides walking, play is an important part of your dog's interaction with you.


Play catch in the backyard for 15 minutes a day. Try doing this in the morning when you're more alert and your dog is usually very hyper. You’ll notice that he'll have less energy throughout the day if you drain him of it earlier on.
Make a meet-up time for doggy friends. Find out which of your friends own dogs and plan meet-ups in central locations where your dogs can play together. Naturally, you'll also need to learn in advance if they get along with each other.
Buy a frisbee and help your dog become used to it. Once he is aware of what a Frisbee is for, let him join in the fun., If you can't beat it, join it but at least direct it to where your dog can dig without destroying your garden. Create the space, till it over, and bury some goodies in it that it’ll love finding.Burying items close to the surface at first. Then gradually bury them deeper. This can help retain her interest in the new digging spot. It also helps if you can temporarily block off her old digging space.


If your dog is digging because she is bored, increase the play and exercise activities. Don't leave her alone in the yard all day.
If your dog is digging because she appears to making herself a nice, cool, soft place to sleep on, create a shaded area for her, with something comfortable and cool to lie on."

Leave your dog with the right toys while you’re away.,
Try puzzle feeders to mentally stimulate your dog.,
Provide your dog with the right environment.,
Train your dog.,
Rotate toys.,
Give your dog chew sticks.",How to Stop Destructive Behavior in Dogs3," The most common time of the day that your dog is likely to be destructive is when you’re away at work or out doing things away from the house. Your dog can feel lonely, isolated, or unloved. Be sure to affirm your dog before leaving by giving him plenty of attention, playing a game of catch, or taking him on a walk. Dogs tend not to play with toys without the owner there. Leave the dog a Kong, or a chew toy stuffed with food, so that it gets his attention. You could also give the dog a cardboard box with a chew toy inside, so he has to chew his way into the toy.

, Your dog needs mental as well as physical stimulation, and puzzle feeders are a great way to accomplish this. There are tons of toys on the market that encourage dogs to use their brains to unlock hidden treats, but you can also make a puzzle feeder at home. Put treats in an empty muffin tin and then place tennis balls on top. Your dog must figure out how to get the balls out of the way so he can access the treats. This is a good beginner game, and you can work up to more difficult puzzles, such as those with sliding pieces.You can also play games that will keep your dog mentally stimulated, such as hiding toys or treats around the house or in cardboard boxes.

, Notice if your dog seems to get more wound up when there is a lot of stimulation, such as the television being on or sounds from another room. If this seems to be the case, turn the television down lower and close any doors where sound can impact her negatively. However, if she seems to like the sound and even seems comforted by it, consider leaving the radio or television on while you are gone at work. This might help with your dog’s separation anxiety., Training your dog to ""Sit,"" ""Come,"" ""Lay,"" ""Wait,"" and so on not only teaches him good manners, it also provides great mental stimulation. Try an obedience class to help you teach him the basics and work on training in short sessions every day. If your dog already knows the basics, step up your training with more challenging tricks, like rolling over or playing dead.

, Don’t always have the same old toys out. Dogs will tire of a new toy very quickly. Make sure you hide all of his toys in a closet and only allow two or three to be out at a time. When you switch the toys around, your dog will be entertained more and he'll think it’s a treat when he gets an old toy to play with that’s been hidden away. As an added incentive, this will prevent you from spending more money on new toys., This will stop them from chewing on other things. Chew toys made of rawhide and other organic matter are not intended to be durable or permanent. Pieces of these toys chip off; the size of the pieces can vary depending upon your dog’s size and enthusiasm. Such pieces can be sharp and can cause serious damage to your dog’s mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Never give rawhide chews to an unsupervised dog, as the may choke.
Don't leave the chew toy laying out all the time. Take it away when not needed so the dog doesn't become bored with it.

Avoid overcrowding your dog.,
Ensure that your dog is fenced in well.,
Get your dog a kennel and use it properly.",How to Stop Destructive Behavior in Dogs4," If your dog feels overcrowded, either by living in a confined space or being forced to share his space with other dogs without having space of his own, abnormal behaviors can arise. In particular, male dogs will fight over territory if they feel crowded., Poor fencing that allows your dog to slip out can result in destructive behaviors including car chasing, fighting with other dogs, and potentially attacking people. In many jurisdictions, you are required by law to ensure that your dog is properly restrained and you'll be held liable for your dog's bad behavior., Get a kennel for your dog to use when you're not home, and to sleep in. To get your dog used to his ""safe space"", put him in it throughout the day while you are going about your daily routine, and at night for sleeping. The goal is for the dog to know that his kennel is his safe place, and its time to calm down once in his inside. Remember, never use the kennel as punishment.


Kennels are great training tools for puppies and young dogs. You can train them to spend time in their little confined space. They cannot do any damage there. As long as you don't leave them in there for too long, they'll learn to love their crate."
"
Encourage appropriate chewing.,
Discourage inappropriate chewing.,
Discourage chewing inappropriate items by spraying them with chewing deterrents.",How to Stop Destructive Behavior in Dogs5," Dog toys such as balls and Kongs may appeal to your dog, just be sure to select a size that is appropriate for your dog. They should be able to pick it up and carry it but it should be of sufficient bulk that it cannot be swallowed. Praise the dog when he chooses his toy over another item that you don't want him to chew on.


Do not give toys that resemble inappropriate items; for example do not give your dog an old shoe to chew on because he will not know the difference between the old chew shoe and a brand new pair., If you do find your dog chewing on something inappropriate correct the dog by taking the object away. Direct his attentions to an appropriate chew object and give praise when he chews on said object. Gradually, your dog will learn what objects are his and which are not., When you first use a deterrent, apply a small amount to a piece of tissue or cotton wool. Gently place it directly in your dog’s mouth. Allow him to taste it and then spit it out. If your dog finds the taste unpleasant, he might shake his head, drool or retch. He won’t pick up the piece of tissue or wool again. Ideally, he will have learned the connection between the taste and the odor of the deterrent, and he’ll be more likely to avoid chewing items that smell like it.


Spray the deterrent on all objects that you don’t want your dog to chew. Reapply the deterrent every day for two to four weeks. Deterrents come in many flavors and can be purchased at your neighborhood pet store.
Please realize, however, that successful treatment for destructive chewing will require more than just the use of deterrents. Dogs need to learn what they can chew as well as what they can’t chew. Please see our article, Using Taste Deterrents, for more information."

Ignore your dog’s howling.,
Reward your dog for being quiet.,
Train your dog to be quiet on command.Just as you can train a dog to “speak,” you can train it to stop howling or making other noise when you give a command.",How to Stop Howling Dogs1," Some dogs will howl in order to get your attention, or to “ask” for food, treats, toys, etc.To prevent this kind of howling behavior, you will first have to show your dog that howling is not a way to get your attention.


Don’t scold or punish your dog when it howls, as it may find even this kind of attention rewarding. Simply do not touch, speak, or look at your dog when it howls to get your attention.
An additional complication is that some dogs will find howling self-rewarding, meaning ignoring the behavior might not deter the behavior as it might for other attention-seeking behaviors. Ignoring the howling instead of yelling or punishing will, however, prevent you from accidentally reinforcing the behavior.;
, Rewarding your dog when it is quiet will help condition it to stop howling excessively. Keep a supply of treats or toys ready, and try these techniques:Don’t give your dog anything (food, treats, toys, etc.) until it has been quiet for at least five seconds. This will condition your dog to associate being quiet with getting a reward. If your dog howls when waiting for something, ignore it until it is quiet for at least five seconds.
Give your dog treats at random times when it is being quiet. The unexpected treat will help reinforce good behavior.

, Once you’ve trained your dog using the following steps, just give the command to “hush” whenever it starts to howl:


Say “speak!” and try to get your dog to make noise (such as by clapping your hands).
Praise your dog when it makes noise and give them a treat. This teaches your dog to make a noise on cue. This which means the dog will be less likely howl in the absence of the cue.
Now wait for your dog to stop saying noise, say “hush!” or “quiet!” and then praise your dog and give it a treat.
Repeat these steps many times. You can also try slowly lengthening the amount of time your dog needs to be silent before you give it a treat.

Use a proper collar.,
Use the right leash.,
Stop and stand still.,
Wait for the dog to respond.,
Repeat for the duration of the walk.",How to Stop a Dog from Pulling on Its Leash1," Be sure that your dog has a comfortable collar that fits it properly. The collar shouldn’t be so tight that it is choking the dog, but should be tight enough so that it does not slide up and down the dog’s neck.You should be able to slide your hand between the dog’s neck and collar when it is secured in place.
Many people choose to use a harness instead of a collar. The harness disperses the pressure to the dog's back rather than its neck. This will allow you to train your dog to walk on a leash without having to rely on the choking feeling the dog gets when pulling at its leash.;
, When using this method for training your dog not to pull, make sure you do not use a retractable leash. This will defeat the entire purpose of the exercise. Use a standard chain or cloth leash., Whenever your dog pulls, stop and stand still (be a tree). No matter how hard your dog pulls, don't let it go in the direction it wants to go. The reason for this is that if the dog pulls, and you follow it, the dog is learning that pulling is a very effective way to get somewhere.It might help to attach the leash to your belt loop using a carabiner. This prevents the dog from getting ahead. It's also far easier to stand still with your hips getting pulled than your arm.

, Wait until the dog does anything that loosens the leash. The dog might stop pulling by leaning back, sitting, or changing direction. As soon as the leash loosens, you can start walking again.You can encourage the dog to loosen the leash by calling it back to you.

, This method requires a lot of patience! You're trying to teach the dog that pulling gets it nowhere. You have to be consistent and timely.A variation of this method is to walk in the opposite direction whenever your dog pulls.

Turn down the ringer on the phone.,
Ignore the behavior.,
Move your dog to a different room.,
Desensitize your dog to the sound of the phone ringing.",How to Stop Your Dog from Barking at the Phone1," Some dogs bark at the sound of the telephone ringing. To reduce the likelihood of your dog barking at the phone, turn down or change the ringer on the phone. Making it quieter may not cause your dog to bark as much as having it loud.If your dog barks at your cell phone ringing, consider changing the ringtone to a song or pleasant sound. You may even consider putting it on vibrate.;
, Speaking to your dog, getting off the phone, or even looking at your dog when they are barking can reinforce the negative behavior. Your dog may think that barking gets you to pay attention to him. One way to get rid of negative behavior is to ignore it and not give your dog any attention when they are doing it.While on the phone, ignore your dog. Go to another room to talk. If your dog barks when the phone rings, answer the phone while ignoring your dog, then go into another room. Don’t engage with your dog.
The behavior may get worse before it gets better as your dog tries to get your attention again.

, You can try to control your dog’s barking by moving them to a different room away from the phone. If you keep your phone in particular room, like the kitchen, try to keep your dog away from the room. Consider closing the door to the room to try to muffle the sound of the phone.If your dog barks while you are on the phone, put them outside or in another room while you have your conversation.

, Your dog may not like the sound of the phone or find it alarming or scary. To help your dog not get upset at the sound, let the dog hear the phone ring more often. Call your phone or get a friend or family member to keep calling the phone. Let it ring. Don’t say anything to the dog, respond to the dog, or respond to the phone. Just let it ring.Do this for a few days. Your dog may bark a lot at the phone at first, but eventually, they should get desensitized and stop caring about the ringing sound.

Put a leash on your dog when you take him out to your yard.,
Allow your dog to chase the squirrel.,
Distract your dog with the scent of food.,
Walk your dog back into the house.,

Keep a tight hold on your dog’s leash during his walk.,
Remove food sources.,
Keep your tree limbs short.,
Make your garden undesirable to squirrels.,
Install a motion-activated sprinkler in your yard.,
Contact a professional animal removal service.",How to Stop a Dog from Killing Squirrels," To stop your dog from killing squirrels, you will need to train him carefully and manage his environment.If your yard is the problem area, put your dog on a leash, take him out to the yard, and give him different obedience commands ('sit,' 'stay'). Do this for about a month, rewarding him each time he correctly responds to your commands.If your dog is already familiar with these commands, you will not need to practice them outside for a full month. Your dog may need only a few days of practice doing the commands on a leash.
Reward your dog with treats and/or verbal praise each time he correctly follows your commands.Add some fun to these training sessions by giving your dog toys he can easily play with while on the leash, such as Kong toys.;
, Take your dog out to the yard without his leash on. If he sees a squirrel, let him chase after it as the squirrel races up a tree. This probably sounds counterintuitive: if you want your dog to stop going after squirrels, why should you encourage him to do that very thing? No need to worry—you are fostering the prey drive only initially. This strategy will work well if you have trees in your backyard. If you do not have trees, do not allow your dog to chase after the squirrel—he could very well catch it and kill it.
If the squirrel runs up a tree, your dog could sit under the tree for hours, waiting for the squirrel to come down.With your dog at a standstill, this would be the opportunity for you to divert his attention away from the squirrel.
Have his leash with you.

, Break your dog’s rapt attention on the squirrel by wafting the scent of tasty food (e.g., chicken, hot dog) near his nose. Keep the food hidden in your hand so he only detects the food. When your dog turns his attention towards you, open your hand and give him the food.Put the leash on your dog as he’s munching on the treat., With your dog sufficiently distracted from the squirrel, walk about 10 feet away from the tree. If your dog is not sitting already, command him to sit and stay. Next, take his leash and walk him back into the house. With enough repetition, your dog will learn that you can control his prey drive and thus stop him from killing squirrels.Go through this process each time your dog sees a squirrel in your yard.

, If your yard is not the problem area, try managing his prey drive through games at home and distractions during his walks. This may take some work, but it can be fun. Games that foster your dog's natural prey drive encourage him to use that drive for play, rather than actual hunting.Play Frisbee and hide-and-seek with your dog.You could also play fetch with your dog.Find an exercise toy that has a sheepskin lure tied to the end of what looks like a fishing pole.Using this toy with your dog could keep him entertained for long periods.
During your outdoor playtime, try to choose a time when you know squirrels will not be around. If squirrels are a constant problem, choose games that you can play indoors.

, Playtime is fun, but it can also be instructional. For example, if you are playing fetch with your dog, tell him to ‘sit’ and ‘stay’ when you throw the ball, then give him a release command (‘go’) to allow him to chase it.By giving him commands, you are controlling his instinct to chase after something right away.


Give your dog positive reinforcement (treats, verbal praise) when he sits and stays.When your dog responds to these commands during ‘low-distraction’ playtime, start practicing them when you go out for walks where there will likely be more distractions. The goal is to manage his prey drive such that he focuses his attention on you, rather than on a squirrel.

, If your dog has a habit of breaking away from you during a walk to go after a squirrel, try to hold onto his leash more tightly.Although keeping a tighter grip will manage your dog’s prey drive by not allowing him to bolt, it may not be an effective long-term solution (and may tire your arm out after a while). There a few other things you can do to manage your dog’s prey drive during a walk.


Distract your dog with a noise. Bring a squeaky toy with you so that, as soon as your dog sees a squirrel (or if you notice it before he does), you can make a noise that will snap him out of his prey drive trance.Block your dog’s movement with your body to prevent him from chasing after the squirrel. You can also move your dog sideways and away from the direction of the squirrel, making sure not to pull the leash as you move him away.Try adding variation to your walk: change your pace, switch directions randomly, and make detours. All of these sudden changes will force your dog to pay more attention to what you’re doing, and less attention to something he can chase.Touch your dog to distract him. This will probably startle your dog the first time, but he will eventually get used to the touch, making it an ineffective long-term strategy to manage his prey drive., A good way to stop your dog from killing squirrels is to keep them out of your yard in the first place. That will be a win-win situation for your dog and the squirrel! Remove food, such as acorns, from your yard that would be attractive to squirrels.Rake up any nuts and berries, and remove any leftover food (human or pet).Bird feeders are very enticing for squirrels, so it would be a good idea to remove them from your yard.If that is not practical, replace the birdseed with something that squirrels do not like, such as safflower., Another way to keep squirrels out of your yard is to limit their access. If your trees have long branches, cut the branches so squirrels cannot use them as launching pads onto your roof or into your yard. Squirrels can leap about 10 feet, so cut the limbs such that the distance between the tree and your yard is more than 10 feet., If the squirrels keep finding a way into your yard, try to make your yard more undesirable to them. For example, bury orange or lemon rinds just beneath the soil in your garden to repel the squirrels. You can also sprinkle some garlic powder or cayenne pepper in the soil just before your plants bloom to keep squirrels away.Certain plants, such as the Crown Imperial flower, can be deterrents to squirrels.You could also spray commercially available squirrel repellent in your yard., If all else fails, squirrels will definitely dislike being the unwitting victims of a sudden burst of water. Place the sprinklers in areas where squirrels tend to frequent in your yard, like the garden.It probably won’t take long for squirrels to avoid your yard almost entirely.

, If squirrels continue to frequent your yard, or if you do not have the time to implement your own squirrel-removal strategies, consider contacting a professional company to do the job. It may cost anywhere from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, depending on the extent of the squirrel problem."

Remember that this process takes time.",How to Stop a Small Dog from Barking at You," Why? Because if you start out disliking the dog this process will either take longer or fail. Dogs can pick up on the fact you don't like them. Start out by looking at the dog when it is barking at you and say: ""Dog...You don't know it yet but we are going to be friends"". The dog will probably bark louder at you. One thing to note here is that during this whole process do not lock the dog in the eye. That is a challenge to them. Look at them, but not directly in the eyes. Be very wary of a dog that is curling its lips back and showing its teeth. The training will take longer for a dog that is as aggressive as that and it may fail. No method is foolproof.;
,"", or throw things at the dog. If this has happened, add one week to the training process for every time it has happened. Yelling, or throwing things at a dog and especially a Dachshund will only make them more angry.


In their mind you have just became the schoolyard bully who needs to be taken care of in short order. Dachshunds meet force with force. They don't care that you are ten times bigger than they are because they were originally bred to go down holes and kill fierce creatures that were bigger then they are.

, Ask the neighbor if it is alright to give their dog treats. Some dogs are on controlled diets because of food allergies or health conditions.

, They need to be doing the same thing you are doing, otherwise this will not work. It may be too tempting for them to stand there and bark back at the dog. A smart dog will sense correctly that you are mocking them. Other dogs will just bark more.

, If the dog hates you, it's not going to allow you to get close and it will interpret your actions as hostile. If you leave the food lying there the dog may eat it and still hate you anyway. An uncommonly smart dog will ignore any food offered from you even if it has NOT been trained to do that.. Don't be discouraged. If you are determined to try the food method, make sure that your scent is on it.

, Avoid having anything in your hand that the dog will see as a weapon. Always keep in mind that you are trying to slowly build trust. Go about your normal business like you don't have a care in the world.

, Observe where the dog goes potty. Find which spot it uses the most. Make sure the dog is not present and will not be around for an hour or so. Take some fresh dirt from a clean spot and make sure that the scent from your hands and feet is on the dirt. Put a small pile of it right into the dog's potty area. Then go hide and watch what happens when the dog discovers it. If the dog barks at the dirt, it's a bad sign. If it acts as if it's happy, that is an exceptionally good sign. You may have to repeat this a couple of times. Use this method when your other attempts have failed.

, During the training the dog may do something that will cause you to laugh. Dogs (and many other animals) interpret any showing of teeth as a sign of aggression. Stay relaxed and stoic.

, Let it come to you. If it approaches you and is not barking, make NO moves toward it. It is still trying to decide if you are good or bad.


Your first move towards it should not be hasty and any wrong move you make will set the process back. If you think you can touch the dog, let it smell THE BACK of your fingers. Be prepared to pull your hand away quickly.
Don't look the dog in the eyes. Talk to the dog gently and say its name and watch its general body posture. If the dog accepts smelling your hand, very slowly and carefully stroke its back just a couple of times. Don't overdo it. Then you go back to your normal activities. If the dog stays with you, ignore it unless it comes up to you for attention again.

, The dog may still occasionally bark at you but continue to ignore it. After a few days, you should notice that it's wanting more and more attention from you. It's now time to seal the deal. Start giving the dog some treats. This will seal its friendship with you. The treats will help if there is a setback. Let's say you accidentally step on the dogs foot. Bring those treats out and give them to the dog to show that you mean it no harm.

, In full sight of the dog, treat them as if you are really happy to see them. Have them set down. Make sure they have dog treats. Call the dog over and have that family member give them treats. If the dog breaks into ecstasy you have won especially if that dog is a finicky eater.

, Try NOT to fall in love with the dog. Tell yourself that this was only to get it to stop barking at you without the neighbors getting angry at you. It's your neighbors dog not yours. Of course if the neighbor wants to sell/give you the dog then by all means ignore this step. In fact if this advice has worked for you you may very well one day find yourself adding your own tips to this article while a sleeping happy dog is curled around your neck as you type on a laptop in your favorite chair.

, There will be several times during the training that you want to give up thinking that it does not work.Don't give up. With some dogs you will have to be as stubborn as a Dachshund for it to work. Once the process is done you will find that you have a small dog that would cheerfully give up it's own life to save yours.

Recognize the behavior.,
Try counterconditioning.,
Seek professional assistance if your dog’s separation anxiety and howling continue.,
Spend quality time with your dog.Dogs need lots of attention from their humans, especially if they have to be left alone for extended periods.",How to Stop Howling Dogs2," If you find out that your dog is howling during times that you are away from it, the behavior may be caused by separation anxiety.Howling caused by separation anxiety is usually accompanied by other behavior patterns, such as:


Pacing
Destroying objects
Urination and/or defecation
Drooling, If your dog has separation anxiety, you will have to help it overcome the problem. The most basic technique, counterconditioning, involves getting your dog to associate good things with separation.For dogs with moderate separation anxiety, this may be enough to end the howling behavior.


Every time you leave home, offer your dog a toy.The best choices are ones that will keep your dog occupied for some time; for instance, there are toys that can be stuffed with food for your dog to enjoy for 20-30 minutes or more. Look for these toys at pet supply stores.
When you return home, take the toy away so that your dog associates it only with the times when you are gone.
Repeat these steps consistently, and over time your dog’s separation anxiety (and howling behavior) should subside or disappear.
You can also try crate training your dog in addition to counterconditioning in order to stop its howling.
In any case, do not punish your dog because of separation anxiety. Instead of making your dog stop howling, this will only increase its anxiety.

, If your dog has a more severe case of separation anxiety, it may need more extensive counterconditioning and desensitization—often by starting with very short periods of separation, then gradually increasing them. Talk to a veterinarian, animal behaviorist, or certified professional dog trainer (CPDT) to discuss training techniques, possible medications, and other options.If you seek the help of a CPDT, make sure he or she has been trained in counterconditioning and desensitization techniques, as education in these areas is not required for certification.

, Making time to play with your dog may also help reduce its separation anxiety and howling behavior. Each day, set aside time for games, treats, and exercise with your dog.


As long as your dog is healthy, it will benefit from frequent play (fetch, jumping, tugging, etc.), as well as at least one half-hour walk per day.Discuss your dog’s activity level with your veterinarian; if your dog is aging, injured, or very young, he or she may have more specific exercise recommendations.

Determine if an environmental trigger is causing your dog to howl.,
Change how your dog reacts to the trigger.,
Care for your dog if it is sick or hurt.",How to Stop Howling Dogs3," Many dogs will howl in response to external stimuli, like sirens, other dogs, or thunder.Pay attention when your dog howls to see if the behavior follows a specific trigger.


If your dog’s howling is caused by an environmental trigger, it will usually stop once the trigger goes away or ends. If the occasional brief howl does not pose a problem, you may just want to let your dog be.

, If the howling caused by an environmental trigger is excessive or needs to be controlled (because the noise is bothering neighbors, for instance), then you may need to change your dog's behavior using desensitization and counterconditioning techniques.If the environmental trigger can be controlled, you can try desensitizing your dog to it. For example, if your dog howls at the sound of your dryer, try to keep it calm while the dryer is on for only a minute, and offer it a treat. Gradually increase the amount of time the dryer is on, as long as your dog is calm. Hopefully, your dog will become desensitized to the trigger and not howl.
If the environmental trigger cannot be controlled (such as a siren or thunder), you can still use counterconditioning to stop your dog’s howling. To do this, download a sound effects album featuring the scary noise. Play it at a low volume and reward the dog when it is calm in the presence of the unpleasant sound. As your dog becomes more tolerant, slowly increase the volume.Do this consistently, and your dog may come to associate the trigger with getting a reward instead of needing to howl.

, If you cannot determine that your dog’s howling is caused by an environmental trigger, separation anxiety, or another obvious cause, then the cause may be health-related. Have your veterinarian inspect your dog to determine if it is howling because of illness or injury."

Every time the dog obeys a command, click the clicker and give your dog a treat.Be consistent with the clicker so that your dog associates the sound with treats.

, On the walk, stay ahead of your dog at all times. This will ensure that the dog learns to follow you rather than the other way around., As the dog catches up to you, click the clicker and drop a treat on the ground before the dog passes you. If the dog does not immediately respond to the clicker, give it a verbal command to stop. If the dog responds, click and drop a treat.If the dog does not stop upon your command, do not give the dog a treat. This will ensure the dog does not associate negative behaviors with treats or the clicker.

, Keep repeating this process on your walk. This exercise will train the dog to pay attention to you. Moreover, it will ensure that it learns to stay next to or behind you when walking on its leash.

Get a head halter for your dog.,
Use a choke collar.,
Try a halti dog harness.,
Wear the dog out.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Stop a Dog from Pulling on Its Leash3," The lease attaches to straps around the dog's muzzle so that when the dog pulls, its head will be forced around, facing you. Attaching the leash to the dog's muzzle automatically redirects its focus toward you., When training your dog, try using a slip or choke collar under the supervision of a trained expert. These collars will tighten around the dog’s neck if they pull on the leash, effectively choking them. Using these collars for training will help your dog associate pulling with being choked.While these collars can effective for training a dog, many experts argue that they are dangerous or unnecessary. It is recommended that you never use a choke collar unless under the direct supervision of animal behaviorist.These collars work by using negative reinforcement. Most dog training experts suggest that your dog will respond better to positive reinforcement that it will to negative reinforcement- so keep that in mind when considering using this training tool.
These collars are for training only. Never leave this collar on your dog or use it as a substitute for their regular collar.
These collars are controversial, so consider the arguments for or against choke collars before deciding to try this method.

, These harnesses attach to the dogs collar with a clip, and are fastened across the dogs underbelly.


It works through attaching your leash to the front chest strap, which means you will gain more control over your dog. When your dog pulls on its leash, it will be guided back towards you, naturally and gently discouraging him from pulling.
The leash attachment at the chest prevents putting any pressure on your dog’s throat and neck, which is especially important as this could cause tracheal damage.

, Run the dog to tire it out before attaching the leash and going for a walk. A tired dog is far more manageable and will be more responsive to your commands during the walk.Try playing fetch in the yard for 10 minutes before going on a walk.

, End training sessions on a happy success moment. Don't end it when he/she is messing up. Success is continuing to make progress. Never allow the dog to remain unhappy at the end of your training session. "

Observe when your dog barks.,
Read your dog’s body language.,
Listen to the tone of your dog’s barking.",How to Stop Dogs from Barking at People1," Dogs have a wide variety of barks, and they’re usually triggered by specific situations. Look for what may be causing the barking behavior when it happens. The following are some common reasons for dogs to bark:Fear/Alarm. When dogs are startled or afraid, they may bark. Nervous dogs tend to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound, regardless of where they are.

Territorial protection. Dogs protect what they perceive as “their” territory. Practically speaking, this could be anywhere that your dog associates with you: your house or yard, the car, or even your “personal space” around your body. Dogs also consider places or routes they travel frequently as their territory, so if you take your dog on the same walk every day, he’s likely to consider everything along that route “his.”

Attention. Many dogs will bark when they want attention. These barks may be very short and focused. This is especially common if you reward the behavior by responding to the barking.

Greeting. Dogs bark to say hello. They may bark at other people or other animals. They also may bark to invite some playtime.

Anxiety. Dogs may bark due to separation anxiety. These dogs can’t stand being alone and will bark compulsively when they are left on their own.

Frustration. Dogs may bark when they’re frustrated. If your dog is tied up, can’t get at his favorite toy, or wants to go and play with the dog next door, he may bark to signal that he’s frustrated with the situation. A dog may also bark if he’s bored.;
, Barking communicates your dog’s emotional state. Reading your dog’s body language can provide clues as to how your dog feels. For example, if your dog is afraid, she may bark while hunched down. Once you know what’s behind the barking, you can help quiet your dog. Here are some signs of your dog’s various moods:Afraid. When dogs are afraid, they make themselves smaller to appear as less of a threat. They hunch over, tuck their tails, and flatten their ears to their heads. They may yawn or lick their lips as a way of comforting themselves.

Happy. When dogs are happy, their muscles are relaxed. Their mouths are loose and may look like they’re smiling. They may pant. Their ears and tail are in the natural positions, and the tail may wag from side to side or in a circular movement.

Alert. Dogs go on the alert if they perceive something could be a threat. Their ears are perked up and their gaze will focus on whatever they’re looking at. Their tails may be upright or over the back, but they are usually still. The hackles (the fur on the shoulders and upper back) may be raised.

Playful. Dogs who are feeling playful are all over the place. They’re very energetic, with bouncy movements. They may jump, run in circles, or bow to invite you to play. Playful dogs may look like they’re smiling.

Dominant. Dogs who feel confident about the interaction display assertive body language. They stand very tall, arch their necks, and appear slightly tense. Their tails are usually upright and still. They may make eye contact.

Aggressive. Dogs who feel confident and aggressive about the situation make themselves look bigger by raising their tails, pricking up their ears, and holding their heads high. They may lunge or look ready to pounce. Their lips are often retracted to show the teeth, although sometimes they may pucker their lips forward. Aggressive dogs who are feeling defensive combine fearful and confident body language.

, You can tell a lot about a bark by how it sounds. Studies have shown that humans are fairly good at deciphering the overall emotion behind the tone of dog barks.Happy barks are usually high-pitched. Barking as a greeting may also include other noises, such as whines and growls.
Barks demanding attention are often short, focused barks.
Lower-pitched or harsh-sounding barks usually indicate a disturbance of some kind, like fear or alarm.
Separation anxiety barking sounds are often shrill. They sound despairing and miserable.
Compulsive barking is often a monotone barking. It sounds repetitive and is often accompanied by movement that seems compulsive."
"
Talk to your neighbor.,
Make helpful suggestions.,
Try to agree on a concrete solution.,
Get backup from other neighbors.",How to Stop a Neighbor's Dog from Barking1," Many people jump straight to drastic measures instead of simply talking to the neighbor about their concerns. Unless you're on bad terms with your neighbor, the best way to solve this problem is usually to just talk to him or her about it. You could casually approach your neighbor next time you see him or her outside, or write a note asking to set up a time to talk.Your tone at this point should be friendly and be respectful, yet firm. Don't make legal threats; you may have to do that later, but for now, try to keep things civil.
Assume your neighbor is unaware of the problem. Say something like, ""I knew you'd want to know that Sadie's barking is audible to us at night, especially since our bedroom faces your yard.""
Explain that the barking is having a negative effect on your sleep, concentration, and so on, and that you would like to work out a good solution.
Thank your neighbor for hearing you out and making a change. Most considerate neighbors will do their best to accommodate you right away.;
, It's possible your neighbor is well aware of the issue, but isn't sure how to get the dog to stop barking. If you're pretty sure you know what the problem is, there's nothing wrong with making suggestions. This is especially effective if you're a dog owner, too. You can commiserate over how tough it can be to get a dog to stop barking. Here are a few common problems you might consider bringing up:


Dogs kept outside commonly bark from boredom; this is especially true for energetic breeds like German Shepherds, terriers (including Pit Bulls), and guard dogs like Dobermans and Rottweilers. Suggest that the dog needs more exercise.Some dogs are very excitable and nervous, and they bark at everything that passes. Obedience training can be very helpful. You might want to provide the names of a few well-rated training schools in the area.
Dogs also bark when they're either too cold or too hot. Many people have the misconception that dogs' fur keeps them warm in subzero weather; it's not the case, unless the dog is a husky. If you've seen the dog shivering or looking miserable in the heat of the day, tell your neighbor the dog could be barking because its uncomfortable.

, Rather than expecting your neighbor to put a stop to all barking, it might be more feasible to agree on a practical solution that works for both of you. Here are a few solutions that might apply; you can adapt them to your situation as necessary:See if your neighbor will agree to take the dog inside during certain hours, such as between 10 pm and 7 am.
If barking during the day is a problem because the dog is left outside, see if the neighbor will agree to install a dog house where the dog can take shelter during the day. Discuss a certain date by which the dog house will be installed.
If the dog has a behavioral problem and the neighbor agrees it needs to be addressed, see if he or she will set a certain date by which the dog will start attending obedience classes.

, If your neighbor ignores your requests or doesn't make a change after you've asked politely, it can help to get neighbors involved. Talk to other people who live nearby to see if they're also being kept awake by the dog. You can then talk to your neighbor again as a group. This time your requests are likely to be taken seriously.


If you don't want to gang up on your neighbor, ask the other neighbors to contact the dog owner individually. That way he or she won't feel bullied.
Best case scenario, the neighbors will be able to put their heads together to come up with a good solution that doesn't leave anyone feeling ostracized. However, if the dog owner is unreceptive and the barking continues unchecked, you may have to change tacks and get authorities involved."

Avoid speaking to the dog or giving a hand gesture.,
Remove rewards for barking.,
Close your dog’s mouth.,
Control the environment.,
Socialize your dog.",How to Stop Dogs from Barking at People2," These reactions reward the dog with attention and are to be avoided. Shouting is also ineffective. Instead, completely ignore any barking.Telling the dog to be “Quiet” could be counter-effective.
In some cases, spritzing your dog’s with a spray bottle full of water can be an effective and harmless way to startle her out of barking. However, some dogs see this as a game rather than a distraction, so you’ll have to determine whether it works for your dog.

, Rewarding your dog for behaviors you want to eliminate must be avoided, as this will only reinforce those behaviors. For example, if your dog barks at you to get attention and you respond by giving him attention, you’ve just rewarded him for the action you want to remove!Ignore your dog when he’s barking for attention. This can be tough, akin to ignoring a crying baby, but in order to avoid confusing your dog it’s important that you not pay him any attention when he’s demanding it.
Don’t reward your dog’s demand for attention with glances, pets, or talking. If you’re able to, turn your back to him. This will signal that you don’t like this behavior. Eventually, the dog will quiet down.
When your dog stops barking, praise him and give him treats. As he begins to understand the system, require him to stay quiet for longer periods of time before you reward him.

, If your dog is not a nipper, it can be helpful to close your dog’s mouth when she barks inappropriately. This is a physical reinforcement that you do not approve of the dog’s behavior.There are leashes and halters that allow you to gently pull the mouth closed while you’re out on a walk.

, When feasible, remove your dog from anything that triggers barking. Close blinds or curtains if your dog barks at people passing by. Put your dog alone in a room if she barks at guests.


Territorial barking can often be addressed by changing what your dog is able to see. Installing a wooden fence instead of a chain link fence or covering your windows with opaque film (that still allows light through) can help a territorial dog quiet down.If your dog startles at unfamiliar noises, play a white noise machine or leave a fan running while you’re not home. This can help distract your dog from the other noises she hears., If your dog barks whenever she sees other dogs or people, she may not get enough socialization. Model good behavior at the dog park, on walks, and when you interact with people. This can help teach territorial dogs that they don’t have to bark to protect their territory everywhere they go.

You can also take your dog to “doggie day care,” where she can play with other dogs and learn good dog behavior.

Tire your dog out.,
Teach your dog other ways to greet people.,
Teach your dog other ways to communicate.,
Desensitize your dog.,
Distract your dog.",How to Stop Dogs from Barking at People3," Sometimes, dogs bark because they’re frustrated or bored. If your dog doesn’t get enough exercise, he may bark because he has too much pent-up energy. Give your dog plenty of exercise and playtime to reduce problem barking.If your dog is bored, make sure he has plenty of toys. Puzzle games, especially those that involve food or treats, can be a good way to keep your dog occupied and happy.

, Happy dogs may bark to greet others. Teaching your dog other ways to greet them will cut down the problem barking.

For visitors to your home, teach your dog to go to a specific spot and wait to receive guests. Get her to sit and stay as you (or a helper) come in the door. Reward her with praise and treats.
You can also train your dog to find a special toy near the door when people come over. If he has a toy in his mouth, he’s less likely to bark when guests arrive.
Train your dog to sit quietly before allowing others to pet him when you’re out. This will also reduce the risk that anyone will get hurt by an excited dog.
Don’t reward greeting barks by acknowledging your dog. Wait until she’s quieted down before you greet her and give her pets or treats.

, Dogs often bark to communicate their needs. If you can train your dog to alert you in other ways, he won’t have to bark for everything.For example, ring a bell whenever you take your dog outside to associate the two. Train your dog to ring the bell (hotel-service “tap” bells work very well) when he needs to go outside.
Bang the water dish or food dish before you fill it. Your dog will learn to associate the two, and can bang or paw his dish when he’s hungry or thirsty.

, Desensitizing your dog to whatever is causing her barking can help curb problem barking.Start by introducing the stimulus at a distance -- far away enough that your dog doesn’t bark at first. For example, if your dog barks at a neighbor’s dog, ask if your neighbor will help you.


Move the stimulus a little bit at a time toward your dog. Praise her and give her treats for staying quiet.
As the stimulus approaches, feed your dog some treats. If she barks, stop the treats.
As the stimulus disappears, stop feeding your dog treats.
Start small. Gradually increase the time spent around anything or anyone that might make your dog bark.
Practice until your dog becomes more and more comfortable. Be patient. Remember: learning any new behavior takes time, practice, and consistency.

, Distracting your dog can help curb problem barking by giving your dog something else to focus on. Once you’ve distracted the dog, give him something else to do, such as fetch or perform a command.You can use a high-frequency whistle or a noisemaker to break your dog’s concentration when he barks. When the dog barks, use the noisemaker. This will interrupt the dog.
You can also make a physical noise that isn’t verbal, such as clapping or snapping your fingers. Don’t yell or shout, though, as your dog will think you’re barking with him.
Once you have your dog’s attention, ask him to perform a task that’s incompatible with barking. For example, you could ask him to fetch a toy, go to his crate, or perform a trick."

Take your dog to a quiet room.,
Choose a command to use.,
Initiate barking.,
Give the command after the dog is quiet.,
Keep practicing.",How to Stop Dogs from Barking at People4," Using a quiet room is the best option for training. Having your dog’s full attention will help it learn any new commands., Short words that are easy to understand, such as ""shh"" or ""quiet,"" are helpful. Choose a gesture to help reinforce the command, such as putting your finger to your lips or making a fist. Be consistent and use the command and gesture every time.

, Perhaps counter-intuitively, you need to get your dog to bark to teach her how to be quiet. You could have someone ring the doorbell, or you could rattle a toy that gets her worked up.Allow the dog to bark two or three times.Make a sudden gesture to surprise the dog and stop him barking.

, When training the dog you do not give a command while the dog is barking. Instead, you while he is quiet, you give a food reward and simultaneously give your ""Quiet"" command.


Do not reward the dog until the dog is quiet.
It can help to gently close your dog’s mouth while you repeat the quiet command., Use the quiet command until your dog can be quiet on cue. Remember that it can take some time for your dog to learn new behaviors, so be patient and be consistent!


When she stops, pause for a second and then praise her. Give her treats and encourage the silence.

Research your town or city's anti-barking laws.,
Call the relevant authority to report a noise complaint.,
Call animal control to report abuse.,
Get other neighbors to file the same complaint.,
Sue the dog owner in small claims court.",How to Stop a Neighbor's Dog from Barking2," Look online at your town or city's codes, by-laws or dog legislation. There may be a code against unruly pets or incessant barking at night; many places have legislation or regulations in place that deal specifically with dogs and/or noise. There might also be a code covering ignoring requests from neighbors.


Often neighborhood or civil dispute centers produce small briefs on dog issues, as they're rather commonplace complaints. See if a precedent has already been set in your neighborhood.
You may want to share your findings with your neighbor to give him or her one last chance to change before you call the authorities. If you're pretty sure it won't work, move straight to the next step.

, Find out what town hall/council/municipal office or other relevant authority to call so you can file a report on your neighbors for a noise complaint.The authorities will talk to the dog owner and assess the situation. They will usually inform you of the outcome. If nothing changes, call again a few days later.You might want to ask if anonymity is an option when you file the report. In some cases, this may not be an issue for you, especially if it's plain-as-day that you're the one pointing the finger thanks to previous attempts. However, if you have various upset neighbors, maintaining anonymity may be useful to prevent retaliation of any sort.
Some jurisdictions will act on anonymous complaints, while others require your name and address but won't reveal this to the neighbor complained about. Check the public or private status of making a complaint before making it.

, If you believe the barking is a result of neglect or another form of abuse, you have the right to call animal control. If the dog is being severely abused it will be confiscated from the owner, but in most cases animal control won't take the dog away. Instead, they'll come to assess the situation and try to educate the owners as to how to properly care for the dog.


If the dog is left outside during extreme heat or cold, this would be considered a good reason to call animal control.
If the dog looks underfed or dehydrated, you can call animal control.

, If the authorities get multiple calls about the same dog owner, they'll be more likely to take action quickly. There's definitely strength in numbers in this situation, so rally as many people as you can to remedy the situation., Even after getting the authorities involved, some stubborn dog owners won't comply with requests to quiet the dog. If nothing else works, you can sue for nuisance in small claims court. The goal will be to make a case that the dog's barking is preventing you from enjoying your own home.If you win, the dog owner will have to pay a small sum of money. Prepare to sue by doing the following:


Try to negotiate with your neighbor, so you can show the judge that you made an effort.
Decide how much you want to sue for. An attorney can help you figure out a dollar amount.
Gather witnesses and other proof, like photos or recordings.

Use a silent dog whistle.,
Try a sonic training system.,
Block the dog's view.",How to Stop a Neighbor's Dog from Barking3," There are mixed reviews on whether these devices work, but many have found success with them. Silent whistles make a sound that dogs can hear, but humans can't, so your neighbors won't even know you're using it. Whenever the dog barks, blow the whistle. it may take a number of attempts, but eventually the dog will associate barking with the piercing noise of the whistle, and stop barking.

, This uses more advanced technology to silence a dog's barking, but it's the same idea as the whistle. Again, the results are mixed; these seem to work better for some dogs than others. If you're at the end of your rope, it might be worth the expensive price tag to give it a try.

, If the dog barks every time it sees movement, blocking its view of your movements might help. Increase the height of your fence or close off areas where the dog sees movement. If the dog is being set off by your cats or other pets moving in the yard at night, this might be enough to quieten the dog.


Try to look at things from the dog's perspective when the dog is outside. See if there is anything outside in particular he is barking at, such as rabbits, squirrel, another dog, something else you think the dog might be barking at. Then think about whether there is a way to reduce this trigger.

Try ignoring the behavior first.,
Do clicker training.,
Use a command.,
Make a startling noise with keys or a can of pennies.,
Give your dog more exercise.",How to Stop a New Dog from Barking at Your Neighbors1," If you haven’t tried already, ignore your dog completely when it barks. Chances are, you give it some form of attention when it starts barking at neighbors or passersby. Your dog interprets this attention as a form of reward, which reinforces the noisy behavior.Don’t look at, touch, talk to, or otherwise give it any attention whatsoever while it barks.
Have a small food treat handy. As soon as it stops barking, give it the treat and some verbal praise. If you reward it as soon as it becomes quiet, it will associate calming down with the reward.;
, Clicker training is a positive reinforcement training method that has proven to be very successful for training dogs and other animals. Rewarding your dog for what they do right is much more effective than punishing them for what they do wrong. By clicking the clicker right when the dog does what they’re supposed to and then giving them a treat, you can clearly communicate to the dog what they’re being rewarded for., You can also train your dog to follow a command word such as “Quiet” or “Enough.” When it barks, say “Quiet” or “Enough” clearly and calmly, and use the same tone of voice every time you give the command.Reward quiet behavior with pea-sized treats, and keep offering a constant stream of treats for as long as the dog remains quiet.
Proceed with this sequence each time it barks, and keep track of its progress over the course of 10 or 20 repetitions.

, If significant time goes by and command word training isn’t successful, make a startling noise to get your dog’s attention. Shake a set of keys or rattle an empty can filled with pennies.If you succeed at getting its attention, tell it to come, then give it a treat if it remains quiet.
Don’t substitute the noise of metal for shouting, or the noise training won’t be effective.

, If your dog routinely barks excessively, it might have a case of canine boredom or need more exercise. Increase the length of its walks, or add another walk to its daily routine.Most dogs require at least a combined hour of exercise per day. For example, you can combine a half hour-long brisk walk with a couple shorter walks to total an hour for that day. Larger, more active breeds, like working dogs or sporting breeds, need more. Consult your vet to put together an exercise plan that accounts for your dog's specific health and breed requirements.
Try playing more games that offer both physical and mental stimulation, like fetch and hiding a toy or treat.
When it barks, try distracting it with a toy, having it perform a trick, or follow some other command word such as sit or come.

Contact animal control.",How to Report Excessive Dog Barking," The easiest way to report excessive barking is to call your city’s animal control department. Give the person on the other end of the phone the location of the dog and tell them how long the dog has been barking. You can find the animal control phone number by looking in your phone book or searching the Internet for “your city” and “animal control.”


In New York City, you can report excessive dog barking by calling 311.You can also report anonymously online.Depending on your city, you might have to contact a different department. For example, in Los Angeles, you need to contact your local animal shelter.If you can’t find the phone number for animal control, then call the police. They should direct you to the right number.;
, Some animal shelters will require that you send a letter. For example, Los Angeles requires that you send the following information in a letter to your nearest animal shelter:your name
your address
your phone number
the address of the barking dog
a description of the problem (such as when the dog barks)
your signature

, Your city’s police or animal shelter will send someone out to investigate. Realize that this person might not come out right away. Instead, the person may come to check on the dog at another time. You should be available to talk to the person investigating the barking dog.


Show the investigator where the dog is located and share any documentation, such as audio that you have recorded.

, In many cities, the city will respond to your complaint by sending the dog’s owner a letter, explaining how they can reduce the dog’s barking.If the dog continues barking, however, you need to report the barking once again to the appropriate authorities.

, Depending on your city or county, you may have to testify in court against the dog owner.You will probably be nervous. However, you should remember these tips for being an effective witness:Always tell the truth. It is illegal not to.
Never guess if you don’t know the answer to a question. Also be careful when providing estimates. Be sure to preface an estimate with the words, “If I have to give an estimate, then I’d say….”
Avoid humor. A court proceeding is serious business, and you should take it seriously.
Don’t get angry. Always try to remain calm and in control.

, Each city will have different rules about how much barking is “excessive.” Although you may find five minutes of barking late at night annoying, your city might not consider that amount of barking excessive. To find your city’s definition, search the Internet for “your city” and “excessive barking.”


For example, in Los Angeles, barking is excessive if it is continuous for 10 minutes or intermittent for 30 minutes within a three hour window.In New York City, by contrast, barking warrants calling law enforcement if it lasts continuously for 10 minutes or more between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 pm or for five continuous minutes between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am., You should carefully document the days and times when the dog is barking.If the dog barks mostly at night, keep a log beside your bed so that you can easily write down the duration of the barking.

, You can build your case by tape recording the dog barking. In some cities, police or animal control officers won’t come right away to investigate. Instead, they might stop by the animal’s house several weeks later and listen for 10 minutes to check if they can hear barking.In these situations, it is highly unlikely that the dog will be barking at the precise moment the investigator shows up to listen.


Accordingly, you should record audio of the dog barking so that you have proof.Use a digital recorder, tape recorder, or a camcorder. Your smart phone may be able to record video or audio.

, Experts disagree as to whether you should talk to the owner about the barking. In some situations, talking to the owner could be helpful. For example, the dog might bark only when the owner isn’t home, and the owner could be unaware of the barking.The owner could be grateful that you informed them of the problem.


However, some owners might become hostile if you complain about the dog. Complaints about excessive barking can escalate into tit-for-tat “wars” between neighbors: you complain about the dog, your neighbor makes up a complaint about you, etc.
If the dog owner becomes upset or annoyed when you talk, quickly end the conversation with a pleasant, “I just thought you should know” and don’t raise the issue again.

, Animal cruelty is very serious and should be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities. If you hear a wailing dog and investigate, then pay attention to the following signs of animal cruelty:open wounds or multiple healed wounds
a tight collar embedded in the dog’s neck
being extremely underweight
limping or inability to stand
heavy discharge around the nose or eyes
the owner hitting or otherwise abusing the animal

, The dog may be barking because it is in pain or suffering. You should first document the abuse, by writing down what you have seen.Give dates and times you have heard the animal howling. Also note if and when you saw the owner strike the dog.

, Don’t put yourself in danger. For example, you shouldn’t trespass on someone’s property, break into their garage, or approach an animal that looks wounded.Instead, take pictures from a safe distance, if possible.


Document the dates and times that you took the pictures.

, You should contact your local animal control or local animal shelter after you have gathered all of your information. Offer to meet the investigator to show them where the dog is located.

Discontinue reinforcement.,
Ignore the barking.,
Reward good behavior.,
Find a replacement behavior.,
Continue the training.",How to Get Dogs to Stop Barking1," Also called ""attention-seeking barking,"" request barking is a common problem for dog owners. The first step to breaking a dog's request barking is to stop giving your dog what she wants whenever she barks. This will, of course, take some time to train out of your dog, especially if she has been ""rewarded"" for her barking over many years.Try to distinguish between barking that stems from needing to use the bathroom (which is a valid need to vocalize) and barking over every minor desire, such as wanting to come on the couch or be given more attention.Do not give in to your dog's barking, no matter how much she barks. Any concession to a dog's request barking will undo whatever progress you may have been making.;
, Attention-seeking or request barking may be the only way your dog knows how to behave. Even after you've discontinued your reinforcement of that behavior, it will most likely take a while to break your dog of the habit. In the meantime, it's best to ignore - rather than punish - this attention-seeking behavior.In a dog's mind, even yelling at her to stop is considered attention. If you lose your patience and yell at your dog, she will probably bark for even longer next time, because she will have been conditioned to expect any kind of response (even a negative response).If your dog is barking, do not yell at her, or pet her, or give her what she wants. Do not even look at her. The best strategy is to distract yourself, like reading a book or newspaper, until your dog calms down or tires herself out., When your dog finally does stop barking, it's important that you praise and reward her for her silence. Over time, your dog will learn that being silent and obedient will achieve greater results than acting out and barking.Keep treats on hand for when she does stop barking. Rewards should be given as quickly as possible after the desired behavior to most effectively teach the dog.Vocally praise your dog when she stops barking. Say, ""Good dog!"" and give her a treat.As your dog learns that silence is rewarded with treats and barking is ignored, you'll need to gradually extend the period of time that your dog must be quiet before receiving a treat. For example, once she has passed the initial stages of getting a treat after the barking has stopped, you may want to prolong the required quiet time by a few seconds each day and work your way up to a minute or two before rewarding her.For best results, vary the amount of time your dog must remain quiet before getting a treat. That way she won't come to expect a treat after a certain duration of time, and the anticipation will keep her in quiet suspense. For example, after a few weeks of training, alternate between 20 seconds of silence, a whole minute of silence, and 30 or 40 seconds of silence., One of the best ways to train an animal out of undesirable behavior is to teach her an alternative behavior. That way, instead of growing increasingly frustrated and irritated that you are not responding to her desires, your dog will eventually realize that if she wants to get her way, she'll need to engage in the other, more-desirable behavior.Teaching replacement behaviors may be time consuming, but ultimately it is the best way to encourage desirable behavior. Instead of responding to your dog's vocal requests to play, for example, teach her to bring her favorite toy to you and set it on the floor.You can also prevent undesirable behavior by reducing the chances of those situations arising. For example, if your dog barks for your help whenever her ball rolls underneath the couch, try putting something under the couch to block her toys from rolling under there., Don't stop at discontinuing barking for attention. Continue your training to eventually cover all aspects of request/attention-seeking barking. Eventually, your dog will learn to wait patiently whether she wants to play, eat, or receive pets."

Get rid of stimuli.,
Keep your dog active.,
Stay calm.,
Distract with another command.,
Ignore the barking.,
Try behavior therapy.",How to Deal With a Barking Dog1," Take a look at what makes your dog bark and find a way to remove that motivation. If your dog likes to bark at passing pets they see through the window, close your curtains or blinds. If they bark at the doorbell, encourage individuals to call or text you and let you know they’re at your home.If there is a stimulus you can’t get rid of completely, such as your dog barking at their reflection in the window or mirror, try to limit their access. Keep the dog away from the stimulus as much as possible.;
, Barking may often be the result of pent-up energy. Help your dog expend that energy by keeping them active and mentally stimulated. Make sure they go for daily walks, and set aside time for one-on-one play every day.Provide your dogs with physical activity by making sure they get a long walk every day, or multiple walks a day.
Play games such as fetch and tug-of-war to help your dog release physical energy.
Challenge your dog mentally with agility training, obedience courses, or puzzle toys.

, Shouting only excites your dog further. Your dog understands a limited amount of words, and will mostly only hear your tone, which your dog will think is you joining in. Be stern, but remain calm and avoid raising your voice when your dog barks.Use a consistent word such as “stop,” “quiet,” or “wrong,” to indicate to your dog that they should stop barking. Consistency helps your dog recognize that word and the actions you expect when you say it.

, Distract your dog by giving them another command to which to respond instead of barking. Tell your dog to sit or perform a trick to get them to refocus on you instead of whatever is causing them to bark.


For best results, use a command your dog already knows, instead of one they are currently learning. Using a new command may confuse or frustrate your pet.

, If your dog’s barks are demands for attention, simply ignore them. This habit is often reinforced when owners pay attention to their dog simply to stop the noise. It will be loud and take time, but if you ignore it long enough, your dog will stop barking to get your attention.To make this especially effective, be sure to shower your dog with positive reinforcement when they aren’t barking. Pet them, play with them, and let them know you care. Just don’t give into their demands for your affection.

, Many veterinary offices can also offer behavior therapy if you have a dog that just won’t stop barking. Consult with your dog’s vet to see if they offer programs to help determine why your dog is barking and what you can do to break the habit.Barking can often be exacerbated by both mental and physical health problems in your dog. During therapy, ask your vet to check and make sure your dog is not in any pain.
Make sure that you teach your dog the ""quiet"" command. Ask your veterinarian for a referral to a certified dog trainer for help with teaching your dog the ""quiet"" command.

Make sure there are no medical causes of the chewing behavior.In some cases, dogs chew as a coping behavior when they suffer from psychological problems (like anxiety).,
Use negative reinforcement to discourage ""bad"" chewing.,
Use positive reinforcement to encourage ""good"" chewing.If you find your dog chewing on something appropriate, approach it calmly and give it enthusiastic, happy praise (using phrases like “good boy!”).,
Use deterrent sprays.Dogs are much less likely to chew on things with tastes that they find unpleasant.,
Encourage good chewing by providing your dog with toys and treats.If you provide your dog with acceptable things to chew on, it will have fewer incentives to chew inappropriate objects.,
Give teething dogs soothing treats.,
Make sure to spend time with your dog.Domestic dogs are social creatures that have evolved to be accustomed to contact with humans as well as with other dogs.,
Play with your dog and keep it interested in new things.,
Keep objects you don’t want your dog chewing out of its reach.Prevention can be the easiest way to stop your dog from chewing inappropriately, so remove its temptations.,
Don’t offer your dog confusing items to chew.Your dog may not understand if you offer it items to chew that are very similar to items you do not want it chewing.,
Supervise your dog, and keep it separated from things you don’t want it to chew, if necessary.You may notice that your dog resorts to chewing when you are not around.,
Teach your dog the ""leave it"" command.If you're willing to put in a little extra time and effort, it's possible to teach your dog a handy command that can save your possessions in cases where you catch it chewing on them.",How to Stop Your Dog from Chewing Things it Shouldn't," Likewise, if your dog is affected by certain parasites or nutritional deficiencies, it may be compelled to chew all sorts of things. Because of this, consider taking your dog to a veterinarian or animal behaviorist for an expert diagnosis and a suitable treatment plan, especially if the chewing is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, gastrointestinal problems, or abnormal behavior.;
, To train your dog not to chew, you need to make it understand two basic ideas: first, that chewing certain objects is unacceptable behavior; second, that chewing its own toys is “good.” To discourage your dog from chewing things it shouldn’t, immediately take the object away and scold the dog with a clear command like “No!” or “Bad dog!”If your dog releases the object, give it something appropriate to chew (like a treat or toy) and praise it.
If your dog runs away with the object, don’t chase it. Many dogs will interpret this as play behavior, and think of it as a reward.
Never hit or beat your dog. Most animal societies recommend against using corporal punishment. Moreover, it can lead to other problem behaviors triggered by anxiety.
Don’t scold or punish your dog after the fact.This is ineffective because the dog will not be able to associate the inappropriate action with the negative reinforcement.

, You can also offer your dog a small treat.


Offering praise and treats in this way is positive reinforcement that will encourage good behavior.Pairing the desired action (in this case, chewing appropriately) with praise and food associates the action with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction in the dog’s mind. With consistent training, the good behavior itself becomes its own reward.

, Thus, you can discourage your dog from chewing on certain things by rubbing or spraying them with bad-tasting substances.


Deterrent sprays in unpleasant flavors like bitter apple are available from pet supply stores.In addition, you can spray a weak solution of a common unpleasant-tasting substance (white vinegar, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, etc.) mixed with water.
Always use a non-toxic substance. Never try to deter your dog from chewing with a substance that can cause harm or illness.
This technique works best if your dog has a habit of chewing a particular object, or something immobile. For instance, you can spray chair legs with a bitter apple flavor if your dog has a habit of chewing on them.
This method is not fool-proof; some dogs will chew even if the item tastes bad.

, Make sure that your dog has a supply of toys and treats available to it wherever it goes. That way, whenever it has the urge to chew, you can offer it something appropriate, or it can find something on its own. Good choices include:


Rawhide treats
Chewing strips
Teething rings
Ropes
Squeaky toys
Raw bones (but no raw bones that can be a choking hazard, such as chicken bones)
Kong toys (which can be filled with food), Like human babies, young puppies go through a period of ""teething"" as their teeth come in. This can lead young dogs to chew incessantly, even when they're otherwise well-trained. To help with teething, try freezing a wet washcloth and giving it to your puppy to soothe the soreness caused by the teeth coming in., If they become bored or are kept from contact with other dogs, some dogs can resort to destructive coping behavior, including chewing. Give your dog a chance to meet and play with other dogs, such as at a dog park.

, Dogs don't just want toys; they want fun, happy interactions with the people in their family! Be sure to take the time to play with your dog a little bit every day, especially if it's been chewing. Just twenty minutes or so of play per day can go a long way towards expending a dog's excess energy and calming it down.


Lots of play and exercise can tire your dog in a safe and beneficial way so that it doesn’t expend extra energy on inappropriate chewing.Dog classes are available in many areas.These are an opportunity for pets and owners to practice together to help a dog learn new tricks or behavior. Keeping your dog active in this way can discourage excessive chewing.

, Place any objects your dog likes to chew (or might chew) out of its reach: in a cabinet, high off the floor, in a bag or box, etc.


Objects such as remote controls, shoes, and books are common temptations for dogs that like to chew.
Poisonous plants, electrical cords, cleaners, and any other hazardous objects should also be kept out of your dog’s reach., For instance, if you offer your dog an old shoe to chew on, it might be confused about why you don’t want it to chew on your new shoes. For the best chance of reducing your dog’s inappropriate chewing behavior (and saving your possessions), and avoid treats and toys that resemble things you don’t want it to chew.

, If this is the case, you may consider keeping it confined in a pen, dog crate, or other area while you are gone. You can also use baby gates to keep a dog out of rooms or areas that contain items it is tempted to chew.In addition, you can supervise your dog while you are at home. Even keeping your dog on a leash while you are at home to ensure it doesn’t chew inappropriately can help condition it and encourage positive behavior over time.

, To teach this command, use the following steps:


Get two small treats and hide one in each fist. Get the dog's attention with one treat, then sharply tell your dog, ""leave it"" (referring to the object it is chewing).
Don't let the dog have the treat. Let it sniff and lick at your hand, but don't let the treat go.
Ignore your dog if it starts to bark or whine. As soon as it loses interest in your hand, however, offer it the treat from the other hand and give it lavish praise.
Repeat this process until your dog moves away from your hand as soon as you say ""leave it."" This teaches your dog that ignoring whatever it wants to bite or chew on is better than chewing on that thing. Be persistent; do this over and over, and your dog should get the hang of this command.

Teach your dog to sit or lay down.,
Choose a place your dog should go when it barks.,
Use command training to teach it to go to its spot.,
Continue with spot training from various places.,
Add sit or lay down to the spot command.",How to Stop a New Dog from Barking at Your Neighbors2," When you send your dog to its designated spot, you'll tell it to sit or lay down there for as long as necessary. If your dog doesn’t already know how to sit or lay down, you’ll have to first teach it one of these commands.First, say the command calmly and clearly. Physically guide the dog into the appropriate position, then reward it with a small food treat as soon as it gets in that position. Repeat 10 to 20 times per training session to reinforce its association of following the command with a reward.
Use pea-sized food treats when you’re just starting out, then substitute food with a toy or verbal praise.

, Select a spot that’s still within view but at least eight feet away from the window or door. This is the spot you’ll teach your dog to go to when the doorbell rings or when it starts barking from the window.Examples include the doorway of an adjacent room, a mat or rug at the far end of a foyer, or a stairwell with a view of the front door.

, Choose a consistent command for your dog to follow, like “Go to your spot!” or “Mat!” Say the command, show the dog a treat, then toss the treat onto the mat or spot. Repeat this process 10 to 20 times.After about 10 repetitions, try pretending to throw the treat to the spot. When the dog goes to the mat, toss it the treat as soon as it gets into position. Don’t give it a treat until the moment it goes to its spot.
Make sure to use the same command with the same tone of voice every time you say it.

, Eventually, you should say the command and your dog should go the spot on its own. When it can reliably go to its spot, start mixing up when and from where you give it the command. Try giving the command from another room, and reward the dog when it gets to its spot., When you’re sure it understands the spot command, start telling it to stay or lay down once it’s in position.Say “Go to your spot,” and give a pea-sized reward when it gets to its spot. Then say “Sit!” or “Lay down!” and again offer a small food treat.
Repeat this sequence 10 to 20 times each day to reinforce the spot and sit or lay down command combination.

Get your dog used to new sights and smells.,
Be patient and consistent.,
Consult a trainer if you need help.",How to Stop a New Dog from Barking at Your Neighbors3," While command training can be an effective way to modify behavior, social training is the foundation of preventing barking problems. If you have a puppy, start introducing it to children, other animals, your neighbors, and other new sights and smells as soon as possible.Get your dog used to your neighbor by making a good introduction. Have your neighbor give your dog a treat when it stops barking, and do so regularly if necessary. If your dog knows command words, have your neighbor tell your dog to sit and offer a treat when it follows the command.

, Both command and social training take time and repetition. Make sure everyone in your household knows what specific command words your dog understands. Have everyone give command words with the same tone of voice.Make sure no one encourages your dog to bark by saying things like, “Who’s that?!” or getting up to look out the window.Remember to avoid yelling at your dog when it barks, unless you’re clearly and firmly saying a command word it understands. If you say “No!” or yell, your dog might think that you’re barking, too, which will reinforce the noisy behavior., If your dog isn’t responding to command or social training, consider enrolling it in obedience classes or getting it a private trainer or a veterinary behaviorist. Ask your dog-owning friends and family or your dog’s vet for a referral.Look for a board Certified Veterinary Behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). When choosing a trainer, check their websites to identify their certifications. Look for reviews online, and ask trainers if they have any current clients who can offer testimonials.

Recognize separation anxiety.,
Try counterconditioning your dog.,
Desensitize your dog to solitude.,
Be patient.,
Consider alternative arrangements.",How to Get Dogs to Stop Barking2," Separation anxiety can take various forms in a dog, but the most common signs of separation anxiety are destroying the house/apartment and barking incessantly. These behaviors are typically only engaged in when the dog's owner is at work or otherwise out of the house, and if the dog is not destructive, some owners may not even be aware that their dogs have separation anxiety.Common signs of separation anxiety to look out for include:


following you from room to room, no matter how briefly you are goneshaking, panting, or crying when you get ready to leave for the dayurinating or defecating indoors while you're not homechewing household objects when you're not homescratching or ""digging"" at the floor, walls, or doors when left alonepossible complaints from neighbors about barking or howling when left at home alone, Counterconditioning is a common treatment method for dogs that typically involves training the dog to associate something fearful with a reward. In the case of separation anxiety, instead of fearing someone or something, the dog fears being left alone. To counter condition  separation anxiety, you'll need to train your dog to associate being left alone with something the dog enjoys (like treats).Whenever you leave the house, try giving your dog a puzzle toy stuffed with food. Something hollow that can be stuffed with treats, spray cheese, or low-fat peanut butter will keep your dog occupied for at least 20 to 30 minutes, which may be long enough for her to forget that she was afraid of you leaving.When you get home, remove or hide the puzzle toy(s) so that your dog becomes conditioned to only having access when you're out of the house.Be aware that counterconditioning typically only works for mild cases of separation anxiety. Though puzzle toys will certainly be enjoyed by your dog no matter how severe her condition, you may need to resort to stronger approaches if your dog suffers from moderate to severe anxiety., If your dog has moderate to severe separation anxiety, she most likely will not be cured overnight. A good way to get your dog more accustomed to solitude is to gradually desensitize her to being left alone and reinforce the fact that getting ready to leave does not mean abandonment. This is a slow process that will take several weeks of practice and consistency, but should prove effective for long-term results.Work on pre-departure anxiety by exposing your dog to your various departure cues, like putting on a coat or picking up/jingling your keys. Try engaging in these behaviors at various times throughout the day without actually leaving the house.Teach your dog to become more comfortable alone by working on ""out-of-sight stays."" This entails having your dog sit or lie down and then stepping out of the room or otherwise out of sight.As your dog gets comfortable with you being out of her sight, try closing a door to block her access to you, and gradually extend the duration of time that you are out of the room or behind a closed door.Start out doing out-of-sight stays at a low-stakes door, like a bathroom or bedroom door. Do not attempt to jump right to the front door, as this may alarm your dog.After several weeks, you should progress to practicing out-of-sight stays at an exit door. But even then, it's best to use an alternate door (if possible) than the one you typically use to leave for work. For example, instead of going out the front door or the door to the garage, try going out the back door.As you extend the amount of time that you're out of your dog's sight or behind closed doors, you should incorporate counterconditioning methods like a puzzle toy to keep her distracted. Try adding this component once you're behind closed doors or out the back door for at least 10 to 20 seconds at a time., It takes a lot of training and practice to get your dog comfortable with prolonged absences. Most of an anxious dog's undesirable behavior will take place within the first 40 minutes that you're gone, and it will take many, many training sessions before you can comfortably reach a 40 minute absence.Only increase your absence by a few seconds each training session. Anything more than that may upset your dog and trigger her panic reactions.Once your dog can be comfortably left alone for 90 minutes, she will most likely be able to handle four to eight hours of solitude. However, in the early stages of that comfort level, it's best to ""test"" your dog at four hours of solitude, rather than jumping right to a full work day (if possible).If you are consistent with your training and practice several times each day on the weekends and at least twice a day on weekdays (such as before work and in the evening), you may be able to accomplish long-term comfort in under a month.However, every dog is different, and your dog may need a longer training period or more training sessions each day.
Be patient, and remember that your dog is only acting out because she loves you and is afraid you'll abandon her., If your dog absolutely will not calm down in spite of training, or if your landlord or neighbors have expressed impatience with your dog's need for training, you may need to consider alternative arrangements.See if you can bring your dog to work with you (depending on your workplace). It may not be ideal, but many offices are dog-friendly, especially if you explain your circumstances to your boss.Make arrangements for a friend or family member to watch your dog while you're gone. Most dogs only experience separation anxiety if they are left completely alone. In other words, having anyone there will usually help.Consider crate training. Crate training's success varies considerably from one dog to another. Some dogs are frightened by having to be left in a crate, while others see the crate as their own safe space and an assurance that someone will be home at some point to open the crate.Seek assistance from a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) if all else fails. A CPDT will know how to help your dog in the best way possible. Find a CPDT in your area by searching online, or ask your vet for a recommendation."

Recognize alarm barking.,
Teach your dog the quiet command.,
Apply the quiet command.",How to Get Dogs to Stop Barking3," Alarm barking is any pattern of barking at perceived intruders. While barking at a real intruder is useful and may save a person's life, barking at perceived intruders like mail carriers, parcel deliverers, or even just neighbors passing by the property can be annoying and troublesome.Alarm barking does not always require a visual confirmation of the perceived intruder. Some dogs may engage in alarm barking simply from hearing a car door outside or hearing voices on the sidewalk.Alarm barking is often accompanied by a slight lunge or pounce forward (one to two inches) with each bark., The best way to quell alarm barking is by teaching your dog to be quiet on command. Like any training, this will most likely be a time-consuming process that requires patience and consistency. But if you're willing to put in the time and effort, even the most territorial dog will learn to behave better.When your dog starts engaging in alarm barking, hold up a treat after three or four barks. This will get her attention and will most likely distract her from the perceived intruder.Wait until she stops barking. Simply be patient and continue to hold up the treat.Once your dog stops barking, say ""quiet"" in a calm but stern voice and give her the treat.Repeat this process until your dog learns to associate the word ""quiet"" with her silence. Once your dog has done this successfully on 10 or more occasions, you can begin giving the quiet command without showing her a treat. If she still complies with your command, then give her a treat. If she does not, you may need to show her the treat for several more training sessions.Eventually your dog will learn to be quiet on command without getting a treat. Even after you've reached this stage of training, however, you should still give your dog verbal praise when she stops barking., Once your dog has learned the quiet command in training sessions, you'll need to apply the quiet command to real-world scenarios. You can do this by having a friend slam a car door in front of your house, rattle your mailbox, or approach your front door.Have a treat ready every time your friend comes to the door. Even if you've passed the point of giving treats during regular training, you may need to use treats for applied training sessions involving an actual perceived intruder.When you have someone come to the door pretending to be the mailman, it's imperative that your friend does not leave the porch until your dog is quiet. If he leaves while she is still barking, she may come to think that it was her barking which drove him away."
"
Recognize compulsive/boredom barking.,
Give your dog more exercise.,
Teach your dog tricks.,
Leave distractions for your dog.",How to Get Dogs to Stop Barking4," If your dog barks compulsively for no reason, or tends to bark when she's left alone (in the yard, for example), she may be engaging in boredom barking. Dogs that bark when left alone may be experiencing separation anxiety, but there are usually other symptoms which accompany that problem, like destructive behavior, bathroom problems, and following you around when you're home. Common signs of compulsive or boredom barking include:


excessive barking in a repetitive patternpacing or running back and forth, usually while barking or shortly before/after barkingbarking whenever left alone (without other signs of separation anxiety)barking whenever you stop paying attention to her, Exercise and play time are the best remedies for compulsive and boredom barking. While walking your dog is, of course, an important part of getting her exercise (even if you have a fenced-in yard), it may not be enough. Try having your dog run back and forth between two people for 10 to 20 minutes, chase a ball or toy, or take your dog jogging with you before you leave for work.Giving your dog at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise each day is important for her physical and mental well being, and may help reduce incidents of problem behavior like boredom barking.You should also spend some time each day playing with your dog. You can play hide and seek, or just toss a ball around and have her chase or fetch the ball., Learning and practicing tricks is an excellent way to prevent boredom in dogs and discourage compulsive behavior. Tricks require focus, attention, and retention of lessons, which can occupy your dog both physically and mentally.Once your dog has learned a few tricks, have her perform them everyday. This will help her remember the tricks she's learned and also help keep her occupied and engaged., In addition to exercise, leaving distractions around the house is a great way to inhibit problem behaviors like boredom barking. You can use a puzzle toy stuffed with peanut butter, or simply toss a handful of treats in various places around the room. You can also leave a radio or television on for the dog so the sound will distract her."

Let the owners know.,
Try mediation.,
Submit a complaint to Animal Services.,
Check on the dog.",How to Deal With a Barking Dog2," If there is a dog in your neighborhood that constantly barks or howls, the first course of action is to talk to the owners directly. Let them know their dog’s noises have become a problem, and ask them if there is anything that can be done.Remember to be calm, polite, and reasonable. There is a good chance your neighbor doesn’t know about the barking, since it may happen when they are not home.
Let the owner know, ""I hear your dog barking frequently, and the noise can be disruptive for some of us in the neighborhood. Is there anything we can do to help calm down your dog and reduce the noise?""
Do not demand anything of your neighbor. They know what solutions will work best for their pet. Simply bring their attention to the issue, and ask what can be done.

, If your neighbor is unwilling to strike a compromise regarding their dog, consider going to mediation. The mediation process allows you and your neighbor to sit down with a trained, impartial third party to discuss the core issue and reach a mutual solution.Mediation helps keep matter from escalating to a lawsuit or other formal actions. Your neighbor is not required to mediate, but you can encourage them to do so in lieu of a formal complaint.
You can find a mediator online through groups such as the American Arbitration Association, or contact a local law office for recommendations on mediators in your area., File a complaint with your local Animal Services office letting them know about the noise. Many cities and counties have protocol for issuing written notices letting owners know that excessive noise must be dealt with.Contact your local animal shelter to ask them about the complaint process. Let them know your concerns, and ask them if they offer an abatement program to open an investigation into and help deal with excessive noise complaints.

, Your neighbor’s dog may be barking because of an annoyance such as a squirrel that likes to run through the lawn. It may also be barking if it has poor living conditions, such as being left alone outside 24/7 with improper access to shelter, food, or water.If it is a minor annoyance, work with your neighbor to resolve the issue. If a squirrel is the problem, for example, have one of you contact animal control to have the squirrel rehomed.
If the dog does not have quality living conditions, contact animal control immediately to get the dog the help it needs.

Yell for help.,
Find a distraction.,
Keep your calm.,
Call animal control.",How to Deal With a Barking Dog3," If a barking dog is approaching you and you believe it may be aggressive, call for help. Yell loudly and clearly. People in the surrounding area may notice and come to offer you assistance.Avoid yelling if the dog is close and rapidly advancing toward you. The dog may perceive your yelling as a threat, and continue its advance.

, If a dog is barking and you think it may pose a threat, find something for it to bite that isn’t you. A frenzied dog will bite at almost anything, so find a stick, a bag, or another object that you can hold out for the dog to bite instead of you.If you cannot find such an object and truly believe that a bite is inevitable, wrap your arm up in a shirt, jacket, or other heavy material. Encourage the dog to bite the covered arm while you call for help or try to retreat.

, An aggressive dog is encouraged by fear and anxiety. Avoid yelling or kicking, stand tall, and stand slightly sideways to show the dog that you don’t want to take their space.If possible, claim your own space by holding out an object such as an umbrella or a bag to make yourself look bigger. This lets the dog define what is your space and what space belongs to it.

, If you have your mobile phone available, call animal control to let them know that there is an aggressive stray in the area. Provide them with the general location of where you last saw the dog, as well as what kind of aggressive behaviors it exhibited.If you think the dog is an immediate threat, also notify 911 and ask for help to be sent to your area immediately.

Instead, let it get used to its new surroundings and its new family first. Once the dog has a steady routine and has gotten comfortable around you, then you can introduce it to the neighbors.


Waiting to introduce your new dog around will also allow you the time to figure out how it feels about strangers. If it is super friendly and easy going, then introductions will not be an issue. If it is guarded and fearful or aggressive, then you will need to do more work around how to respond when meeting new people.;
, Check to see if it knows commands and whether it will follow them reliably. Once you understand what your dog can and will do, then you will know better what to expect when introducing it to others.


If your dog doesn't know commands or will not respond to them reliably, then you will need to do some training with the dog. Many people use positive reinforcement and repetition to get a to reliably respond to commands such as sit, stay, and lay down.

, You want to make sure that you have physical control over the dog before the introduction. Put a collar or harness on the dog and hook a leash to it. Make sure you can hold on to the dog even if it goes wild or gets overly energetic.Harnesses can be great to use on dogs that have a lot of energy and can pull a lot. If attached correctly they hold the dog very well and the dog cannot wiggle out of them like they can with a collar.
Keeping the dog on leash also protects the dog from getting loose and lost in a new neighborhood., Before the meeting you can tell your neighbor how to interact with the dog for the first time. This may include highlighting the fact that calmness in them will promote calmness in the dog and that contact should be made gradually.Give the neighbor a treat for the dog ahead of time and tell them the commands you would like them to give the dog before giving it a treat.
You may also want to tell the neighbor to avoid direct eye contact with the dog initially. Direct eye contact can be read as aggressive by a dog., If your new dog is agitated or temporarily ill behaved, then it is not the right time to have an introduction. Make sure your dog is in a good mood, fully fed, and tired out from exercise before introducing it to a new person.Instead of just meeting the neighbor by chance, make a plan to meet intentionally. This will allow you to make sure the time and place is right.

, Dogs can get territorial in their own space, so it's best to have a meeting with someone new at a location that is neutral. This could be a park or backyard that the dog has never been in, or it could simply be on a the sidewalk away from its house.If you must have the meeting at your home, you will run a greater risk of having the dog exhibit territorial behavior towards the neighbor.

, It is important to keep your dog on leash and keep a good hold of the leash while the dog is meeting someone new. Since the dog is new to you, you will not necessarily be able to identify the signs that it is going to misbehave before it does it. This means that you should keep a strong hold at all times in case the dog's mood or behavior changes suddenly.


Even if the dog is behaving well, keep a hold on its leash. Your dog should learn that you are in charge and you holding onto the leash will signal that.

, If your dog has a hard time meeting new people, you will need to take the interaction slowly. You will also want to make it possible for the dog to approach the neighbor, not the other way around.


Your dog should first be given some time to see the neighbor from a distance.Then you should bring the dog close enough to smell the neighbor but not make contact. Then, if all is going well, you can allow physical contact. This usually includes the dog sniffing the neighbor.
It can be a good idea to meet up with the neighbor while going for a walk. If the dog continues to move while the new person comes into their space, they are less likely to resist it., If your dog is aggressive towards the neighbor then you should delay the meeting until you can train the dog more. There is no use in exposing your neighbor to an aggressive dog. Instead, take it as a learning experience and focus your energy on dog training and behavior management.


There are some dogs that take a bit of time to warm up to new people. If you know this about your dog and you are sure that it will warm up to the neighbor, then you can continue the introduction. Just be sure to warn the neighbor about this beforehand and make sure that they are fine with doing a little bit of work to befriend the dog.

, When introducing your new dog around, you want to be sure that it does not get overwhelmed. You also don't want to put it in a situation where it is likely to act badly or fearfully. With this in mind, introduce a new dog to only one or two neighbors at a time.


Slow and intentional introductions can set up lifelong quality relationships between your dog and its neighbors.

, Make sure your dog doesn't have a biting or snapping fear response before introducing it to a child. New dogs that are scared may show fear by snapping or biting.


This fear response can injure a child that doesn't know to take caution with a new dog.

, If your dog is well behaved and friendly to your neighbor then it should be rewarded with a treat or a fun activity for its behavior. Giving the dog positive reinforcement will help assure that it behaves the same way the next time it meets a new person., If your dog doesn't react to strangers in a way that you want it to, then you will need to spend some time training it. This is usually done with positive reinforcement and consistency. Specifically, you will need to get your dog to reliably respond to commands and you will need to introduce it to a wide range of people so that the experience becomes normalized.


If your dog is actually aggressive with strangers, as opposed to scared or hesitant, then you will need to go about this training more strategically. The dog may even require the expertise of a professional dog trainer.

, Part of training will be making sure that your dog is comfortable with people, including strangers. This is called ""socialization.""In order to do this you should lead by example, showing over-the-top kindness and joy when meeting people and showing affection. If your dog sees you welcoming new people, it is more likely to exhibit this behavior as well.


Ideally, socialization should begin when a dog is a puppy. However, it is never too late to socialize a dog and make it comfortable meeting new people.Tell people that you are meeting up with or who are coming to your home about the situation. Make sure they model friendliness and joy with you and the dog.
If you have a dog that has been trained to guard, then it will harder to get it to be friendly to strangers.

Meet your dog's needs.,
Rule out medical problems.,
Use training methods.,
Give her more exercise.,
Block what bothers her.,
Consult an expert.,
Try bark deterrents.",How to Get Dogs to Stop Barking5," If your dog is hungry or left out in the yard all day every day, she will probably bark. No amount of training or behavioral techniques will subdue her need for food and comfort. Make sure your dog always has plenty of cool, clean water to drink any time she needs it, two to three nutritious meals each day, and access to the inside of your home.

, Sometimes barking is your dog's way of indicating to you that she is injured or sick. If there is a chance that your dog might have some medical problem or injury, you should take her to see a vet as soon as possible., Teaching your dog the ""quiet"" command is an excellent training technique. It will be useful for any kind of problem barking, though it may be the only option for certain behavioral problems like territorial alarm barking.Any time your dog starts barking unnecessarily, hold up a treat to distract her from the perceived intruder.Once your dog has stopped barking, say the word ""quiet"" and give her the treat.Gradually lengthen the duration of time she must be quiet before getting the treat. Eventually, she should reach a point where simply saying the word ""quiet"" without showing her a treat will elicit a silent response., Exercise is a great way to curb problem behavior, including excessive barking. Whether your dog is anxious, territorial, or simply bored, getting a good workout will probably help reduce the frequency and intensity of her problem barking.Depending on your dog's age and physical abilities, you can exercise her in a number of ways. Long walks are good for older dogs, while younger dogs might enjoy going jogging with you, chasing a ball for a game of fetch, playing tug-of-war, or other interactive toys., If your dog has barking problems whenever she sees or hears something outside, a simple solution might be to block her access to seeing or hearing that trigger. If she stands at the window and barks, try putting up curtains or blinds so she can't see passing people or animals. If the sounds she hears outside tend to set her off, try leaving a radio on during the day to distract her and muffle the sounds outside your home., There are many different types of dog behavior specialists, each with their own unique qualifications. No matter what kind of expert you choose, you should always check the person's qualifications and look for recommendations or reviews online. If you can't find an expert online, ask your vet for recommendations on an expert who can help your dog with her unique needs.Trainers are often certified, but not always. Trainers may also go by other titles, such as behavior counselor, pet therapist, and pet psychologist.Certified Professional Dog Trainers (CPDTs) are certified by an independent organization. In order to become certified, a prospective CPDT must complete a rigorous hands-on training program, pass a standardized test, and provide letters of recommendation.Behaviorists may have a number of different types of titles, but essentially any kind of behaviorist must have earned a master's degree or a PhD in animal behavior. Typically a behaviorist with a doctoral degree will be called a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), while a behaviorist with a master's degree will be called an Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (ACAAB)., Bark deterrents like anti-bark collars are very unpleasant for dogs, and should only be used as a last resort when no other method has worked. Some people oppose bark collars because of the perception that these bark deterrents are punishment devices. Training works much better than punishment devices, and training will of course provide the best long-term solutions to behavioral problems, but if training hasn't worked for your dog and your landlord has threatened eviction or police intervention, you may need to resort to a bark collar.Citronella collars deliver a small, short blast of citronella every time the dog barks. These types of collars have been shown to be at least as effective as electronic collars, and do not risk causing any pain or real discomfort to the dog.Ultrasonic bark collars deliver an ultrasonic noise that only dogs can hear. It is unpleasant for the dog, but does not cause any real pain.Shock collars are similar to citronella and ultrasonic collars, but instead deliver a brief electric shock to the dog's neck. These collars typically have a number of different settings to change how intense the shock is, and if using one of these collars it is best to use the lowest setting possible to prevent injury to the dog. Again, these should only be used as an absolute last resort."

Vaccinate your new dog.,
Accept responsibility for your dog’s actions.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Elderly Neighbors1," Before you take your new dog across the street to meet your elderly neighbors, you should make sure your neighbors are interested in this interaction. While many people welcome interactions with dogs, not everyone is going to be excited about meeting the newest addition to your family. Before you show up on their doorstep with your dog, walk over and ask them if they’re interested in meeting your pooch.


Try saying, “Donald, our family just got a new dog. Would you like to meet him?”;
, Since many dogs are territorial, it is important that the introduction does not happen in your dog’s territory. For example, you should not introduce your dog to your neighbor in your yard or house. Instead, choose to introduce them in your neighbor’s yard, or in a more neutral space, like the neighborhood park.

, It is crucial that your dog understands basic commands like sit, stay, and down before you introduce them to your elderly neighbors. This will ensure that you remain in control of the interaction and that your dog will respond to you should something go awry. If you are having trouble teaching your dog basic commands, consider taking them to obedience school before you introduce them to your elderly neighbor.Dogs that are well-behaved at home may not respond to commands consistently in unfamiliar territory. You should practice with your dog in a park or other location outside of your home so that you can be confident they will respond to your commands when your neighbors are around.

, Before you introduce your dog to anyone or any dog, you must make sure your dog is up to date on all of their vaccinations. Schedule a check-up with your veterinarian and go over your dog’s vaccination records. If your dog is due for new vaccinations or boosters, make sure these take place before introducing your dog to your elderly neighbors., Before your dog meets your elderly neighbors, it is important that you understand you are legally and morally responsible for your dog’s behavior. For example, if your dog bites or injures your elderly neighbors, you will likely be responsible for paying any costs associated with your neighbors’ injuries. Likewise, if your new dog destroys your neighbors’ property, chances are you will have to bear responsibility for your dog’s transgressions."

Master basic commands.,
Make sure your dog’s vaccinations are up to date.,
Understand you are legally and morally responsible for your dog’s actions.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Children1," Children are often small in stature; as a result, they are sometimes literally in the dog’s face. Kids are full of energy, moving abruptly and often erupting in high-pitched noises that can startle and unnerve your new dog. They also might not realize that a dog’s growl or stiff back might indicate the dog wants the child to back off, and a kid’s lack of responsiveness to a dog’s body language can be read as threatening by the dog., Before you introduce your dog to kids, the dog should master basic commands such as sit, stay, and down. Your dog will need to know these commands so that you can control them as they interact with children. If you are having trouble teaching your new dog basic commands, you should consider obedience training before allowing your dog to interact with kids., Regular veterinary checkups and vaccination schedules should be part of every dog owner’s routine. It is extremely important that your dog is up to date on all of their vaccinations prior to being around children. Call your vet and make sure your dog is properly vaccinated before you introduce them to kids., While interactions between children and dogs can be wonderful for both parties, they can also quickly escalate into an undesirable, or even dangerous situation. If your dog bites or harms a child, you are responsible. Knowing this will help you understand the importance of preparing your new dog to interact with kids."

At the obedience classes you could ask other people about their experiences of introducing dogs to new family members.You could ask your local pet store if they know about good obedience classes in your neighborhood.
You could check if there is an American Kennel Club that offers obedience training in your area.;
, You should make sure your dog knows how to sit, stay, heel and other basic commands. If your dog does not know basic commands, it will be difficult to properly introduce them to a new family member. Consider additional training if your dog does not respond to basic commands.To teach your dog to “come,” you should find a quiet place. Kneel down so that you are the same height as your dog. Say “come” and open your arms wide. When your dog gets to you, give them a little pat on the head and a treat.Another basic command is “heel.” It will take some effort to teach your dog to heel, but it is very worthwhile.

, Teach them by pointing at their bed or a particular place in the house and saying “go to place.” This will be a useful command when you are introducing your dog to the new family member.Learn how to train your dog to “go to place.”


, Take your dog for a walk in the park and observe their reactions to babies. See how your dog looks at babies from a distance. If your dog growls or reacts aggressively, you should consult a dog trainer immediately to find a solution.If your dog seems neutral or fine with babies, you can try walking closer to them and just get your dog familiar with the general looks and sounds of babies., Ask a friend or a family member with a baby whether you could go for a walk with them with your dog. Keep your dog on a leash and walk a safe distance from the baby stroller. By walking with your friend’s baby, your dog will get used to the sights and sounds of babies. You could tease out this idea by saying to your friend:“I am trying to get my dog used to the idea of a new family member in the house. I have heard it can be good to expose dogs to babies prior to the arrival of a new family member. Would you be up for a walk with my pooch and I?”

, Since your household will have new routines when the baby comes, you should get your dog used to the changes ahead of time. If you anticipate having to walk your dog for shorter periods or at different times of the day, for instance, you should start this new walking routine prior to the baby’s arrival.If you anticipate being really tired in the mid-afternoon after your baby’s arrival, you could start taking naps at that time so that your dog is used to the new routine.
If you anticipate eating dinner a little earlier every evening, you could start with the new dinner time so that your dog gets used to the new routine.

, Get a doll, as well as a stroller, crib and other equipment you will need for the baby. Start taking the doll for walks in the stroller and putting it to bed at night in the crib. Let your dog watch you take care of the doll. By watching you with the doll, your dog will start getting used to some of the changes that will take place with the new family member.If your dog shows good behavior around the doll, you should give praise.You could take your doll for a walk in the stroller with your dog., In the weeks ahead of your due date, you should gradually give your dog less and less attention. A gradual transition of routine and attention will be easier on your dog than a sudden shift in the amount of attention you give them.For instance, if you usually cuddle with your dog and watch a movie on a particular night of the week, you could try skipping this routine some of the time. Your dog will get used to the diminishing attention, as long as you make sure it is a gradual transition.

, Install a baby gate, or a screen door, in front of the baby’s room. Your dog will be able to see and hear what is going on, but will be unable to go in. By installing the gate ahead of time, your dog will get used to the new boundary.When shopping for a baby gate, remember to measure the doorway where the gate will be installed. You should also know the height of your dog, since you want to purchase a gate that your dog will be unable to jump over.You should avoid pressure mounted gates, since your dog will be able to push them over. Instead, get a hardware mounted baby gate. Hardware mounted gates are much more difficult for dogs to get around., Play a soft recording of baby noises in the background when you are hanging out with your dog or cleaning. Your dog will get used to the sounds. If they are behaving well, you can try turning up the volume slightly."

These commands can distract your dog if they are acting inappropriately around the baby, and they will improve the overall behavior of your dog. Good commands to teach your dog include “sit,” “come,” and “leave it.”To teach your dog a command, show them the proper behavior while giving a command such as “sit” or ""come.” Give them a treat when they successfully do it. Soon they will associate the word with the command.If you are having difficulty training your dog yourself, you may want to take them to obedience classes or find a local dog trainer to train the dog for you. Some trainers may even offer baby safety classes for dogs.;
, If your dog has certain habits that may harm the baby, you should train the dog to stop before the baby arrives. These might be behaviors that are harmless to adults but could cause injury to babies.If your dog jumps on people, they may try to jump on someone holding the baby or they try to jump on the baby themselves.
If your dog likes to sit on laps, you should encourage the dog to instead sit beside you quietly. Train your dog to only come into your lap when requested.
Make sure the dog can properly walk on a leash. This will ensure that the dog can safely accompany the baby stroller on walks.

, If possible, arrange a supervised visit between your dog and young children or babies both inside and outside of your home. Watch your dog to see how they react to being around young children.You can ask family members or friends if they would be comfortable with letting their children play with your dog.
Give your dog a treat if they sit quietly while children pet or play around them. This will teach your dog to associate children with positive events, and it will reward them for acting calmly around children.
If the dog acts aggressively towards the child, remove them from the situation. Consider contacting a behaviorist for help.

, If your dog won't be allowed in the nursery or playroom when the baby arrives, start restricting them now. By making this a routine before the baby comes home, your dog will think that it is normal.You can use physical barriers, like baby gates, to block rooms and areas. These will let your dog see and smell into a room, which can help them get used to the baby, but it will prevent them from entering the room.

, It may be useful to start acclimating the dog to a rough or unusual touch. Start petting the dog in places that a child might grab, such as the paw pads, face, tail, belly, ears, and mouth. Reward the dog with a treat if they manage to sit calmly while you touch them in these areas. Do this a few times a day for a few minutes at a time., When the baby is born, you may have to change the dog’s exercise, feeding, or play schedule. Over a period of one to four months, slowly change the dog's schedule by a few minutes everyday.Start feeding the dog at irregular periods so that your dog does not expect food at an exact time. For example, instead of feeding your dog exactly at eight every morning, pick a random time between six and nine o’ clock every day.

, If your dog will be allowed in the nursery, let them sniff around the new items, such as the crib, toys, rocking chair, and changing table. Give them lots of time to investigate the area, and reward them if they're calm.


Give your dog scents associated with babies. Let them sniff bottles of things like baby powder, oil, shampoo, or diapers. You can even sprinkle a bit of baby powder on your clothes and let your dog sniff you.

, If you can find one, you may want to invest in a realistic baby doll that makes crying and babbling noises. You can usually find these at baby stores. Start treating this doll as though it is a real baby. This will let your dog see the things you will be doing with the baby, and it will help them adjust to the types of noises a baby can make. You can:Make the doll cry
Bounce the baby doll on your lap
Rock in the rocking chair with the doll
Change the doll’s diaper
Get the dog to sit quietly beside you on the couch while you hold the doll
Take the doll out in a stroller while walking your dog

, The baby will require most of your attention in their first months of life, and this means that your dog will not be able to spend as much time with you. While you should not outright ignore your dog, slowly reduce the amount of time you spend with the dog by about ten minutes a day.If the dog is very attached to you, you may want to have your spouse, partner, or another family member spend more time with them so that they can develop a stronger bond. By doing this, the dog will have someone to be with when you are caring for the baby.

, You may want to check that the dog's vaccinations are up to date. If your dog has not been spayed or neutered, you should consider doing it now. 'Fixed' dogs are calmer and less likely to be aggressive than dogs that haven't been spayed or neutered.You may also want to take the dog to the groomer to cut away excess fur, trim the nails, and remove any earwax. It may be difficult for you to do this after the baby is born, and it will help keep your home clean., While the baby’s arrival might be hectic, it is important to care for your dog during this period. Make sure a family member can care for the dog at home, or ask a friend to take the dog in for a few days. If the dog is well cared for in this period, they may be less excitable when you return with the baby., After the baby is born but before they come home, ask someone bring a blanket or an item of clothing that the baby has worn home. Give this item to the dog so that they can sniff it. This will familiarize the dog with your baby’s scent, and it will cause less stress to the dog when the baby arrives home., Have someone wait outside with the baby or take the baby into another room. Come inside, and greet the dog calmly. Let the dog sniff you and other family members before bringing in the baby., It is best to introduce the baby and the dog while the dog is restrained on a leash. Even if the dog is friendly, they can easily injure the baby in their excitement. Have one person hold the baby, and the other person hold the dog.

, Find a stable place to sit with the baby in your arms. Have another person slowly bring the dog towards you on a leash.If the dog starts jumping, pause until the dog calms down. If the dog is calm enough, you can let the dog sniff the baby. If your dog becomes aggressive, immediately take them out of the room.


If you have more than one dog, introduce them to the baby one at a time.If the dog growls or jumps on the baby, gently pull back on their leash or state a command like ""come"" to distract them. Remove them from the room, and try introducing them again later.

, Although you may have your hands full with the new baby, you should try to keep the dog as busy as possible. Make sure the dog has plenty of toys, such as chew toys and food puzzles. Always take them on their scheduled walks to prevent destructive behavior.You can also think of activities that the dog can do with the baby, such as taking the stroller out when you walk the dog.

, As the baby grows, you may become more comfortable with the dog and the baby being together, but you should never leave the two unsupervised. If the baby bothers the dog, the dog may bite. There may also be accidental injuries. For example, the dog may unintentionally scratch the baby, causing serious injury. Always supervise the dog and baby when they are together; never leave them alone.If you notice the dog acting in appropriately around your baby, redirect the dog by calling their name or giving a command like ""down"" or ""come."" Praise them if they can be easily distracted.

, The dog should have a private space in the home where they can retreat if they are stressed or annoyed by the baby. This can be a crate, a dog bed, or a corner. The dog should always have access to this area, and you should not disturb the dog while they are there. As the child grows, teach them not to go into the dog’s den or to bother the dog when they are in this area."

If you notice which groups your dog reacts negatively towards, you can try to change this negative association for your dog.Your dog may have many reasons for this negative association. If you got the dog from a shelter or as an adolescent, they may have had bad experiences in the past with specific groups of people.
Additionally, your dog may not have had a lot of exposure to a specific group of people, so they are fearful of unknown people. Getting them more exposure to different groups of people is the best way to make them less fearful.;
, If you find your dog is fearful or dislikes men, women, or people of color, it's a good idea to expose your dog to some of these different groups. You'll want this to be in a safe setting where your dog feels comfortable.


You can invite friends that are members of different groups your dog dislikes over to your house. Keep your dog on a leash at all times so you can control them.
Your friends can offer treats to your dog. Once your dog begins to affiliate treats with specific types of people, they will begin to get over their fear and dislike.

, Dog can be easily overwhelmed with too many people. If you can introduce your dog to a few new people in a controlled environment, they can learn that people are not scary, but can be good and friendly.When your friends come over, give them treats or dinner to give to your dog. If possible, see if your dog will take their dinner or treats from your friend.
It’s important to keep your dog on a lease. They may get frightened and lash out, so you want to be able to control their movements in case this happens.

, Your dog should trust you, so if you are friendly towards others, your dog should learn that they should be friendly towards those people as well. Even something as simple as sitting and talking to others while your dog watches can be useful to get them over being aggressive towards strangers.


Sitting and talking quietly with other people makes your dog think of them as friendly. They may bark or seem aggressive at first, but if you ignore them, your dog will eventually learn that this specific stranger is not a threat to you.
While you’re talking to other people, you can have treats at your feet. If your dog approaches, they get the treat, while if they are too afraid they will not.

, When you invite people over, you want your dog to not be aggressive or hostile towards others. Giving them treats when they are nice, even if they are not especially friendly, can get them to be more open towards meeting others.


When your first introduce your dog to a new person, give them a treat if they don’t bark. Even saying things like “good boy” or “good girl” if they don’t bark can be a good first step.
If possible, see if your dog will take the treat from the new person. However, it’s important to know your dog’s signs of aggressive so they don’t bite or lash out rather than taking the treat gently from the stranger.

, Speaking in a friendly tone of voice can get your dog to be friendlier towards other people. If your dog begins acting out or acting aggressively towards others, speaking in a firm and lower tone of voice will get them to pay attention and listen to you.When you're socializing your dog around a few other people, speaking in a pleasant and excited tone of voice should get your dog to also be pleasant or excited. Once they associate your happiness with the other person, they should realize there is no threat.
If your dog looks anxious or looks like they may get aggressive, speak in a firm tone of voice. This will let them know you mean business and that they need to obey you.

, Your dog may get overwhelmed around too many strangers. Instead, take your dog for a walk where they can see strangers, but are not too close to them.Your dog may be curious about other people in the distance. If their curiosity seems pleasant, but not anxious, then maybe you can walk closer to other people.
It's important to take some time for your dog to get used to being close to strangers. They may not seem ready to be near others; if this is the case, don't force them to meet new people just yet.

, Dogs may take both of these things as signs of potential aggression. They may get nervous and dislike the stranger before even meeting them.


If you know the new people your dog is meeting, ask them to avoid eye contact. Eye contact for dogs can meet a fight for domination, depending on the circumstances.Having the stranger approach your dog from an angle is also a good idea.This way your dog will not see them as a threat or be surprised by their appearance., When you're in public, some people may want to pet your dog, so it's important to know your dog's reaction. If your dog is likely to be aggressive if being pet by strangers, tell others that your dog does not like to be petted.If someone wants to pet your dog, ask them to put their hand out palm first. This allows your dog to sniff the other person and determine how they feel about them.Your dog may only like to be petted in certain areas and in certain ways. Tell strangers where and how to pet your dog.

, Dog bites can be serious, especially since the most common people bitten by dogs are often children. If your dog does bite a stranger, react immediately to remove your dog from the situation.Dogs have a few obvious warning signs when they are about to bite. They may pin their ears back, yawn, or their fur may stand up on their back. If you see any of these warning signs, remove your dog immediately.
If your dog bites, pull your dog out of the area using their leash. Remove them from the area so they do not get excited again., Dogs give off clear physical signs of anxiety or nervousness. If you notice your dog doing any of these things, get them away from strangers, since they are feeling anxious or stressed.Dogs that lick their nose and lips are feeling anxious. Additionally, a ""stress yawn"" is common in dogs that feel nervous.
Panting or pinned ears can be a sign of nerves. While dogs do pant when they are overheated, they may also pant when they don't feel comfortable.

, Before a dog is about to become aggressive, they give off signals that tell you how they feel. Usually, this will come after their signs of anxiety, though the two are also largely interchangeable.If your dog becomes very rigid and stiff, they are feeling threatened. Their tail will also be rigid and not wagging comfortably about.
Any growling or showing of teeth is usually a sign of aggression. Growling that is low is a clear sign your dog feels threatened.

, Dogs also give clear signs when they feel good around strangers. Their body language and behavior will tell you a lot about how your dog is feeling towards others.Dogs show their emotions through their tail and their eyes. If they are wagging their tail loosely and making friendly eye contact, they likely feel good around other people.
An especially happy dog will roll over and allow you to pet its stomach. Belly rubs show that the dog is trusting and willing to be put in a vulnerable position around you.

Let your dog make the first move.,
Have your partner give your dog some treats.,
Enjoy the area together.",How to Introduce Your Dog to Your Partner1," Bring your dog an article of clothing that belongs to your partner. It doesn’t matter too much what the item is - but choose something that they wore and haven’t washed. A sweatshirt is a great option.Let your dog sniff the item, then give them a treat. This exchange will cause your dog to associate positive feelings with the scent.
Say your partner’s name in a positive and lively voice as you offer the treats.
Repeat the process periodically in the days preceding an actual introduction.;
, Choose a specific time and location to introduce your partner and your dog. Somewhere neutral is recommended. A park is probably your best bet. Hold the introduction during the day, ideally somewhere bright and spacious.It’s best to avoid simply coming home one night with your new partner. Your dog will likely be protective of the space you share together.

, Direct your partner to stand on either side of your dog without initiating interaction. Your dog will likely be curious enough to step towards them and sniff them. When they do so, say your partner’s name and give your dog a treat. As you and your partner talk normally and calmly, continue to give your dog treats when they sniff your partner.

, Your dog may quickly grow comfortable with your partner, and they may simply hit it off immediately. If not, some bribery can speed up the process. Provide particularly special treats for your partner to offer your dog once your dog is comfortable approaching them.Special treats might include pieces of cooked chicken breasts, turkey hot dogs, or even steak. Direct your partner to crouch down when offering the treat.
If your dog remains skittish, have your partner place these treats on the ground near your dog and say your dog’s name in a friendly voice.

, Another reason it’s best to meet at a park is that your dog will likely be happy to be there. After the introduction is made, spend some time in the park together, perhaps doing whatever you like to do with you dog, such as playing a game of fetch. Whenever your dog dog gives your partner attention, have your partner offer a treat.After your dog will receive treats from your partner, have you partner crouch down and pet your dog while talking in a calm voice.
Once your dog and partner seem comfortable together, give them some space so that your dog is receiving attention and praise from your partner.

Make sure your neighbors know they cannot hug or kiss your dog.,
Do not allow your dog to jump on your elderly neighbors.,
Recognize signs of stress.,
Reward your dog.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Elderly Neighbors2," It is important that you are there to supervise your dog when it meets your neighbors. Predicting how your dog will act when it is introduced to a new person is difficult. You must be present to ensure a safe and positive interaction. For example, you should not allow your elderly neighbors to enter your yard and greet your dog when you are not present.

, After you have decided on a space to meet, allow your dog to approach your elderly neighbors in a relaxed and friendly manner. This will give your dog a chance to signal that they are okay with the interaction. Make sure your dog is on a leash when they approach your neighbors.Do not force the interaction. It may take a couple of visits before your dog is comfortable enough to approach your neighbors on its own. If you force your dog to approach them, or have them approach the dog, you risk creating a situation that is more stressful for your dog than enjoyable.

, When you introduce your dog to your neighbors, it is important that your neighbors use calm and soft voices. Your neighbors should also limit their body movements to those that are slow and gentle, avoiding any abrupt movements that might startle or frighten your new dog., While many humans think that dogs enjoy being hugged and kissed, these acts of affection can cause fear, discomfort, or even aggression in some dogs. Gently let your elderly neighbors know that your dog does not like to be hugged, kissed or being patted roughly on the head. Instead, suggest gently petting your dog on the chest or back., It is important that you don’t let your new dog jump up on your neighbors when you introduce them. Jumping up on people is a common behavior in dogs, but it is not one you want to encourage. This is especially important when your dog is meeting elderly people, as they often have health problems that could be exacerbated from having a dog jump up on them., Meeting new people can be stressful for some dogs.

Licking of the lips
Tucking of the tail
Yawning
Turning the head away from people

Explain that this applies not just to your dog, but to all dogs, and is meant to protect them from aggressive or antisocial animals.Try saying, “Bobby, I’m really excited you want to pet my dog. Thank you for asking me first! It’s important that you always ask before you pet, because some dogs don’t like to be petted.”

, Children are at a high risk of being bitten in the head, face, and neck by a dog. Therefore, it is important that you educate children to not put themselves at risk by placing their head near the dog’s head. This simple advice can prevent a catastrophic or disfiguring injury to the child.Try saying, “Sally, make sure you don’t put your face near the dog’s face.”

, A child should never go near a dog’s food or bother a dog while the dog is eating or drinking. One of the most common circumstances for dog bites suffered by children is the guarding of resources like food and water. Explain to the child that a dog’s food, water, and feeding times are off-limits.Try saying, “Let’s all remember that we can’t bother the dog when it is eating or drinking. Dogs can get really angry if people go near their food or water. Let’s wait until after the dog finishes eating and then we can take the dog out to play.”

, If you have children, involving them in the dog’s care can be a meaningful experience for the entire family. It will help the children learn responsibility as well as bond with the dog. For example, you can let your kids take the dog on its evening walk and clean up after it.

Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise.",How to Introduce a Dog to a New Family Member2," After the birth, you should get a friend or family member to take a blanket or other item of clothing that has touched your baby back home. Get your dog to smell the blanket so that it gets used to the smell of the baby. When it comes time for introductions, your dog will be well prepared., After you come home with the baby, let your dog get used to the smell first prior to introducing them to the baby. Make it a gradual process. Start by allowing your dog to smell a toy that your baby has touched. Once your dog has sniffed the toy, you could let them smell a room that the baby has occupied. After that, you can gradually work towards introducing your dog to the new family member., Keep the dog on a leash while introducing them to your new family member. Watch attentively. If you feel comfortable, you can let the dog sniff the baby., To get your dog used to the intimate attention you give your baby, you should give them treats when you are feeding the baby. This will make a positive connection with feeding time.Review the list of ingredients when you are shopping for dog treats. If there are ingredients you have never heard of, you probably shouldn’t get the treat. Generally, avoid artificial ingredients and look for natural ingredients. Shop around until you find the treats that your dog likes., During time when you are introducing your dog to the new family member, it is important to make sure they are still getting lots of exercise. If you don’t have time, you should hire a dog walker or ask a friend to take them for a walk.For instance, you could take your dog to the dog park.
You could go to the local swimming hole and throw sticks for your dog.

Maintain a private space for your dog.,
Make the dog feel free when the introductions are made.,
Ask the person to offer the dog a treat.",How to Introduce a Dog to a New Family Member3," Designate an area of the house as your dog’s area, so that they have a place to retreat if things get too intense or loud with the new baby or other person in the house. You could give them the laundry room or another small room as a retreat space. A dog crate could also be used.Dog crates range from $20 to $200.
You could also purchase a new bed for your dog.

, When the new person arrives, you should give your dog a sense of freedom to smell the person, as long as the individual is comfortable with the situation. You should make sure the doors are open and there are plenty of exits, so that your dog does not feel trapped.


For instance, do the introductions in an open area of the house and leave all of the doors open.

Tell your partner to act normally.,
Watch your dog's body language.,
Meet multiple times in neutral locations.,
Be patient.",How to Introduce Your Dog to Your Partner2," Talk to your partner beforehand about meeting your dog for the first time. This is especially important if your partner is nervous around dogs, or your dog is skittish or aggressive around other people. Direct your partner not to maintain eye contact with your dog.
Tell your partner not to face the dog directly, walk quickly toward it, or stand over it. Your dog could interpret these behaviors as aggression.
Ask your partner to avoid automatically reaching toward your dog with outstretched hands.
Additionally, inform your partner that the two of you should maintain friendly small talk throughout the interaction so that your dog knows that your partner isn't a threat.

, If your dog becomes stressed, you will be able to tell by its body language. While a little stress during a new situation is okay, allowing your dog to get very stressed could make the situation worse. Go slowly and give your dog time to warm up to your partner. Cut the visit short if your dog starts to show the signs of stress:

An intense stare, with visible signs of white in the eyes
A tightly closed mouth, with lips pulled back
Stiff, tense body movements
Growling
Showing no reaction to its name, favorite toys, or food, as though it is ""shut down""

, Especially if your dog is still unsure of your partner, it’s best to hold the first few meetings in neutral locations.

Have your partner be more and more involved in games of fetch, and have your partner hold the leash during a walk.Every time your partner approaches you and your dog, say your partner's name in a friendly and excited voice.

, It may take a while for your dog and your partner to fall for one another as much as you have. Don’t worry too much about this. If you have any questions about helping your dog and your partner get along, ask your vet.Definitely notify your vet if your dog seems to experience prolonged stress or behaves aggressively around your partner after the first one or two meetings.

Let them get some alone time together.",How to Introduce Your Dog to Your Partner3," Once your dog and your partner are comfortable around one another, travel from a neutral meeting location back to your home all together. Upon entering the space you share with your dog, give one of your dog’s favorite items to your partner. Then have your partner say the dog’s name and offer them the item., Don’t suddenly disappear on your dog and spend all your time with your new partner. Not only is this unfair to your dog, they will likely notice the change in your behavior and may even realize that it’s your partner keeping you away.To prevent this from happening, go on dates all together! Picnics, hikes, and even bars with patios are great places to spend a multi-species date.

, Once they really seem comfortable together, ask your partner to watch your dog next time you have individual obligations. The opportunity to bond one on one is especially likely to make them both more comfortable around one another."

Use the “go to your place” command.,
Try the “calm down” command.,
Teach your dog to stay off the furniture.,
Send your dog to their crate.",How to Be Intimate with Your Partner when You Have a Protective Dog1," One way to get your dog to be less protective of you when you are with your partner is to use the “go to your place” command. This command can be done when your dog starts to get agitated or protective of you when you are around your partner. Or you can use it right before you and your partner are going to be intimate so you can have some privacy.To do the “go to your place” command, put a blanket or a pillow down in an area that is away from you and your partner. You may already have a “place” that you send your dog to when you have company over or when there is someone at the door.
Command your dog to “go to your place” or “go to place” and hold up a treat. Once your dog goes to the spot, throw the treat on the spot or go over and give them the treat.
Your dog should stay in the spot while you and your partner are out of the room. Reward your dog again if they stay in their spot when you reenter the room with another treat.;
, You can also use the “calm down” command to get your dog to relax and stay calm when you are around your partner. Do this by telling your dog to “calm down” or “relax” while holding a treat in your hand. Once your dog sits and appears calm, you can reward them with a treat.You may also try calming down your dog by ignoring their behavior when they get too protective around your partner. You may then wait until your dog relaxes to address them with a “Good job” and a treat.
It may take time for your dog to go from learning the “calm down” command to calming down on their own when you ignore them. You may want to start with the command first and transition to using no command at all, just body language like no eye contact or not addressing your dog.

, Another way you can encourage your dog to leave you and your partner alone during intimate moments is to teach your dog to stay off furniture like your bed or your couch. Not allowing your dog on the furniture can help to set clear boundaries and let them know that you are in charge. This way, your dog is already aware that the bed or the couch is off limits for them and that they cannot get involved in anything that happens on these spots.You can teach your dog to stay off the furniture by pointing at the ground and saying “down” to your dog until they get off the bed or the couch. Once they sit on the floor, you can reward them with a treat.
You should reinforce this rule in your home by not allowing your dog to go on any furniture, whether there is company over or not. Make sure other members of your household also uphold this rule.

, If your dog becomes protective and riled up when your partner is over or physically close to you at home, you should consider sending the dog out of the room. Tell your dog to go to their crate, if it is inside and nearby. You may put the crate in another room and say, “go to your crate” or “out.” You can also lead the dog to their crate and keep them in there while your partner is over so they are not able to see you or get physically close to you both.Keeping your dog in their crate may be a temporary solution, especially if your partner is over often and you do not want to confine your dog in their crate for a prolonged period of time. You may try other obedience techniques with your dog, such as a “calm down” command or a “go to your place” command once your dog understands the “out” command.

Always supervise interactions between your dog and children.,
Make your dog sit and stay before the introduction.,
Have the child approach your dog with a closed hand.,
Stop any rough play.,
Remove your dog immediately at any sign of aggression.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Children3," It is extremely important that you are always present when your dog is interacting with kids. This is especially crucial when your dog is meeting new children. You can never predict how your dog will react in a given situation, making it absolutely necessary that you supervise all interactions between your dog and children.

, It is important that your dog it sitting and staying when you introduce them to a child. This is a reminder to your dog that they are subordinate to you and are under your command. Do not allow children to approach your dog unless they are in sit and stay., Tell the child to close their hand and slowly approach your dog. Then allow your dog time to sniff the child’s hand. If this goes well, tell the child they can gently pet your dog on their chest or their back. Do not allow the child to pet your dog on the top of its head, as some dogs will find this uncomfortable., Allowing a child to engage in rough play with your dog can encourage aggression. Rough play increases the risk of your dog biting or attacking the child. If your dog and the child appear to be engaging in any type of rough play, such as your dog using their mouth to play, immediately remove your dog from the situation., If your dog begins to bark, acts agitated or scared, or engages in aggressive behavior, then it is your responsibility to immediately remove the dog from the situation. These behaviors are all signs your dog is not yet ready to interact with kids."

Offer a safe haven or crate.,
Understanding your dog's anxiety.,
Expose your dog to a small stressful situation.,
Move on to a more fearful situation.,
Directly expose your dog to his fear.,
Consider using pheromones.,
Put blinders on your dog's eyes.,
Try alternative therapies.,
Avoid using sedatives.",How to Reduce Anxiety in Dogs," It's natural to want to comfort your dog, stroke his head, and speak soothingly to him. You may even be worried if you're both dealing with a stressful event, like an operation at the vet's. Unfortunately, your dog can pick up on your anxiety, making him feel like the situation is out of control, amplifying his anxiety.Don't give your dog treats or respond with hugging or petting. These reward your dog's anxious behavior, which means that he learns to repeat it.;
, Since your dog will be paying close attention to how you respond to stressful situations, signal to him that everything is fine. If you act as if nothing has changed, your dog will have no cause for alarm. If your dog is showing signs of anxiety, like trembling, shaking, or whining, then ignore his behavior.Speak to your dog in a firm but kind voice telling him not to be silly. He'll recognize the disapproval in your tone of voice and understand that you aren't concerned so neither should he be.

, Your dog may be feeling out of control and fearful. Focus his attention on you and distract him by doing a simple training session, even if it's in the vet's waiting room. Do simple training commands like ""Sit"", ""Down"", or ""Stay."" This tells him you are in control, you are not worried, and that everything is normal.


With his attention elsewhere, the hormones that make him feel anxious subside so he'll relax.
Practicing these commands when your dog is anxious can also help you deal with any separation anxiety your dog might have., Create a place that your dog associates with safety and can retreat to. Plan ahead and train your dog to accept a crate as a safe place.At times of exceptional anxiety, cover part of the crate with a blanket to make it even more den-like. Being in a calming environment will stabilize his anxiety levels.


Casually place toys in your dog's crate but continue to act normally and avoid eye contact. This way, you won't be reinforcing any fearful behavior.

, Your dog is anxious because his body produces hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline, in fearful or stressful situations. These prepare his body to fight or flee and create actual physical changes in the heart (making it pump harder), the muscles (supplies them with extra blood), and the lungs (take in more oxygen). These changes mean your dog can become anxious out of habit, so that whenever your dog gets cues that he should be anxious, hormones are released causing the anxiety episode.


For example, if your dog sees you reacting to his fear, then his body releases chemicals and hormones to respond to the anxiety. That is why it's important to watch how you react to your dog's anxiety., Desensitize, or expose your dog to an ultra-low level of the fearful situation. Do this to show him that nothing bad happens. For example, if your dog is afraid of the vet, walk your dog past the vet's office and get him used to sitting by the entrance. Reward good behavior with a treat and lots of attention before continuing on a fun walk. This way, your dog has positive associations with a previously stressful place.You'll need to take this slowly, gradually exposing him from weeks to months and increasing the level of the threat.

, Once your dog becomes comfortable with a low-level situation, move on to a more stressful situation. For example, take your dog into the waiting room of the vet. If he goes in comfortably, reward him with treats. Do this a few times before adding a new step to the routine. You might take your dog in and sit down for a while. Again, reward calm behavior. You can start extending the period of time you spend there to make your dog more comfortable.These small visits will expose your dog to what he fears. Eventually, he'll build positive associations with going into the vet's.

, Some dogs might be more fearful of sounds or surprises. In these cases, have your dog face his fears. For example, if your dog is afraid of fireworks, play a recording of firework noise very quietly and reward your dog for good behavior. Gradually increase the volume over a length of time. If your dog seems distressed, go back a few levels and start again.The same principle can be applied to pretty much anything. If your dog is afraid of other dogs, have a plastic dog set in the distance and reward your dog's calm behavior. Or, if your dog is afraid of riding in the car, start by feeding him in the stationary car. Create positive associations.

, You can buy dog appeasing pheromones (DAP, also known as Adaptil), synthetic versions of the pheromones that mother dogs release when nursing their puppies. The DAP can be diffused or sprayed in your home, car, or outside. DAP are thought to make your dog feel safer, reassured, relaxed, and contented, which can reduce anxiety levels.Keep in mind that your dog will need to be exposed to the pheromones for around 2 weeks before feeling the effects. Because of this, you may want to use a DAP or Adaptil collar so your dog is continually exposed.

, Use face blinder caps (similar to horse blinders) to gently cover his eyes. These can reduce anxiety by decreasing visual stimulation and only allowing your dog to see shapes, but not details. These work best for dogs that are fearful of flashes and bright lights, such as thunderstorms or fireworks. Test the blinder caps out before a stressful situation to make sure your dog accepts them and is comfortable, before adding them into the equation of a stressful situation.If your dog paws frantically at the cap, stands with his head down looking dejected, or shakes then it is best to remove the cap. Blinder caps can actually increase feelings of anxiety for some dogs, because they feel trapped.

, There are several options for non-prescription medications which you can get from the pharmacy or your vet's office. These include:


Bach Flower remedies: Place herbal drops containing the Bach Flowers (chicory, heather, red chestnut, and honeysuckle) on your dog's tongue at times of high anxiety. The remedy is said to have a calming effect but this is not proven, and very much a case of ""try it and see"". Some owners swear by its effectiveness, while others report no change.Skullcap and Valerian: These herbal remedies are said to have a calming effect and the ability to reduce anxiety and excitability.Follow the package instructions for dosing information, but be sure to give it before your dog becomes anxious. Once your dog is already aroused any potential benefit is lost.
Zylkene: Scientific studies believe this food supplement can help animals deal with stress. The active ingredient is a refined protein found in milk that acts on receptors in the brain. Give zylkene before a stressful situation, or in the long term, since there are no negative side effects. This makes it ideal for situations such as going into a boarding kennel where the stress could be prolonged., While sedatives might seem like a good idea if your dog is extremely anxious or sensitive, there are several harmful associations. Keep in mind:Sedatives are often addictive and so your dog may become hooked on the medication.
The effect tends to diminish over time so, you'd need to increase the dose of the potentially addictive medications.
For the short term, sedatives are supposed to make the dog too sleepy to show outward signs of anxiety. But, his heart may still be pounding away and he has the internal physiological signs of anxiety. He just can't show them.
The brain has a reduced ability to learn new behaviors. This means that any progress made through retraining is often painfully slow and forgotten altogether when the medication stops.
Some sedatives cause disorientation and can actually amplify the distress your dog feels when he's anxious.

Ask your visitors to call you instead of knocking on the door or ringing the bell.,
Play with your dog beforehand.,
Get a bag of treats.,
Wait for the right time to introduce the dog.,
Put your dog on a leash before letting guests in.If your dog is on a leash, you can better control its behavior.,
Stay calm.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Visitors1," The sound of an arriving guest might upset the new dog. Therefore, you should ask all potential visitors to call you before they arrive at the house. Alternately, or in addition, you could put an “out-of-order” sign over your doorbell to prevent its use altogether.Your dog might also be afraid of or agitated by a knock at the door. You could place a sign on the door that reads, “Dear visitor, please do not knock. Instead, call me at .”;
, Create a positive association with visitors. If you know your guest is arriving, start playing with your dog for the five to 10 minutes prior to their arrival. This ensures your dog will be in good spirits and – hopefully – a bit more relaxed when your guest arrives. Over time, your dog will come to associate the arrival of a guest with positive feelings like happiness., If your dog is behaving properly during a visit, whether it’s scheduled or unscheduled, feed your dog a steady stream of treats. This will keep the dog relaxed and less likely to engage in unwanted behavior. If your dog has a favorite treat, keep a bagful of those treats handy and accessible in advance of the visitor’s arrival., If your dog seems agitated or moody, hold off on introducing it to visitors until it is in a better mood. For instance, if your dog is barking loudly, whimpering, or pacing about with nervous energy, your best bet is to make introductions some other day.If you can’t control when the visit takes place – for instance, if your visitor drops by unannounced – provide the new dog a steady stream of treats when the visitor is present. Your guest should do likewise.
If you’ve already scheduled the visit and find your dog is agitated, contact the visitor and explain that your new dog is in no mood to receive guests today. Reschedule the introduction between the visitor and the new dog at a different time.

, If it bolts for the door, it won’t get far. And if it attempts to jump on your guests, you’ll be able to quickly pull the dog away and keep it at a distance.Remove the leash if and when your new dog appears calm and collected enough to not jump up on visitors or engage in other unwanted behaviors.

, If you are on edge or have a nervous energy about you, your new dog will sense and reflect it. This could lead to unwanted behavior when your new dog is introduced to your visitors.To stay calm, breathe in through your nose for three seconds and out through your mouth for five seconds.
Visualize a successful introduction. For instance, if you’re plagued by nightmares or thoughts of a disastrous introduction between your new dog and visitors, replace negative imagery with positive imagery. For instance, when you envision your new dog whimpering and unhappy in the presence of visitors, you should “turn the page” mentally and envision instead a happy dog meeting a host of kind visitors.
If your guest is not calm, listen to what they have to say. Let them know that you understand their nervous behavior by asking, “Is there anything I can do to help you relax around my new dog?” Letting them know that you’re there will reassure them and help them calm down.Instruct them in some calming techniques that you’ve used such as envisioning a pleasant introduction to your new dog and practicing breathing control techniques.

If your house in chaotic with a cacophony of noise from a too-loud stereo, screaming children, or indeed arguing adults, the dog will pick up on the vibe and find it difficult to relax. Make the home a peaceful place, without raised voices.


Also, make sure the dog has a place to withdraw from the activity of the home, such as its crate. It needs a safe place to go if it all gets to be too much. Not having a hiding place or den is very stressful for a dog, as its natural instincts are to hide if it feels threatened.;
, For example, breeds such as the Jack Russell or the Border collie that have a heritage as working dogs, need plenty of exercise. If they are crated for many hours at a time, or left home alone all day, then they are likely to be hyper by the time you come home.


Expect to take the dog for long walks to burn off energy, before the dog's mind turns to relaxation. After all, if the dog had nothing to do all day but sleep, rest is the last thing on its mind., Again, a tired mind is one that is ready to relax and a bored mind is more easily distracted. Stimulate your dog's mind by holding regular impromptu training sessions, of about 5 - 10 minutes duration, 2 - 4 times a day. If the dog can concentrate for longer, then great, do that.Also, give the dog puzzle feeders, or put its dry kibble inside a closed cardboard box, so it has to work out ways to get the food and will be stimulated at the same time.

, Feed a good quality food (meat listed first on the label) that is right for your dog's life stage. If your dog is over energetic, check with your vet and consider switching to a lower protein food.


You may want to consider trying a hypoallergenic diet in case the dog's hyperactivity is due to a food intolerance., A dog in pain, such as from arthritis, finds it more difficult to relax and may become snappy. If your dog's character changes, such as it goes from being placid to aggressive, schedule a vet checkup in case there is a medical problem that needs addressing., Your dog may not be able to relax because you are doing things that it dislikes. For example, many dogs dislike having their head petted. This is because the hand comes over the head and eyes, which is a threatening gesture in dog language. If your pet shrinks away or its body stiffens when you go to pet its forehead, then consider that it may not like it.


Instead, form your hand into a fist and hold it just below the dog's nose level. Let it approach and sniff the hand. If the dog wags its tail, raises its head, pricks its ears forward, or moves closer, these are all good signs you have his permission to pet it.

, Your dog may sense if you are in a rush to try and calm it down. Instead, work on calming the dog down when you have time to spend with it. A great time to make your dog relax is when you are watching TV in the evening. You can gently pet the dog while watching a favorite program.Remember that dogs have sensitive hearing, so don't have the volume turned up high.

, Wherever it is, the dog should have open access to this space but should not be forced onto into it. This might be a blanket on the floor or on the sofa beside you.


Decide if you have a 'no pets on the furniture' rule or not. Be aware if you invite the dog up onto the coach it will get the message it's OK to jump up, so only choose that option if you don't mind the dog on the furniture.

, Stroke gently, gliding your hand over its coat, following the direction of the lie of the coat. Do not brush against the lie of the hair or pet roughly, as this is unpleasant and equivalent to having your hair pulled or someone smack your face. Make the movements long and flowing. The dog will appreciate if you use both hands, one following in the trail of the other.


Be aware that some areas are more ticklish than others, and dogs feel vulnerable when certain areas, such as the belly, are touched. Work with the area the dog presents to you. Thus if it lies on its side, stroke its flank, rather than pushing the dog onto its back. The dog may interpret this as a sign of hostility, since you are forcing it into a submissive posture. However, if the dog voluntarily shows you its belly, then stroke it.

, If all is going well, try a gentle massage. Use deeper pressure using the palms of your hands and rock them backwards and forwards over the dog's neck, shoulders, and spine. If the dog shows any sign of discomfort, such as growing tense, looking up repeatedly, flicking its head or a leg away, or getting up, then stop.


Be aware that older animals may have sore joints, especially elbows, so never apply pressure here unless shown how to do so by your vet or vet physiotherapist.
Don't end a relaxation session abruptly. It may frighten or shock the dog. Instead, let the pup doze peacefully in the full knowledge of a job well done.

, This gives off soothing dog pheromones (chemical messengers) that give the dog an olfactory message that it is safe and secure, and that it can relax.

, Another popular relaxation technique if T-Touch or Tellington Touch. This is a massage therapy designed especially for pets. It can be learned at home and involves making repetitive circular movements with the fingertips or palms, over the dog's body. For starters try making small circular movements over the dog' ear flap and cheeks, and as you build confidence and your dog starts to relax, then experiment with other areas such as his shoulders or back."

Provide a secure hiding space.,
Cover or close any windows.,
Use pheromones.,
Watch for potential safety hazards.",How to Help a Dog Scared of Thunder1," You want to offer an area for your dog to escape to when a storm hits. This area should be dark, quiet, and smaller. This will prevent your dog from seeing any lightning or hearing at least some of the thunder. To make your dog associate the space with comfort, you might want to feed them there at least a few times.If your dog always tries to hide under your bed, you might offer it the bedroom closet instead. Just make sure to keep the door open. Some dogs even like to hide in bathtubs during storms.
Do not lock your dog into a confined area during a storm as this will only make them more anxious and nervous. Freedom of movement is an important part of feeling safe.
Some even suggest that you line your dog’s hiding area with foil. This may prevent some of the electromagnetic energy from impacting the space quite as much, thus lessening your dog’s reaction.;
, If your dog likes to move around during storms, then you’ll want to pull the curtains over your windows. This will help to block out the flashes of lightning and the noise of rain. You can also try to close a few doors so that your dog has a large area to roam, but with only a few windows available.It helps to block off any windows prior to the storm hitting. Otherwise, your dog may stand at them barking and refuse to leave until the storm is through.

, You can go to your local pet store, or talk with your vet, about purchasing specific dog pheromone blends designed to calm anxiety and lessen stress. These often come in a variety of application forms, including infused collars, sprays, and diffusers. Look for a pheromone labeled as a D.A.P or “Dog Appeasing Pheromone.”For maximum benefit, try to expose your dog to the pheromones consistently, not just during stormy periods. This will keep your dog’s emotions more level and make them better equipped to deal with stressful situations.
If you are hesitant to use a manufactured pheromone, you can also try placing some lavender oil into a diffuser. This is often relaxing for both pets and their owners., When very scared during a storm, some dogs forget to pay attention to their surroundings and can hurt themselves and damage property too. Look around your home and try to anticipate your dog’s movements. For example, if you think that your dog may try to crawl under a small glass table to hide, then you may want to block off that room or table."
"
Approach the individual.,
Call law enforcement.,
Consult an advocacy group.,
Assist an abandoned dog.",How to Help an Abused Dog1," Some abuse may stem from intent, but some abuse may also come from simply not understanding. If you think someone is keeping a dog in poor conditions, neglecting them, or otherwise harming the dog’s health, talk to them directly about the concerns.Try to be polite. Aggressively confronting another is not the way to get them to hear your point, and it helps to give an individual the benefit of the doubt.
If you see a dog looking lethargic, for example, you might want to say, ""I noticed your dog looking a little tired. Have you gone on any long walks recently? If not, it might help to offer them a bit of nourishing food and make sure they always have access to water.""
Let the individual know what you’ve seen, why you think the dog is hurting, and what the individual can do to better help care for the dog. Offer them contact information for resources such as groomers, animal rights groups, and vets if you have it available.
Offer to help care for the dog if the individual seems unable to fully do so themselves. If they simply seem unwilling, the situation may require professional intervention. Allow professionals to handle the matter, as you taking the dog away could be seen as theft.;
, If you see a dog being actively abused, call emergency services right away and report what you’re seeing and where the abuse is happening. If you know of a dog that’s regularly abused but not in imminent danger, call your local humane society or animal control as soon as possible.Examples of active abuse may include physical abuse, as well as circumstances such as being chained up outside in dangerous or inclement weather, or being left in a hot car.
Try to document as much as you can about the case. Get down dates, times, locations, and details of suspected abuse. If possible, include photos or video footage as evidence for the authorities.

, Talk to your local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) or humane society about a suspected case of abuse. They may have legal resources or counselors that can help you determine what does and does not constitute abuse in your area, and what options you have if law enforcement is not responsive.Try to use advocacy groups as a resource. They often have limited authority unto themselves, but may be able to put you in touch with others that can better assist a particular situation.

, If you spot an abandoned dog, call your local animal control or humane society immediately and let them know where you last saw the dog. While waiting for someone to pick the dog up, you may opt to put out food and water to help keep the dog close and ensure it has some nutrition if it is malnourished.Try to avoid coming in close contact with the dog. Leave food and water out front, but do not touch the dog or bring it into your home. You do not know how it will react to you, so the best protective move is to avoid aggravating it.
If you believe the dog is acting erratic or unsafe, use a barrier such as your bag or jacket in between you and the dog. Allow the dog to distract itself with the barrier while you escape elsewhere.

Start by hugging and touching in front of your dog.,
Distract your dog with a toy.,
Move on to more intimate actions with your partner over time.",How to Be Intimate with Your Partner when You Have a Protective Dog2," Another tactic is to try to get your dog used to your partner being around and close to you. To do this, start with some basic physical touching in front of your dog, such as hugging and holding hands. As you do this, give your dog a treat. Continue hugging and holding hands, moving closer together, while you give your dog another treat.Giving your dog treats while you are physical with your partner will show them that this interaction is a good thing and not a cause for concern. It will also let your dog know that you approve of the touching and are not in any danger.

, If your dog becomes anxious or upset when you are touching your partner, have their favorite toy close by. Have a short play session with your dog using the toy and involve your partner. This will let your dog know that your partner is friendly and fun to be around, rather than a threat.You should both play with your dog for a few minutes, throwing the toy around. Then, throw the toy in a separate room and give your dog a treat. Your dog may be tired out and willing to leave you two alone after the play session is over.

, Once your dog seems comfortable with you hugging your partner and holding hands, you should try kissing in front of your dog. Kiss your partner and then throw your dog a treat if they stay calm and quiet. You can also give your dog a Kong toy stuffed with treats so they are occupied with the Kong while you and your partner kiss or get intimate.Over time, your dog may be so involved in their treat that they do not pay attention to what you and your partner are doing. You may also both be able to go into a separate room together, leaving your dog to enjoy their treat alone.

Discuss the issue with your vet.,
Get a referral for a professional dog trainer.,
Check in with your vet periodically about the issue.",How to Be Intimate with Your Partner when You Have a Protective Dog3," If you have tried obedience training and other techniques to no avail, you may want to bring up the issue with your vet. Tell your vet that your dog acts protective when you and your partner become intimate. You may describe your dog’s exact behavior and demeanor to your vet. Giving your vet as much information as possible can help them give you guidance on how to train your dog to avoid the issue.


For example, you may tell your vet, “My dog gets protective if my partner and I hold hands” or “My dog barks at my partner and I when we kiss in front of him. What can I do to address this?”

, Your vet may suggest that you see a professional dog trainer for hands on advice to address the issue. Your dog may respond better to a professional trainer who is confident around dogs and aware of how to deal with the problem.The trainer can then teach you different commands or techniques you can try to get your dog more comfortable with your partner. They may also suggest ways where you can get your dog out of the room so you and your partner can be intimate with no disruptions or distractions.

, If your dog continues to be protective when you are with your partner, you should check back in with your vet about the issue. Keep the lines of communication between you and your vet open so you can work on dealing with the issue together.


You may also try several different tactics and report back to your vet about what worked and what did not work. Over time, you may find a solution that helps your dog feel at ease around your partner when you are intimate with them.

Help your visitors adopt nonthreatening body language.,
Get the dog to sit.,
Introduce one dog at a time.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Visitors2," Dogs feel least threatened by people whose body is oriented away from them. Encourage your visitors to turn in profile, keeping only their head aimed in the dog’s direction, and avoiding direct eye contact until the dog feels more comfortable around the guest.Your visitor should sit or squat at the dog’s level when greeting it for the first time.
Instead of looking directly into the dog’s eyes, your guest should examine some piece of art on the wall or talk directly to you instead of addressing or interacting with the dog.
Encourage your guest to use their indoor voice when around your dog and discourage yelling and boisterous behavior, including raising their arms or standing up suddenly.
Discourage your guest from petting your new dog.

, Your dog should sit or stay when visitors arrive. As soon as the visitors come in, say “Sit” or “Stay” to your leashed dog. Only then should you actually proceed with the process of introducing the new dog to the visitor.If your new dog does not know how to “sit,” teach it how by taking it to an obedience school or “puppy kindergarten.” Alternately, you could teach it yourself.

, If you have two or more dogs, you should introduce them to guests one at a time, rather than in a pack. When multiple dogs – new or old – are in one location doing something exciting like meeting a visitor, they could get overly excited. This abundance of energy and excitement could lead to conflict among the dogs."
"
Show your dog the visitors are friendly.,
Reward calm behavior in your new dog.,
Do not reward antisocial behavior.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Visitors3," Tie your dog up somewhere in the house. Encourage your guests to offer your new dog a treat. This will keep it happy and reduce its feelings of anxiety or stress related to the guest.Reassure your dog when it meets visitors. When guests come over, provide your dog with a steady stream of positive, comforting verbal feedback. For instance, you should say, “It’s okay, that’s my friend. My friends are your friends, too.”Adopt a kind and gentle tone when introducing your new dog to visitors.

, If your new dog stays relaxed and at ease in the presence of visitors, you should show your approval with both verbal praise and a more substantial reward. For instance, offer your new dog a bit of its favorite treat. You could also toss a favorite toy or ball across the room to provide your new dog with an opportunity for play. Fill a KONG toy with kibble bits or other snacks your dog likes and toss it to your dog when it’s being good during the introduction.Toss a chew toy your dog’s way to reward it.
Pat your new dog on the head when it is behaving appropriately during the introduction.
If your new dog likes being rubbed on the belly, rub its belly as a reward.

, If your dog demonstrates hostility, anxiety, or shyness, you should not reward that behavior. Doing so will only reinforce that reaction, and you will see your new dog repeat these behaviors in order to earn a treat. Instead, say, “No. That is bad,” in a stern voice.For instance, you might tie your new dog’s leash around a table leg. Instruct your guest to say, “Sit” to your trained dog. When your new dog sits, your guest can give it a treat.
If your new dog is not yet trained, take it to a “puppy kindergarten” or obedience school. You can locate such an institution by asking your vet for recommendations, or looking one up in your yellow pages.

Behave normally.,
Offer positive reinforcement, hugs, and treats.,
Put a ThunderShirt on your dog.,
Play a game of fetch.,
Practice some obedience commands.,
Try a calming massage.",How to Help a Dog Scared of Thunder2," If you act anxious, then your dog will respond in kind. Instead, try to go about your normal business as if a storm is not taking place. Keep your voice level and steady; do not whisper or shout. Try not to maintain too much eye contact with the dog, as that can be interpreted as another sign of stress., Do not pressure your dog into cuddling or hugs, if this isn’t your normal way of interacting. However, if your dog approaches, then it is a good idea to offer them general comfort in the way of a few gentle pats. You can also toss a few of their favorite treats into their hiding area., The use of this canine garment has been the cause of some debate as to its effectiveness. A ThunderShirt is a heavier, jacket-like garment that you place on your dog. The idea is that the force of the garment exerts enough pressure to calm your dog and make it feel secure. If you think your dog would do well with this option, you can buy one online and test it out.Just be careful placing the garment on your dog, especially if they are panicked. They could end up scratching or biting you by accident. Try to place the shirt on your dog before the storm hits.

, Distraction is one way to help your dog cope with their thunder fears. Before your dog starts to act openly fearful, initiate a game of fetch or some other fun activity. Keep the tennis ball out and the game going until the storm passes by. It is possible that your dog will not even notice the storm in the midst of having fun., If you find that your dog enjoys training and working on commands, you might run through a training set during the storm. This will place your dog’s concentration on something productive. However, be extra patient when working through commands as the storm may lessen your dog’s responsiveness.

, If your dog is willing to sit or lay down beside you, it is possible for you go give them a light massage. Start by applying pressure to the pads of your dog’s feet. Then, move upwards rubbing lightly on each area. Your dog may be distracted by your touch and may temporarily forget to be afraid."
"
Begin working on it early.,
Desensitize your dog to the noise.,
Talk with your veterinarian.,
Consider medication.,
Be patient.",How to Help a Dog Scared of Thunder3," Start trying to address these behavioral challenges as soon as you notice them. It is possible to even work with a puppy to overcome their fears. In many cases, it is enough to create a positive association with storms, using treats and so on, early on in a dog’s life. Also, watch the progression of your dog’s fears to help prevent a minor fear from becoming a major phobia.The best way to trace the degree of fear is watch your dog’s body language. Do their eyes look increasingly agitated? Are their movements more and more jerky and uncontrolled?

, This method involves providing controlled exposure to the sounds and noises associated with storms. Get a CD with the sounds of thunderstorms on it, including the loud cracks of thunder. Play it around the house for just a few minutes and then gradually build up to longer intervals. The hope is that your dog will eventually see these noises as normal and pay little attention to them.You can also make a point to play this tape while you are feeding your dog, so that it associates storms with something positive., As soon as you notice that your dog is suffering, go ahead and make an appointment to meet with your vet. They will be able to examine your dog and rule out any physical causes for these anxieties. They can also suggest additional behavior modification strategies that may work well for your particular breed of dog. You can also discuss the option of medicating your dog.Your vet may also give you a referral to see a vet behaviorist.

, If your dog’s fear gets to the point which they are a threat to themselves or others, you may need to look into medication as an option. Some vets offer acepromazine to owners, but it is simply a tranquilizer without an anti-anxiety component. It is better to go with a canine noise aversion drug, such as Sileo.Melatonin is a gentler option when compared with prescribed medications. You can get it over-the-counter and it is a hormone. It works by calming your dog down and reducing the effect of outside stimuli, such as thunder. Consult with your vet regarding the specific dosage requirements for your dog., Curbing your dog’s fearful reactions and behaviors may take a good amount of time. If you get frustrated, just remember that their fear is really out of your dog’s control. Focus on what you love about your pet and keep moving forward to try to get them help."
"
Volunteer at a shelter.,
Donate supplies or money.,
Foster a dog.",How to Help an Abused Dog2," Many animal rescues depend on volunteers, and one of the best ways you can help a rescue pet who experienced abuse is to help the shelter overall. If you have experience working with abused animals, let the shelter know.You may not work directly with abused animals if you do not have experience in that area, but volunteering your time helps give trained shelter staff more time to work with these abused animals.
Go online and fill out a volunteer application for your local shelter or call them and ask to see if they have any volunteer openings.

, If you cannot volunteer with a shelter or rescue agency, consider donating money or necessary supplies. Shelters are often underserved and underfunded. A direct monetary donation can help them get the things they need to operate correctly, while a donation of toys, food, leashes, dishes, or other goods can directly benefit the pets they service.Contact your local rescue and ask them, “What are the procedures for donating to your shelter? Do you accept donations of supplies, or just monetary donations?”
Be sure to follow the rescue’s donation policy. They may not be able to accept items that are gently used, or they may not be able to accept supplies donations at all. Ask them specifically what they need and what they are allow to take.

, When rescues cannot house an animal, either due to capacity or to due to the abilities of the dog, they turn to foster homes where the animal lives until it has recovered and can be adopted. Volunteer to foster an dog by calling your local rescue and letting them know you are open to working with abused animals in your home.Fostering an abused animal may require some commitment beyond a normal foster situation. You may be responsible for getting the animal to and from the vet, physical therapy, and training.
Abused animals may live in their foster homes for several months before being ready for adoption. They will require extra time and patience from their foster home.

Be patient.,
Create a safe space.,
Create success.,
Provide daily care for your dog.",How to Help an Abused Dog3," A new dog owner may not understand or be able to predict all of the reactions from an abused dog early on. Be patient if the dog is hesitant, reluctant, afraid, or even aggressive. Most often, these are self-defense responses that will slow or fade after the dog has become more comfortable.Do not try to give your new pet too much affection or force physical contact with them. Let them come to you.
If the dog is exhibiting aggressive behaviors such as biting, try to discourage them without yelling by using stern verbal tones and eye contact.
If the aggressive behavior continues, you may want to seek the assistance of a professional trainer.

, You may choose to designate a corner in your home as a safe space for your new dog, or you may opt for a crate. Either way, create a space with access to a bed, water, and comforting items such as toys or a blanket that your new dog knows is just for them.This area should serve as a place for your dog to go to rest and recharge. Try not to disturb them too much when they are in their space.
If your dog is spending too much time in their space and never interacting at all, you may try to coax them out with treats, or by moving the food dish a bit farther out.

, Help rebuild your dog’s confidence by introducing them to new situations where they can only succeed. If new people scare your dog, for example, have a pet-loving friend come over with treats and plenty of gentle affection for your pup.The situations don’t have to be too elaborate, nor do they have to address all your dog’s fears at once. Rather, building success gradually teaches an abused dog to have confidence where there was once fear.
Reinforce positive responses to these situations with plenty of love and praise. Let your dog know when they do the right thing and they will continue to do so.

, It’s important to care for an abused dog’s specific needs, but it’s equally important to make sure their overall needs are met. Building a daily routine helps calm your abused dog because they know what to expect, and it also allows you and your new animal to bond.Try to make sure your dog is regularly fed and given clean water, walked, and played with. Keep times as consistent as possible,
Try to schedule some quiet time for you and your dog. Allow them to be in the same room or encourage them to be near you, but do not look to provide the dog with too much active attention. This allows your dog to become comfortable simply being near you.

Consider medication.",How to Stop Your Dog from Misbehaving Dangerously," If your dog is behaving dangerously, you'll need to use proper restraining equipment. These devices can be used on walks as well as around the house - just don't leave your dog unsupervised while wearing a leash, harness, or muzzle, as this may lead to injury.Using a head halter may be more effective than a regular collar. The head halter restricts your dog's ability to move and lunge while on the leash.
If your dog has ever bitten someone, you should have your dog wear a basket muzzle when it's around other people or animals.
Whether you use a muzzle or a head halter, make sure it is properly fitted to your dog's face. This will help prevent injuries to your dog and reduce the chances of your dog slipping free.;
, Any time you're out walking your dog, you may run into someone or something that elicits a dangerous or aggressive response. You can help reduce the risk of incidence by shortening your dog's leash when you approach other people or animals.A leash should be worn at all times when your dog is outside your home.
If you see anything that you know may upset your dog, like a runner, bicyclist, skater, or another dog, pull your dog in close and hold the leash as short as possible.

, In addition to holding a short leash, holding your dog's attention is one of the best ways you can help reduce the risk of incidence on walks. It may take some training, but eventually your dog will focus on you - and on the treat in your hand.Use a verbal cue, such as ""watch me,"" ""leave it,"" or ""sit and stay.""
Use your cue consistently with your dog so it knows what you expect.
If you use a clicker for training purposes, you can utilize that tool while trying to hold your dog's attention.
Bring plenty of treats on your walks. Any time your dog gets upset, offer treats as a reward for good behavior when your dog responds to your commands.

, The best way to train your dog out of territorial aggression is by limiting its opportunities in the first place. Your dog may display territorial aggression to people or vehicles approaching your home because it sees these people and things as a threat. By removing your dog's opportunity to bark or growl, you can help break your dog of this potentially dangerous habit.Block your dog's access to windows or keep them covered with curtains or blinds.
Don't let your dog near the door when someone (like the mail carrier) approaches. Try to drown out the sound of an approaching person with music or by distract your dog with treats and toys.
If you go outside in your yard, keep your dog on a leash and stay with your pet to supervise it.

, Getting adequate exercise each day can help reduce aggression and other behavioral problems in many dogs. Though this may not completely fix your pet's problems, for many dogs it noticeably reduces incidences of aggression and misbehavior.Aim to get 45 to 60 minutes of brisk exercise twice each day. Your dog should be panting by the end of each exercise session.
You can give your dog exercise by playing catch, throwing a frisbee, going jogging or running, going hiking, or taking your dog swimming.
Don't start out with long, strenuous workout sessions if your dog isn't used to it. Start slowly and build to the twice-daily 45 to 60 minutes gradually over several weeks.

, Professional training is the best way to break bad or dangerous behavior problems. There are many training options available for dog owners. Ask your vet or search online to find out about training opportunities near you.You can hire a trainer to work one-on-one with your dog, or you can enroll in a group class. A trainer can give individualized attention, while a group class improves your dog's social abilities.
Choose a trainer or class that employs positive reinforcement-based training methods. These will help your dog develop consistently better behavior.
If your dog continues to have aggression problems, hire a canine behavioral specialist. This type of trainer will work with your dog to curb this undesirable behavior.

, Two of the most useful commands for a dog to learn are ""sit"" and ""stay."" These commands, when used properly, can prevent displays of aggression and stop bad behavior in its tracks.Have your dog sit. If your dog hasn't learned the sit command yet, you can help teach it by gently pushing your dog's rear end to the floor while calmly but firmly saying ""sit.""
Once your dog sits on command, give it treats and verbal praise.
Give the command ""stay"" while slowly taking a few steps back from your dog. You may have to repeat the command with each step, or once may be enough, depending on your dog.
If your dog moves before you release it, go back to where you were and start over. If your dog obeys, break the hold by saying ""good dog"" or ""okay, come"" and offer treats and verbal praise.

, ""Leave it"" is just as valuable as ""sit"" and ""stay"" when breaking bad behavior. By teaching ""leave it,"" you can prevent your dog from approaching other animals or from going after another dog's food or toys, which may otherwise lead to conflict.Hold some treats in your closed fist and show your hand to your dog, keeping the treats hidden in your palm. Allow your dog to sniff and lick your hand, but don't give access to the treats.
As soon as your dog discontinues its efforts to get the treats in your hand, say ""good dog"" and offer a treat from a separate location (say, a bag in your pocket or on the counter). Never give the treats in your hand that were off limits.
Once your dog starts to resist the urge to sniff and lick your treat hand, start using the verbal command ""leave it"" before you show your closed hand to the dog.
Gradually increase the difficulty after a week or two by showing your dog your opened hand full of treats and using the ""leave it"" command. Quickly close your hand if your dog lunges for the treats and start over.
Once your dog masters the ""leave it"" command with a closed hand, begin leaving the treats on the floor and using ""leave it,"" then offer treats from your pocket or the counter. Again, never give the restricted treats, as this can ruin your training.

, Once you've determined what your dog reacts dangerously towards (like bicyclists, for example), you can begin to desensitize your dog to that stimulus. Start out slowly and work from a safe distance away, then gradually get closer every training session. Eventually, your dog should realize that the person or thing it's frightened of or aggressive towards is not a threat.Give your dog a series of treats in rapid succession while you approach the frightening stimulus or any time it is in plain view. The treats should be given continuously to hold your dog's attention and its good mood.
Stop giving treats immediately after you've moved away from the person or object your dog is aggressive towards.
Keep your dog on a leash during this type of training to prevent any risk of injury to the other person or people your dog is showing aggression and fear towards.

, Possessive aggression is when a dog displays aggressive behavior towards people or animals that get close to something the dog wants. This most commonly happens with food and treats, but it can happen with other items like a dog bed or even a piece of furniture.Limit your dog's access to items it might get possessive of. You can do this by blocking off certain areas of your home or by hiding these objects out of reach.
If your dog is possessive and aggressive over toys or treats, remove your dog's access to those items. Only give access when your dog is in its crate (if you use one) or a confinement room alone with you.
Keep your dog on a leash during training. Work on offering food rewards as you take possession of the item(s) your dog gets protective of, speak in a calm but confident voice, and pet your dog while you take the desirable item(s).
Restrict all access to highly-desirable items like rawhide bones and pig's ears, at least during your initial training. These items are more likely to provoke an aggressive response.

, If your dog has displayed behavioral problems that could be dangerous, it's important that you talk to your veterinarian. Your vet may run tests to see if your dog is otherwise healthy. Your vet can also recommend behavioral and medical options that might help improve your dog's behavior.


Contact your vet once you've witnessed your dog misbehave dangerously more than once. The first time could be an anomaly, but a second incident is likely the start of a pattern.
Describe your dog's behavior in meticulous detail. Try to remember the exact situation and circumstances in which each incident occurred.
Ask your vet questions about your dog's behavior. Your vet may have recommendations, so letting the vet know that you're open to suggestions can help expedite your dog's treatment.

, Spaying and neutering dogs has been shown to reduce aggressive behavior, including on-leash lunging, mouthing/nipping, and biting. Neutering a male dog will also prevent it from trying to escape your home to seek out a mate, which is a major cause of dog injuries due to collisions with vehicles and other dogs.Ask your vet if spaying or neutering your dog may help curb your pet's behavioral problems.

, Sometimes the reason a dog misbehaves dangerously is because the dog is in pain or is fearful of a medical condition it has. Your vet is the only person who can definitively determine if this is the case, usually through blood work, a chemistry panel, or a thyroid test during your dog's examination.Some common medical problems that can lead to aggressive behavior include, but are not limited to:


epilepsy
hypothyroidism
arthritis
hip dysplasia
dental disease

, Medication for behavioral problems should always be viewed as a last resort when training alone hasn't worked. However, medication by itself will not be as effective. In order to correct your dog's behavioral problems, you'll need to continue working on behavioral training, even as you administer medication from your vet.Some commonly used prescription medications for canine behavioral problems include:


clomipramine (Clomicalm)
amitriptyline (Elavil)
fluoxetine (Prozac)

Do not punish a dog for anxious behaviors.",How to Know if Your Older Dog Suffers from Separation Anxiety," If a dog is beginning to develop separation anxiety, it's not uncommon for it to begin displaying anxious behaviors before you even leave the home. Before you leave, watch your dog and see if it appears agitated.Your dog may begin pacing, panting, drooling, trembling, and whining as soon as it sees you're trying to leave.
Your dog may also look very sad. Your dog may appear lethargic or depressed prior to your leaving.;
, One of the most frustrating issues regarding separation anxiety is that dogs often react by whining or howling when left alone. Listen when you leave the house. After you, say, step out of your apartment, stand in the hallway. If you hear barking, whining, or howling, your dog may have separation anxiety., If your dog is nervous or depressed in your absence, it may stop eating. Pay attention to how full the food bowl is before and after you're gone. If it rarely looks like your dog eats in your absence, this may be a case of separation anxiety.If you feed your dog on a schedule, try giving your dog its regular meal before you leave. If you get back and your dog has not eaten, this may be separation anxiety.

, Dogs with separation anxiety issues often dislike being left home alone so much they try to escape. You may see marks by your doors and windows, indicating your dog has tried to paw or chew through these areas. If your dog has gotten loose while your gone before, this is also an indication of separation anxiety., If you're noticing symptoms of separation anxiety, think about whether your dog has any special risk factors making it more prone to the disease. Separation anxiety can sometimes happen with age, or get worse with age. However, any recent changes in your home could potentially be a cause of separation anxiety.If a household member recently moved away, this can cause separation anxiety.
If you moved to a new home recently, this can also cause separation anxiety.
A major change in your schedule can also cause separation anxiety. Your dog may get increasingly agitated if you, say, recently took on a more demanding job and are gone from the home more often.

, It's not uncommon for separation anxiety to lead to other behavioral issues. One of these is house soiling. If your dog is urinating or defecating inside the home, this can indicate separation anxiety.Usually, urinating or defecating while you're home is not a cause for separation anxiety. Dogs suffering from separation anxiety will only urinate or defecate when you're gone.
House soiling can be a sign of a medical issue. This should be addressed by a vet. Do not assume it's due to separation anxiety without confirmation from a vet.

, If a dog is developing anxiety, it may become more vocal in general. In addition to barking when you leave, a dog with separation anxiety may bark or howl more often throughout the day. If your dog is anxious, it may bark or howl at very small noises and triggers even while you're home.This can also be a sign of an underlying medical issue and should be addressed by a vet.

, With separation anxiety, it's not uncommon to come home to find your dog has been behaving in a destructive fashion. Dogs with separation anxiety may dig, chew, or destroy household objects.If you frequently come home and find your dog has chewed something up or gotten into the garbage, this may be separation anxiety.
Destructive behaviors caused by separation anxiety often border on self-harm. A dog with separation anxiety may have broken teeth or scrapes on their paws and nails.
Destructive behaviors that are due to separation anxiety rarely occur in the guardians presence. You're unlikely to ever see your dog being destructive in your presence if your dog has separation anxiety.

, Dogs also act out when their bored. If your dog is bored, you may mistake this for separation anxiety. However, there are several ways to differentiate between negative behaviors caused by boredom and those that are caused by anxiety.Dogs who are bored tend to bark in a monotone. Their barks are usually in response to something outside, such as another dog or a car, rather than their owner leaving.
Destructive behavior in a bored dog usually has an obvious cause. A bored dog will get into the garbage to get food. If you, say, recently threw out leftover chicken, a bored dog will get into the garbage to get this. Bored dogs will also chew items that give off a fragrant smell, such as leather.
Anxious dogs engage in destructive behavior without an obvious trigger. They will chew any item that's left out, regardless of how it smells, and get into the garbage even if there's nothing of interest in it.

, Any change in behavior can indicate a medical condition. If a dog is acting strange, it may not be feeling well physically. Therefore, you should see a vet to rule out an underlying medical condition. If an underlying medical condition is not detected, your vet can help you find a treatment plan for separation anxiety.Your vet will give your dog a medical exam and may also order certain tests, depending on your dog's current health and medical history.
Let your vet know about all the symptoms your dog is displaying. This can help the vet make as informed a diagnosis as possible.

, Counterconditioning is a process by which you work on changing your dog's reactions to a variety of situations. It requires a lot of time and patience, but it can be a successful means to treat separation anxiety in dogs.For counter conditioning, you work on replacing a fearful situation with one a dog loves. For example, if your dog starts howling each time you put on your shoes to leave, give your dog a treat when you put on your shoes. This can help your dog feel more positive and relaxed about your leaving.
It can also help to give your dog something to do while you're gone. Like any animal, dogs crave stimulation. Many owners find it's helpful to leave their dog with a puzzle toy that contains food. Instead of getting anxious about their owner leaving, dogs see this as exciting as they're given a toy and a treat.

, In severe cases, a dog may benefit from being medicated for separation anxiety. Talk to your vet about medication if you believe it would help your dog. Usually, medication is recommended when other treatment options aren't working.Usually, a dog is given anti-anxiety medication. The medication your vet selects depends on your dog's history and current health. As older dogs are often on existing meds, your vet will want to find a medication that does not interact poorly with your dog's medication regimen.
Medication is rarely used as the only means to treat a dog's separation anxiety. Usually, it's used alongside behavior modification.

, If your dog's separation anxiety is severe, sometimes you need to have someone watch your dog. Older dogs may be very resistant to change. If possible, try to leave your dog with another household member or look into doggy daycare., Never punish a dog who's suffering from separation anxiety. Berating an already anxious dog for, say, urinating in the house will only increase its anxiety. Remind yourself your dog is acting out due to anxiety and the behavior is not deliberate. Punishing an anxious dog will not stop the behavior."

Let the new dog determine the level of proximity.,
Place the new dog behind a barrier.,
Identify your new dog’s triggers.,
Be patient with your new dog.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Visitors4," Your new dog should make the first move toward the visitor. If the visitor makes a move toward the new dog, it might get scared or territorial. With your new dog on a leash, wait for it to extend the leash to its maximum length. When it’s pulling gently at the leash and sniffing or woofing inquisitively at the visitor, allow the new dog to wander a bit closer. Provide verbal reassurance to your dog all the while.If it wishes to wander all the way up to the visitor, allow it to do so. Otherwise, allow it to wander off and don’t force it to stay in close proximity to the visitor.

, Putting your dog in a crate or behind a baby gate is a good way to introduce the dog to visitors. This keeps the dog feeling safe and secure while at the same time preventing the dog from jumping up or on your visitor. This gives both the dog and the visitor time to observe the other from a safe distance.If your new dog is too disruptive even behind a low barrier or inside a crate, move it to another room while your visitor is visiting.You might try to introduce your new dog to your visitor again after 10 minutes or so.

, It might be hard to know what your new dog’s triggers are because it is new. However, if foster owners or previous caretakers observed any trigger behaviors in your new dog, they might have passed such knowledge on to you. If the prior caretaker did not pass anything on to you, or if the new dog had no prior caretaker, make careful observations about your dog’s reactions to particular people and stimuli.For instance, your new dog might become fearful or aggressive when in the presence of perfume, people wearing wide-brimmed hats, or other “intimidating” modes of dress.
Avoid introducing your new dog to visitors who possess or demonstrate qualities that trigger negative behavior in your dog. Alternately, embark on a desensitization program to prevent your new dog from reacting poorly to its triggers.

, Like people, some new dogs have fears or anxieties that they grow out of over time. The best thing you can do is to introduce your new dog to a variety of different people over a long period and give it lots of positive encouragement and stimulation during the introductions. This will help your new dog develop a store of experiences on which it can draw so that being introduced is not a novel or unusual thing, but rather, a normal part of a healthy social life."
"
Recognize signs of distress.,
Be patient and kind.,
Build a safe space.,
Create good endings to bad experiences.,
Train your dog.",How to Help an Emotionally Disturbed Dog1," A dog may show distress by barking or biting at the air, but other signs of distress may be less obvious. Other signs of discomfort may include yawning, licking their nose, crouching, walking backwards, or making the body as small as possible.If you notice signs of discomfort with your dog, try to identify the source of the discomfort. This will help you better understand your dog's reaction and help better prepare yourself and your pet in the future.
Do not try to force physical attention on your dog if they give indicators that they do not want it, such as backing away. Forcing attention could startle them more and cause an unintentional aggressive reaction.;
, Above everything else, a dog that is working through its own emotional issues will need your patience and your kindness. They may not socialize much early on, and you may discover unexpected objects, noises, or other cues that trigger an extreme emotional response from the dog. Regardless, stay calm and provide support.If a dog engages in reprimandable behavior after an extreme event, scold them using a stern voice, but avoid yelling, clenching your fist, or raising your hand. Be firm with the dog, but not seek to threaten.
Understand that it may take the dog time to open up to people, yourself included. Do not force attention on the dog, and be patient while the dog becomes acquainted with its surroundings and the individuals in its life.

, While your dog is adjusting or dealing with their emotional problems, it can be beneficial for them to have a space all their own to which they can retreat if they feel stressed or anxious. Provide them with a crate, a corner of the house, or a room that is designated as their space.If you are bringing home a dog from a situation where it spent most of its life in a crate, such as a puppy mill, it may be best to skip the crate and instead offer a corner in a more open room.
Equip the dog’s safe space with bedding, access to fresh water and food, and comfort items such as toys, chews, pillows, and/or blankets.
Try not to enter the dog’s safe space unless absolutely necessary. Allow this to be a place where they can relax and feel comfortable.

, A traumatized dog may learn to trust a bit more when experiences that cause panic end on a good note. Try to create a positive outcome for experiences to which your dog is acting negatively to help them build trust in you and the situation.For example, if your dog is afraid of having their teeth brushed, try to end each brushing session with gentle petting along the jawline and praise for your dog’s positive behavior. This can help them grow increasingly more comfortable with future brushing sessions.
When possible, try to give your dog the option to leave if they become too uncomfortable with any situation. Forcing the dog to stay may only make their anxieties worse.

, Training is a great way to teach a traumatized dog new skills and allow them to find new ways to interact with their environment. If your dog is not already trained, consider starting with a basic class taught by a professional trainer. Check with local trainers and pet stores to see when new classes start.Some trainers offer courses especially for rescue dogs or formerly abused dogs. Call or go online to see if any local trainers specialize in working with dogs similar to yours.
If your dog has already mastered basic training, you may want to consider signing up for a continuing or advanced class, or start with agility training to help build your dog’s strength and confidence.
Puzzle toys, available at most pet stores, can also be a great way to engage your dog’s mind and offer them rewards for interacting with their environment.

Minimize exposure to triggers.,
Bring them around other dogs.,
Introduce positive people.",How to Help an Emotionally Disturbed Dog2," Your dog will trust you and the world a lot more when it is not confronted daily with things that remind it of past trauma. Some incidents are unpredictable, but do what you can to minimize exposure to trauma-inducing triggers.If stress-based triggers can be avoided, try to remove them from the dog’s vicinity. If, for example, you have a puppy mill rescue who cannot stand the sight of a crate, remove dog crates from the area where the rescued dog normally spends its time.
If you cannot remove certain stress-based triggers, such as the noise caused by fireworks during holiday celebrations, talk to your vet about treatment options.

, Socializing an emotionally fragile dog allows them to work out their fears and frustrations with their peers. Take your dog to the dog park, set up one-on-one play dates, or have them walk alongside another dog during their daily walks.If group situations make your dog nervous, it might be best to start your dog off by walking them with another dog or setting up a one-on-one play date.
If your dog displays any aggressive behavior toward other pets or people, it may be necessary to work with a trainer or behavioral specialist before you continue socializing.

, Being introduced to new people can often be a struggle for dogs coming from emotionally abusive situations. Help counteract this by introducing positive people who can offer affection and praise to your dog.Stage meetings with friends or family. Instruct them as to the best ways to approach your dog, and provide them with treats and toys they can use to help win your dog’s affection.
Try to make a point of introducing your dog to people it will see regularly first. Having your dog bond with someone who will not be around long could cause greater stress for your pet.

"
"
Talk to your vet.,
Work with a trainer.,
See a behaviorist.",How to Help an Emotionally Disturbed Dog3," Your dog’s vet will often be the first point of contact in dealing with emotionally stressful situations. Let your vet know what your dog is experiencing and how they are reacting to the situation. The vet should be able to help you figure out a proper response to the situation.Let your vet know right away if your dog is quickly losing weight, has had a rapid decrease in energy, or if it refuses to eat or drink, as these may be signs of severe depression.
Your vet is also the person who can prescribe medication for depression and anxiety in your dog.
Let your vet know if you know an unavoidable stressful situation is coming up, such as a loud holiday or a long car trip, and they may be able to give you a mild sedative to help your dog manage their stress.

, A professional trainer can help you and your dog learn how to better communicate and interact with one another. Check online or ask your vet for recommendations for local trainers that have experience working with emotionally traumatized dogs.Set up an initial appointment with the trainer to introduce yourself and your pet, as well as to set goals. Let them know what you want out of training, and what specific problems you may foresee with your dog.
Behavioral adjustment training can be especially effective for dogs that display aggressive or inappropriate behavior. Check with your vet to find a specialist in your area.

, An applied animal behaviorist has an advanced degree in dealing with animal behavior, and can help in creating long-lasting personal changes for emotionally struggling pets. They will work with you and your pet to only train them, but help make modifications that can allow your dog to live a happy, less worried life.Contact your vet for recommendations on behaviorists in your area, or look for a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist through the CAAB website."

Change the texture of the stairs.,
Place the feeding location near the stairs.,
Put a blanket over see-through stairs.,
Start at the bottom.,
Break it up into smaller tasks.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Start slow.,
Avoid forcing your dog.,
Begin conditioning your puppy early.",How to Help a Dog Overcome Its Fear of Stairs," Your dog may be afraid of the surface material of the stairs in your home. If this is the case, you can try to change it up so your dog can feel more comfortable. If you have uncarpeted stairs, consider adding carpet squares or another kind of surface gripping product to the stairs.Dogs can easily slip on stairs made out of wood, marble, or tile. This is why carpeting is the best option to help your scared dog adjust to using the stairs.;
, If your dog is afraid of the stairs, you need to start altering how it thinks about the area. Move your dog’s feeding location to the base of the stairs so that your dog will begin associating the stairs with the pleasurable experience of eating instead of their existing fear.If your dog is resistant to eating near the stairs at first, make the move more gradually. Move it a few feet closer to the stairs each day until it is finally eating directly next to the stairs.

, Some dogs are afraid of stairs that they can see through – like slatted wooden stairs on decks or other kinds of stairs with gaps in them. To help your dog overcome their fear of these kinds of stairs, consider placing a blanket over the surface of the stairs and working with your dog to go up them that way.Make sure that you shape the blanket around the stairs so that they retain their natural shape. This will help keep your dog safe and used to the stair shape.
Once your dog has mastered the blanket technique, you can remove the blanket and attempt the normal stairs together.

, Looking down a flight of stairs can be quite intimidating to a dog – especially a small dog or a puppy. The stairs can look much steeper from the top than from the bottom. Start at the bottom of the staircase to help give your dog more confidence in tackling the feat.Your dog will feel more secure about going up one stair at a time then it will going down, especially at first.
It is also less dangerous for your dog to start at the bottom. There is a lower risk of falling down the stairs if you start at the bottom.

, If your dog is afraid of the stairs, it may because they seem so large and daunting. Try breaking the exercise up into smaller, more easily accomplishable tasks to boost your dog’s confidence.Work with your dog to make it more comfortable simply approaching the stairs at first. Play with the dog near the stairs and give it treats.
Encourage your dog to go up just one stair. Then reward the dog with a treat and call it to come back down the one stair. Once your dog has mastered this, move on to two stairs (and so on).

, When your dog successfully completes a task, reward it with a treat and praise it out loud. Keep rewarding your dog with things it likes (treats, your attention, your praise, etc.) whenever it moves a step closer to overcoming its fear of the stairs.Never physically hit or yell at your dog if it doesn’t behave the way you want it to during training. This will only reinforce the negative feeling it has already associated with the stairs.

, It’s unreasonable to expect your dog to overcome its fear of stairs in a short period of time. Begin by slowly introducing your dog to the idea of using the stairs and start the often lengthy process of counter-conditioning. Don’t rush into it. Give your dog time to adjust.Don’t get discouraged if your dog doesn’t make quick progress. You have to spend some time supporting your dog and helping it overcome this fear.

, Dogs don’t respond well to force; they often learn much better when they have full control of what happens to their bodies. This means that you should never drag your dog up (or down) the stairs by its leash. This will only reinforce the negative feelings your dog already has about the stairs.If you must keep your dog on a leash while using the stairs, make sure there is enough slack in the leash to let the dog still feel in control of itself during the situation.

, One of the best ways to avoid a fear of stairs is to get your puppy used to it during their crucial conditioning stage early on. From four to sixteen weeks, puppies adapt more easily to new experiences than they will later in adulthood. It’s important to expose your new puppy to as many things, people, animals, and experiences as possible during this time to ensure that it will develop into a well-adjusted dog.The earlier you tackle this problem, the easier it will be for your puppy to outgrow the fear.

Decide whether to wake up your dog.,
Call your dog’s name.,
Wait for your dog to wake up.,
Soothe your dog when it wakes up.",How to Handle a Dog's Nightmares1," When your dog is having a nightmare, your first instinct may be to wake up your dog. However, this isn’t always the best idea. Waking up your dog would disrupt its sleep cycle, causing it to feel confused and possibly lash out at you. It’s often better to let a dog continue sleeping through the nightmare.If your dog’s nightmare is lasting more than a few minutes, consider trying to gently wake up your dog.If you’re undecided about waking up your dog, call your vet for advice. If the nightmare is occurring late at night, consider calling an emergency animal hospital for guidance.;
, If you decide to wake up your dog, you will need to do so carefully and safely. Call your dog’s name softly. If your dog doesn't wake up, call its name several more times, getting a little louder each time. Your goal is to wake up your dog gently without startling it.Do not lean close to or touch your dog when you call its name. In case your dog wakes up suddenly and lashes out, you do not want to be in harm’s way.Your dog should wake up after you call its name a few times. If it doesn’t, it may be having a seizure, which would require immediate veterinary care. Other signs of a seizure include uncontrollable shaking, urinating or defecating, and rigid leg movements., If you decide to let your dog continue sleeping, wait quietly until your dog wakes up on its own. Although hearing or seeing your dog having a nightmare can be very distressing, remember that nightmares do not last for forever.Your dog’s nightmare will end, and your dog will calm down again.


Dogs tend to forget their nightmares after waking up., When your dog wakes up from its nightmare, it may feel a little confused or disoriented. Turn on some soft, soothing music to help your dog calm down and feel safe again.For your own safety, though, do not touch your dog just yet.


Wait until your dog is more alert and calmed down before getting close to it.

Understand separation anxiety.,
Monitor your dog’s behavior.,
Try a variety of pre-departure routines to pinpoint your dog’s triggers.,
Understand the purpose of desensitization.,
Do those things more often, when you're not leaving.,
Switch it up.,
Watch for trembling and whining.,
Notice if your dog seems to avoid its food.,
Monitor for bathroom accidents.,
Watch for chewing or digging at exits.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to End Dog Separation Anxiety With Desensitization," If your dog suffers from separation anxiety, it means that it gets extremely anxious whenever you leave the house. This may be because they are afraid of being alone, or because they are unsure when you will return to provide and care for them. Whatever the reason, many dogs become anxious when their owners leave.This could mean that your dog feels afraid and nervous whenever you aren’t around. If your dog suffers from this condition, you should consider helping them with desensitizing techniques.;
, When you are about to leave your house, you probably notice that your dog is already anxious. Your dog has figured out that you are going to leave by the things you do, and the way you act before you go. These things that you include in your pre-departure routine are possible triggers for your dog that make it anxious because they tell your dog you are about to leave again.Possible triggers for separation anxiety include putting on your shoes, grabbing your keys, putting on your jacket, picking up your purse, or any other thing that indicates an imminent departure to your pet.

, Try to figure out which things specifically make your dog feel anxious. You can try this by getting ready to leave out of your dog’s line of sight and only letting them see you do one things each time you leave. Or change the order of your departure routine to see when they start acting anxious.For example, you could try picking up your purse before you put your shoes on to see if one or the other happens to elicit the anxiety response you expect.

, Desensitization is the process by which something becomes less foreboding because of constant or repeated exposure to that thing. The point of desensitization is to make the scary thing less scary by encountering it more frequently.In this case, if your dog is upset by your absence and becomes anxious by your departure, you need to pinpoint what things trigger these feelings in your dog and then expose your dog to this behavior in random intervals not related to your leaving.

, This causes your dog to lose the association of you going away with you putting on your jacket. There is some effort involved, but it's worth the time it takes. Once you have finished multiple repetitions of desensitization exercises, your dog will be more relaxed and happier when you are gone.If your dog knows you are going to leave when you pick up your keys, grab your keys more often. Put on your jacket, pick up you keys, and go to the door throughout the day. When you get there, turn around and go back to what you were doing.
Some other possible triggers include: putting on your shoes, making coffee, saying goodbye or hugging family members, turning out all the lights in the house, closing the curtains, setting the house alarm, or even brushing your teeth. Whatever your dog’s trigger seems to be, spend some time doing those activities throughout the day and then returning to your other activities at home. This way, your dog will begin to stop associating these activities with your departure from the house.

, Keep doing the pre-departure routine activities in various orders at various times throughout the day, especially when you’re not leaving. Frequent exposure to these things that used to give your dog anxiety will reduce your dog’s anxiety over time.Go to the door and pick up your purse and stand there for a minute. Then put your purse down and go sit on the couch and pet your dog. Do things like this constantly until your dog starts exhibiting less anxiety when you do them.

, If your dog seems to tremble and whine when you are getting ready to leave the house, it is probably a sign of separation anxiety. Dogs are keen observers of human behavior, so they can learn to recognize the signs of your imminent departure.If your dog starts trembling and whining as you put your jacket on, grab your keys, or do any other pre-departure activities, this probably means it suffers from separation anxiety.

, Loss of appetite, especially as you prepare to leave and while you’re away, is a big sign of canine separation anxiety. If your dog is feeling anxious, it will be less likely to eat its food.Try to feed your dog right before you leave and see if it eats. Also, notice how much food your dog has each time before you leave and check the level again when you return. If, over the course of many times, it appears that your dog isn’t eating while you’re gone, then your dog probably suffers from separation anxiety.

, Many dogs who suffer from separation anxiety end up having accidents in the house while their owners are gone because they are so upset at being left alone and they feel like they don’t have any idea about when their owner will return. This can cause a dog to feel the need to relieve themselves instead of waiting for the owner’s return.Be mindful to look for any accidents your dog may have had while you were gone, especially at the door they use to go outside.
Also be careful not to leave your dog alone for too long without access to outside to use the bathroom. Any dog will eventually have to go to the bathroom if you leave them alone long enough, whether or not they suffer from separation anxiety.

, If a dog suffers from separation anxiety, it may be likely to spend a lot of time at the door you leave through while you are gone. This may lead to anxious biting, chewing, or digging at the door or nearby surroundings in an attempt to get to where your dog thinks you went.Check the exits of your home for signs of bite marks or claw marks to see if your dog is exhibiting this behavior.

, If your dog continues to exhibit symptoms of separation anxiety even after you try the desensitization method for several weeks, it may be time to talk to your vet about other possible causes and cures. Your vet may be able to recommend some further treatment that will help your dog feel less anxious.


Possible treatments include anxiety medication that could help lower your dog’s stress levels. However, this will probably only be recommended by your vet in very extreme cases.

Use a tourniquet only in extreme emergencies.,
Watch out for signs of internal bleeding.,
Helping your vet take care of your dog.",How to Help a Dog Suffering from Trauma1," You will likely need to seek veterinary care following a traumatic injury, but you may be able to perform first aid to help stabilize your dog. That said, an injured or frightened dog is much more likely to bite you unexpectedly, so apply a muzzle before touching or moving your dog.If your dog has clearly been injured but you're unable to identify specific injuries, take great care when moving them. Moving their body as little as possible, position your dog on a stiff, flat surface and get them to a vet.
If the dog is bleeding, you will need clean bandages or cloth to slow bleeding and protect the wound for travel to the vet. If someone else is available to help, have them grab these supplies while you apply a muzzle.;
, If your dog has been bitten by another animal, suffered from blunt trauma or burns, or fainted unexpectedly, bring them to the dog immediately. Likewise, if their heartbeat or breathing stopped, get them to the vet quickly and safely.Any breathing complications require especially quick veterinary attention. Surgery may be needed as soon as possible.
Blunt trauma, such as a car accident or fall, may lead to injuries including internal bleeding, organ rupture, skeletal fractures, and head injuries.
Animal bites can cause both deep wounds, as well as spinal injuries or breathing complications that result from being thrashed around. Bites need to be professionally drained, cleaned, and inspected.

, Use a clean towel, and maintain pressure for fifteen minutes. This should stop bleeding from minor injuries. Immediate veterinary care is necessary for injuries that continue to bleed.Consider elevating an appendage that continues bleeding. Do not do this, however, if bones in the affected limb may be broken. Continue to apply pressure to an elevated limb.

, If you are far from a veterinary facility and a wound is still bleeding, there are additional steps you may take to help reduce the bleeding. Do not remove a pad or bandage that has soaked through with blood. Instead, preserve the clot that may be forming and add additional layers of bandages or cloth.Cut blood off at the artery. Use your thumb or finger to compress the main artery supplying blood to an injured limb. These arteries can be accessed from the dog’s armpits or groin.
From the dog’s underside, push into the armpit or groin on the side corresponding with the injury. You will likely be able to feel the artery running down the center of the limb. Press hard enough that blood cannot flow.

, Using a tourniquet is dangerous, and should only be done if you are unable to stop a dog’s bleeding. Use a 2-inch wide piece of material to wrap the severed limb twice and tie the material in a knot. Slip a short stick under one layer of the strip and twist the trick until the tourniquet is tight enough to stop the bleeding. Tie the stick in place and record the time your applied the tourniquet.Loosen the tourniquet every twenty minutes and leave it loose for about twenty seconds.

, Though you may feel as though your dog is alright following a potentially traumatic injury, it’s important to watch them for signs of internal bleeding, which may take a while to develop. If for any reason you are concerned your dog may be suffering from internal bleeding, bring them to the vet immediately.Specific signs of internal bleeding include pale or white gums, skin that is cool to the touch on the legs, ears, coughing up blood, increasing weakness, or tenderness in your dog’s abdomen.

, Once you get your dog to the vet, answer any of the vet’s questions as accurately as you can and provide any medical history you have. Once the dog is stabilized, the vet will perform a thorough analysis of the dog’s nervous system, chest, abdomen, and skeletal system to rule out injuries that may not be apparent. Specific blood and urine tests, as well as x-rays, may be needed.Be thorough in your description of any injury for instance, instead of saying, ""My dog was hit by a car,"" say something like, ""My dog was hit on the left side by a car traveling about 30 mph. After they were hit, they walked into the yard and passed out.""
Following most significant injuries, expect your dog to stay with the vet for at least 24 hours. Many injuries following a traumatic incident do not make themselves immediately apparent. Accordingly, plan to have your dog stay with the vet for a while for continued monitoring.

Your new dog should not eat or drink from an established dog's bowls. Likewise, it should not sleep in an established dog's bed.;
, Puppy pads are moisture absorbent mats that can be placed on the floor or in a dog crate. They are used when the dog has accidents during its housetraining.


Puppy pads can be helpful to have around even if the new dog is not a puppy.

, Your new dog will need an outdoor place to relieve himself. If you have a dog already, this can be the same location that he uses. Find a spot in your yard or at a nearby grassy area. Plan to use this place regularly so that your dog will expect to relieve himself at this location when he goes outside.

, A few days before you plan to bring the new dog home, wear one t-shirt for a day. This will put your scent on the shirt for the established dog. The next day, wear another t-shirt to put your scent on it for the new dog. The goal here will be to eventually have your own scent mingle with scents from your new dog and established dog on each t-shirt.


You can also sleep with the t-shirts to get your scent on them.
The t-shirts should be prepared a day or two ahead of when you are giving them to the dogs.

, Take one of the t-shirts that you’ve worn and rub it over the dog you already have. You can also let your dog sleep with the t-shirt for a night.

, Ask your breeder or rescue organization to have the new dog sleep on the other t-shirt for at least one night. This also helps your new dog get familiar with your scent.

, Give the established dog the shirt the new dog slept on, and vice versa. This way the two dogs become familiar with each other prior to meeting. Since dogs communicate by scent, it is helpful to have them recognize each other's scents and associate it with your scent., Dog appeasing pheromone sprays (DAP) can boost the scent recognition process. These can be purchased from your veterinarian or at major pet retailers. DAP contains a synthetic version of the pheromone that a nursing bitch gives off in order to make her pups feel safe and content.


If so desired, spritz the t-shirts with DAP at each stage, giving it as bedding to the first dog, then spritz again when it’s transferred to the second dog., If you are getting a puppy, you should have something that smells familiar to it. When you pick up the puppy, ask the breeder for a blanket that smells of the puppy's mother and littermates. Put the blanket in the puppy’s crate. This gives him something familiar to snuggle with.

, Your new dog needs a space where he feels safe. Set aside one room that contains his crate, food, water and puppy pads. Place the bedding in the crate. Lay a blanket over one end so that the crate can be dark and secluded.


If you collected one, include the new dog’s familiar-smelling blanket.
Include the t-shirt that has your scent and the established dog’s scent on it. This helps to blend the smells together and makes a link between the familiar and the new.

, Dogs, especially adult ones, will benefit from being introduced in a neutral territory away from home. Many rescue shelters will facilitate these meetings to see if the dogs will get along. Plan this visit to take place several days before the new dog is scheduled to come home with you.


Choose a park you don’t normally visit so that your dog isn’t territorial about the location.
This step can be especially important before making a final decision about taking a rescue dog home.

, The rescue shelter or owner should walk the dog in the same park where you are. Plan to meet at the same time so that the dogs can interact.

, Set off on a walk in the park as if it’s just a normal walk. Allow the dogs to meet up. Meeting on neutral territory lowers the stakes because neither dog has anything to defend there.Ideally, the dogs will meet in this type of situation a couple of times before the newcomer arrives at your home.
If the two dogs get along and play well together in the park, chances are they will have a good relationship when they are at home together. This bodes well for their future relationship. Likewise, if the dogs hate each other on sight, you are forewarned about a clash of personalities. If this is the case, you should rethink getting that particular dog.

, Give positive reinforcement to your dog by giving it a treat or some extra attention. Always speak to your dog first when introducing it to a new dog.

, When you first arrive home, take the new dog straight to the place you want him to use as a toilet. This is the first step in house-training your dog.

, Bring the dog to his crate and place him inside. Leave the door open so that he can come out if he wants to.

, When you bring the dog home, introduce him steadily to new rooms in your house. Limit him to the first room for at least 24 hours, keeping him in that room with his crate open. Allow the new dog a bit of time to get used to his new surroundings. He will slowly get accustomed to new scents, such as the scents in your house and the scent of the established dog from the t-shirt in his crate.


Do not give him the range of the house straight away. This will overwhelm him.

, Give your dog positive reinforcement by telling him that he’s a good dog. Give him a pet and scratch behind the ears.

, Make sure your new dog knows where to go when he needs to relieve himself. Take him to the toileting area every few hours during the first 24 hours.


Ignore accidents today. The new dog may still need to be housetrained, and he will need to learn where to go. Take him out to his toilet area often. If he does have an accident, simply ignore the behavior. Punishing him will only confuse and distress him.

, After every toilet visit, take the new dog back to its crate. This will help him feel safe and he won’t get so overwhelmed.

, Starting with the second day, introduce your new dog to a new room every day. Do not give him the range of the house straight away. This will overwhelm him.

, If the new dog seems inquisitive, you can start to show him other rooms, one at a time. Take him to each new room and let him explore for about 20 minutes at a time.


If the dog seems overwhelmed, limit him to one room for a few days.
Make sure the new dog always has ready access to his crate.

, Once the new dog has explored a room for 20 minutes, take him out to the toilet spot. This maximizes the chance of him toileting outside and establishing this habit.

, Give your dog positive reinforcement by telling him that he’s a good dog. Give him a pet and scratch behind the ears.

, After every exploratory session and toilet visit, take the new dog back to its crate. This will help him feel safe and he won’t get so overwhelmed.

, The new dog may still need to be housetrained, and he will need to learn where to go. Take him out to his toilet area often. If he does have an accident, simply ignore the behavior. Punishing him will only confuse and distress him.

, After the new dog has spent at least 24 hours at your home, you can start introducing the new and established dogs to each other. To do this, place the new dog in his crate and close the crate door. Bring the established dog into the room and let him sniff around.


Don't point out the new dog. Let the dog find the new dog for himself. The established dog will be able to investigate by sniffing the crate and finding the new dog himself., Allow the two dogs to interact through the bars of the crate for up to 20 minutes. Remove the established dog from the room. Let the new dog out of the crate and take him to his toilet area.

, If the established dog behaves positively and approaches the new dog in a friendly manner, reward his good behavior with a treat.


Do your best to ignore the new dog during this time, so that the older dog is not jealous. Instead, speak to the established dog first. For the first few days, only praise the new dog when the established dog isn’t around. Give your dog positive reinforcement by telling him that he’s a good dog. Give him a pet and scratch behind the ears.

, The two dogs will start to get used to each other, either by being happy in each other’s company, or by ignoring one another. Continue this introduction for a few days.

, After the dogs have had a chance to get to know each other a bit, introduce the two dogs by putting the new dog on a leash and bringing him out of the crate. Monitor the dogs’ reactions to each other. The established dog may have one of several reactions: he will accept the new dog and want to play; cold-shoulder the new dog; or growl and threaten him. Give the dogs about 5 minutes to interact.Keeping the new dog restrained on a leash is important during these first meetings. If the new dog chases your established dog on its home territory, your dog is more likely to dislike the newcomer.After they have interacted, remove the established dog and take the new dog out to the toilet area.

, Depending on how well the dogs are getting along, gradually extend these contact times to 20 minutes in duration. After each session, lead the established dog out of the room and take the new dog out to the toilet area.


It is fine to take this step more slowly if necessary.

, As the two dogs get used to one another, stretch out the 20 minute segments by taking them for walks together.


When going for walks, always put on the established dog's leash first. Let him through the door ahead of the newcomer. He is less likely to challenge the newcomer if he is assured that he is top dog.

, Keep your eye on both dogs when they are together. However, do not be too alarmed if the established dog growls. Despite any growling or signs of aggression, the established dog is extremely unlikely to harm the new dog and is more likely to make a fuss and then wander off in disgust. You should, however, keep an eye on the dogs at all times until you are confident that they are used to each other.

, To avoid having the established dog feeling territorial, do not allow the new dog to eat or drink from the other dog’s bowls. Also, prevent the new dog from playing with the other’s toys.

, The new dog may still need to be housetrained, and he is learning where to go. Take him out to his toilet area often. If he does have an accident, simply ignore the behavior. Punishing him will only confuse and distress him.

Review basic commands.,
Exercise your dog.,
Stay calm.,
Reduce territorial behaviour.",How to Introduce a New Dog in a Not Neutral Area1," If you plan to introduce a new dog in a not neutral area, make sure it follows basic commands - most importantly, “Come here”, which could be vital if you need to remove your dog from a dangerous situation. Employ the correction and reward method, which involves speaking firmly but never becoming verbally or physically aggressive with your dog. For in-depth instructions and videos, visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/.;
, Giving a dog ample exercise can prevent destructive behaviour, which often arises when a dog has too much energy. Most breeds of dog require between 30-60 minutes of robust exercise a day. To ensure your dog's best behaviour while being introduced in a non-neutral area, bring it out for exercise shortly before., Dogs are very sensitive and responsive to the emotions of people around them, and often reflect them back in their own behaviour. To ensure that a dog is well-behaved while being introduced, keep your feelings in check and remain calm. Be firm and positive, but refrain from intense emotion that will make your dog anxious or over-excited., Minimize territorial behaviour in your dog before introducing a new dog by using ""nothing is free"" training. A dog's inclination to mark or defend its territory has likely been reinforced over time by way of unearned treats and a sense of entitlement. To curb this, make your dog obey a command before feeding it any meals or giving it treats or toys to play with, reinforcing your role as a provider and leader."

Give your dog a treat at the sound of the elevator “ding.” If your dog is afraid of elevators, it will associate the sound the elevator makes when it arrives with negativity.,
Enter the elevator then immediately exit.,
Increase the time you spend on the stationary elevator gradually.,
Send the elevator up or down one floor.,
Consider giving your dog a meal in the elevator.,
Get help from another dog.",How to Get Rid Of Your Pup’s Elevator Phobia1," The first step to training is to recondition this negative association. As soon as you hear the “ding,” offer your dog a treat and verbal praise, like “Good dog!”When training your dog, break up treats into pea-sized bits. That way, you can offer lots of treats without negatively affecting its diet.
When verbally encouraging your dog, use a calm, normal tone of voice. Project positivity and happiness, but avoid baby talk or cooing, or you might risk encouraging its anxiety.;
, When the door opens, you should enter the elevator before your dog. Give the leash a gentle tug if you need to encourage it to enter the elevator. Hold your arm in front of the door or press the “Door Open” button to keep it from closing.Stay in the elevator for about one second, then exit. Don’t rush your movements, but try to keep them brisk and confident.
Once you’ve exited the elevator, offer another small, pea-sized treat.

, If your dog seems to be tolerating the training well thus far, repeat the enter and exit sequence five or ten times. Gradually increase the amount of time you spend inside the elevator. Work your way up to the point where you can let the elevator door close.If your dog barks or starts to get anxious, let it take a break from training and start again in a couple hours or the next day.
If it stays calm when the elevator door closes, immediately reward it with a small treat and verbal praise.

, After getting your dog used to being in elevator with a closed door, begin training it to stay calm in a moving elevator. Begin by going up or down one floor, and reward calm behavior with a small treat and verbal praise.If your dog has been more comfortable in the past with one direction, start with that direction. Otherwise, it doesn’t matter which direction you send the elevator first during training.
Repeat the training sequence at least once a day for several days, and gradually increase the number of floors you travel.

, For most dogs, mealtime is a strong positive motivator. If you have difficulty with desensitization training and your dog doesn’t seem interested in treats, try feeding it a meal inside the moving elevator.Do your best to make sure your neighbors won’t be walking their dogs while food is in the elevator. If the elevator opens and you’re greeted by another dog, ask its owner politely if they mind taking the next elevator or giving you a minute to finish training., If your pup has four-legged friends who are used to elevators, consider asking their owners for a play date. Other dogs can help show your pup that using an elevator isn’t scary.If you get help from another dog, make sure that it and your pup have already been introduced and are comfortable with each other’s presence. Do not confine your dog in an elevator with a dog it doesn’t know.

Seek veterinary attention for shock.,
Monitor an injured dog for symptoms of shock.,
Help a dog suffering from shock.",How to Help a Dog Suffering from Trauma2," Shock may lead to reduced blood flow to a dog's tissues, which can damage their organs. If shock is present, seek attention as quickly as possible, as the condition may worsen.Generally, injuries that lead to either internal and/or external bleeding are the most likely to lead to the low blood pressures that may result in hypoglycemic shock.
Other types of shock include cardiogenic shock (which may follow a heart attack), anaphylactic shock (caused by severe allergic reactions), septic shock (from infections), and neurogenic shock (following a head or spinal injury).
In addition to injury, dehydration, blockage of the airwaves, and illness may also cause shock. Regardless of the type or cause of shock, get an afflicted dog to the vet.

, Rapid heart beat, anxiety or agitation, inflamed red gums, and shallow breathing may all indicate the onset of shock. As the degree of shock rises, the dog’s heart beat will speed up, gums will turn whitish or blue, the pulse will diminish, and the dog will become weak and lethargic. Further, breathing may become more rapid or more shallow.As late-stage shock sets in, gums will appear white or mottled, heart rate and respiration may fluctuate, eyes may become glazed over or unfocused, rectal temperatures will fall, and the dog may fall into a stupor or coma.
Do not assume your dog is not suffering from shock. Continue to watch them closely for several days, and know that the onset of shock can happen rather quickly.

, Most importantly, you need to get the dog to the vet. There are several things you can do to help counteract shock on the way. Note that there are also a few things you should be careful to avoid.Provide any necessary first aid, including restraining the dog, reducing blood loss, etc.
Keep the dog in as quiet an environment as possible.
Position their head slightly lower than their body.
Cover the dog’s body with a blanket or towel to maintain body heat, but do not apply a heating pad.
Minimize the dog’s movement as much as possible.
Do not place anything in the dog’s mouth, including food, water, or medication.

Recognize that dogs can suffer from mental trauma.,
Provide the dog a safe space.,
Keep the dog on a routine.,
Provide ample opportunities for play.,
Read to them.,
Talk to your vet about diet and medication.,
Expect to help manage a dog’s PTSD for the rest of their life.",How to Help a Dog Suffering from Trauma3," Both service dogs and civilian dogs can develop symptoms similar to those that afflict human sufferers of post traumatic stress syndrome. In particular, abuse, natural disaster, and other traumatic experiences can lead to symptoms such as anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, and more.Any signs of persistent nervousness, distress, or confusion should all be considered serious.
If your dog routinely forgets basic commands, holds their ears back constantly, has dilated pupils, tends to keep their body low and their tail tucked, and frequently breathes rapidly with the corners of their mouth drawn, they are likely suffering from significant anxiety.

, A dog that may be suffering from mental distress will likely benefit from having a space that is all their own. Designate their crate, or even a room, off limits to any other people or animals in your home. Keep the dog’s favorite toys there, as well as their food bowl and an item of your clothing.If possible, locate the dog’s safe space somewhere quiet and out of the way.
Supply chew toys a swell, as anxious dogs are often more prone to chewing.

, Order and consistency can make your dog feel more comfortable. This means walking and feeding your dogs at the same times every day. When you do introduce new environments, people, or other pets to your dog, do so gradually. In short, minimized variations from a consistent routine whenever possible., If your dog is willing and able to play with other dogs, encourage them to do so. Bring them to the dog park whenever possible, even if they simply quietly watch the other dogs play on your first few visits. While it may take a while for your dog to comfortably play with other dogs, it’s a meaningful sign of recovery once they are able to do so.Also take your dog out with you on runs, hikes, and swimming excursions. Even if they are slow to want to socialize, it’s still important to ensure they get plenty of exercise, and they will likely enjoy doing so with you.

, Personnel in some dog kennels have begun using a surprisingly method to help socialize dogs that have become frightened, irritable, or overly aggressive after abuse or other traumatic experiences. The approach is also very simple: sit near you dog and read to them. Even respondent, lethargic dogs have been known to wag their tails after a few minutes of listening to a human read in a calm, even, and friendly voice., Many holistic approaches to a dog’s mental health exist. The most legitimate are based on dietary changes, and include supplements such as Omega 3 fatty acids. Talk to your vet before changing your dog’s diet, especially when you’re considering providing supplements.L-theanine and melatonin are also recommended to boost canine mental health. In fact, you can buy L-theanine supplements designed specifically for dogs.
There are also collars that emit pheromones that may help anxious dogs relax.
Depending on the degree of your dog’s distress, your vet may even recommend pharmaceuticals such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, or amitriptyline.

, Symptoms such as those related to conditions like PTSD will not necessarily be “cured”. A dog’s state of mind can be significantly, if not permanently altered by a traumatic event. However, you can help diminish the symptoms your dog suffers by providing them with constant love and understanding. "

Separate the dogs.,
Emphasize scent.,
Reassure your resident dog.,
Let your dogs interact briefly.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Monitor the dogs closely.,
Look for signs of bonding.,
Consult an expert.",How to Introduce a New Dog in a Not Neutral Area2," Since you are not introducing the new dog in a neutral area, keep your pets separated until after they have grown more comfortable with each others presence. Place the dogs in their crates, close enough to smell and be aware of one another, or in adjoining rooms separated by a baby gate. Let the dogs out at alternate times so that they can pick up on each others scent around the house without a confrontation.The new dog should spend more time confined during the first few days, being let out for approximately 15-20 minutes, 3 or more times a day.

, Smell is the primary way for dogs to get to know each other and establish a sense of comfort with one another. Place objects from one dog (e.g. a toy or blanket) in the other's crate or bed so that it gets used to the unfamiliar scent. In the long run, the recognition of each other's scent may forge a bond between the dogs., During the initial period where your resident dog adjusts to the new dog’s presence, offer it as much comfort and attention as possible. Identifying an unfamiliar scent in its home without being able to confront the source will be confusing and unsettling, as your dog will likely suspect that there is an intruder in the home. Spend quiet time cuddling or petting it to keep it calm and make it feel secure.This kind of quality time will also help to curb jealously later on.

, If both dogs seem to have grown comfortable with each other’s presence, allow them to interact for a few short periods each day (5-10 minutes, or longer if the dogs get along well). Clear the area that you choose for these play sessions of any objects they might fight over (toys, dog blankets, food bowls, etc.). Monitor the interactions closely- if one of the dogs shows signs of aggression (e.g. staring at the other dog), remove it from the interaction and tell it to go lie down until it is calm.

, Create positive associations during your dogs’ first interactions so that your resident dog sees the new dog’s presence as something good. Use praise and a happy, upbeat tone of voice to address both dogs during this time. Reward both dogs with treats, being careful to give each dog the exact same treat at the same time to avoid jealously or fighting., Monitor your dogs very carefully while they play, watching for warning signals. Actions like moving to another part of the room are clear signs that a dog needs a break from the situation, and should be respected. Watch for other signs that could be mistaken for simple play, such as:Staring at another dog
A dog circling another dog with its neck arched, legs stiff, and tail high
A dog licking its lips or nose in an exaggerated manner, which is likely a signal that it is anxious or uncomfortable., During your dogs’ supervised interactions, look for indications that they are forging a bond. Such signs would include cuddling, increased play and interaction, or mutual grooming (e.g. licking each other). As time goes on the dogs should not avoid each other, as that is generally a sign of having incompatible pets., If your dogs do not get along after several attempts at play time and monitored interactions, contact an animal trainer for help regulating the problem behavior occurring. Avoid punishing either dog, which will result in further negative associations with the new living situation.

Start elevator training your pup by twelve weeks.,
Train your dog when the elevator is in low demand.,
Stay calm and confident to reassure your pup.,
Keep your dog’s leash short, but leave some slack.",How to Get Rid Of Your Pup’s Elevator Phobia2," Puppies are most open to new experiences between eight and twelve weeks of age. You should start getting it accustomed to using elevators during this time.In addition to elevator training, you should expose your puppy to as many new experiences as possible, like other animals, children, other people’s homes, and car rides.
If your dog is older, you can still use desensitization training to get rid of its fear of elevators.

, Schedule twenty minute training sessions during times when the fewest number of people will be riding the elevator. You don’t want to disrupt your neighbors’ daily activities, and you’ll want to keep training sessions as stress-free as possible.Try to observe the elevator and note the times of day with the lowest traffic. Morning and evening rushes, when people are coming and going to work, will be obvious occasions to avoid.

, When training your pup and whenever you expose it to a new experience, be sure to monitor your own body language. Try to control your breathing and heartbeat to project calmness, confidence, and positivity.Don’t panic if someone gets on or off the elevator, or if you encounter another dog. Say hello and be friendly. Your calm behavior will help cue your dog to keep its cool, regardless of age.

, Like your body language, holding the leash with some slack will let your dog know that it shouldn’t be reactive. Holding a leash too tightly or pulling it tells your dog that you’re in a stressful situation and it should be on guard.You don’t want to give your dog full reign or disregard the leash length. Shorten the length of the leash so you’ll have control if you need it, and be sure to keep it clear of the elevator’s moving parts.

Avoid walking your dog during periods of heavy canine traffic.,
Consider using a muzzle.,
Train your dog to stay and wait at doors.",How to Get Rid Of Your Pup’s Elevator Phobia3," If your dog is already stressed out by the elevator ride, coming into contact with strange dogs will only cause its anxiety to spike. While you’re training it to ride the elevator, do your best to avoid encounters with your neighbors and their dogs.Try to keep track of when your neighbors walk their dogs. Most dog owners have fairly set walking schedules, so you should be able to identify peak times that you should avoid.
You can also try talking to dog owners in your building or complex. Tell them, “I’m training my pup to stay calm on elevator rides, and it’d be best to steer clear of other dogs for now. Do you mind telling me what times of day you generally take your dog on walks?”
If you take your pup out and hear a dog down the hall, wait at your door or out of visual sight for a minute or so.

, A muzzle will help you avoid a bad situation if your dog is larger or if you’re at all afraid that it might bite a passerby. Until it’s comfortable with elevators, riding them will be an upsetting experience with an increased risk of aggressive behavior.Choose a plastic basket muzzle for your dog. Find one at your local pet store, and ask a sales associate to measure your dog’s snout and help you choose an appropriate size.
Get the dog used to the muzzle by letting it sniff it, touching it to its nose, then putting it on and offering a treat. Try placing a bit of peanut butter inside the muzzle so your dog can lick it after you place it over its snout.
Be sure to only use muzzles in combination with desensitization training. A muzzle is not a replacement for consistent, positive training.

, Commands like ”stay” and ”wait” will come in handy while elevator training your dog. When command training your dog, first say the command and, if necessary, physically guide your dog into the appropriate physical position.As soon as it’s in the correct position, offer a pea-sized treat. Repeat the sequence ten to twenty times per training session to reinforce the behavior.
Try not to let your dog ever enter or exit doors before you. This will help prevent your dog from leaping out of an elevator before you can see who or what is waiting to enter.

Keep the meeting short and simple.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Dogs in the Neighborhood1," An easy way to meet other dogs in your neighborhood is to make sure you are out and about with your dog on a daily basis. If possible, try to keep a regular walking schedule so your new dog will become familiar with the canines and humans it sees out on its daily walk. Walking your dog regularly means you will run into more opportunities for your dog to socialize with its neighbors., When you are out and about in the neighborhood, it is important that you always have your dog on a leash. In most places and situations, the law requires you to keep your dog leashed. Having your dog on a leash means you can maintain control if you run into another dog. Keeping your dog on a leash will also prevent your pup from running away should he feel threatened by the presence of another dog., Before you allow your dog to meet another dog, you should first make sure that dog does not have a history of aggression. Try asking the owner if their dog likes meeting other dogs. If the answer is yes, then ask if their dog has any aggression issues. It is better to ask these questions up front than to learn the answers the hard way.Before you approach the other dog owner, try saying, “Hello! It looks like my dog might like to say hello to your dog. Is your dog aggressive?”

, You should never allow your dog to greet a dog without first asking the owner for permission. The world is full of friendly dogs, but it is also filled with dogs that can be aggressive and antisocial. For this reason, it’s important that you get permission from the owner before allowing your dog to greet someone else’s dog.Try asking, “Is it okay if my dog says hello to your dog? My dog is friendly.”

, It is best that you keep meetings with other dogs brief while you are out walking your dog in the neighborhood. Once you have acquired permission from the other owner, allow the dogs to sniff each other for a few moments. If your dog behaves well and refrains from lunging at the other dog or barking, praise your dog and then lead your dog away."

Figure out the root of your fear.,
Learn to read a dog's body language.,
Relax around dogs.,
Spend time around dogs.",How to Get Used to Dogs1," There are a variety of reasons people may be apprehensive around dogs. The first step to overcoming your fear is identifying potential sources. This can help you see where and how a fear is based in irrational thinking.


Oftentimes, people fear dogs because their parents instilled a fear in them at a very young age by overreacting in the presence of a large, unfamiliar, or overactive dog. If this is the case with you, remember your parents were striving to protect you when you were a small child. You were likely more vulnerable and less likely to understand boundaries with strange animals. In adulthood, you probably do not need to fear the majority of dogs you encounter.People often fear dogs because of past experience. If you were bitten by a dog, or witnessed a friend or family member being bitten by a dog, you might have developed a fear because of that incident. Try to remember the majority of dogs are friendly and harmless and that one bad experience should not influence your relationship with dogs for your entire life.;
, Many times, people fear dogs because they do not understand how they communicate. Dogs are fairly straightforward in terms of behavior. Learning to read when a dog is being friendly is a great way to alleviate an unnecessarily fearful reaction when you encounter a dog.


A happy dog will appear relaxed and will hang his tail and head in a natural position. He may gently wag his tail from side to side or in a circular motion. His mouth will either be closed or slightly open and he might be panting at an even tempo. The corner of his mouth might even be turned up as if he's smiling. If you notice a dog behaving like this, he's probably safe to approach and touch.An exited dog is often mistaken for an angry dog, and dogs may get excited when you encounter them in public or enter someone's home. However, there are important differences. An excited dog will center his weight on his rear legs and might bounce around. His tail and head are held upright, and he may wag his tail. His mouth is generally open and some barking might occur. If a dog is being aggressive, however, he will be showing his teeth and wrinkling his nose rather than just opening his mouth and his weight will be centered equally on all fours. His tail will be held straight up or, if scared, will be between his legs. An aggressive dog will likely not break eye contact. Dogs are rarely unprovoked, so you are not likely to encounter an aggressive dog very often.An alert dog is often also mistaken for an aggressive one. When alert, dogs might bark or growl but this is unlikely a sign of aggression. An alert dog will have his ears pointed forward and be staring at whatever's interesting him. The hair on his back might be standing up and his mouth is typically closed. You probably do not have to be afraid of an alert dog. However, you should not attempt to pet or interact with a dog when they're engaged with something else. They might become startled and nip., Dogs pick up on cues from people and can tell if someone is afraid in their presence. This can cause dogs to become fearful. Trying to remain calm around a dog can help you have better interactions with dogs and gradually reduce your fear.


Oftentimes, people tend to freeze around dogs if they're afraid. Before dogs attack, they tend to lock up and stare. If a dog notices you engaging in this behavior, they might interpret it as a sign you're being aggressive. Instead of freezing up around dogs try to relax your muscles and ignore their presence. This might be difficult and even feel unnatural at first, but a dog is more likely to be friendly towards you if you remain calm.If you're going somewhere where you know you'll encounter a dog, try engaging in breathing and relaxation techniques beforehand. Close your eyes, imagine entering the room with the dog, and then take deep, calming breaths.If you feel brave enough to reach out, let the dog sniff your hand. Move slowly and offer out your hand in a fist,and keeping it below the dog's eye level so that he can see it easily and doesn't mistake it as a threat. do not snap your hand away if the dog moves to lick or sniff you. It's normal for dogs to nose the hand of a stranger and it does not mean the dog is going to bite. If you move your hand away too quickly, you might frighten the dog. He might think you're moving to hit him or becoming aggressive. You want to keep your interactions positive to help gradually get over your phobia., Once you've had several positive interactions with dogs in public or at social gatherings, start to consciously spend more time around dogs. .


Gradual, prolonged exposure to a fear-producing stimuli is a very effective means to cure phobias. If you make an effort to interact with dogs, eventually your fear will slip away.Start small. This does not mean starting with puppies, which can be frightening because of their unpredictable behavior. Start with older, well-trained dogs that are unlikely to jump or frighten you.Remember to stay calm. If you feel compelled to leave the room when you're interacting with a dog, do not leave. This only reinforces that there is something about dogs to fear and you need to engage in behaviors like running and hiding to protect yourself. Remain in the room until you calm down.Remember that a direct stare is a threat to a dog. If you are anxious and stare at the dog, he is more likely to interpret you as a threat and become tense as a result. This then escalates a cycle of fear and suspicion. Instead, be sure to blink regularly, and watch the dog from the corner of your eye or keep moving your head so as to avoid a direct stare.
Talk to friends, co-workers, and family members who own dogs about how you're trying to get over your fear. They can help by allowing you to interact with their dogs or taking you to dog-friendly places like dog parks and nature trails.

Set up a meet and greet with your neighbor.,
Supervise the introduction.,
Introduce the dogs on neutral territory.,
Carefully monitor the introduction.,
Allow the dogs to set the introduction’s pace.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Dogs in the Neighborhood2," A great way to socialize your new dog is to set up a meet and greet with one of your neighbors. If you live near someone with a friendly, well-socialized dog, it is okay to ask them if they are interested in setting up a time and place for the dogs to meet. Make sure to ask your neighbor about any antisocial or aggressive behavior their dog may have exhibited in the past., It’s important that you are 100% attentive to your dog and yourself when meeting other dogs in the neighborhood. While it might seem natural to engage in an in-depth conversation with your neighbor as your dogs play, it’s critical that you keep your attention on the dogs. This will allow you to respond quickly and effectively should any trouble arise.

, Dogs are, by nature, territorial animals. It is important that you do introduce your new dog to other dogs in a neutral space. You should not, under any circumstance, introduce the dogs in one another’s territory. For example, you shouldn’t allow your dog to run into your neighbor’s yard to meet their dog. This could set up a situation where your neighbor’s dog becomes territorial, and even aggressive. Instead, introduce the dogs in a neutral space, like a neighborhood park or local trail., Pay attention to how each dog is responding to the interaction. For example, you should look out for wary, defensive, or aggressive body language including growling, lunging, teeth baring, and hair standing up on the dogs’ backs. If you notice any of these signs, calmly call your dog to you and leave the situation.

, Not all dogs are going to be excited about meeting each other, or want to immediately engage in a playful or positive interaction. Be patient. Do not expect instant friendship between the dogs and do not force the dogs to interact., If your dog responds well throughout the meet and greet, reward them. For example, you can give your dog a treat if they remain calm and display confident behavior. At the end of the meet and greet, and after you have left the company of the other dog, positively reinforce your dog’s good behavior with a treat or a favorite toy."

Introduce a dog to a new baby.,
Understand your child's fear.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Explain to your child how dogs communicate.,
Introduce your child to an adult dog before a puppy.",How to Get Used to Dogs2," If you have a dog and are bringing home a new baby, you need to follow certain protocol to make sure the introduction goes smoothly. Dogs usually adjust well to babies, but you should still guide introductions with careful planning.


Before your baby arrives, teach your dog general obedience skills. Sit, lie down, stay, and leave it are commands your dog should know. This way, if he's getting overly excited around the baby you could easily intervene and get him to calm down and take a break.If possible, allow your dog to interact with friend's babies in the months leading up to delivery. Introduce him to new signs and sounds so the strange noises the baby makes do not frighten him.Make sure your dog's first encounter with the baby is pleasant. Allow everyone else present to enter the house before the baby comes so your dog can greet them as usual. When you show your dog the baby, stay calm as this will help your dog stay calm. Praise your dog for being calm around the baby and speak to him in a pleasant voice as he interacts with the new family member.Give your dog attention when the baby is present. People are often tempted to do the opposite, giving the dog extra attention to make up for any he lacks when the baby is around. However, this can lead your dog to believe good things only happen when the baby is gone. If he gets treats, praise, and attention in the presence of the baby he'll learn to like the new family member.Always reward your dog for calm, polite behavior around the baby. If he gets too excited or playful, have a cue word that will make him give the infant space. Something like ""Go lie down"" or ""Shoo"" should signal to your dog he needs to take a few minutes to calm himself., If your child is experiencing a dog phobia, strive to understand where that fear is coming from. This can help you better explain why the fear is, in most cases, unnecessary.


Children, especially young children, are naturally fearful of unfamiliar things. If your child did not grow up around dogs, they're likely startled in the presence of a new animal. Fear is not rational and cannot always be dealt with by trying to explain, rationally, why a dog won't hurt a child.Show don't tell is a good adage when dealing with childhood fears. Instead of explaining again and again a dog won't hurt them, interact with the dog yourself. Calmly pet and talk to an unfamiliar dog and show your child the dog is friendly.
Of course, take the usual precautions. Do not pet a strange dog or one that appears aggressive. You do not want to inadvertently reinforce your child's fear.

, Oftentimes, when trying to explain proper behavior, parents end up fueling a fear of dogs. Be careful how you speak to your child when she interacts with a new dog.


People often say things like, ""Pet the dog gently, or else he might bite"" or ""Do not pet a strange dog, as he might be aggressive."" Such phrasing is well-intentioned, but what you're really telling your child is that dogs are something to be feared.Instead of those kinds of phrases, try to reword warnings in a positive light. Instead of saying, ""Don't pet a dog like that,"" try something like, ""Dogs really prefer to be petted on their backs gently. It makes them happy."" Instead of warning children that strange dogs might bite, instead say, ""Dogs like to get to know people before being petted."", Children, much like adults who fear dogs, often have phobias based in misinformation. Make sure children know how dogs communicate so they recognize a friendly, happy dog.


Let your child know a dog with an open mouth and relaxed ears is friendly. That dog is ready to be petted. Teach them that a wagging tail is a sign of happiness in dogs.If you see a dog acting fearful or aggressive, explain this to your child in terms that are not frightening. Instead of saying, ""That dog might bite"" say something like, ""That dog looks scared. He probably needs some space."", Children might love puppies as they're cute and cuddly, but introducing your child to an untrained puppy might not be a great idea.


Puppies and children are both easily excitable and might not understand boundaries. If a child, especially one unfamiliar with dogs, interacts with a puppy he could accidentally end up bitten or scratched. If your child is already afraid of dogs, this could reinforce that fear.Find an older, trained, and calm adult dog for your child's first interactions. If you're considering adopting a dog, finding an older dog at a shelter is not only a great option to reduce fear in your child. It's good for the dog as well. Older animals are often not adopted and end up in shelters for months and even years, and might be euthanized if they're not housed at a no-kill shelter."
"
Introduce the dogs on neutral grounds.,
Monitor interactions for the first few weeks.,
Seek professional help if necessary.",How to Get Used to Dogs3," When you pick up your new dog, he should be introduced to your current pet on neutral grounds. This way, neither animal will feel the need to be territorial.


Have a friend assist you if necessary. You should take the dogs on a walk together through the neighborhood or have them meet at a park up the street. Do not just bring your new dog into your home and do not put them in the car together right away.Keep the dogs on leashes during initial introduction. Sniffing is normal, but if you notice any barking or aggression pull the dogs apart until they've calmed down. Encourage positive interaction by praising the dogs for non-aggressive behavior. Provide treats and toys so the dogs feel positive and happy in one another's presence.Once the dogs have finished greeting one another and appear to have calmed down, you can take your new dog home., For the first few weeks, you should not leave the dogs unsupervised alone together. Even the smoothest introductions have some hiccups as dogs establish ground rules and power structures for their home.


Keep toys, treats, and food separate. Make sure each dog has their own food bowl and water bowl. Never give one dog a treat without also giving the other a treat. These steps can minimize fighting over territory, resources, or attention.If the dogs growl, fight, or otherwise behave aggressively separate them for a few minutes and allow them to calm down. Once they've relaxed, allow them to interact again. Overreacting and separating them for long periods, or responding to fights with extreme scolding, makes dogs feel there is something to be feared. You want to minimize stress in your home as much as possible for a smooth transition.Always separate your dogs when you're not home until they're used to one another. If a fight breaks out and you're not there to stop it, one or both dogs could end up seriously hurt., Sometimes, even if you follow proper protocol, two dogs still do not interact well.


While shelter dogs can be a wonderful addition to your home, they often come from abusive homes where they were not given enough food, water, and attention. Dogs from these kinds of backgrounds can be more territorial and may have a hard time adjusting to another dog.
A professional pet trainer might be able to curb aggressive behaviors and help you learn better techniques to discipline your dogs. Look for trainers in your area if you've having trouble establishing a harmonious home."

Make sure your dog is well trained.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Avoid aggressive dogs.",How to Introduce Your New Dog to Dogs in the Neighborhood3," Before you introduce your dog to other dogs in the neighborhood, you should make sure they understand basic commands like sit, stay, and down. This will help you maintain control over your dog when they meet other dogs and prevent possible scuffles.

, You need to be keenly aware of your dog’s body language when you introduce it to other dogs. You should also pay careful attention to the other dog’s body language. Beware of wary or defensive behaviors from your dog or the other dog. Walk away calmly if you notice body language such as:Prolonged staring
Stiff legs
Baring of teeth
Hair standing up on the dog’s back

, If you notice defensive body language in another dog, or if the dog engages in aggressive behavior like barking or lunging, you should not approach the dog. Instead, leave the situation as calmly as possible. Try to distract your dog and calmly, but quickly, walk away from the other dog.

Consider what you are expecting of your dog.",How to Teach Your Dog to Jump1," When you want your dog to learn to jump, be sure it is a suitable thing for your dog to learn. Consider the following:


Is your dog the right size or height?
Is your dog healthy enough?
Is the jump you expect from your dog doable for your dog?
Is your dog a good learner?

Name the covering behavior when your dog does it naturally.,
Encourage the behavior by giving a treat when you see it.,
Attach a sticker to the dog’s forehead.,
Tie a kerchief over the dog’s eyes.,
Condition your dog to play shy.",How to Teach Your Dog to Play Shy1," Dogs can understand over a thousand words when trained to interpret them properly.Dogs will often rub their faces or cover their faces with one or both of their paws. When you see this behavior, draw the dog’s attention to it by saying “Play shy!” in a friendly, happy tone.


Instead of “Play shy!” you can use a similar cue such as “Cover!” or “Hide!” Whatever verbal cue you use to teach your dog to place its paws over its face, be consistent with it. Do not use two commands to teach the same trick.;
, After about one week of acknowledging and drawing attention to the dog’s natural covering behavior by calling out “Play shy!” whenever you see the dog’s paws over its face, begin testing your pooch to see if he or she has internalized the command yet. Command your dog to play shy and issue a treat if it obeys. If it doesn’t, help your doggie remember how to play shy. Exclaim “Play shy!” Then place one or both of its paws over its face.


If you choose to place both paws over the dog’s face, you will first need to get the dog to lie down.
Whether you choose to place one or both of the dog’s paws over its face, make sure you do it the same way each time. If choosing to utilize only one paw in the trick, always use the same paw. For instance, if you exclaim “Play shy!” and cover your dog’s eyes with its right paw, do not cover its eyes with its left paw the next time you want it to perform the trick.

, Place a post-it note, a piece of tape, sticker, or a band-aid on the center of the dog’s forehead, just above the point right between its eyes. Painter’s tape peels off easily and is also a good choice. Whatever you choose, apply it lightly enough to be noticed by the dog, but not so firmly that removal will be difficult.


Do not use anything too sticky, or anything that gets tangled in the dog’s fur. If you do, your dog may get hurt and learn that playing shy is a painful, scary experience. This will hurt your chances of getting the dog to learn the trick.

, If you do not want to stick something sticky, loop a kerchief over the dog’s eyes and tie it beneath the dog’s jaw. Do not tie the kerchief too tight. Ensure you do not cover the dog’s nostrils. You should be able to fit your pinkie finger between the kerchief and the dog’s body.


Instead of a kerchief, you could also use a loose elastic headband.

, With the sticky object stuck to its forehead or the kerchief over its eyes, your dog will be a bit irritated and try to remove the object. Before giving it a chance to do so, hold its paws out in front of it for a few seconds, then cue your dog to action with your phrase of choice (“Play shy!” or some alternative). Release its paws and allow it to remove the foreign object. When the dog learns to associate your command with its action and subsequent reward, you have properly conditioned it.


Once conditioned, you can take away the kerchief, sticker, or other training object you employed to encourage the dog to place its paws over its eyes. If the dog cannot perform the trick without the object which inspires it to reach across its face with its paw (the lure), you will need to continue practicing until the dog understands the trick. Continue to reward the dog with either a treat or verbal praise.
If your dog is particularly laid back, it may not remove the lure of its own accord, and you may need to move the dog’s paws to its forehead for it. Take one of its paws in your hand and intone your cue phrase (“Play shy!” or some alternative) before gently bringing its paw up to a point on or just below its eyes. Hold it there for a few seconds, then release, administering a treat or verbal praise.
Your dog might react in a wiping motion rather than covering its face and holding the position. If this happens, take each of your dog’s paws in your hands gently and fold them.

Use only the visual cue.,
Practice the trick in different locations.,
Be patient with your dog until he masters the trick.",How to Teach Your Dog to Play Dead on Command," Playing dead involves your dog lying down. Before he can learn this trick, he should be comfortable with the command to lie down., Preferably, this area should also be quiet so that your dog does not become easily distracted., If your dog does not already know this command, teach him by holding a treat high in the air with your hand. As he is looking up at the treat, push on his back end until he sits; firmly say the word 'sit' as you are doing this.Once he is seated, reward him with the treat by bringing the treat to him instead of allowing him to jump up to get the treat. Firmly tell him 'No' if he jumps up.Practice this several times a day for few days until he can sit without you pushing on his back end. Each practice session should last about 10-15 minutes.Continue to give him treats as positive reinforcement each time that he sits.

, Hold a treat in front of his nose, but do not allow him to eat it. Instead, slowly move the treat down to the ground while still holding it in front of his nose.Say the verbal cue 'down' as you are moving the treat to the ground so that your dog associates the verbal cue with the action of lying down.Your dog should be lying down by the time you move the treat down to the ground.If he gets back up, continue practicing until he lies down each time you move the treat down to the ground.Reward with him a treat when he lies down without quickly getting back up., Hold your hand in front of your dog’s nose as if you had the treat, but do not have a treat in your hand.Use the same hand motion as if you had the treat to get your dog to lie down. Once again, reward him with a treat when he reliably lies down without quickly getting back up., You will need to practice this command with your dog several times a day for at least a few days.Each practice session should last about 10-15 minutes.
If you want to challenge your dog, you can gradually decrease the visual cue until he learns how to respond to only your verbal cue to lie down., If your dog does not know how to stay, it will be challenging to teach him how to play dead. Make sure that he is comfortable staying in a certain position before teaching him the trick., Areas such as his bed or a comfortable mat would be good choices. You could also choose a grassy area outside., Teaching your dog to stay from the ‘sit’ or ‘stand’ positions will help him get ready for learning how to play dead. , If your dog begins to move towards you before that amount of time has passed, then start over again. Once your dog can stay for 1-2 seconds, reward him with a treat.After you give him his treat, he can move towards you, since he has successfully stayed in place.

, Increase the amount of time in small increments until he can stay in the same place for at least 10 seconds.Increments of 1-2 seconds will help your dog stay for longer periods of time.
Give your dog a treat each time that he can stay for a few extra seconds.

, When he is in the position in which you want him to stay, say the word ‘stay’ and hold your hand up like a stop sign.It will probably take a few days for your dog to associate these cues with staying, so be patient with him.
Reward him with a treat when he successfully and consistently follows these cues.

, Although you can practice having him stay when he can’t see you,he will need to be able to see you when you teach him how to play dead.


You can increase your distance from him where he can still see you, such as to his right or left.

, Your dog may prefer to lean to one side or the other when he’s down, so make a mental note of which side he prefers.Command him to stay seated or standing, and then command him to lie down.
As you practice the trick, always have him lay down on the floor from the side that he leans on; he’ll probably prefer to do this anyway.

, Do not use a verbal cue for this; use your hands, some treats, and a clicker. Be mindful that this step will probably take some coaxing, so be patient with your dog as he learns how to follow your guidance to lie on his side.


You can get him to lie on his side by gently pushing him with both hands from the down position. Once he is lying down, reward him with some positive reinforcement (eg, verbal praise, belly rub, treat).You can also lure him with food to get him to lie down. To do this, hold a treat in front of his nose. Then, move the treat back to his shoulders (his left shoulder if he’s leaning to the right, or his right shoulder if he’s leaning to the left). As he turns his head to get to the treat, he will eventually lie down on his side. Use your clicker and other positive reinforcement when he lies down so that he knows he did the right thing., The better your dog is able to move fluidly from one position to the other, the closer he will be to mastering how to play dead.


Use your clicker and give him a treat when he moves from sitting/standing to the down position, and again when he moves from the down position to lying on his side., You will know when your dog is ready for the verbal cue when he automatically lies down on his side when he sees that you have a treat or when you lure him with food.You can use whichever verbal cue that you are comfortable with. ‘BANG!’ is a verbal cue that is commonly used for this trick.
Be consistent with whichever verbal cue you use. You do not want to confuse your dog by using different verbal cues for the same command., At this stage of teaching your down to play dead, your goal is to get your dog to be able to play dead just by responding to your verbal cue, rather than having to be lured by food as well.It may take some time before your dog can respond without the lure of food, so just be patient with him.

, A common visual cue to use for this trick is the shape of a pistol. Your dog will not immediately understand what the visual cue is, so it will be helpful to pair it with the verbal cue that you have chosen for this trick.There are a couple of ways that you can make a pistol signal: the thumb and index finger of one hand, the thumb and index and middle fingers of one hand, or the thumb and index finger of both hands placed together. For the last option, your other fingers would be intertwined.
Give your dog the visual cue at the same time that you give your verbal cue.Alternatively, you can use the visual cue after the verbal cue. If you try it this way, use the visual cue before your dog responds to the verbal cue. If your dog responds to the verbal cue before you have the chance to use the visual cue, and continues to do so after repeated attempts, you can either stop using the visual cue at all or use it at the same time as the verbal cue.Practice using both the verbal and visual cues together until your dog demonstrates that he can play dead using these cues together.

, Ultimately, you want your dog to play dead by responding to just your visual cue. Even after your dog understands what the visual cue is, it will take extra time for him to be able to respond to it without any verbal cues, commands, or the lure of food.Gradually use the visual cue by itself more frequently, and use the verbal cue and other commands less frequently.
Reward him with a treat each time that he performs the trick with just the visual cue.

, The fact that your dog has mastered the trick in one location does not mean that he’ll automatically be able to do it in other locations or situations. Practicing the trick in different areas, or around different people, will allow your dog to become even better at playing dead.Other locations include different rooms of the house, a dog park, or in front of a crowd of people. , He may learn this in a few days, or it may take him a few weeks. Whatever his pace is, reward him generously for his progress."

This helps for 2 reasons: It prevents the dog from crawling under, and It helps build confidence. It will also prevent your dog from tripping over the pole. If you can, place a barricade on either side of the jump so your dog will not try to go around. Some good temporary jumps can be made out of simple household items like boxes, piece of wood, and small furniture.

, This will help you guide your dog over the jump, because beginners might be confused. Make sure the lead is reasonably loose.

,,, Step over the jump as your dog will hopefully do the same. When your dog is jumping, give a voice command. You can also use a clicker as the dog jumps over the hurdle.

, Pet your dog, praise it, and occasionally give a treat.

, If your dog is tired, let her rest before trying again. Dogs tend to focus better when they aren't tired and hungry.

, Do not push your dog too hard. Hard work pays off in the long run, but too much pressure will not create any progress.

Set up a box or row of boxes somewhere in the yard or garden.,
Choose a toy or a treat to entice the dog.,
Walk over the box jump with your dog.,
Run or jog over the box jump with your dog.,
Settle yourself on one side of the jump.,
Use the word ""jump"" so that he associates the command with the action.,
Repeat until you are certain he knows what to do.",How to Teach Your Dog to Jump4," The boxes should be of a good height for your dog to leap over.


The more enclosed the area, the better. That way your dog cannot circumvent the jump but must go over it to reach you.

, If you do choose the toy, have treats as a reward.

, This will familiarize him with going over the box.

, Make it fun, so that he wants to come with you.

, He must be on the opposite side. Use the toy or treat to entice the dog to come to you, using the jump.

,


If your dog jumps, reward him with a treat and praise.
If your dog walks around the jump, do not reward him but make him repeat the action until he jumps.

,


When your dog is more familiar with jumping, you can remain alongside the dog and toss the toy over the jump and ask him to jump to get the toy.
Over time, you can increase the difficulty of the height or shape of the jumps, to give him a bit of variety.

Obtain a clicker and use it to train your dog.,
Set a target for your dog’s movement.,
Move the target.,
Continue elevating the target.,
Bring the target closer to the dog’s snout.,
Condition your dog to play shy.",How to Teach Your Dog to Play Shy2," A clicker is a small noise-making device which emits a sharp cracking sound when squeezed. These are available at your local pet store or online. When your dog performs a positive action, you should squeeze the clicker, then immediately administer a dog treat and/or fulsome praise.It’s alright if teaching your dog to play shy is the first trick it will learn with the clicker. However, if he or she has been trained with the clicker before in more basic tricks such as sit, play dead, or lie down, your dog will learn to play shy through clicker training much faster.

, A target, in dog training, is the place or position you want the dog to be in. Targets will evolve in difficulty for the dog as the training process proceeds. A starting target for training a dog to play shy could be a a ruler or short stick.


Lay the stick on the floor about 10 centimeters in front of the dog.
Beckon the dog forward with a treat. When the dog sets his or her paw on the stick, squeeze your clicker and administer the treat. Repeat seven to ten times, alternately administering either a dog treat, or praise (“Good boy/girl!”)

, Instead of clicking and rewarding your dog when it steps on the stick, life the stick with your hand about halfway up the dog’s body. Hold it close enough that the dog does not need to move forward to touch the target, but can simply reach its paw out to make contact with it.


If your dog is 30 centimeters tall, hold the ruler or stick in front of him or her at a height of approximately 15 centimeters. When your dog places its paw on the target, squeeze the clicker and administer either a dog treat or generous verbal praise.
Your dog should recognize that stepping on the target stick is still the goal even though it has changed position. However, you may need to demonstrate to your dog how to step on the stick. Take its paw in your hand and place it on the stick directly one or two times, then click your clicker and administer a treat when after it has held the position for two or three seconds.

, Bring the target stick further up the dog’s body. If your dog is 30 centimeters tall and you moved the stick from the ground to a point 15 centimeters up, after seven to ten successful attempts by the dog to place its paw on the stick, move it up to 17 centimeters. Just as before, each time the dog places its paw on the target, squeeze your clicker and administer a treat to the dog. Seven to ten successful attempts later, raise the target up to 19 or 20 centimeters.


As you elevate the target, shorten it as well. Instead of a ruler or stick, use a straw. After each elevation cut it a bit shorter.

, As you elevate and shorten the target, bring it closer to your dog’s snout, aiming for an area just below its eyes. Once you bring the target object close enough to make contact with the dog’s snout, deploy your cue phrase (“Play shy” or some variation) just before you raise it to the point near your dog's eye. Your dog should, in the final stage, be raising his or her paw to a point where he or she covers or touches this point near the eye. Repeat seven to ten times.

, When the dog learns to associate your command to play shy with its action and subsequent reward, you have properly conditioned it. Once conditioned, you can take away the target and practice playing shy with only the clicker and dog treats. After a week or so, begin to phase out the clicker as well. Use it every three out of four times instead of every time, then every one of two times after another week or so.


If the dog cannot perform the trick without the target object or clicker, you may need to go back to an earlier stage of training to reinforce the steps you taught your dog initially. Keep practicing until the dog understands how to play shy.

"
"
Be consistent in your processes.,
Reward the dog promptly.,
Be the boss while training.,
Train your dog everywhere.,
Be patient and set realistic expectations.,
Keep practicing.",How to Teach Your Dog to Play Shy3," This means you should try to intone the cue words at the same volume and with the same tone of voice every time you administer the command. Dogs understand both emotional cues and the meanings of the words.When you teach the dog to be shy, you must utilize the word in the same way every time.


Consistency also means giving the dog a reward at the same time every time it obeys. When training, you should always provide a reward immediately after the dog has accomplished its trick. Let the dog hold the covering position for the same length of time. In the future, the dog will remember how long it is expected to hold the covered position based on the amount of time it did so before.

, When training your dog, you must reward it immediately when it behaves in conformity with your wishes. When it plays shy, exclaim “Good boy/girl!” in an enthusiastic, friendly tone, and give it a doggie treat.Creating the association between playing shy with receiving a reward will encourage the dog to act obediently.


Treats are a good reward, but need not be the only one. Dogs also respond positively to opportunities to play fetch, or go for a car ride or walk.
Do not hold treats in your hand while training. The dog will learn that unless the treat bag is present, it need not comply with your commands.

, Dogs can read body language and posture. Let your dog know you are serious about his or her training by assuming a position of power.Stand up straight in front of your dog with your shoulders back when training.
Keep your hands out of your pockets. Your dog may wrongly (or rightly) believe that you have treats in your pockets, and that will become “the” position he or she identifies with playing shy.

, If you limit training to only one space or room of the house, your dog will think playing shy is something to be done only in that one room.Train your dog to play shy in the bedroom, the living room, the basement, and the backyard.

, Some dogs learn faster than others. Think about how quickly your dog was able to learn to sit, play dead, and roll over. Average those learning times to assess how long it might take for him or her to learn to play shy. Continue to train your dog to play shy and it will learn in time. Do not become frustrated or angry at your dog if he or she is not learning at the pace you desire.Take notes at the end of each session and look for small signs of improvement over the long term. Always maintain a positive attitude and celebrate your dog’s progress.
Relax and take a few deep breaths if you feel you are becoming frustrated or disappointed in your dog’s progress.
If either you or your dog are growing weary of the training exercise, end it and try again later.

, Train your dog constantly. Training sessions should occur several times each day at random times. Do not train your dog for periods which are too long or too short.Each dog’s attention span varies. Pay attention to your dog’s level of interest; if he or she starts to wander away, lies down, or barks, it may be time to end the practice session and pick it up again later.

Move onto more complex commands.,
Enroll in classes or shows.,
Enroll in tests and trials.",How to Teach Your Dog to Herd," Even non-herding breeds can easily be taught to sit, come, lie down, and heel whether or not you continue their training. Unless your dog knows how to be obedient off-leash and listen to you despite distractions, training to herd sheep will be difficult, if not impossible.;
, A dog with solid herding instincts will display this aptitude early on. Look for your dog moving around you or other animals in a circular motion. If your dog does not display early signs of these instincts, you may not be able to train it to herd., If you are serious about dog herding, you should consider training yourself or the dog sooner rather than later. The earlier in your dog’s life you use the most up-to-date training techniques, the better the result. It is possible to teach your dog more advanced commands without professional help, but only the most instinctive herders will pick it up easily., As soon as you take your dog home, start getting it to retrieve balls or toys for you. As soon as you can, teach it to get the toy only at your command. This will develop its instincts for chasing as well as basic obedience., It is important that your dog learn verbal commands for left and right. Use a leash and walk your dog through the motions. Combine this with repetitive verbal commands so your dog learns the association.Teach your dog to run right, or clockwise, when you say “come bye” or “bye” for short.The command for left, or counterclockwise, is “away to me” or “’way” for short.Get your dog used to stopping and lying down when you say “wait,” “lie down,” “sit,” or a similar word.

, You don’t want your dog’s first encounter with livestock on show day. Get it used to obeying your commands around sheep and other animals. Contact local dog herding associations to find out where you can take your dog to meet livestock., See if you can buy or get access to a lamb or duck for your dog to practice herding. Put them in a small kennel and practice the basic commands “come bye” and “away to me.” Now is a good time to practice your “lie down” command. Get your dog used to obeying your basic commands., It should be clear if your dog has the right instincts for advanced herding. Its tail should go down when it is around the flock, meaning that it is thinking. It should naturally run circles around the livestock and respond to your commands. You can only take this interest as far as your dog will let you, so respect natural limits., Once your dog is obedient to you, acclimated to livestock, and knows basic commands, teach them useful maneuvers. Getting your dog to run around the herd is useful, but the ability to move it from place to place is the next step. Work toward a practical application of herding commands.


Outrun: your dog will run past the flock and stop them from moving away from you. This is important to getting the flock under control.
The lift: your dog has to introduce itself to the flock. Working on this move will get the flock to respect your dog and follow its directions.
The fetch: in this move, your dog will work the flock back to you. This has an important applicability for working dogs.

, The basics for herding will only get you so far. If you want to take this hobby further and compete in shows, you need to teach your dog more complex commands. There are a host of herding commands that you may need to know on show day. Teaching them to your dog may require a little more expertise than you have been able to pick up thus far.


If your dog displays little enthusiasm for the classes, it may not be well-suited for herding. You should always pay attention to the wants and needs of your dog., When it is time, sign you and your dog up for a show. The excitement of having lots of dogs, people, and new scents and sounds will be confusing for your dog at first. You will probably have to compete in a few shows before your dog scores some wins."

Identify their happy body language.,
Look for signs of anxiety.,
Ease their anxiety.,
Watch out for defensive postures.,
Create a safe space for your dog.",How to Get Along with Your Dog1," Learning how to identify your dog’s body language when they are happy will let you know when they want your attention and to play. Body language will play an important role in your relationship with your dog, and being able to accurately read your dog’s responses will help you to get along with each other. Here are some common body language cues that your dog is happy:Relaxed body position
Enthusiastic tail wagging
Tail thumping the floor
Play bow where their rear end is up in the air with their tail wagging while their front end is down on the ground.;
, An anxious dog indicates that they feel uncomfortable in a given situation and are stressed. When your dog is anxious, you should try to address the cause of their anxiety. Here are some common signs of anxiety in dogs:Suddenly scratching and biting at their paws or another body part
Yawning when they are not tired
Flicking their tongue or quickly licking their lips with just the tip of their tongue
One paw raised
Half moon eye with the whites of their eye showing around the rim or cornersThis is a sign of severe stress. It may indicate your dog is about to bite out of fear.



, When your dog is anxious, it is usually due to their environment or some external cause. Your dog may feel uncomfortable in a situation because they are scared, feel defensive, or just want to be left alone. The best way to ease a dog’s anxiety is to give them space. An anxious dog needs space to calm down and to relieve their stress. You can try speaking to them in a calm and soothing voice, but let them have some alone time.If you are able to, try to take the dog out of the stressful situation into a calmer environment.

, When dogs are defensive, or show avoidance behaviors, they want to remove themselves from a situation and may perceive something as a threat. Your dog may show these behaviors at a dog park and indicate that they are afraid or anxious to be around these other dogs.Teeth-baring
Hair standing up on their back
Deep growls
Stiff legged gait
Prolonged stare

, Dogs need areas where they feel safe, secure and comfortable. This might be their crate, bed, or an old chair where they like to spend their time. It is a place where they can go and relax, sleep, or play with a toy. Let them leave their toys there and treat it as a part of their territory. This gives your dog a space where they can go when they’re feeling stressed, tired, or just want a break from the action."

Think about your motivations.,
Decide on a breed.,
Consider your dog’s size and age.,
Weigh choosing a male or female.,
Consider your dog’s personality.,
Choose to adopt or purchase the dog from a breeder.",How to Get a Companion Dog for an Existing Dog1," Before you decide to add to your animal family, take a few moments to weigh the reasons behind your decision. You’ll want to make sure that your dog is actually indicating that it wants a companion, perhaps by whining or acting lonely. And, remember that adage that more dogs equal more work.It is important to note that adopting a new dog will likely only worsen any behavioral issues, such as barking, that your current dog possesses. Don’t expect a new dog to be a bad behavior cure.If you are considering getting a dog to replace one that has passed away, make sure to take your time. Dogs experience a grieving process as well and getting another dog too quickly could disrupt this.;
, Take your dog to a play group or pet park and watch the interactions. See what types of dogs your pet gravitates toward in a positive way. What breeds of dogs does your dog seem to avoid or clash with? You could also observe interactions while attending an obedience class you’re your dog. Make sure that you consider both pure and mixed breeds.For example, it is possible that your dog seems to enjoy playing with terriers, but is a bit afraid when encountering retrievers or shepherds.
Make sure to consider the grooming and unique care needs of your new potential pet. If you already have a high maintenance dog, such as a poodle, you may want one requiring less care. Or, perhaps you plan to tote both dogs to appointments at once to save time., A puppy’s jumping and energy may be too much for an older dog to handle. However, an older dog may be more set in its ways and less likely to defer to your current dog. Likewise, a teacup or toy dog could be injured by an excitable large dog. Dogs who are close in size generally make the best play companions.Again, the best bet here is to watch your dog in a natural play environment to see who it naturally chooses for companionship.
It may seem like a good idea to make your older dog act as a babysitter for a younger puppy, but this can backfire. Your current dog might exhibit little patience with the pup and could even hurt it. Or, the puppy could run wild and develop bad behaviors, such as biting. Make sure to plan a training regimen if you consider a puppy., Two dogs of the opposite sex are generally more likely to get along, as opposed to two of the same sex. And, a male-male pairing will likely be more peaceful than a female-female pairing. Again, you will want to watch your dog to see how they interact with the different sexes.Make sure to get your dogs spayed or neutered. Not only does this help to control the pet population, it also often leads to better behavior.

, All dogs have different traits and needs/wants. You’ll want to make sure that your dog is friendly, at a minimum, to other dogs. You’ll also want to think about whether or not your dog tries to establish dominance around other animals, or is content to be led. You want to find a companion dog that can bring out the best in your dog’s personality.If your current dog’s behavior is a bit unruly, you may want to complete an obedience course prior to bringing in another dog., Once you’ve narrowed down your preferences a bit, you’ll want to contact your local animal shelter to discuss the adoption process. This, or reaching out to an online adoption website (such as Petfinder), is generally the best way to locate a mixed breed dog. If you want a pure bred dog, you’ll want to search for breeders in your area.


You can go to the American Kennel Club (AKC) website to get more information regarding breeders operating in your area.
Whether you choose a breeder or adoption, try not to visit the facility with your dog during the first go-round. This can stress out your dog and lead to a bad reaction.If you are looking for a puppy, you can find one via a breeder or adoption. If you are interested in a more mature dog, adoption is probably your best bet. You can search online for dog rescue groups in your area as well.

Be around for your dog.,

Take your dog everywhere you go.,
Notice and praise the good that your dog does.,
Give your dog plenty of treats as a reward for things done well.,
Ensure that your dog has plenty of mental stimulation as well as exercise.,
Do things with your dog.,
Forgive your dog.,
Notice how your emotions are reflected in your dog.,
Hug your dog.",How to Encourage Your Dog to Enjoy Being Around You," If your dog is aware that you are willing to spend time with it every day, then your dog is more likely to reciprocate with shows of affection, joy and love. If your dog feels neglected, it may wander off and find other things to do with its time.;
, This means speaking in an even tone, not yelling at the dog and saying things to your dog kindly.

, Your dog will appreciate being part of your daily life and seeing new people and places as you go out and about.

, This will encourage more of the good behavior from your dog and helps to cement the bond between both of you. This is known as ""positive reinforcement"" and it's a much more fruitful way to train and interact with dogs than a punishment focus.

, Dogs like treats more than their food. However, don't give too many; keep it in moderation.

, Dogs need enrichment and thrive on challenges as much as humans enjoy doing puzzles and challenging one another to a battle of wits. Help your dog use its grey matter by giving it challenging things to do, such as:


Obedience training
Hiding food inside a container, making the dog search for it and get it out itself
Hide treats around your apartment, house or yard, so that your dog has to go hunting for them

Teach your dog tricks.

, Be active together and stay healthy together. Your dog will appreciate the fact that you are both doing something and neither of you will notice the effort involved.


If you like running or jogging, take your dog along with you.
Go swimming together.
Take your dog down to the beach and run on the sand together.
Go for a trail hike with your dog.

, If you are angry after a dog does something you don't like, your dog will be upset. Moreover, dogs cannot relate being told off after an event as they live in the present, not the past;for example, rubbing a dog's nose in its poo an hour after it does it in the wrong place tells your dog that you're mean and odd, not that the dog did something wrong. Instead, practice positive reinforcement to get the behaviors you do want from your dog, along with reassessing how your behavior might be contributing to your dog's misbehavior. For example, if the dog cannot get outside to do its toilet, whose fault is that?

, Your dog picks up on how you are feeling and will respond according to its own personality. It's up to you as the dog's companion to work out your own dog's personality and to interact so as to bring out the best in your dog. Be wary of how your own emotions impact your dog, and ease off displaying any emotions that might unsettle, upset or anger it, in much the same way as you take care to respect the needs and emotions of others in your family or household. Your dog is family too.

, Give your dog hugs now and then, to say ""I love you"". Be loving, as your dog will pick up on the loving vibes.

Let your dog see you while you feed them.,
Use positive reinforcement and praise.,
Try to see things from your dog’s perspective.,
Address behavioral issues with training.",How to Get Along with Your Dog2," Exercise is an important part of your dog’s routine and is necessary to keep them happy and healthy.Exercising together will help you strengthen your relationship with your dog and to spend time together. Switch up your regular exercise routine and go for long walks, take them hiking, or go swimming at a dog-friendly beach or lake. Your dog will appreciate spending time with you and will have fun., Try playing a variety of different games with your dog. This is a great way for you and your dog to bond, plus it’s a good way for the two of you to get along. Try games like tug of war, hide and seek, and fetch. Whenever you find a game that your dog really enjoys, you can stick with it and look for ways to keep the game fun. For instance, if your dog loves fetch you can use different types of balls or throw multiple balls at one time. This helps your dog associate you with fun and happiness.Games have the added bonus of giving your dog some of the exercise they need to be healthy.

, The relationship between you and your dog needs to be built on mutual trust and affection, and your dog needs to recognize that you’re still the boss. Set rules for your dog and be consistent when you enforce them. Your dog will become confused when you yell at the to get off the couch one day and then let them snuggle up to you on the couch the next day. Be consistent with the rules that you set, whatever they are, and make sure the dog respects these healthy boundaries.A healthy relationship with your dog requires discipline and reinforcement. Use positive reinforcement, like praise or treats, to reinforce good behaviors that you want your dog to follow.

, Rather than just dumping their dog food in a bowl and walking away, let your dog watch as you portion out their food and give it to them. Not only is this a good way to reinforce training commands like sit and stay, this shows your dog that you are in charge.Have your dog sit and watch you while you prepare their food so they form a strong positive association between you and their food.

, You should use positive reinforcement and praise to encourage your dog's good behaviors and to let them know that you appreciate their efforts. When they sit on command, tell them ""good job,"" or ""good boy,"" or you can give them a small treat. Even though your dog doesn't understand the exact words, they respond to your tone of voice and know that these phrases mean that you're pleased with them.You can incorporate positive reinforcement during training and in your everyday relationship with your dog.

, Your dog does not have human emotions and motives. When your dog displays inappropriate behavior, try to consider the situation as if you were a dog. Thinking of things from this perspective can help you look objectively at the situation and identify things that you can change to improve your relationship.

For example, if your dog peed inside, you should ask yourself if you were home on time to let your dog out. Your dog did not pee on the rug because they are mad at you. In the future, make sure that your dog is able to use the bathroom every several hours.
If your dog raided the garbage can, it is not necessarily because they are hungry. If you throw something tasty in the garbage can, take the garbage out right away so that your dog isn’t tempted. Place a weight in the bottom of the can, buy a can with a locking lid, or both.

, It's not uncommon for dogs to have some sort of behavioral problem, like barking incessantly, jumping up on people, or being possessive over food and objects. These behavioral issues can put a damper on your relationship with your dog, and as an owner, it's up to you to address them through training.When you train your dog to stop barking or ease their separation anxiety you will improve your relationship. Dog behavioral problems often come out of a lack of structure, routine, and training.


Positive reinforcement will reward your dog for the behaviors that you do want, and will discourage dogs from continuing negative behaviors. Negative reinforcement, like yelling or becoming aggressive with your dog, will not solve the issue.
Not all behavioral issues can be corrected at home. You may want to contact a dog trainer who specializes in these issues if the issue is not being resolved through training.

Spend time with your dog.,
Give them special treats.,
Learn your dog’s likes and dislikes.,
Be physically affectionate.",How to Get Along with Your Dog3," Your relationship with your dog will be strengthened when you spend more time together.Spend quality time with your dog where you are interacting one on one, like when you are playing a game or going on a walk. Give them your full attention during this time and show them that you are involved in whatever they are doing.


This is especially important if you spend the majority of your day away from your dog. Quality time becomes very important when you see less of each other throughout the day, so make it a priority.

, Every now and then, a special treat can brighten your dog’s day. It shows them that you love them and that they’ve pleased you. You can give out a special treat after a particularly good day together, when you and your dog have gotten along well.


Make sure you give them a treat that is safe for dogs. It is generally best to avoid giving dogs human food, since it contains more calories than they need. You could give them a rawhide bone, a special dog treat, or a few of their favorite treats.

, When you know what your dog likes, you can incorporate some of these things into your everyday life with each other and help to avoid the things they don’t like. For instance, if you know that your dog has a few favorite toys, likes scratches on the head, and going for long walks when it’s sunny, you can make it a point to do these things. This also demonstrates that you respect your dog and your relationship.


When you know what your dog doesn’t like, like loud noises or being hugged, you can avoid these things. Your dog will come to realize that you are trying to make them happy and will love you for it., There’s evidence that physical contact between you and your dog releases hormones in both of your brains that make both of you feel happy and safe.This contact could come from grooming, playing, petting, and scratching. Physical affection between you and your dog shows that you trust one another and that you care for each other.

Be patient.,
Talk with the dog’s owner or breeder.,
Choose a healthy dog.,
Observe the dog interacting with people and other dogs.,
Try an overnight stay.",How to Get a Companion Dog for an Existing Dog2," It’s highly unlikely that you will find a good match immediately after you start looking. Instead, be prepared to wait until you locate the best possible companion dog for your family. Keep up the search by checking in regularly with your adoption contacts. Use this time to keep observing your dog to learn more about what they might like.If you choose to go with a puppy from a breeder, you may also have to get past the wait list and the holding period of 9-12 weeks before a puppy can be released.

, Whether you go through a breeder or rescue organization, make sure to ask about the dog’s history, if it’s available. Does it have a record of good interactions with other dogs? Does it come from a situation of abuse? Is there information available about the parents?

, To protect your current dog and avoid costly vet bills, you’ll want to find out as much as you can about the health status of your adoptee. Some illnesses, such as parvo, can pass from dog to dog. And, some puppies can be so sick that they pass away shortly after adoption, only causing more heartache.


Look for dogs with clear eyes, clean noses and eyes, unobstructed breathing, and consistent outward behaviors. Ask to see medical records, if they are available.
Getting another dog means that there is twice the possibility of some sort of medical issue. Make sure that you have some funds set aside in case something happens to your new dog., Even if you have to sit outside the kennel at an adoption facility, try to get some sense about how your potential adoptee has been socialized. Are they friendly overall or shy just at first? You want a dog that is not crippled by shyness, as that can turn into aggressiveness.


If you feel safe, place your hand down to see how the dog reacts. The dog should be cautious, but curious. Offering a treat will make your first meeting even more positive.

, Most rescue organizations and breeders will allow you to go on a trial run with your new dog. Bring the dog home and follow the introduction procedures outlined below. This brief visit, whether it be a few days or longer, will allow to see how this dog fits into your home life and the life or your current dog."

Go to a neutral location.,
Proceed slowly and cautiously.,
Watch for any signs of aggression.,
Keep them separated when unsupervised.,
Give positive attention to both dogs.",How to Get a Companion Dog for an Existing Dog3," You can introduce the two dogs in your home, or even in your backyard, but a totally ‘new’ spot, such as a park, is ideal. This means that neither animal will feel protective or defensive over the space. You could also contact a local dog trainer and ask for their assistance, and the use of their facility, for a few hours., Get two handlers, one for each dog, and have them hold the dogs leashed a good distance away from one another. The two handlers should slowly walk forward, pausing if they sense their dog is tensing up. This whole process should go slowly and methodically, which will help to calm the dogs as well., Pause and pull the dogs back a bit (gently) if there are any signs of distress or agitation, such as growling or lunging. Ideally, the dogs will show a degree of curiosity and will keep their tails wagging the entire time., After the initial introductions are concluded, you can let both dogs off their leases if there are no signs of agitation. They will likely continue to sniff each other and play. However, when you move indoors it is a good idea to separate the dogs if you are not in the room and during meal times as well.You can separate the dogs by using baby gates, closing certain doors, or even crating both of them for periods of time.

, It is important to provide visible and physical affection to both dogs throughout the introductory process and beyond. Give treats to them together. Buy toys for them separately and for them to play with together. Make sure that there are plenty of toys and treats, so that the dogs will not feel the need to compete."

When the dog lowers his or her head fast enough, use a command.,
Say ""Christmas"" and see if the dog ducks.,
Stand further away from your dog when saying the command.",How to Teach Your Dog to Duck," If you haven't already, target and clicker train your dog. The target can be a certain stick or your finger, palm or fist. Let the dog sniff at the target, and click when it does. Do this a few times to warm up.;
, Move the target down right under the dog's head. Click when the dog sniffs at the target. Repeat this step four times.

, Click when the dog lowers its head to sniff at the target. Repeat this step four times.

,, Click when the dog moves its head down when the target is not there. Repeat this until the dog understands exactly how to do this.

, Only click when the dog lowers his or her head as fast as you want him or her to do. This can take time.

, The command can be ""duck"" or anything else you want to call it. When you see the dog is about to duck, say ""duck"" and click if the dog ducks. Repeat this many times.

, If it does, do not click. Just wait for a few seconds, then say ""duck"". If the dog ducks, click and reward. Test your dog by sometimes saying a random word, and sometimes saying the command. Only click when the dog ducks on command.

, The dog should be able to do the trick even when you are in different positions. Also sit down, then have your arms up in the air, etc.

Teach your dog to spin.,
Try the stationary leg weave trick with your dog.,
Advance to the forward leg weave trick.,
Have your dog circle around you.,
Get your dog to hop up.,
Make your dog your dance partner.",How to Teach Your Dog to Dance1," You can teach your dog to spin in both a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction. However, make sure you use different verbal commands for each direction so your dog doesn’t get confused. For example, use the command SPIN to turn clockwise and the command TWIRL to turn counter-clockwise. As with all tricks, make sure to have some sort of food motivation for your dog while he’s in training. The best option is to have some of his kibble available as a treat when he performs the moves correctly. To teach your dog to spin, use the following steps:Place a treat in your hand and use your hand and the treat to lure your dog to move in a full circle (or spin).
If your dog performs the spin correctly, reward him with the treat.
It is also helpful to use verbal praise (like the word YES or GOOD) to indicate to your dog that he’s done something properly and a treat is coming. This verbal praise bridges the time between your dog performing the trick correctly and your dog receiving his treat.
When training your dog to move in a clockwise circle, try to use your right hand to hold the treat. And when training your dog to move in a counter-clockwise circle, try to use your left hand to hold the treat.
Once your dog has learned the basics of the spin, try getting him to spin multiple times before providing the treat.
You can also remove the treat from your hand and simply use the motion of your hand to command your dog to move in a circle.
Finally, start to add the verbal command to the trick. If spinning clockwise, start saying the word SPIN (as an example) when your dog is spinning. And use the command TWIRL when your dog is spinning in a counter-clockwise direction.;
, The stationary leg weave is a neat trick that isn’t difficult to teach but looks more complicated to people watching. Basically, you need to stand still, with your legs slightly apart and have your dog weave in and out of your legs. It’s referred to as the “stationary” leg weave because you just need to stand in one place. There’s no need for you to move around for this trick, although you may need to bend your legs every so often to help you dog walk through your legs. Use the following steps to teach your dog the stationary leg weave:Start with your dog in front of you while standing with your legs slightly apart (enough for your dog to fit through). Make sure you have your dog’s attention.
Hold your dog’s treat in your right hand and your dog’s collar in your left hand.
Place your right hand behind you, near your right leg and near the opening of your legs. You want your dog to be able to see or smell the treat in your right hand.
Using your left hand on your dog’s collar, guide him through your legs towards your right hand with the treat.
Use your right hand to lure him through your legs and around the outside of your right leg.
When he performs this movement properly, say YES and give your dog his treat.
Repeat the same basic movements on your left side.
During practice, provide the treat at different spots in the weave movement. This helps to prevent your dog from assuming he only has to go to a certain place to receive the treat.
Once your dog has the handle of weaving through your legs on both sides, use your hands and the treat to lure him in a full figure eight around BOTH of your legs before you reward him.
Eventually you can get your dog to do this trick without using your hands. Instead, you can cue your dog using the movement of your legs. To do this, practice the trick while bending your right leg and leaning slightly to the right while he weaves around your right leg. Perform the same movements on your left side. Once your dog gets the hand of it, he’ll move through your legs when he sees you bend your leg and lean to the side.

, To start learning this trick, make sure you’ve already taught your dog the stationary leg weave. While performing the stationary leg weave, move your leg forward as if you were going to take a step (but don’t actually take a step). This will get your dog use to your new movement for the leg weave. Once your dog is able to do the stationary leg weave properly, following these steps to teach your dog the forward leg weave:Start with your dog standing to your left side, facing forward. If you need to hold his collar to get him into this position, it’s okay.
Take a step forward with your right leg and lure your dog through your legs, towards your right side, with a treat and your hand.
Once you dog has moved through your legs and is on your right side, say YES and give your dog his treat. The word YES works as verbal praise to let your dog know a treat is coming and he’s done something right.
Take a step forward with your left leg and lure your dog through your legs, towards your left side. Say YES and reward him when he’s completely the movement properly.
Continue practicing this trick, leg-by-leg, as you walk forward until your dog is comfortable with the trick.
Once your dog is able to move around your legs individually, have him one around both legs properly before rewarding him.
Slowly progress through the process by taking away the treat and using only your hands for direction. Then stop using even your hands and just use the movement of your legs to cue your dog to perform the trick.

, Training your dog circle around you is very similar to training your dog to spin. The only obvious difference is that you are the centre of the circle for this trick, whereas with spinning the centre of the circle is empty. You can train your dog to circle around your clockwise and counter-clockwise. If you use verbal commands for this trick, make sure to use different words for clockwise and counter-clockwise. For example, you could use RIGHT for clockwise and LEFT for counter-clockwise. This trick can also be performed with you standing, kneeling, or sitting, but you may want to start with only one position until your dog has the hang of the trick. Use the following steps to train your dog to circle around you:Start with your dog standing on your left side and with his attention focused on you.
Hold your dog’s treat in your right hand and use your hand (and the treat) to lure him to walk around your legs in a clockwise circle.
Because a circle can technically start and end anywhere, reward your dog at different locations around your legs so he doesn’t always assume one specific spot is the ‘end’ of the trick.
While your dog is still learning, it’s also important to keep your hand as close to your legs as possible. This will help your dog associate the treat with your legs.
Continuing practicing the circle movement while saying the verbal command. Also, practice with your dog going in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction.
Eventually your dog should be able to perform the trick without being lured by a treat, but by simply listening to your verbal command.

, Teaching your dog to hop up, or to stand on his back paws only, is not as hard as it seems, but does require a step-by-step approach so as not to confuse your dog. Throughout the trick, the important thing is to lure your dog upwards, onto his back paws, with a treat. Eventually, you’ll be able to remove the treat and replace it with a simple verbal command like UP. Use the following steps to help get your dog to hop up:Start with your dog sitting beside you, facing you, and make sure his full attention is on you.
Use one of your hands to hold a treat just above his head. Use your hand and the treat to lure him upwards.
The step-by-step approach is to first allow your dog to stand up with his front paws leaning against your leg. Once he’s in that position, you can give him verbal praise (YES) and give him the treat.
Once he’s perfected standing with his front paws on your leg, switch and have him put his front paws on your forearm.
Then, once he’s perfected both leaning against your leg and forearm, lure him to stand up without any support. This may be harder for some dogs than others. Some dogs may even be able to skip leaning against you and go directly to this step, but don’t be upset if it takes a while for your dog to get to this point.
As you work your way through this trick, start adding the verbal command — UP — when holding your hand above your dog.
Eventually you’ll be able to stop using your hand (and a treat) and just use the verbal command.

, Most dance tricks you do with your dog are done with you and your dog beside each other. You may be moving together, in time to the music, but you’re not actually dancing hand-to-paw. There is a trick you can teach your dog that will put him a position to make it look like you two are really dancing with each other.Note, this trick will only work with a dog who is around the same height as you when standing on his hind legs.
Start by kneeling down at your dog’s level with one arm raised either to your side, or to the front of you.
Use your opposite hand to hold a treat above your outstretched arm. The purpose of the treat is to get your dog’s attention. Hold the treat high enough that he can’t reach it while sitting down.
Either on his own, or with some coaxing, get your dog to raise up on his hind feet and put his front paws on your outstretched arm.
Once your dog has his front paws on your arm, provide him with the reward.
You’ll want to repeat this trick several times in the kneeling position. You may also want to add a verbal command to the trick so you dog will still perform when you no longer have a treat.
Once your dog has the hang of this trick while your kneeling, practice the trick while you’re standing up.

Use a clicker rather than only treats.,
Use a little piece of paper and hold it in one hand.,
Do this exercise again and again.,
Now your dog is ready.,
Good job!,
Continue:


opening the door a little wider each time
making the distance between you (and your dog) and the door a little bigger each time
making the piece of paper a little smaller each time (cut it in half..)

,
Continue until:


your dog knows that he's supposed to really close the door, not just touch it
your dog knows exactly what you are talking about when you say ""door"" even if the door is far a way or not visible from is location
your dog closes the door without a piece of paper.

",How to Teach Your Dog to Close the Door," If you don't know what a clicker is or how it works do some research and think about purchasing a clicker, or just use a ""clicker word"", a word that you use every single time your dog does what he's supposed to do, before you give him a treat.;
, Get your dog to touch the paper (get him to touch it, don't make him touch it). As soon as he touches the paper with his nose (or paw) click or say a clicker word and then throw a treat on the floor for him right away. Don't feed the treat from your hand, otherwise your dog will get more interested in the delicious smelling hand than in the piece of paper.

, If your dog gets what you want him to do make him touch the paper a little more every time he does it. If he's already good at that wait until he uses his paw to touch it. If he does that be very happy and show him that he did a great job. So you basically want him to get used to touch the little piece of paper with his paw every time you want him to.

, If you used a post-it as a piece of paper, stick it on the door, a little below the height of your dog's nose. Have him touch the piece of paper with his paw again. You should be pretty close to the door yourself. Now you can start using the command ""door"" or whatever word you'd like to use. Say it while you're pointing at the paper. Don't forget to click or say a clicker word as soon as he touches it.

, This is the time when you should open your door a little and have your dog push it a little while touching the paper with his paw. Same process as you did before: Your dog knows exactly that he has to touch the paper with his paw now (when you say door and point at it), so this time wait with the clicking until your dog actually pushes the door a little.

Pay attention to time.,
Differentiate between rewards and bribes.,
Use alternative rewards.,

Watch for the behavior and reinforce it with a command.,
Find ways to get your dog to show his teeth.,
Start training the dog to smile on cue.,
Watch for signs of stress or aggression.,
Avoid aversive techniques.,
Engage in good leadership techniques.",How to Teach a Dog to Smile," Teaching a dog to smile is similar to teaching him any habit, so you'll need to know the basic tenets of dog training. Timing makes a huge difference when it comes to successfully training a dog.


A dog must be rewarded the instant he obeys a command. Many people reward their dogs with a small treat or positive verbal praise, such as ""Yes!"" or ""Good job!""Some people invest in a clicker, a small mechanical device that makes a clicking noise when a button is pushed. You can teach your dog to associate the clicker with positive feedback by clicking it shortly before rewarding your dog with treats or attention.;
, While treats as a reward can be great motivation for a dog, they begin to come off as bribes when used too often. This can result in the dog only engaging in behavior when he knows there's the possibility of food.


Tell your dog to ""smile."" Wait 2 or 3 seconds for her to obey this command and only give her the treat if she does. Do not show her you have food until she's already done the trick.High energy dogs, particularly young dogs, may not want to engage in training sessions with you. If you're using treats as a way to lure them into the living room when practice time rolls around, stop. This teaches your dog she only has to behave well if food is involved.

, Treats are many dog owners go-to, as they're a quick and easy way to reward a dog for positive behavior. You should mix up food-based rewards with other forms of positive feedback.


If you have a playful dog, allow him access to a favorite toy for a few minutes shortly after smiling.Rewards like walks or car rides can be given out after a long training session.Dogs are natural people pleasers and want to make their owners happy. You can also reward your dog with pets and praise from you., Dogs pick up on body language easily. While training, make sure to convey a sense of authority to your dog.


Always stand when giving a dog a command. If you're sitting your dog will learn to only respect you in that position.Keep your hands out of your pockets. The dog might assume you have treats for him there and will learn he only needs to follow orders if food is a possibility. This can also distract him from the task. Keep your hands in view at all times.Never hold a bag of treats or a toy or any other objects used as a reward while training. Your dog needs to learn to behave regardless of potential rewards.Move from room to room during training. Dogs might assume they only have to engage in the behavior in one area of the house. Ideally, your dog should perform whenever you ask and not just in the living room or bedroom., A dog showing their teeth and, in a sense, smiling is a difficult behavior to train. Unlike sitting or shaking, there's no way to convey to the dog what you want by positioning their body. To start training your dog to smile, simply watch for the behavior and reward them when it occurs.


Unless it's an act of aggression, reward your dog the very moment he shows his teeth.Use the verbal cue you want your dog to respond to when you see him smile. For example, if you want your dog to smile when you say, ""Say cheese!"" use these words the second your dog shows his teeth, and follow up with a reward., If you know your dog will show his teeth in particular occasions, take the opportunity to reinforce the behavior.


Do you brush your dog's teeth regularly? Oftentimes, dogs show their teeth in anticipation of a toothbrush. You can take this as an opportunity to teach the dog to respond to your desired command.A small amount of dog-safe human food sometimes makes a dog show his teeth in confusion or due to distaste. This most often happens with bitter tasting foods, like fruits and veggies. However, be careful. Some fruits and vegetables, like grapes and tomatoes, are toxic to dogs. Make sure the food is safe before giving it to your pet.Never reward a dog if he show his teeth in aggression, however, and do not deliberately encourage aggressive behavior to get a dog to smile. This breeds hostility and can lead to bad behavior down the road.

, Once there is a firm connection established between the command and the behavior, you can begin solidifying this connection with proper training sessions.


Offer words of encouragement while instructing your dog, and provide verbal and physical rewards as she responds to the command.
Go over the command several times a day, doing 5 to 15 repetitions, until the dog seems to have mastered the behavior.Watch for new behaviors during training and take these as an opportunity to teach your dog new tricks. If, for example, your dog raises her paws forward while training you should immediately call out something like, ""Beg!"" and reward the dog., If your dog begins showing signs of stress during training, you need to give him a break and evaluate your techniques. You want training to be a positive, bonding experience.


Pay attention to the eyes. Dogs will squint when stressed, so if your dog's eyes look smaller than usual he might need a break. If your dog is staring at you without blinking or refusing to meet your gaze, these are signs of aggression. Your dog might be on the verge of an outburst and you should cease training until he's calmed down.The mouth, when closed, signifies tension and stress. A frightened dog will firmly close his mouth, and may flick his tongue in and out and lick his lips. Showing teeth is generally a sign of aggression, but as that's the behavior you're striving towards it's likely not the case unless accompanied by growling and/or the wrinkling of the muzzle.Raised, forward ears can indicate stress or aggression. If his ears are completely flattened against his skull, this indicates fright. These are both signs that training is not going well and your dog needs a break.When scared, a dog will do her best to look small. She may hunch over and lower her back, head, and tail. The tail might even be tucked between the legs. When a dog is using her full body to indicate fright, you are probably doing something wrong in training., Aversive training techniques essentially mean scolding or otherwise punishing your dog for negative behavior. Dogs trained using an aversive method are 15 times more likely to exhibit stress than dogs trained using positive reinforcement alone.Aversion techniques involve scolding the dog for negative behavior and sometimes use of devices like shock collars or choke chains to discourage negative responses. Dogs subjected to such methods show signs of stress more often during training sessions and seem to have less loving, positive overall relationships with their owners overall.Breaks are important. If a dog is not paying attention and showing signs of stress, he might simply need time to relax and be a dog. Behaviors like running, playing, and chewing should not be completely forbidden. Scolding in such instances will only serve to confuse and distress the dog., The alpha male approach is a myth of dog training, and can cause undue stress and aggression in dogs. While training, be a good leader but do not try to dominate your dog.


The ""alpha roll,"" which involves turning the dog on her side and holding her down, can be dangerous if done incorrectly and cause physical harm to the dog. It also leads to stress in dogs, which can turn aggressive fast. Refrain from such behaviors if your dog is getting antsy during training.Instead of attempting to dominate the dog, simply restrict access to rewards if a dog acts out. If your dog gets overexcited in the presence of treats, simply wait until she sits calmly before giving her any food. She will learn to engage in respectful behaviors when she realizes acting out does not result in a reward."

Firstly, the dog's master must prepare him his dinner.,
Hold the bowl out just in front of your dog, and say loudly, ""Ask!"",
Make your dog bark.,
Do this each day for a week or so, and don't give your dog his dinner until he barks.","How to Teach Your Dog to ""Ask!"" for His Dinner"," This should be done in sight of the dog so that they know that they are expecting dinner time.;
, Some dogs will automatically bark at this point, but quieter ones will not. If the dog does not bark readily you will need to do something that usually makes him bark.

, This could be something fairly simple, like knocking on the kitchen door. If possible, have another person do this while you continue to hold out the food bowl. When the dog hears the sound, he will bark, at which point say, ""Ask!"" - and reward the dog by giving him his dinner and perhaps stroking him.

, Eventually you will be able to just say ""Ask!"" and he will bark. (Remember: some dogs take longer than others to learn skills such as these, so always be patient and never lose your temper with the dog. Younger dogs are more likely to be able to learn tricks such as these than older dogs, but if you do it properly, an older dog may also learn.)

Find music that suits your dog.,
Design a routine to go with the music.,
Start your routine with a pause.,
Make sure your routine includes movements in all directions.,
Create sections of your routine where your dog moves on his own.,
End your routine centre stage.,
Practice each part of the routine with your dog.",How to Teach Your Dog to Dance2," Dogs have different temperaments and different energy levels. When you’re just starting out with dancing, pick a song or selection of music, that is compatible with your dog’s energy level and enthusiasm. Start by picking music that lasts only 1 to 2 minutes.For example, if you have a very high-energy dog, you may need to pick music that has a fast beat. Whereas, if you have a low-energy dog, you may need to pick music that has a slower beat.

, Once you’ve selected the appropriate music, figure out what specific tricks and moves you want to perform with the music. If this is your first time creating a dance routine with your dog, keep it simple. Once you’ve selected the move, and the order you want to perform the moves, break the whole routine down into smaller, more manageable chunks.Each chunk, or section, of the routine should include only a small number of tricks. If it’s a difficult trick, you may want to break that into a chunk of its own.

, If you’re planning a routine for competition, or you want to add a little drama to a routine for other purposes, start your routine with a pause and not movements. The purpose of the pause is to provide the audience with a split-second picture of you and your dog together., For routines in competitions, you’ll have a limited amount of space to perform, but you will need to use as much of it as possible. When travelling across the dance floor, you should move in all possible directions — forwards, backwards, sideways, diagonally, in circles, and angles., Parts of your routine should include movements where you stand still and your dog moves on his own. These parts offer a great opportunity to showcase your dog and his abilities.If you’re planning a routine for competitive purposes, check the rules to make sure such movements are allowed. Some organizations require the human to continue moving throughout the routine.
The opposite of this step should be avoided, where a part of your routine requires the dog to stay still and the human to be the only one moving. Your dog should always be the centre of attention.

, Every routine should end with you and your dog at ‘centre stage’ or the centre of the dance floor. If you’re preparing a routine for competition, you should also make sure you end your routine facing the judges. If your routine is simply for an audience, then you should end your routine facing the main portion of that audience.Once the music has ended, step forward and bow to the judges or the audience. Pause for a moment and then move

, Once you have your routine broken down into small pieces, practice each individual section with your dogs. In order not to overwhelm your dog, practice each section in the order they’re to be performed. Once your dog has mastered one section, move onto the next section, until you’ve practiced the whole routine.Even though you may move on from one section to another, you’ll want to keep practicing all the previous sections with your dog periodically.
At this stage of development, you’ll probably want to practice without the music.
Try to practice a part of the routine at least once a day.

Use a target stick or an index finger as a target.,

As soon as this work you take a step forward without holding out the target stick.,
Now you should at the earliest date move away from the wall.,
When the dog can offer initial position from the front, you should start to vary your own position.,
When the dog is in initial position you should be able to turn both to the right and to the left, and even turn back, and then the dog is supposed to quickly sit in initial position again.",How to Teach Your Dog Initial Position," The first thing you can teach your dog is to come to the handler so that the nose is in about the height of your left leg. That is easily taught by holding the target stick in your left hand by (or 5-10 centimetres behind) your left leg and clicking when the dog is in the right position.;
, If the dog walks to your left foot you click and reward at the foot.

, Click when the dog puts its forelegs on the box. Reward when the dog is still standing on the box with its forelegs. Click and reward several times when the dog is standing on the box.

, If the dog moves a hind leg, click and reward immediately. Move again, click and reward when you see the first movement of the hind paw.

, Continue until you can move a whole turn, and the dog twists its forepaws on the box 180 degrees in the ratio of you by just moving the hind paws.

, To start with, click when you see the least movement of the hind paws. Move willingly when the dog is eating the treat, but make sure you're standing still when the dog moves so that the dog won't rely on you moving. Keep on doing this until the dog can stand on the opposite of the box, and spin 180 degrees completely next to your leg.

, Move about 45 degrees to the right. Then the dog is supposed to move - click at the moment you feel the dog's back part hitting your leg. Then you move 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees - and finally you should be able to move a whole turn while the dog is following you next to your leg just by moving the forepaws.

, The most important things to start with is that the dog is following your foot in the correct position and that the hind legs work well.

, The dog should know how to sit totally straight and close next to you. Train next to a wall or another backstop so that you avoid that the dog's bottom will ""rip up"". Have your dog standing on your left side between you and the wall. Take a step forward and hold the target stick by your leg. When the dog comes to the target stick, you lift the target up a little. If then the dog sits down you click and reward with the left hand. Then take a new step and repeat the same thing several times until the dog sits down quickly in the correct position when you lift the target stick.

, Click and reward if the dog comes to your foot and sits in the correct position. If the dog doesn't sit correctly, you don't reward but try again, or eventually some more times with the target stick before you make another try without it.

, Use the target stick in order to make the dog come to your foot, but remove it as soon as possible. Eventually you can train some more with different kinds of backstops.

, For example, you can start the training by letting the dog offering the initial position from the front. Click and reward. Then you move a little, so that the dog have to come in initial position from the right. Next time you stand so that the dog is on the left side. Then behind you etc.

, When you train turns on site you should reward the dog while it is still sitting in initial position. In the beginning you should train one turn at a time. For example, do 5-10 turns to the right. Then take a break.

Place a treat in your palm.,
Wait until your dog paws.,
Hold your palm up without a treat.,
Add a verbal cue.,
Open your hand in a high-five position.",How to Teach a Dog to High Five1," Curl your fingers over the treat. Then, call your dog over and sit on the floor in front of it. Hold your fist under your dogs nose. Your fist should be a few inches away from its face.Make sure you hold your fist in a vertical position in front of your dog’s face. This will ensure that part of your palm, as well as the treat, is visible.;
, If your dog just smells the treat, don’t do or say anything. The goal is to get it to paw your palm. Once your dog paws your palm, reward it by giving it the treat in your palm.Also reward your dog with pets and praise, for example, “Good girl (or boy).”
Repeat steps one and two for about three 15 to 20 repetitions, or until your dog consistently paws your palm for the treat. Do this over the course of a day.

, Instead, place the treat in your pocket, or keep it in the treat bag. Hold your palm in the same position. Once your dog paws your palm, reward it with praise and treats from your pocket or the treat bag., Once your dog can consistently paw your closed palm without a treat, add a verbal cue like, “high-five.” Say “high-five” as your dog lifts its paw to touch your palm. Reward your dog with praise and a treat for the correct behavior.Repeat this step until your dog consistently paws your palm while saying “high-five.”

, Keeping your hand in a vertical position, say “high-five.” The moment your dog touches your open palm, i.e., a high-five hand, with its paw, reward it with praise and treats.Once your dog gets this maneuver down consistently, up the ante by moving your hand a little higher so your dog has to stretch for it."

Resist the urge to run.,
Stand your ground.,
Back away slowly.",How to React if a Mean Dog Chases You1," Running may seem like the most reasonable reaction, but it's actually the most dangerous. Most dogs that charge at a person don't intend to bite them, even when the dog is mean or aggressive.However, if you start to run, the dog's predatory instincts will kick in and it will most likely chase you.If you're running or jogging when the dog begins to chase you, stop immediately.
Even if you're a fast runner, the dog will probably have enough energy and excitement to catch up with you.;
, Running towards you while barking and/or growling is simply the dog's way of trying to scare you away. If you stand still for long enough, the dog will eventually calm down and lose interest in you.


Face the dog. Don't turn away until you're a safe enough distance away that the animal has lost interest in you.
Make yourself big by raising your arms up in the air.Some experts recommend shouting while doing this, but be aware that yelling may further excite some dogs., Because most dogs only chase people to scare them away, if you stand still and back away calmly the dog will eventually back away from you.The key is to back away in a calm and nonchalant manner that won't further excite the dog.


Do not turn your back on the dog, as this may trigger its predatory instincts if it is still excited.
If at all possible, try to put a physical barrier between you and the dog. You can do this by backing away behind a parked car or by crossing the road away from the animal.Only turn away from the dog and continue on your way when you've put some distance between you and the dog. If the dog begins to look distracted or disinterested, you're probably far enough away.

Have your dog sit and focus on a treat in your hand.,
Practice this a few times.,
Toss the treat for your dog to catch.,
Tell your dog to sit and stay.,
Place a treat on your dog’s nose.,
Try the command without holding his muzzle.,
Practice catching and balancing for a week or two.,
Introduce your dog to catching the treat from his nose.,
Keep working on the trick.",How to Teach a Dog to Flip a Treat on His Nose," Stand in front of your seated dog and show him the treat in your hand. Keep his attention on it, and let him focus in on it. Then, say “Catch!” as you arch your hand in the air and guide the treat into your dog’s mouth.The first time you do it, you want to guide the treat all the way to your dog’s mouth rather than tossing it. This will teach him to keep his eye on the treat when you say the command “Catch.”
You can use individual pieces of your dog’s normal food as training rewards. They are familiar with this food, you know it’s safe for them, and one piece at a time is a small enough quantity to be able to use it as a reward for an extended period of time without accidentally overfeeding them. But, because they are used to getting this food, you may want to pop in a few treats to keep it interesting for your dog.You can also buy treats made specifically for training purposes. They’re cut in very small pieces, and you can keep these in your pocket or in a container nearby while training.
For this specific trick, you may want to try using a treat that is flat enough to balance well on your dog’s nose without rolling off. Or, just use a soft treat that you can press flat with your fingers.;
, Let your dog get the hang of concentrating on the treat as you speak the command. Make sure your dog stays seated and praise him each time you practice the motion and command.


Remember to stay calm and be persistent. Don’t get irritated or upset if your dog isn’t getting it right away. The key to successful training is remaining calm and keeping at it., Once you’ve practiced the command and guided the treat to your dog a few times, try tossing the treat to him without guiding it to his mouth. Stand back, hold the treat for your dog to see, and say “Catch!” as you toss the treat gently to your dog.Try this a few times, making the task more difficult each time. Step back further with each toss. Make sure you keep your dog’s attention before tossing the treat so he can focus on it and be better able to catch it.
Practice catching with your dog until he seems to have it down. In order for your dog to be able to flip a treat from his nose and catch it, he has to be able to catch!

, On carpet or a mat, have your dog sit, and tell him to “Stay” in a firm but gentle tone. Place your hand gently around his muzzle and say “Stay.” Hold there for a moment and make sure your dog listens.Sit and stay are two basic commands that you dog needs to know before being able to master the treat flip trick. If you can’t command your dog to sit and stay, you will have difficulty training him to flip a treat. Practice these commands if your dog doesn’t have them down yet.
If your dog cannot successfully balance the treat on his nose without looking down and letting it fall, he won’t be able to flip it to catch it. You must practice balancing the treat on his nose without allowing him to drop it or get it before you can move on to flipping it.

, While gently holding his muzzle, place a treat on your dog’s nose and command him to “Stay.” Hold it there for a moment. If your dog moves or doesn’t balance the treat, start over.Once the dog balances the treat while you hold his muzzle and tell him to “Stay,” remove the treat from his nose and reward him with a different treat. You don’t want to give him the one on his nose just yet. This exercise is to teach balance, not catching or flipping. Practice this a few times.

, After practicing the “Stay” command with a treat on his nose and your hand gently on his muzzle, try the exercise again. This time, hold his muzzle, place the treat, command him to “Stay,” and then slowly remove your hand from his muzzle. Let him balance the treat on his own for a moment, then remove it, and reward him with a different one.Keep practicing this step until he is able to balance a treat on his nose without your hand for a moment or two. If he drops the treat or tries to eat it, start over without rewarding him.

, Your dog needs to be really good at these first two commands and skills before he can successfully move from balancing a treat to flipping it off his nose and catching it.


Be persistent when introducing any kind of new training skill with your dog. One common mistake dog owners often make is not working on their training often enough. Try working on training skills at random points of the day, every day., Once he has mastered sitting, staying, catching, and balancing, you can teach your dog to flip the treat from his nose. This might take a little time to get to this point, but once he has those other skills down, this last part will come easily.


Ask your dog to sit and stay. Place the treat on his nose to balance, and command him to “stay.” After a moment, command him to “catch.” Your dog will toss the treat up with his nose and try to catch it.
Even if he doesn’t catch the treat the first time, praise and reward him for trying. As long as he is sitting, staying, balancing, and tossing the treat up to try and catch it, he is on the right path., Dogs learn behaviors over time. Make sure you keep up a regular training routine when trying to implement any new tricks, including this one. Keep training sessions short and to the point, rather than trying to work too long at one time.Try training sporadically throughout the day rather than at set times each day. Also, try training in different locations rather than in the same spot. This will help the dog learn the behavior and associate it with the actual command, rather than with a certain time or location.
Don’t rely entirely on treats to reward your dog for good behavior. Make sure you are happily praising him and making him feel good about himself. Pet him, and tell him in a happy voice that he did well!

Choose a quiet area.,
Pick high-value treats.,
Use a leash.",How to Teach a Dog to High Five2," Whatever trick you are teaching your dog, always pick an area in your house that is free of distractions and quiet. A quiet, distraction-free area will help your dog focus on the task at hand.Pick a quiet room in your house that is away from children and other distracting toys/objects, smells, and sounds.

, Use cheese, hot dogs, or other treats that you know your dog cannot resist. Cut the treats up into small pieces to prevent your dog from becoming full while training it. It is harder to train a dog that is full of treats., If your dog is not familiar with the commands sit and say, then you might need to use a leash to hold it in place. If your dog becomes distracted or begins to wonder away, use the leash to redirect its attention.


Teach your dog the commands sit and stay before teaching it this trick.

Stay calm.,
Avoid eye contact.,
Give verbal commands.,
Distract the dog.",How to React if a Mean Dog Chases You2," Staying calm is essential in any encounter with an aggressive animal. Resist the urge to scream and continue to stand tall while asserting your presence. You can use a stern voice, but yelling loudly may further excite the dog., While you may think of eye contact as a good way to show you're engaging with someone, it means something else entirely to a dog. An aggressive dog will see eye contact as a challenge or threat to its dominance. This could cause the dog to attack you, even if it did not previously seem like it would.Don't make eye contact, but keep paying attention to what the dog is doing. You need to be able to react if the dog lunges towards you.

, If the dog recognizes basic verbal commands, it should respond to your orders. Even if the dog is excited, a strong verbal command should break the dog's attack.However, some dogs won't recognize commands at all. In this case, verbal commands will not be effective.


Use a firm, commanding voice to tell the dog to ""sit,"" ""lie down,"" or ""go home.""
Be confident when you give verbal commands. Dogs can sense fear or uncertainty, so make sure you let the dog know who's in charge with the tone of your voice.

, Distracting an aggressive dog will give you time to sneak away.If nothing else, a distraction may help calm an excited dog down and break its desire to chase you. Any object can be used as a distraction if you catch the dog's attention with it.


If you have any dog treats, dog toys, or any type of food on your person, throw them on the ground in front of the dog.
If you don't have any food or toys, try to find a stick to throw. This might distract the dog or make it transition into a more playful mood."

A growling dog is notifying you that it does not want you in its territory and it feels threatened.Be especially cautious if you hear low, guttural growls and barks coming from the dog.;
, If a dog shows its teeth to you, this is a bad sign. Bared teeth is a warning that dogs send to ward off potential threats. This is meant to be an intimidating defense mechanism toward any perceived danger.This is an especially worrisome sign if it is combined with snarling and/or upright, pointed ears.

, If a dog is looking directly at you, this is not a good sign. Eye contact is considered aggressive behavior in dogs and can mean that a dog is on the verge of attacking you.Think about any nonaggressive dogs you know – they usually avert their eyes to avoid extended eye contact as a sign of submission and affection.
If a dog doesn’t avert its eyes and maintains eye contact with you, this is a sign of aggression.

, When a dog intends to attack, it may make some smaller lunging motions before actually attacking. If a dog is lunging forward at you, this is a pretty clear sign it means to warn or attack you.This is especially dangerous behavior when it is combined with some of the other warning signs like snarling and growling.

, You may be putting on a friendly face, but an aggressive dog might interpret a smiling face as you baring your teeth for a fight. Keep a calm, serious face when you are confronted with an angry or aggressive dog.Keep your mouth closed and your teeth covered at all times.

, Loud noises often frighten dogs and can ward them off if they seem to be in attack mode. Try yelling for help or banging on something nearby. This may startle the dog enough to distract it from attacking you.Try yelling “No!” at the dog as this is likely a word that they have been taught by their owner.

, If you have to walk through areas where you know dangerous dogs may be, try to bring a weapon like pepper spray or dog repellent. These can be effective tools in warding off an attack dog.If you must walk in an area that is known to have aggressive dogs that sometimes get loose, consider getting a good aluminum baseball bat.
Of course, don’t go around pepper spraying dogs unless they are actually about to attack you.

, If you run away from a dog, this can engage their instinct to chase you. If a dog is chasing you, it is more likely that it will attack you when it reaches you. Remain still and motionless for as long as possible.Try to back away from the dog slowly, without turning your back on the dog.
You can also try getting on top of a nearby parked car.

, The best method for preventing a dog attack is to never encounter one in the first place. Do your best to avoid areas where there may be aggressive dogs roaming free. Don’t approach dogs that you don’t know, even if you have their owner’s permission.


Don’t ever enter a fenced area where a dog may be without the owner present.
If you’ve seen dogs roaming loose in certain neighborhoods, avoid those places when possible.

, If a dog attack is unavoidable, try to get something to put in between you and the dog. This will help protect you from getting bitten by the dog and may distract the dog from attacking you altogether.Look for anything around that you can use as a shield. Use your purse or backpack; grab a tree branch off the ground. Try to find anything that could act as a buffer between you and the dog.

, If the dog is really attacking you, don’t be afraid to fight back. Your instinct should be to do whatever you have to do to keep from getting hurt. That’s okay in this situation. Do whatever you can to hurt the dog and keep it away from you.Kick the dog in the throat or groin. Try punching the dog in the face.
Use your body weight to get on top of the dog and pin it down.

, If attacking doesn’t work, you may need to consider protecting yourself. Roll up into a ball on the floor and bring your knees up to your chin. Cover your head with your hands and arms. This will help protect your most vital and sensitive body parts from being damaged in the attack.This is a form of “playing dead” which may cause the dog to become bored and abandon the attack altogether.

, Once the attack is over, you need to take care of your wounds. Call the authorities to report the attack as soon as you feel safe from danger. If you feel seriously injured, go to the hospital immediately. Otherwise, you should go home and clean all of the bites and scrapes with disinfectant and soap. Use some antibacterial cream (like Neosporin) and cover the bites with Band-Aids to prevent infection.You should also consider calling the authorities to report the attack.

Don’t pull away from a bite.,
Strike the dog continuously in a vital area.,
Use weapons to injure the dog.",How to Fight off a Dog1," If you let the dog jump on you or bring you to the ground, you’ll be in a much weaker position and more likely to be seriously hurt. If you’re in a city or residential neighborhood, call out for the dog’s owner.If you’re in the woods or a rural environment, you’ll need to call out for any help you can get.;
, This will deter the dog from attacking you, or confuse the dog as to what part of you it should attack. If you have a backpack or bag with you, hold it in the dog’s direction. If you have nothing else, you can use a piece of clothing to protect yourself from a severe bite.


A frenzied dog may bite the backpack or bag in front of you, sparing your arms and legs.
If you have time before the dog attacks you, you can wrap a shirt or jacket around your non-dominant arm and use that to distract the dog., These are the areas that a dog will first attack, and they are the most sensitive areas of your body. Use one arm to cover your face and neck, and the other to shield your groin and belly region.


If the dog attacks you while you’re using a hand to cover your face and neck with one hand and your groin with the other hand, it may bite you on the hand or arm—but that would be much less serious than a facial or groin wound.

, If a dog has sunk its teeth into your body, don’t try to wrench yourself free. This will tear the flesh and make the bite wound much worse., If you do not have a weapon, you’ll need to rely on punching, kicking, and gouging. Your best chance is to attack the dog in a vital area that is easy to injure. This will weaken the dog and reduce its ability to hurt you.Specifically, aim for the eyes, ribs, and groin.


A well placed kick to the ribs with a steel-toe boot could be effective at deterring an attacking dog
If a dog is latched onto your arm, attack its eyes with your thumbs, strike it in the throat, or seize the dog’s throat and try to choke it.These are effective defensive measures and may stop the dog from attacking you.

, If an aggressive dog is intent on attacking and harming—or killing—you, use whatever weapons you have to protect yourself. If you have a knife, stab the dog repeatedly in its face, jaws, and throat. These are vulnerable areas that will cause serious damage and disable the animal.If you are carrying a pistol or gun, aim for the dog’s head.
If you’re not carrying a weapon, use nearby objects (rocks or boards) to strike the dog.

This sends a positive message to your dog that a certain behavior was the right thing to do and that he should want to do it again in the future. Always make sure you have a healthy treat ready to give to your dog when training.Don't over feed your dog treats.
Treats should only be around the size of a pea.
Treats should only be given to your dog when he does something you want to reinforce.
Dogs can eat many healthy treats. Try offering bits of carrot, sweet potato, or a slice of apple.;
, Dogs learn new tricks best when you train him in a quiet, distraction free environment. If there are too many other things going on, your dog may not give you his full attention. Always make sure that the place you are training your dog in will allow him to fully focus.For example, avoid a busy public park. Try to find a quiet space that your dog can focus in.
Familiar environments are better than new ones.

, Just like humans, your dog can get stressed out if he feels he isn't getting things right or is doing the same thing too much. Whenever you are training your dog, try to avoid any prolonged sessions or pushing your dog to learn something too quickly. If your dog seems to be having trouble learning a new trick, take a break and come back to it later.Taking a break can be more effective than pushing through.
If you think your dog has lost interest, stop for the day.

, Training your dog with a collar on can help you to keep him focused and under control. Before you start teaching your dog how to lay down, make sure the collar is properly and comfortably in place. Here are some tips that can help you put the collar on safely and securely:The collar should be placed around the dog's neck, settling around where his neck meets his chest.
Tighten the collar to a point where you can slip two fingers under the collar.
Don't make the collar too tight or too loose.

, The first step in teaching your dog the lie down command is to stand by your dog in a certain way. You will need to have your dig sit down and then stand next to him on his right side. Your hand should be able to reach the dog's collar from here. This position will allow you the best control over your dog while teaching him to lie down.Have a treat ready to offer your dog. The treat will be the focus your dog uses to lie down.
Place the treat in your right hand and put your left hand on the dog's collar.

, Once you are in position, you can start teaching your dog the verbal “down” command. Standing next to your dog, show him the treat in your right hand. Once he is aware of this, lower the treat down to the ground. Say the command “down” to your dog so that he associates the word with the motion and the treat.If your dog is having trouble, you can try gently pushing him down with your left hand to start the motion.

, Rewarding your dog for properly performing the lie down trick is key. As soon as your dog responds and lies down, give him the treat he was following. Your dog will come to associate this movement with rewards and in time will respond to the verbal “down” command alone.You can also use a clicker. Click whenever you offer a treat, causing your dog to associate the sound with the trick.

, Practice makes perfect. Keep working with your dog to make the lie down command an easy and natural thing for him. The more you practice the command, the easier it will be for your dog to understand what you want and how to do the lie down trick.At first, try to practice at least once every day.
Practicing a few times a day can be a good idea.

, The first step to take when teaching your dog how to crawl is to have him lie down. This will get him in position and ready to focus on the new trick he is learning. If your dog doesn't already know the lie down trick, consider teaching him this first before teaching him how to crawl.Have a treat ready to help your dog focus and to reward him with.

, Once your dog is lying down, take a few steps in front of him. Squat down and show your dog the treat. Keep the treat low to the ground and say “crawl.” Your dog should start to crawl along the ground, trying to get the treat from you. Reward your dog immediately if he crawled correctly.Your dog may stand up and walk over to you. If this is the case, start over from the lying down position.
You should only be a few steps away from your dog at first. Walking too far away may confuse your dog.
Make sure your dog crawled correctly before rewarding him. Your dog will repeat whatever behavior you reward.

, Once your dog starts to understand what the “crawl” command means, you can start to increase the distance your dog crawls. Work gradually, taking a few steps more each time you train your dog. This will increase how far your dog can crawl as well as reinforce the trick overall.Always work slowly to increase the distance your dog is crawling.
Practice around twice a day.

Enter a defensive stance.,
Use chemical repellent if you have it.,
Shove an object at the dog.,
Fight the dog.",How to React if a Mean Dog Chases You3," If the dog cannot be deterred, you may have to defend yourself. Make sure you enact a strong defensive stance and prepare yourself to fight.Keep one arm down and use it as a blocker against the dog. If the dog is going to bite you, it's best to receive the bite on your arm so you can still control the dog.
Put your other arm behind your back. This will signal the dog to get down and behave.

, Mace/pepper spray will stop an attacking animal in its tracks, but you may not have tools like this on hand. If you have any liquids at all that can be sprayed or splashed at the dog, it might be worth trying.Citronella spray is an effective animal deterrent.
Mace/pepper spray can also be useful at repelling aggressive dogs.
In a pinch, spraying water from a water bottle may stop a dog from attacking., Shoving something towards the dog will act as a shield. The dog will bite your object instead of biting you. Anything you have on hand can be used as a shield: a purse or backpack, a sweatshirt, or even a shoe., If you need to fight, make sure you stay on your feet. Getting pinned on the ground will make it much easier for the dog to hurt you. If you need to strike the dog, try to kick it instead of punching it, as your shoes will provide some protection to your feet.If you fall or get knocked down, protect yourself. Cover your face, chest, throat,and neck. Curl into a ball to protect your vital organs.
Keep your hands in fists. If you have loose fingers sticking out the dog could latch onto them and do serious damage.

Avoid the territory of unfamiliar or dangerous dogs.,
Avoid eye contact.,
Keep your hands in your pockets.,
Don’t turn your back on an approaching dog.",How to Fight off a Dog2," Of course you shouldn’t wander into yards patrolled by strangers’ dogs, but dogs may also be territorial about other spaces as well.Keep this in mind if you’re walking in the woods or in an unfamiliar part of town, including neighborhood streets and public parks.


If you’re worried that a dog seems excessively defensive or territorial, find a different way to walk so you’re farther away from the dog.

, If you’re concerned about an unfamiliar or hostile dog, and think it may become aggressive and attack you, don’t look it in the eye.Eye contact will signify confrontation to the dog, and it will take that as a hostile gesture.


Avert your eyes by looking above or below the dog, or to its side.

, When an aggressive dog is sizing you up and deciding whether or not to attack, he will be looking for parts of your body that are easy to grab on to. Hands are an easy target, since they’re exposed and relatively small. Keep your hands in your pockets to avoid giving dogs an easy target, and the dog may decide not to attack you.If the dog does decide to attack, you’ll need to quickly pull your hands from your pockets to defend yourself.

, A dog will take it as a sign of weakness and think you’re retreating if you turn your back and run. If you turn your back, the dog will likely attack. Stand sideways to the dog, with your side facing it, and avoid sudden movements.If you stand in this non-threatening pose, the dog may lose interest and wander off.


If the dog does not lose interest, walk slowly backward away from the dog until you reach safety.

Bring something with you to serve as a shield.,
Carry a weapon with you.,
Pay attention to your surroundings while walking.",How to Fight off a Dog3," When you go for a walk in an area where dogs are often loose, plan ahead to bring something that can help in case of an attack. If a dog is acting aggressive or going to attack you, you can defend yourself and protect your body by placing an object between yourself and the attacking dog. The dog may even clamp down on the shielding object, and avoid harming you altogether.Having something with you like:


A sweater or jacket.
A book or newspaper.
A cane or umbrella.
A bicycle.

, In case you come across an aggressive dog that attacks you, it’s best to be prepared and capable of defending yourself. Pepper spray is available for this purpose, and a knife is certainly better than nothing.Also considering carrying a heavy walking stick that you can swing in self-defense.


If you have steel-toed boots or shoes, these can also be used in self-defense against a dog.
A firearm is the next step; a pistol can be conveniently carried if the law allows.

, If you don't carry a weapon, you can use something you find as a weapon tin case a dog attacks. A sturdy board, pole, or branch should be your first choice. If a dog is threatening you, point the stick at the dog to keep it at bay. Do not try to swing at the dog, as this may anger the animal and cause it to attack.


If no sticks or poles are around, rocks are the next best choice.
Even if there isn’t an aggressive dog nearby that could attack, if you’re in unfamiliar territory, it’s smart to be aware of your surroundings. Consider what objects you could use to defend yourself in the case of a dog attack.

Allow the dog to swim to shore.,

Make swimming a regular part of life.,
Keep a close eye on the dog.",How to Safely Introduce Your Dog to Water," It is very important that when you put a dog in the water it will respond to your commands. A dog won't always see dangers or problems in its path in the water, so you need to be guaranteed that it will follow your command when called if you spot a hazard. This will help to assure its safety and will make its swimming time less stressful for you as well.


Even if a dog is on leash while it is swimming, which is should be when it first learns, it should still be trained to come to you when you tell it to. You shouldn't have to drag it back through the water by a leash, as this is dangerous for the dog.;
, While it is important to have a dog well-trained before you take it swimming, getting your dog used to water in general should happen much earlier. Start getting your puppy used to water when it is about 8 weeks old. This is usually when you will bring a puppy home if you have gotten the puppy from a reputable breeder.Getting a young puppy used to water as a concept early will make the transition to swimming much, much easier.
You should introduce your puppy to water by letting it walk around in an inch or two of water, not any deeper, while you closely supervise.
Letting small puppies watch adult dogs in water can also peak their interest. This will show them that swimming is a natural part of life.

, Give your puppy a shallow bowl of water to play with or set up a sprinkler in the yard on a hot day and let it run around in it. Whatever you can do to build a positive association with water early on, do it.One reason that some dogs shy away from water is that they have a negative association with it. So, one of the best things you can do to safely introduce your dog to water is to increase their interest in it and decrease their fear of it at an early age.

, Some dogs really are born swimmers. They take to the water immediately and look like they were born swimming. Some dogs are not. If you have a dog breed that is known for swimming, such as a Labrador retriever or a Portuguese water dog, then you can expect that the dog will become an excellent swimmer. However, if you have a dog with very short legs that is not known for it athleticism, such as a Chihuahua or a Pug, then the likelihood that it will be a great swimmer is much slimmer.If you have a dog that will probably not be a great swimmer, it's still important to introduce them to the water and make sure they can keep afloat. This is key for their safety and they may even enjoy the water, even if they are not that good at navigating it.

, When your dog is two to five months old, you can start to teach your dog to swim. At that age it will have the strength and endurance necessary for its first swimming lessons.Do not throw a dog that is new to water into deep, cold water and expect it to automatically swim. Instead, you need to allow the dog to go through a gradual learning process, much the way humans need to gradually learn to swim.


Let your dog spend a lot of time playing and having a good time in shallow water that is at a comfortable temperature before you introduce it to deeper water. This will give it good associations with water to begin with.Spend time in shallow water playing your dog's favorite game. This could be simply running and sniffing around or it could be a game of fetch, whatever your dog loves to do.
There are some dogs that are better at swimming than others. This can be about the individual dog but swimming skills also tend to fall along breed lines.

, If you are worried about your dog's safety, you can put a life vest on it to make sure it doesn't drown. There are a wide variety of canine flotation devices on the market that are designed to keep a dog safe while it is enjoying the water. These are usually vest-type jackets, that hook around the dog's chest and under its belly.Just like flotation devices for humans, it is important that you get one for your dog that fits it perfectly. A snug fit is important when it is keeping your dog afloat.
Canine flotation devices often have a handle on the back so that you can more easily grab your dog out of the water if it is having trouble or you simply want to get it out of the water.Putting a flotation device on an older dog that is having mobility issues is also a good way to allow them to continue to enjoy the water without the fear that they will become exhausted and drown.

, Don't assume that you can tell your dog to go into the water alone and it will go. Instead, it may need some encouragement and support in the form of you going in with it. Carry a timid dog into the water and show it that you are there to help it. Hold onto the dog and let it do a few paddles with its paws while you continue to hold it.Expect to go into the water with your dog multiple times before the dog is comfortable with deep water.
Hold onto the dog tightly if it is scared and don't force it to paddle without support.
If you hold the dog around its midsection, it will be able to paddle with its front and back paws while still getting support from you.
Be prepared for the dog to struggle. Hold onto it, preferably with a harness or flotation device, so that it doesn't get away from you if it panics.

, Don't force a dog that wants to get out of the water to stay in the water. This will only make the dog more skittish of the water in the future. However, have it swim a short distance in order to get out of the water.


Swimming a short distance to shore is good practice at swimming for the dog. Keep a close eye on it while it is swimming and be sure to help it if it looks like it is struggling.
It is helpful to have a friend on the shore who can call the dog. If you are out in the water with the dog, your friend can call it to shore and hold up a treat, coaxing it to swim on its own.

, Learning to swim can be very exhausting for a dog, as it uses a new array of muscles and a lot of calories to stay afloat. If your pup looks tired or is panting excessively, take a long break or call it a day.


This amount of time your dog should swim while learning will vary, depending on your specific dog. Keep a close eye on your dog and err on the side of caution when ending your dog's swimming lessons.

, It can be very intimidating to a dog that is new to swimming to enter a large body of water, even if it is ready to doggy paddle. Instead, work your way up to a depth that your dog cannot touch the bottom of by getting your dog to enter a smaller body of water that is deep, such as a deep pond.Not being able to touch the ground when you are close to the edge, and thus close to safety, is much easier than having a long way to swim if you get into trouble.

, Like most skills, your dog will get better and better at swimming the more it does it. If you want to make your dog a great swimmer, perhaps because you want to use it as a hunting dog or you do a lot of activities in the water yourself, then you need to build its skills on a regular basis.Make it a habit to take your dog to a river or lake for swimming on a weekly basis while you are teaching it to swim. This regular practice will improve its skills dramatically.
However, keep in mind that a dog should not be swimming in frigid waters, so you may need to keep it out of the water in the winter. Water that is too cold can give the dog hypothermia and can easily cause it to drown due to shock to its system.

, Don't assume that just because your dog is initially doing well in the water that it does not need supervision. All dogs that are swimming need supervision, whether it is just learning or is a skilled swimmer.


A dog that is new to the water is likely to tire quickly, as it is using new muscles and is doing a new activity that takes a lot of stamina. Your dog could go from happy to being in trouble very quickly, so you need to be on the lookout for this change.Keeping control of a dog while it is learning to swim is important. This means that you should have a hold on the dog, ideally with a harness, while it tests the waters so that you can save it if it gets into trouble.

Allow the dog to initiate contact.,
Request the assistance of the owner.,
Avoid making direct eye contact.,
Interact with the dog from the side.,
Approach very slowly.,
Throw a few treats down on the ground.,
Extend a single hand for the dog to sniff.",How to Gain Trust in an Aggressive Dog1," Go about your business as usual and refrain from reaching down to touch the dog, unless it shows a direct interest in you. It is quite possible that it will grow increasingly curious about you and will try to nudge or bump you for contact. If this happens, just stand still until the dog has had its fill., If this is not your dog, it is a good idea to ask the owner, if present, if it is okay to pet the animal. They will generally decline if the dog is aggressive and then you’ll know that bonding will have to occur at a distance, if you want to try at all. If you see an aggressive dog running around without an owner, it is a good idea to keep your distance and call your local animal control office for assistance.With an owner, you might say, “What a pretty dog. Is it okay if I pet it?”
With an openly hostile and unaccompanied dog, it is probably not a good idea to get close enough to attempt to read the tags. The dog may bite or scratch you. Instead, wait for the animal control officers.

, Looking directly into a dog’s eyes will generally be interpreted as an aggressive act, which will be returned in kind. Instead, try to find a focal point directly above the dog’s head. You can also look at one of the dog’s ears or its collar instead.


If you accidentally look directly at the dog, quickly flick your eyes away. This will often prevent any additional conflict.

, Whether you are sitting, standing, or crouching, try to position yourself at a non-direct angle to the dog. If you interact with the dog in a head-on way, it may increase the aggression. Don’t be surprised if the dog readjusts to directly face you. If this happens, simply slightly shift over to get off-kilter again., If you do decide to get closer to the dog, don’t move in a straight line. Instead, walk in an arc, aiming to get closer to the side of the dog. Only take a few steps at a time and pause if you sense any increasing signs of aggression., Offering a treat directly by hand isn’t a good option when interacting with an aggressive dog. But, you can toss a handful of small treats, such as little pieces of cheese, near to the dog. If the dog remains hesitant, try looking away for a moment to encourage it.If this is not your dog, make sure that you get the owner’s permission before offering any food. It is possible that it may be on a special diet or may react poorly to food treats.
This is an especially good method of positive reinforcement for dog owners to use. Your dog may associate you with good food and may even look forward to your attentions.

, If you’ve spent enough time with the dog for it to positively respond to you, it may be time to take the next step. Slowly position yourself closer to the dog and then reach out with a single hand. Keep it palm up and just hover it in the air for a bit. If the dog sniffs you, that is a good sign. If not, you can always try again in a bit.Be very careful with this step as it makes you vulnerable to an attack. Watch the dog’s body language closely. If the dog growls, begins pawing the ground, or lays its ears back, then it is probably best to stop and try again later.
If the dog loosens up enough, you can even try petting it gently. But, keep your petting to the side or back of the dog’s body. Stay away from the dog’s face.

Minimize repetitive motions.,
Limit tricks that put pressure on the dog’s joints.,
Lessen the number of tricks that involve jumping or running.",How to Modify Tricks Based on an Old Dog's Physical Limitations1," As your dog ages, it may suffer from joint pain and arthritis. Because of this, certain repetitive tricks may be painful or difficult for your dog to perform. For example, avoid having your dog repeatedly sit and lay down. This will aggravate its aching joints.In general, try to limit how often you have your elderly dog perform physically complicated or demanding tricks.
Emphasize easy tricks like speak, kiss, or heel.;
, Do not have your pet do tricks like sit, stand, or lie down for an extended period. This puts extra pressure on their joints and muscles. Be sure to limit the duration and frequency of these kinds of tricks. Instead, encourage tricks like touch or smile that limit joint wear and tear.Let your older dog lay down and avoid having sit or stand for a long period.

, Although your dog may love fetching things, too much excessive physical activity can be hard on its joints and muscles. Instead, maintain the physical activity, just tone it down a little. Do not have your dog run as far to fetch things or jump so high to retrieve them. In general, try to slow things down and make them a little easier.For example, if you are playing fetch, throw the ball or stick half as far as you normally would. You could also throw the object as far as you did before, just do not do it as often.

Stay patient.,
Know your dog’s triggers.,
Interact in a calm and relaxing environment.,
Give your dog its own space.,
Spend time together relaxing.,
Consult with a dog trainer.",How to Gain Trust in an Aggressive Dog2," Remind yourself about the positive traits your dog possesses. For example, it might be super cuddly with its favorite toys. You will likely face setbacks when trying to break through with your dog just stay the course and keep trying to make progress. If you get too frustrated, give yourself a bit of distance from your dog and regain control before interacting again., Spend some time observing your dog’s everyday behaviors. Does it get frightened and turn aggressive during a thunderstorm? Is it afraid to have men approach? It is angry and protective over food? Map out those areas that lead to poor behaviors and try to avoid them. Set your dog up for success.You will be at an even better advantage if you have an idea of your dog’s past. For example, if your dog faced starvation when it was younger, it will likely exhibit food protectiveness. Therefore, feeding times will not be the best times for an initial approach.
Don’t discount the possibility that you may be the cause of the aggression. It is possible that the dog is reacting poorly to your very presence. If this is the case, you should know that it will be tougher to bond with it., Dogs can sense stress and will respond negatively to it. Keep loud distractions in your home to a minimum, such as turning down the TV. Limit large gatherings of people. Keep your house neat and clean without lots of tempting non-dog toys.To make this work, you will want to enlist the aid of anyone living in the household. Work together to be consistent in your interactions with your dog.

, Dogs do best when they have a bit of private territory that they can claim as their own. Place your dog in a crate for a limited part of the day and then leave the crate open and accessible. Put all of your dog’s toys and food and water bowls in one area of the house. Keep this area off-limits for children and other pets.

, It is a common thing for owners to shy away from spending time with aggressive pets. But, that only leaves your dog with excess energy to burn. Instead, take your dog on controlled walks, or spend time lounging in your backyard with no one else around., You can either ask a dog specialist to come to your home or you can arrange to attend a dog obedience class. For dogs with severe aggression (especially towards other dogs), a private session is probably the best option, at least initially. Find a certified dog trainer in your area by searching online or by contacting the American Kennel Club (AKC) in your area."

Use your weight to your advantage.,
Protect your face, chest, and throat.,
Leave the area slowly and carefully.,
Attend to any wounds.,
Call the authorities.,
See a medical professional promptly.,
Look for warning signs.,
Avoid aggravating a dog.,
Assume all unknown dogs are threats.",How to Handle a Dog Attack," There's some truth to the old adage that dogs and other animals can ""sense fear"". If you become agitated and run or scream, you may make the dog feel more confident in his attack, or, worse, you may appear threatening to the dog. Neither of these is a good situation to be in.;
, When a dog approaches, stand completely still with your hands at your sides, like a tree, and avert your eyes.In many cases the dog will lose interest and walk away if you ignore him.


Do not wave your arms around or kick with your legs; the dog may perceive these actions as threatening.
Don't make eye contact, since that could also cause the dog to lunge.
Stand sideways to the dog and keep him in your peripheral vision instead of facing him and making eye contact. This will signal to the dog that you are not a threat.
Don't open your hands and arms up to a bite by extending them. Keep your fingers curled into fists to avoid getting them bitten. The dog may come quite close, even sniffing you, without actually biting.

, Running away can awaken the dog's prey instinct to chase and catch animals. He may pursue you vigorously even if his initial intent was just playful. Additionally, you won't be able to outrun most dogs if you're on foot. Even if you are on a bicycle, many dogs will be able to catch up to you., If the dog continues to threaten you, offer him something to chew on, such as your backpack or water bottle: anything but your arm or leg. This may distract him enough to give you time to escape.


You may want to carry treats or toys when traveling in areas known to be home to dangerous dogs. If approached by an angry dog, throw your treats or toy away from you. The dog may go after these instead of you.

, If the dog continues to behave aggressively, and ignoring or pacifying him is no longer working, face him and sternly command him to leave.


Use a strong, deep, and confident commanding voice.
Continue to avoid making eye contact.
The dog may become discouraged or intimidated and leave.

, If the dog starts biting you, you've got to defend yourself. Hit or kick the dog in the throat, nose, and the back of the head. This will stun the dog and give you time to get away.It's okay to raise your voice at this point. Yell for help as you're fighting back. Hopefully others will hear and come to your aid. However, avoid screaming as this may lead the dog to strengthen his attack.
If you have a stick or another weapon, you can (and should) use it to hit the dog. Don't hit him over the top of the head, though; most dogs have very thick skulls, so this will only serve to make the dog angrier. If available, mace or pepper spray also work as a good defense against an attacking dog.
Fight as though your life depends on it, because it does. Dog attacks can be fatal. While you certainly don't want to hurt a dog unnecessarily, you should use force as necessary if you are being seriously attacked.

, Bring your entire body weight to bear on the animal, specifically pushing down with the hard points of your knees or elbows. Dogs are vicious biters but cannot wrestle, so try to get an advantageous position and break their bones fairly quickly. Get on top of the animal and concentrate force on areas such as the throat or ribs while minding to keep your face out of clawing/biting range.


If you are looking for a more humane solution and can manage it, straddle the back of the dog with your partial body weight and apply forward pressure to the back of the neck to immobilize the dog until help comes.

, If you fall to the ground during the attack, not only is it more difficult to fight off the angry dog, but vital areas on your torso, head, and neck become more vulnerable to attack. These are the most important spots on your body to protect because bites in these places will inflict the most damage and will have the greatest chance of killing you.


Protect your vitalsby rolling onto your stomach, tucking your knees in, and bringing your hands (balled in fists) up to your ears.
Resist the urge to scream or roll away, as these actions may further encourage the dog., Once the dog loses interest in you, leave the scene of the attack slowly by backing away without sudden movements.Staying calm and stationary can be a real test of your nerves in such a stressful situation, but it's the best thing to do as long as the dog isn't actually biting you.

, If you are bitten, be sure to take care of any wounds promptly, as even minor bites can cause infection. Perform basic first aid procedures for bites suffered from a dog attack:


Apply gentle pressure to stop minor bleeding. Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze pad. If bleeding is serious or if it won't stop after several minutes of applying pressure, seek professional medical attention.
Wash the wound thoroughly. Use warm water and soap to gently cleanse the wound.
Dress the wound. Use a sterile band-aid (for very small cuts) or sterile bandages for larger lacerations.
Look closely for signs of infection, including redness, warmth, increasing tenderness, or oozing pus. See a doctor if any of these symptoms arise.

, It's important to determine whether an attacking dog has rabies or a history of aggression. Call the authorities immediately after a dog attack so that the dog can be prevented from harming anyone else and be tested for diseases.


If the dog that attacked you was a stray, he may attack others, too. Removing him from the area is the best way to ensure the safety of yourself and others.
For dogs with owners nearby, how you handle the situation after the attack has been diffused is up to you. If you've been hurt, you may want to take legal action. Many states have laws holding owners responsible for the actions of their dogs.

, If you were bitten by an unknown dog, a dog that was later found to have rabies, or a dog that appeared to be foaming at the mouth, it's imperative that you see a doctor right away to get preventative treatment for the deadly disease rabies.


The rabies shot sequence, if it is necessary, should be started as soon as possible after the bite.
Most European countries are considered to be “rabies-free,” so a shot is not likely to be necessary in the event of an attack that takes place in Europe.
If you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years, you may require additional preventative tetanus treatments.
In general, any significant wounds from a dog attack should be examined by a medical professional.

, Most dogs are not aggressive, but, rather, just curious or defending what they perceive as their territory. Thus, to avoid unnecessary conflict, it is important to be able to tell if a dog is just playing or is being truly aggressive. While some breeds have been singled out as being particularly vicious, any mid-size and large dog breed can be dangerous,so do not ignore warning signs because you think a certain breed is harmless or friendly. Watch for common signs of aggression (and non-aggression):Growling, snarling, and baring teeth are obvious displays of aggression and should be treated as such.
An angry dog may show the whites of his eyes, especially if these aren't normally visible.
Pulled-back ears laying flat against the head are a telltale sign of aggression, whereas normal floppy or elevated ears usually signal a dog's nonchalance.
If the dog approaches you with its body relaxed and with a sloping curve in its midsection, the dog is probably not going to attack.
A dog whose body is tense, straight and stiff (head, shoulders and hips aligned) could mean business.
A loping gait means the dog is playful and checking you out. An even, steady run means the dog may be dangerous.

, Most dog attacks are the result of insufficient containment of the dog, poor training, or taunting. Unfortunately, the world will never be rid of bad owners, so it is wise to be prepared. Common sense should tell you not to aggravate any kind of animal.


Never irritate a dog who's eating or caring for her pups. Dogs are extra-protective during these times.
Avoid smiling at the dog. You may think you are putting on a friendly face with a big toothy smile, but an aggressive dog sees you baring your teeth for a fight.
Dogs that are chained or tethered to a stationary object for extended periods of time are more likely to be aggressive, so do not come within their reach.

, In general, the best policy when it comes to dog attacks is to do everything you can to avoid them in the first place. If you see a dog that may be dangerous, stay away.


Report any dangerous-looking dogs or possible strays in your neighborhood to the authorities.
Teach your children never to approach unfamiliar dogs until they are sure they are safe.
By giving all unknown dogs a wide berth until you find evidence that they are safe, you can avoid the majority of dangerous dog encounters.

Rely more on visual cues.,
Change your pitch.,
Use a vibration collar.,
Train your dog to respond to the new signal.",How to Modify Tricks Based on an Old Dog's Physical Limitations2," If your dog’s hearing fades, you will need to rely on visual symbols to convey meaning to your dog. Most trained dogs have already picked up a number of visual cues, such as your body language or slight hand gestures. In fact, you may find that your dog already responds to certain visual cues without you actively training them to do it. However, if you initially trained your dog to respond to verbal commands like “sit” and “stay,” try incorporating simple hand gestures. For example, if you want your dog to sit, motion down with your hand.You can also teach your dog some simple sign language to help it recognize its cues. Instead of verbal cues, you can train your dog to respond to sign language cues that you give.You can also utilize things like flashlights or laser pointers to direct a dog in low-light settings. However, be sure not to shine the laser in your dog’s eyes.
You may need to do some retraining to get your dog to respond to these new visual cues.

, Some dogs with hearing impairments can still hear certain pitches. Your dog may be able to hear you if you raise or lower the tone of your voice. Practice using different pitches when you give your dog commands and see which works best., A vibration, as opposed to a shock collar, sits around your dog’s neck and gives it gentle vibrations when you press a remote button. With some training, you can get your hard of hearing older dog to respond to the vibrations in the collar. If your dog still has some of its hearing, vibrate the collar while giving the verbal cue. Over time, it will respond to the vibration alone.Be sure to avoid purchasing a collar that shocks and vibrates. You do not want to hurt your dog accidentally during training.

, Whether you decide to use hand signals, an altered pitch, or a vibration collar, you will need to train your dog to associate the new signal with the action. Use positive reinforcement, such as a treat or petting, to help your dog learn the new cue.Because it will not be able to hear the tone of your voice, you will need to rely on treats and petting to reward your dog’s good behavior. Give your dog some food and plenty of physical affection when it performs its tricks correctly.

Be careful.,
Look for aggressive posturing.,
Look for unwanted herding behaviors.,
Pay attention to tail movements.,
Watch for growling or teeth baring.,
Consult with a veterinarian.",How to Gain Trust in an Aggressive Dog3," Make sure to watch out for your well-being and that of others when you are attempting to interact with an aggressive dog. Some dogs may lash out without fully realizing what they are doing, so reason is not always effective or useful. Only go as far as you feel comfortable and know that some dogs will never fully become the stereotypical friendly companion.

, When a dog turns aggressive, it will move its body into an attack position. It might crouch lower to the ground in preparation to spring. Or, it might lunge forward and backwards. It could also try to move to the side of your body to prepare for a blind attack.Be warned if a dog looks directly into your eyes and tries to maintain direct eye contact. This is intended as an aggressive move. To try to diffuse the situation, keep moving your gaze to another part of the dog’s face, such as its left ear. But, continue to watch the dog in case it decides to move toward you.

, A dog might lower its head and try to push against your leg repeatedly. Or, it might nip at your leg or foot to get you to move in a certain direction. These nips could turn more aggressive if you refuse to comply.Cross your arms across your chest, or just keep your hands higher up, in order to avoid being nipped. Repeat the command, “No,” in a firm voice. Hold your ground or move slowly in another direction, keeping your eyes on the dog at all times.

, The tail is a good indicator of a dog’s feelings. However, it is easy to misread. Just because a dog moves it tail in a “wagging” motion doesn’t necessarily mean it is feeling friendly. A dog can also “wag” in an agitated way. Look for loopy, uncontrolled motions as an indication of friendliness.An agitated wag is more stiff and controlled. Watch for a tail that moves in a tight, horizontal motion.

, This is what most people will look for right away, and it is a clear sign of aggression. A dog showing its teeth is also giving you a warning. If you respond to this warning, there is a good possibility that the dog will back down.You can respond by saying, “No,” in a calm voice. Or, you can totally ignore the behavior, while watching the dog closely. If you choose to back away for your own safety, do so slowly with your body still facing the dog.

, If you experience any signs of aggressiveness with your dog, it is a good idea to meet with your vet and ask for advice and assistance. They may inspect your dog for a physical cause, such as arthritis, behind the aggression and pain. Or, they might suggest a particular dog trainer or type of training."
"
Utilize more verbal cues.,
Incorporate clicker training.,
Engage your dog’s other senses.",How to Modify Tricks Based on an Old Dog's Physical Limitations3," When your dog was younger, it relied on a combination of verbal and visual cues. However, with its poor eyesight, you will need to train your dog to rely more heavily on verbal cues. For example, if you trained your dog to sit or stand in response to visual cues, you will need to retrain it to respond better to the verbal commands “sit” and “stay.”To avoid retraining your dog when it is older, teach it to respond to visual and verbal cues when it is young.

, A clicker can be a helpful way to train a blind dog because it helps reinforce your commands. When your dog does what you commanded, click the clicker. Eventually, the dog will respond to the clicker and not your voice. This is particularly useful if your dog also suffers from hearing impairment and has a hard time responding to the pitch of your voice.If you know that your dog’s eyesight is deteriorating, begin clicker training it immediately. This will make the transition to using only verbal commands much easier.
You can also train a dog with poor eyesight to respond to a vibration collar.

, As your dog’s vision declines, noise-making toys will help it perform many of its former tricks. Use balls that rattle or jingle. You can also purchase scented toys that your dog has to search for by sniffing out the toy and bringing it back. Scented toys are great for slower passed game of fetch."

Honor the hierarchy.,
Feed dogs separately.,
Provide separate sleeping areas.,
Introduce new animals slowly.",How to Keep Dogs in the Same House from Fighting1," Dogs are pack animals. They appreciate having a clear position within a social hierarchy. It should be clear to you which of your dogs is the alpha (the leader), the beta (the middle of the pack), and the omega (the bottom of the pack). Rather than working to make everything “fair,” it is important for you to respect and help maintain this social hierarchy.Doing so will reduce the need for fighting amongst your dogs.Feed the alpha dog first, and then the rest of the dogs in order.
Offer the alpha dog treats first, and then the rest of the dogs in order.
Allow the alpha to be the first to pass through doorways.
Give the alpha attention first, then provide equal attention to each dog in order.;
, Provide each dog with its own separate bowl, with plenty of space between them. If your dogs show signs of aggression while eating, you may even consider feeding them in different rooms. When feeding time is over, remove any uneaten food to prevent dogs from eating each others’ leftovers.Feed the alpha dog first, then each dog in the hierarchy.
If you provide a treat or bone, provide one for each dog (giving to the alpha dog first).
One water bowl for all dogs is usually fine.

, Just like food bowls, each dog needs a separate area (such as a dog bed or crate) to sleep. In multi-dog households, dogs will usually select where they sleep. They may switch beds at times or even sleep together. The important thing is to ensure that each dog has enough space when it needs it.You might consider crate training your dogs.
If you do this, be sure to provide a comfortable crate for each of your dogs.

, Anytime you bring a new animal home, everyone in your household needs a little time to adjust. If you introduce a new dog or puppy slowly and carefully, the dogs are less likely to fight, and are more likely to quickly determine their social standing with one another.Allow them to meet on neutral territory, such as a park. Ask a friend (or someone from the shelter) to bring the new dog.
When you bring it home, confine the new dog to one room of the house. Allow it to explore the house in time.
Expect some posturing. Dogs may need to tussle a little bit to determine their rank, but it should happen rather quickly.

Exercise your dog.,
Socialize your dog.,
Enroll your dog in behavioral courses.,
Know your dog's triggers.,
Surrender your dog to their breeder or shelter.",How to Calm an Aggressive Dog1," Many dogs that demonstrate aggressive behavior benefit from extensive exercise regimens. The more energy your dog burns the better their state of mind and the less likely they are to exhibit aggression.Take your dog for regular daily walks at least twice a day.
Take your dog to the park to let them burn off excess energy.;
, Socializing your dog as early as possible will help them get used to encounters and interactions with both humans and other dogs. Take your dog to a dog park or create one on one play dates with other dogs to give your dog the social interaction it needs.Consult your vet for recommendations for enrolling your dog in a socialization class.

, Aggression training camps can help deal with past traumatic experiences as well as provide both you and your dog with tools for dealing with aggressive behavior. Consult your vet for aggression training camp or behavioral class recommendations.

, Knowing what your dogs triggers are will help you avoid aggressive behavior and address it appropriately. Consult your breeder or shelter about your dog's history to see if their aggression is learned or caused by trauma. Check the humane society to learn more about the causes and types of aggressive behavior to better understand what your dog's triggers might be.Bring your dog's triggers to the attention of your vet to see if their behavior can be treated with medication.
Make your dog's triggers known to any trainer should you enroll in a aggression training camp or behavioral course.

, If you do not have the time, money, or resources to deal with and prevent your dog's aggression you might consider surrendering you dog back to their breeder or shelter. Be honest about your concerns and the dog's behavior so that they have the possibility of being re-homed to another owner who may be able to deal with their aggressive behavior.Many shelters have a euthanasia policy in place for aggressive animals. Check with your shelter to discuss their aggressive animal policy."

Give the dog an herbal supplement orally.,
Administer valerian to calm an excitable dog.,
Calm your dog with other herbal oils.,
Use a topical ointment.,
Use a pheromone diffuser.",How to Calm a Dog With Natural Remedies1," Lots of all-natural herbal supplements are available commercially, whether in pill form or in tinctures. You can give them directly to your dog or mix them into a regular meal. Many of the same herbal supplements that have a soothing effect on humans will work on dogs as well.However, consult your veterinarian before giving your dog herbal supplements for proper dosage instructions and any warnings.


Often, mixed-herb supplements are sold with names like “Dog Calm” or other brands, and will involve some mixture of St. John’s wort and valerian. Also look for products which include calming ingredients such as oats, skullcap, and echinacea.;
, This is a sedative herb that is effective in treating excitability and dog anxiety.Generally, you can buy valerian in dried or capsule form and give it to the dog orally, wrapped in a piece of cheese, or with a treat. Treat dogs before situations during which they’re likely to become excited.Apply herbal tinctures or dried herb in an amount between 0.25 and 0.5 milliliters for every 30 pounds that your dog weighs. Administer 2-3 times a day over the course of several days.

, Oil mixtures often include the herb skullcap, which is used for similar calming purposes.Most commercial herbal mixtures involve some combination of ingredients, and they’re much cheaper while still being an effective way to calm dogs.

Passionflower has calming properties, but isn’t a sedative. It is effective in calming frightened animals quite quickly, and is good for travel and other stressful situations during which the dog is likely to get excited.Look for passionflower in pill or essential oil form at your local pet-supply or natural goods store.

, A few drops of all-natural essential oils on the back of the neck can help to calm dogs. Other people like applying a bit of oil to the bare skin inside the ear, but not in the ear canal itself. A variety of different oils and mixtures are used to calm down excitable dogs. Look for ointments that include sedative herbs including red clover, dandelion root, hawthorn, and echinacea.Your local pet-supply store should have useful ointment options, made up of a mixture of different natural oils, which are excellent for calming any animal.Lavender oil is commonly used for calming purposes, since it has aromatic therapeutic properties common to people and pets.

, A plug-in diffuser or collar pheromone diffuser releases a scent that’s undetectable to the human nose, but which the powerful nose of the dog is able to pick up. These pheromones help to make the dog feel “mothered” and calm by releasing chemicals similar to those produced by lactating females.Effective brands of pheromone diffusers will encourage calmness, and should be available at your local pet store in plug-in or spray delivery systems.

Use a Thundershirt.These shirts are worn over the dog’s torso and apply pressure when the dog gets anxious.,
Play classical music to your dog.",How to Calm a Dog1," Dog body language is complex and can often be misread. There is no universal sign of anxiety or fear to look for because every dog reacts differently. It is not unusual for one fearful dog to act aggressive and another to run away and hide. Both dogs want to be safe, but they process the situation differently. Some common signs are:


Hunched body posture
Averted gaze/dilated pupils
Ears held down or slightly backwards
Furrowed brow
Whining
Shaking/shivering
Sweaty paws
Loss of bladder or bowel control;
, Most of the time, this will be obvious. Your dog is clearly afraid of thunder, a specific person, a loud sound, or a particular space. Put yourself in your dog’s place. You know little of the world, but you see something formidable. How would you react? Have empathy for your friend., Take your dog into another room if a particular person is making it anxious. Close the blinds and turn up the music to mask the sound of thunder or fireworks. If your dog wants to turn tail and hide in its safe space, perhaps its crate, cover it with a light blanket, to help muffle the frightening sound. Again, the method you choose to employ to calm your dog all depends on what it is afraid of.You can create a safe space for your dog, by opening a door to a room away from the loud sounds or your can crate train it. In the latter case, your dog will come to find its crate to be the most comforting place of all., You want to give your dog something else to focus on — something “positive” and even productive. Does your dog have a favorite toy or chew stick? If so, present your dog with it to distract it from the negative stimuli. Turn a stressful situation into a playful one. Eventually, your dog will associate whatever is causing them stress initially with a fun experience and then later on they won’t be so affected by the negative stimuli (i.e. strangers, thunder, the vet, or other animals).

, Every dog is different. Every dog enjoys different types of petting. Some like soft gentle strokes, while others like hardy pats and squeezes. One of the most common petting strategies is the gentle sweep of the back. Place the palm of your hand on the top of your dog's head and slowly follow your dog's spine to its hips. Do this repeatedly in order to calm your dog.However, be aware that petting your dog can be misread by the dog as being rewarded for feeling fearful. Counterintuitive as it sounds, petting the dog can inadvertently train him to be fearful in future. Judge the situation, but sometimes it is much better to ignore his fearful behavior which sends the message that there's nothing to worry about.

, The dog interprets the pressure like a baby interprets swaddling. It is comforting for some dogs., Many dog owners and animal shelters quietly play classical music to soothe the dogs."

Have your dogs ""fixed."",
Socialize your dogs.,
Work on dog-to-dog socialization.,
Watch out for signs of stress.,
Recognize specific triggers.",How to Keep Dogs in the Same House from Fighting2," Dogs that have not been spayed or neutered may be more likely to fight with other dogs. If your dogs have not been spayed or neutered, doing so may lessen the appearance of aggressive behavior. Talk to you vet about having this procedure done on your animals.The cost of neutering a dog will usually range from $45 to $135, depending on the weight of the dog.
The cost of spaying a dog--which is a more complicated procedure--can range from $50 to $175.

, You can help prevent aggressive behavior in your dogs by making sure they are adequately socialized. Dogs are most easily socialized between 3 and 12 months. If your adult dog exhibits serious behavioral issues around other people or other dogs, consider seeking help from an animal behaviorist or veterinarian. You can socialize your dog by exposing it to a variety of experiences, including:


Different kinds of people.
Children.
Other dogs (both large and small).
Other animals (like cats).
Noises.
Travel.

, Although puppies may have fun wrestling with a group of other puppies, most adult dogs will find situations with large groups of dogs (such as a dog park) to be a bit stressful. You can work on each of your dog's dog-to-dog socialization, by doing it gradually, and with just one dog at a time.Invite a friend to bring their easy-going dog on a walk with you and one of your dogs.
Allow a polite distance between the dogs.
If both dogs are calm, allow them to sniff one another.
If both dogs seem relaxed and their tails are wagging, allow them to play together off their leashes.
Repeat this process until your dog feels more comfortable around other dogs.

, Dogfights are usually the result of stress. Dogs can be very sensitive to their environments, and can become quite stressed—and thereby aggressive—over seemingly simple things. If you are aware of your dogs’ stressors, you can better prevent a fight.Some common stress factors can include:


Bad weather (especially thunder).
Food or a treat present.
People arguing or being emotional.
Changes to their routine.
Not getting enough exercise.
Loud noises (such as fireworks).

, In addition to stress factors, each dog may have specific triggers that can cause undue aggression. Triggers can make your dog uncomfortable and/or defensive, but knowing what they are can help you prevent fights. Pay attention to the way your dog behaves under different circumstances.Some triggers can include:


Injury or pain – If a dog is in pain, it may feel threatened by another dog.
Protection – If your dog thinks you are in danger, it may act out to protect you.
Unclear hierarchy – If one dog refuses to defer to another, they may fight to determine their places.

Watch the eyes.,
Recognize the dogs’ posture and body language.,
Listen to the growls.,
Break up a fight, when necessary.,
Deal with the aftermath of a fight.",How to Keep Dogs in the Same House from Fighting3," If one of your dogs is uncomfortable, it will stare intensely at the other dog. The other dog may either return the stare, or lose interest. If both dogs are locked in an intense stare, be aware that tensions may be rising. To prevent a fight, you may want to separate the dogs., Certain dog movements--such as pulling their lips back, holding their head high or low, or baring their teeth—are meant to communicate a warning. If your dogs are acting this way towards one another, it may be best to separate them., If your dogs are making low, rumbly growls at one another, this can also indicate a warning. However, growls can sometimes be misleading. Look for the dogs’ body language and other behaviors whenever you notice a growl. If it seems like they might be posturing to fight, it is best to separate them.All dog growls will sound a little different.
It is important to listen to your dog and get a sense of the way it vocalizes.

, If your dogs do manage to get into a physical brawl, you may need to intervene to prevent injury. Try some methods that can be done from a distance, in order to best prevent yourself from getting hurt. Some strategies include:


Make a loud noise.
Spray them with water.
Use a barrier to split them up (such as a piece of wood).
Throw a blanket over them.

, After a fight has been broken up, it is a good idea to keep the dogs separated for up to 48 hours. In this time, you'll need to tend any wounds and provide comfort to each dog. You'll also want to be careful about how you reintroduce them.Tend wounds - Check both dogs for wounds. Any puncture can become infected, so clean any injuries and/or take dogs to the vet.
Provide comfort - Give plenty of affection and attention to each dog. They are likely to be shaky and nervous for a couple of days.
Reintroduce them - After a waiting period, ask to friend to help you reintroduce the dogs. Meet at a neutral space and allow the dogs to sniff each other while they are leashed. If there are no signs of aggression, the dogs have probably moved on. If they continue to be aggressive, keep them separated for a while and try again.

Be calm and decisive.,
Create space.,
Desensitize your dog to other dogs.",How to Calm an Aggressive Dog2," Dogs are sensitive to the moods of others, especially when they are in a state of aggression. The more calm you are when other dogs are approaching the less likely your dog will be to exhibit aggressive behavior.Avoid tensing up the leash, forcing your dog to move quickly, or raising your voice if you anticipate a aggressive outburst. Instead, calmly lead your dog away from approaching dogs or if they are already displaying aggressive behavior.Remember, the calmer you are the calmer your dog will be.

, If you see another dog approaching, move to the other side of the road, walk to another side of the park, or take a safe distance and wait for the dog to pass. Creating space between your dog and the other dog will help you avoid any aggressive interaction.Try using a blockade, like a car or tree, when another dog is approaching.
Avoid pulling back on the leash when pulling your dog away from other dogs. Instead, pull your dog to the side and calmly lead them away.

, The more frequently and consistently your dog interacts with other dogs the less likely they are to display aggressive behavior. Scheduling regular play dates with other dogs, walking calmly by other dogs, and have brief encounters with dogs at the dog park with help desensitize your dog.Keep a long distance when first desensitizing your dog to other dogs. Once they seem comfortable continue approaching at a steady rate and stop and wait once their aggression is triggered again."

Act calmly and quickly.,
Practicing blocking.,
Slowly introduce your dog to new people.",How to Calm an Aggressive Dog3," Both dogs and people can be sensitive to the others moods. If you sense a potential outburst, or if your dog is already displaying aggressive behavior, stay calm and respond quickly. Restrain your dog on their leash or grab their collar and redirect them if they start displaying aggressive behavior.Ask the individual to slowly back away and re-approach once your dog has calmed down.

, Standing in front of your dog and blocking them from approaching others will keep their aggression at bay. Your dog's line of vision will also be blocked, which may relieve them of their trigger entirely. Remember, you know your dog better than anyone else so it is your responsibility to mediate for them.If you have enrolled in behavioral classes use some commands or directives to relive your dog of tension.

, Many dogs are aggressive toward new people. Introducing them slowly will help your dog gradually become used to their presence and curb aggressive behavior. If you are trying to introduce your dog to someone specifically set up regular play dates where your dog can continually get used to the individual.


Have the individual slowly extend the back of their hand and offer it to your dog to smell. This will help them become familiar with the individual and will allow for them to approach your dog.

Create a safe space for your dog.,
Take the dog for more frequent walks.,
Socialize your dog properly.,
Keep your house quiet.,
Buy the dog a thunder-shirt.",How to Calm a Dog With Natural Remedies2," Give your dog a quiet, safe place to retreat to. Place soft blankets and chew toys in a bedroom corner, a closet, or a covered kennel. Encourage your dog to go there when feeling anxious or afraid. Check on the dog periodically, but keep quiet and leave the animal alone as much as possible.


This type of safe space will let the dog retreat and calm down when it is stressed or afraid.

, If your dog won’t settle down, or seems anxious and you can’t figure out why, it could be a sign that the animal isn’t being taken outside frequently enough and is not receiving enough exercise.Dogs, especially young puppies, should be allowed to run regularly, at least 3-4 times a day.


If your dog is panting loudly or won’t stop bothering you, it might be sick or need to go out urgently. Until you figure out your specific dog’s typical behavior, assume that any excited behavior may indicate a need to go outside and go to the bathroom. Unless you want a mess on the floor, take the dog outside promptly.

, It’s normal for dogs to get excitable when meeting new people or new dogs. But if your dog doesn’t calm down or is hyperactive around new people and dogs, it is a sign that you need to start increasing your dog’s socialization as soon as possible. Let the dog meet as many new people and dogs as possible on a regular basis.


Take your dogs for walks and ask permission to greet other dogs that you meet. When the dog behaves, reward it with a treat. Use clear verbal commands and keep the dog under control., Loud noises, shouting, and music can be very stressful for animals, especially dogs. Dogs have very sensitive hearing, so music at a moderate level for you may be stress-inducing for a sensitive dog. Try to keep your space quiet, especially if you have a dog that gets nervous or excited easily.


Sometimes, very quiet music can help to calm some dogs. Play soft classical music or ambient sounds in the background if you have to be away for a while.Some people have success leaving the radio or television on when you have to be away, to help the dogs feel as if someone’s around., Thunder-shirts are like snug blankets that wrap around your dog. These are commonly used during thunderstorms and during travel to calm anxious pets.They’re commonly available at pet stores. If you prefer to make your own, you can fashion one out of a snug t-shirt for medium to large dogs. Cut extra room into the neck hole so the animal’s neck isn’t constricted.


There isn’t much definitive evidence to show that these actually work. Some dog owners swear by it while others have found it useless. The effectiveness of a thunder-shirt may depend on the personality of each specific dog.

Pet and massage your dog more.,
Spend more time around your dog.,
Change the dog’s diet.,
Take the dog to the vet if it exhibits signs of illness.",How to Calm a Dog With Natural Remedies3," It’s important to be affectionate and kind to your animal, and sometimes simply petting your dog can help reduce lots of stress and anxiety. You can also gently massage your dog to calm it—focus on massaging your dog’s pressure points: the feet, ears, and top of its head. This massage will sooth and calm your dog, much like people are soothed by a relaxing massage.Dogs are social animals and thrive on contact and affection. Make sure to spend at least 30 minutes each day—preferably more—petting your dog, playing with it, and spending time with the animal.
Be calm when you’re around your dog. Speak in a quiet and soothing voice, and pet the dog very calmly and slowly.

, Lots of different things can stress out a dog. If you’re traveling, or frequently absent, dogs can become anxious. Many breeds of dogs need to be reassured by humans regularly, or they’ll become stressed out.


Your dog will look to you for behavioral cues: be calm and assertive in situations the dog finds stressful. Your own nervous moods can transfer to your dog, so stay calm and your dog will mirror that mood., Like humans, dogs are greatly affected by their diets, and their moods can suffer as a result of poor nutrition. Commercial dog treats often contain additives and ingredients that can overstimulate a dogs system. Buy natural treats or make your own. If you choose to make your own treats, you can use oats, which give energy but through complex carbs that are slowly released.


Don’t’ feed dogs from the table. Dogs need a balanced diet, rich in protein, complex carbs, and vitamins, just like you do. Don’t feed them on treats and bones.

, If a dog is panting or drooling heavily, or eating lots of grass, this might be a sign that it’s sick or otherwise injured. Dogs that are ill will often struggle to sleep, and may pant heavily in the night. Make sure to pay close attention, so you don’t interpret signs of illness as regular nervousness.


Vomiting or diarrhea is common in dogs, and might just be a sign of nervousness, or that you need to change the dog’s diet. If it persists for more than two days, call your vet.

"
Train your dog.,
Mask your own reaction.,
Use pheromone diffusers.,
Give your dog a zylkene supplement.,
Talk to your veterinarian.",How to Calm a Dog2," Many dog trainers believe that excessively anxious, excitable, or frightened dogs are the direct result of insufficient training. You must reinforce positive behavior when training your dog. Teach it to not get anxious at the vet, excitable at the dog park, or frightened by thunderstorms. Do this by offering an alternative task to focus on and then rewarding it when it completes the task successfully.For example, during a trip to the veterinarian’s office, if you dog gets overly anxious in the waiting room, tell it to “sit” or “lay down”. Really any basic command will do. Then reward your dog after they’ve successfully followed your command. This will reinforce the training and take your dog’s mind off of the stressful situation. In the future, your dog may even associate the waiting room of the vet with sitting and receiving a treat, not with being probed by a stranger., Your dog thinks of you as a member of its pack. If he sees you anxious or fearful, he will adopt a similar emotional state. If you find yourself in an unsettling situation, don’t let it show. Take deep breaths and count them, exhaling slowly and deliberately.


For example, if you take your pet to the vet for an operation and you’re stressed about it, don’t let your dog see it. You want to always create a positive experience for your dog in these situations. Alternatively, if you shriek every time you hear a thunder clap, your dog will think there is something to fear. This will cause anxiety too., Pheromones are chemical messengers given off by a dog’s mother during nursing to reassure her pups that they are safe and secure. Synthetic versions of this chemical, known as Dog Appeasing Pheromones (DAPs) are available for purchase as many pet superstores. Simply plug them into the wall or attach them to your dog’s collar and watch them calm your canine companion., Zylkene contains a protein extracted from milk that acts as a calming agent — like diazepam. This capsule is given twice daily and has been shown to calm dogs during thunderstorms, trips to the vet, or stays at the kennel., They will be able to advise you on what measures will work best - either behavioral or medical. If necessary, you can get a prescription for stronger medications. Only give these to your dogs if your vet prescribes them and do so according to the vet's instructions. Five types of medicines are usually used to treat behavior problems in dogs. These are benzodiazepines (BZs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)."

Be patient and consistent.",How to Deal with Aggressive Dogs when They Fight," Yelling or panicking may fuel the dogs’ aggressive behavior during a fight. Dogs are very sensitive to the body language and reactions of the humans around them, so it is important to control your breathing and remain composed.


If your dog is fighting, it is important to control your breathing to help you release any anxiety and fear. Steady your breathing by counting to 10 as you breathe in and out. Breathing deeply will help you control your emotions, help you remain calm, and may help put the dogs at ease, too.;
, Do not try to separate the dogs with your hands, and do not wedge yourself in between them. This vulnerable position makes it easier for the dogs to accidentally bite or injure you. In addition, this interference could reroute the dog’s aggression toward you., Try to divert the dogs’ attention by making a loud noise. Hit a metal dish, smash pots together, blow a whistle, or create loud noises by dropping something on the floor like a heavy book. This distraction may be enough to distract the dogs and cause them to lose interest in fighting.


If the dog is fighting in the house, ring the doorbell. Many dogs are tuned into that sound, so your fighting dog’s interest may be piqued when it hears the bell. It may leave the fight to go investigate the sound.If your dog gets into a fight while on a walk or in a dog park, rattle your car keys loudly to distract it., If you have multiple dogs that fight frequently, keep a spray bottle full of water on hand. When a fight does break out, remain at a safe distance and spray the dogs with the water. Being hit by a stream water may surprise the dogs and divert their attention away from the fight.If you are outdoors, spray your dogs with a hose if one is easily accessible.While on a walk or in a dog park, use the water from a water bottle or from a dog’s water bowl to sidetrack the fight., If two people are present and the dogs have not ceased fighting, each person should carefully grab one of the dog’s hind legs. Gently lift the legs off of the ground and walk backward a few steps. The dogs should halt the fighting at this point, but it is important to remove both dogs immediately., Once your dog has been properly secured on a leash, removed from the situation, and has had time to calm down, check it for any injuries. Any open wound is prone to infection. Look out for bleeding, swelling, limping, and difficulty breathing.Your dog should be examined by your veterinarian. Even a minor wound can cause serious problems for your dog


Use pressure to stop any excessive bleeding, but do not use a tourniquet.
Depending on the severity of the injuries, your veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics, pain medications, treatment with intravenous fluids, or even surgery., Some dogs may behave in an aggressive way due to a medical issue. Dogs with thyroid problems, orthopedic issues, epilepsy, or other cognitive issues may exhibit hostile behavior. Diet may even play a factor in a dog’s aggressive tendencies. Be sure to talk to your veterinarian first about any potential underlying health issues.Let your doctor know if your dog has been having any health issues or changes coupled with signs of aggression. “My dog’s hair has started thinning, and I have noticed that it is more prone to growling and snipping lately. Could this be a sign of something else?” This information will help your veterinarian diagnose and treat your dog.

, Before your dog is one year old, be sure that it is neutered or spayed. This can help prevent male aggression and thwart fights caused by a female dog in heat. In addition, these procedures can help your dog live a longer, happier, and healthier life., Try to understand what is causing your dog to behave aggressively and try to remove that influencing factor. Evaluate the situation. Think about the dog’s behavior prior to its most recent fight and search for clues or patterns that may help you identify what caused the outburst.


Some dogs show aggression over their possessions, which means that they may guard or protect their food or their favorite toy. Try to remove the objects that your dog covets when other dogs are present, and organize to feed your dog by itself., Aggression problems are difficult to diagnose, and properly training a dog to behave a certain way can be very challenging for a pet owner. Look into hiring a professional animal behavior specialist to properly diagnose and treat your dog. A professional will come up with a comprehensive and personalized plan to help your dog, and the trainer may identify any quality-of-life problems that may be the cause of your dog’s aggression.Talk to your veterinarian about hiring a professional trainer for your dog.

, When desensitizing a dog, you gradually introduce your pet to particular situation to pacify its fearful and hostile reactions. This technique must be done slowly and deliberately to be effective.With time and patience, your dog will begin to understand that it does not need to be violent around other dogs.


Figure out how close you can bring your leashed dog to another dog without it showing signs of aggression. If your dog can watch another dog that is 50 feet away without barking or growling, then start at that distance. Gradually bring your dog closer to the other dog, provided that it does not begin to behave in a hostile manner., In conjunction with practicing desensitization, counter conditioning can help teach your dog a new response to a situation. When you provide your dog with a treat and praise each time it exhibits the desired behavior, your dog will begin to view the once scary situation as a positive one.When your dog gets closer and closer to another dog without barking, lunging, or exhibiting other aggressive behaviors, give it a treat and praise. With repeated attempts, your dog will begin to remain calm around other dogs with the hope of earning a tasty treat., Changes to your dog’s behavior will be gradual, so it may take a long time before you notice significant changes. Don’t be discouraged! Progressing too quickly will not be effective or helpful for your pet. Practice these techniques consistently, and keep a record of your day-to-day training sessions to notice your dog’s incremental improvements.


If you are rewarding your dog for a particular behavior, such as giving it a treat each time it gets closer to other dogs without growling, be sure to consistently reward it on each occasion. An inconsistent rewards system may cause your dog to lose sight of the big picture and the lessons will be lost.
Be on the lookout for small changes. Perhaps one day your dog will quietly growl at another dog in the dog park, and a few days later, your dog will wag its tail when it sees one. This small change shows that your dog is beginning to associate its good behavior with a reward, changing its overall perspective.

Make sure your dog has identification on it.,
Feed the dog.,
Give the dog a space of its own.,
Give the dog a name and teach it to respond to it.,
Buy treats you can use to train the dog.",How to Build Trust with an Abused Dog1," Give your dog a collar with a name tag and your number on it. Make sure it fits comfortably on your dog's neck. An abused dog may get spooked or escape from you, and you want to make sure that if it does get away from you it can be identified.;
, Give it its favorite food at regular times during the day. It is recommended that a dog be fed twice a day.You should also give your dog open access to water at all times.

, This is usually a crate or a bed that the dog feels comfortable on. There are a wide variety of dog pillows and baskets in pet shops that you can buy for it.


The dog's space should serve as a place where it can take a break. If your dog is feeling overwhelmed or fearful, make sure to allow the dog to return to its safe space and leave it alone.
You can also give the dog some toys to play with on its own. Most dogs won't like every toy you give them, but instead will choose a favorite and ignore others completely.

, Always call your dog by its name and try not to change it. Changing names will just confuse the dog.


Having a name that your dog will respond to will keep help you to bond with the dog. Use a happy and upbeat tone of voice when you call the dog by name. This will help to build good will between you and the dog.

, Try lots of different treats until you find its favorite. Give it snacks when it's good, follows a command, or does a trick.

Avoid punishing the dog.",How to Alpha Roll an Aggressive Dog1," You can try to relax your dog by telling them that everything is all right. Use a soothing, calm tone to reassure your dog. The gentleness of your voice may help reduce stress and relax them in a tense situation.;
, If your dog is growling, snapping, or snarling at another person or animal, the best thing you can do is remove them from the situation. Place them in a different room. If you are outside, you can lead them away on their leash. Use commands, such as “come, boy”, to make them follow you away., If you have trained your dog to answer to commands, you may be able to distract them from the target of their aggression. Use a command to have them lay down. If they do so, reward them by praising them, petting them, or giving them a treat.


At this point, you might also ask them to rollover. If they do so, you have successfully distracted them from their target and do not need to use a physical rollover.

, Yelling at the dog, jerking their leash or collar, or hitting the dog will not reduce their aggression in a tense situation. These punishments may provoke your dog more. Even if these methods temporarily stop the situation, they can encourage fearful or aggressive behavior later on."

Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations.",How to Recognize Signs of Anxiety in Dogs," Dogs of all ages and breeds can develop anxiety, but some dogs are at increased risk of developing fear-related disorders. Be mindful of the following risk factors in this section. If your dog has any of the risk factors, you should be even more careful about looking for signs of anxiety. Early intervention can prevent or minimize the development of serious behavior problems.;
, Dogs can be predisposed to anxiety based on genetics, which means you can ask if the parents have anxiety.Unfortunately, this step only applies if you have access to the breeder or other access to information about the dog’s parents.

, Lack of adequate socialization or exposure to different environments and situations can lead to anxiety when a dog is confronted with these stimuli. This is even more likely if the dog lacked these stimuli during the critical period between birth and fourteen weeks of age.For example, puppy mill breeding dogs and other dogs raised in cages often have lifelong problems with fear and anxiety even after rescue., Most anxiety disorders in dogs begin during adolescence, when the dog is between six and eighteen months of age.However, dogs of any age that experience trauma, illness, or other stressful events can develop anxiety problems.

, A history of abuse or past bad experiences with certain people or situations can cause anxiety.If you’re looking at a dog at a shelter or from a rescue, ask if the organization has any record of the environment from which the dog came.

, Any illness or condition that produces pain can increase a dog's anxiety and cause it to become more fearful., Neurological disease, degeneration, or exposure to neurotoxins can lead to anxiety in dogs as well. This also includes age-related cognitive issues, which can result in the onset of separation anxiety in old dogs., The best way to recognize signs of anxiety in your dog is to pay attention to your pet and look for behaviors that seem odd or out of context.The steps in this part include commonly recognized signs of anxiety in dogs.

, Scanning of the environment and attentiveness to the actions of people and other animals is a sign of anxiety. Anxious dogs scan their surroundings even in situations where other dogs would be relaxed. They are often on the lookout for frightening things or occurrences.This heightened lookout mode can also mean that the dog startles more easily than you’re used to seeing.
Muscle tension in the dog is another symptom you may see in a nervous dog that is always on edge.Excessive whining and barking may also be associated with the dog’s inability to calm down and relax., You may notice pacing or other repetitive behaviors.This is similar to how anxiety makes it harder for humans to sit still.

, Especially when these symptoms don’t relate to heat or cold exposure, they may be signs of anxiety.Note that dogs also commonly pant after physical exertion such as play or exercise, which is not an immediate cause for any concern.

, If your normally housebroken dog begins relieving itself in the house, it can be a symptom of anxiety.Old dogs can also show sign of incontinence, so consult your vet for a more complete diagnosis of the symptom.


Anxious dogs can also experience diarrhea following an anxious episode., Lip licking, yawning, tucked back ears, and dilated pupils are all other potential symptoms of anxiety in your dog.Ensure you differentiate these behaviors from times when they are expected, such as when the dog is tired (for yawning) or when the dog experiences a change in light conditions (for dilated pupils).

, Anxiety in dogs involves the release of similar brain chemicals as anxiety and fight-or-flight situations in humans. “Flight” responses in nervous dogs can include bolting, hiding, digging, scratching, fleeing and pawing (such as at doors)., These behaviors are usually more common in specific cases of separation anxiety where the anxiety is due to the absence of the dog’s owner. The destructive behaviors in question include destroying barriers such as doors and gates., Much like humans can experience sleep disturbances due to anxiety, you may also notice this symptom in your dog. This sign is more common for long-term cases of anxiety, so look for it in association with other symptoms., Shedding is another potential sign of anxiety. Keep a close eye on the dog’s behavior if you notice uncharacteristic shedding or even bald spots because the cause may be due to excessive licking, which is another anxious characteristic.Check with your veterinarian to ensure that the symptoms aren’t associated with a skin disease, endocrine disorder, or simply allergies if present without other signs of anxiety., Another sign is a loss of appetite in your dog. In severe cases, you may even see weight loss in your dog over time due to the change in eating habits.You may also notice vomiting unrelated to disease or eating spoiled or inappropriate food., During anxious episodes, your dog may maintain a lower body posture or tuck its tail between its legs.These general signs of cowering may indicate fear in your dog as well. Other typical signs of anxiety in a high-stress environment (such as the vet clinic) include:


Yawning
Licking lips
Avoiding eye contact
Raising a paw
Rolling over and displaying the belly
If you notice your dog displaying these behaviors, try to give them some space and a little time to adjust to the stressful environment. Pushing the dog outside their comfort zone might cause the dog to bite.

, An anxious or fearful dog may also cling to its owner in many situations.Look for this symptom in association with destructive behaviors when you aren’t around, which likely indicates separation anxiety.

, If you suspect your dog is anxious, try keeping a log of each exhibited behavior from the previous part. Log the location, duration, and circumstances behind each behavior.

, You should examine the specifics of each exhibited behavior to determine which ones are actually caused by anxiety. Other things to note about each instance include people and other pets in the area, location, environment, weather, noises, and anything else you notice when the dog is showing signs of anxiety.

, With the information you’ve collected, try to weed out the behaviors that were actually appropriate based on the context. For example, panting is a common sign of anxiety, but it is normal for dogs to pant when they are hot or have been exerting themselves.If all of the occurrences of panting you note occur in hot weather or after long walks, the panting probably is not due to anxiety. If, on the other hand, panting is occurring when the dog is well rested and confronted with strangers or other stressors, it is likely a result of anxiety.

, By logging the instances of anxious behavior, you may also begin to see patterns emerge related to particular stimuli. This is why carefully noting details about when your dog becomes anxious, even if these details seem insignificant at the the time, is critical for fully assessing your dog's anxiety.A thorough understanding of context will enable you to eliminate stressors and work on easing your dog's fears through controlled training.For example, a dog that fears being separated from its owner might start to show signs of panic or anxiety when the owner picks up car keys or puts on a coat because those are signs that the thing the dog fears might be about to happen. The critical thing to realize is that the owner does not actually have to leave the house for the anxiety symptoms to begin. The dog just has to somehow associate the owner's actions with its fear.

, If your dog primarily shows signs of anxiety, including barking and property destruction, when you are away from home, consider setting up a video camera to record the dog when you are gone.This will allow you and your veterinarian to properly contextualize the dog's behavior and decide if it seems to be anxious because you are gone or if something else, such as loud noises or workers outside, is upsetting the dog.

, Armed with all of the information you have collected about the behaviors and circumstances, you are ready to present the case to your veterinarian. However, most of the symptoms above also have a number of other potential causes. Your vet will discuss your log with you and perform a physical examination of your dog to rule out other possible causes of the behaviors.


If you are worried such an exam might make your dog's anxiety worse, contact the veterinarian in advance and explain your concerns. Veterinarians can offer suggestions and options—often including house calls—that can help make the process easier on your dog.

, Your vet may consider multiple options based on your dog’s specific case, ranging from steps you can take yourself up to seeing a veterinary behavioral specialist. Follow your vet’s recommendations closely and keep him or her up to date regarding your dog’s progress.

Pet the dog delicately.,
Exercise and play with the dog.,
Give the dog plenty of attention but don't smother it.,
Socialize the dog cautiously.",How to Build Trust with an Abused Dog2," Many dog who have been abused are hand shy, meaning that they are fearful when approached by hands.Pet your dog with your palm up under his or her head, not over the head or on the dog's rear end. It isn't an offensive motion if you use the palm up.


You want to make sure that the dog sees you coming before you pet it. While you might get closer to a fearful dog by sneaking up on it, you will not build trust that way and you might get bitten due to fear.

, You need to build up trust with an abused dog, so once again you need to be delicate with your play at first. After about a month, your dog should start to trust you. Play football, catch, races, and anything else your dog enjoys doing.


The more walks you give it, the more trust you get.

, You need to walk the line between giving the dog attention and giving the dog freedom. Keep a bit of time everyday to play with your dog. However, your attention can be stressful to a dog that is distrustful of you. Give it a break from your attention if if becomes too much for the dog.

, Your dog needs to build trust with other people and dogs, in addition to you. This can be difficult to achieve if the dog has been severely abused. Begin slowly, by letting the dog see other dogs or people at a distance. Then very gradually let your dog get closer. You will probably want to get a volunteer to be the stranger you introduce your dog to, as you don't want to scare a stranger with a possibly aggressive dog.


Once you and your dogs are nearly soul mates you might want to take getting another dog into consideration. If you cannot handle it, simply take the dog out for more walks so it can meet other dogs.
Dogs that have not been properly socialized, but have not been abused, can appear as if they have been abused.Socialize any dog that has socialization issues, as it can even help dogs that have not been abused.

Use rewards instead of punishment.,
Use counter conditioning.Counter conditioning will be helpful if your dog has specific fears.,
Train your dog in basic commands.,
Be patient.",How to Build Trust with an Abused Dog3," You want to reinforce positive behavior instead of punishment because most dogs understand the connection between actions and rewards more clearly than what they are being punished for.


Never hit a dog. If you don't like something the dog is doing a simple and calm ""no"" or Uh-uh will usually suffice.

, It works by conditioning the dog to get closer and closer to things it fears by luring it close with something it loves.


For example, if your dog is afraid of bicycles, you place your dogs favorite toy or a treat close to a bicycle. After the dog takes the bait, you gradually (over days or weeks) move the treat or toy closer to the feared item.

, This may go slowly if you have just adopted an abused dog. Just remember that if you build enough trust between you and the dog, it will eventually want to follow your command.


Begin with ""sit"" and ""come"" commands. These will set the foundation for further training, such as ""heel,"" ""lay,"" and a wide variety of others.

, An abused dog has gone through a lot of trauma and deserves some time and patience from you. It's fine to have some behavior expectations but don't be unrealistic. The dog doesn't have any reason to trust you, as they may have had strictly bad relationships with humans. Give your pup some time and show it everyday that your are trustworthy.

Remember shyness may arise from lack of socialization.,
Watch for other shy behaviors — the four Fs.,
Recognize shy behavior that stems from prior abuse.",How to Rehabilitate an Overly Shy Dog1," Dogs are shy when confronted with things they do not understand. If the dog wasn't exposed to something as a puppy, their natural reaction is to be cautious around it as an adult. Also, dogs that associate an object with fear or punishment (such as a dog struck with an umbrella), may be shy or fearful of the object (an umbrella).Dogs may become shy because of unfamiliar people, certain situations, or objects. Often this is simply because of a lack of familiarity.
Shy behavior is commonly the result of poor socialization, insufficient guidance, or even past abuse.;
, Some behaviors in particular that are indicative of shyness include the four Fs: freeze, fight, flight, and fool around. The fight and flight behaviors are fairly straightforward, as they are the same as human response to fear. Freeze is simply when the dog freezes in place in reaction to a stressor. Fool around, however, can be more complicated, but it is similar to a person laughing nervously or fidgeting. In dogs, fooling around can be wild bursts of energy, jumping, pawing, etc.

, Most dogs are shy or lack confidence because of poor socialization as a puppy, rather than physical abuse. If, however, you suspect your dog has experienced abuse, you should meet with a certified behaviourist to assess and work with your dog.


If you are bringing a new dog home, some signs of abuse may be cuts, sores, etc. If the dog has been out of the abuser's care for a long time, you may not notice sores, but there may be scars.The dog's shyness itself could be a sign of prior abuse, but you may also see hostility, aggressiveness, illness, distress, or other signs of inadequate socialization."

Do something fun with the dog.,
Give your dog a ""sacrifice"" item during the storm.,
Do not focus all your energy on consoling your dog.,
Don't scold your dog for showing fear during a storm.,
Desensitize your dog to loud noises.",How to Stop Your Dog from Being Frightened During a Storm1," The best way to change your dog's fearful behavior is to sidetrack it with an activity it enjoys. What does your dog like to do the most? Maybe it's tugging on a toy or playing catch. Whatever it is, try doing it during a storm.


You, and your dog, may get wet from walking or playing in the rain, but it will be worth it if your dog is sidetracked from its fear.
If your dog is behaving well, and responding to commands correctly, this is a great time to give it a treat. This will reinforce the good behavior, and not the bad.;
, If your dog tears things up out of fear during a storm, then give it something to focus its destructive attention on. This could be a stuffed animal, a chew toy, or a rawhide bone. Whatever you give your dog, make it something that will grab its attention and allow it to focus its nervous energy., Do not cuddle and act as its protector. This doesn't mean that you can't give it a pet, give it some comfort, and act nicely towards it as usual. You just shouldn't act as if it does have something to be afraid of. If you do this, it's going to assume that protection is needed.


In addition, if you act like the dog needs protection, your dog will also assume that you are available to protect it whenever it acts nervous and scared. This can lead to an escalation in bad behavior. If it learns that cowering in the corner during bad weather yields hugs and kisses, it may form the habit of doing that every storm.
Some animal behaviorists disagree with the idea of not comforting a distressed dog. They say that you should comfort your dog in any way that you can. This comforting should be combined with redirection, so that the dog is sidetracked from its fear., Just as you don't want to overly comfort the dog, you don't want to punish it for being scared. That only gives your dog another reason to be afraid. Remember that fear is a


Instead, go about your normal routine and act as if everything is normal. This doesn't mean ignore your dog, it just means that you should interact with it as normal.Ignoring the thunder and lightening, as well as the dog's nervousness and fear, will eventually teach your dog that nothing is wrong. This can be hard to do, however, as the dog's behavior is the meantime may be erratic and fearful.

, A dog that has extreme reactions to loud noises may respond to gradual desensitization. This means that you expose the dog to a variety of noises, gradually increasing the volume so the dog gets used to it.There are CDs that you can purchase that make the noises of a thunderstorm. Play them at various times of day, starting with the volume very low. Make it louder and louder until the dog is used to it. This will only partially desensitize the dog, since there are also electrical disturbances in a storm that can't be mimicked by a CD.
Expose a young dog to a variety of noises from an early age. If your dog is very young and is experiencing thunderstorms for the first time, you will have a much easier time keeping it calm if it is used to a wide variety of noises already.

Assess the situation.,
Pin the dog on their side.,
Hold the dog down.,
Release them after a few seconds.,
Avoid growling or eye contact.",How to Alpha Roll an Aggressive Dog2," If you absolutely feel as if there is no other way to calm down your dog, you can try the traditional alpha roll. This should be a situation where the dog will not listen to commands or where you cannot remove the dog from the situation.Yawning, staring, licking their tongue, or tensing their body are signs that a dog might bite. The best thing you can do in this situation is stay still and avoid eye contact until the dog relaxes. An alpha roll may increase your chances of being bitten., The goal is to force the dog onto their side. Lean over the dog, and lift their front legs. Gently nudge them until they are on their side. Do not slam the dog against the ground.If the dog is threatening to bite you, do not do this. Your face will be very close to theirs, putting you in a vulnerable position to be bitten.
Small dogs can be picked up and rolled over.The larger the dog, the more difficult it will be to roll them over, and the more dangerous it may be to provoke them with a rollover.
A submissive dog will voluntarily expose their belly to someone they trust. Dogs who are forced to roll over will often fight back., Hold them down by placing a flat hand on their chest or neck. Do not squeeze or choke the dog. If you splay your fingers, you can keep them pinned without using much force or pressure.Do not hold a snarling or snapping dog by the muzzle or your hand may be bitten., Contrary to some advice, you should not hold down your dog until they calm down. This will increase their fear, and it could even make them more aggressive. You only need to hold them down for a few seconds. Once you release them, walk away for a few minutes before you interact with your dog again.If your dog urinates, this means that you have frightened them.Release them immediately. Fear is not an effective training tool, and it cause your dog to act unpredictably aggressive in the future.

, Growling at your dog or making aggressive eye contact will only increase their aggression. It will not calm them down, and it may provoke them into attacking you. It can also damage your relationship with your dog in the long term, as your dog may grow to be afraid of you.Hitting your dog or pulling on a choke chain can also increase aggression in a dog."
"
Reward the dog for good behavior.,
Praise the dog.,
Limit exposure to triggers.,
Seek advice from a dog behaviorist.",How to Alpha Roll an Aggressive Dog3," Treats are a powerful training tool that can reward your dog for appropriate behavior. It will train them to associate certain acts with positive emotions.If you give your dog a treat after they successfully complete a command, they will be more obedient when you state this command in the future and more likely to listen to you in aggressive situations.


Do not use treats to distract or lure your dog away from a target or when they are in an aggressive mood as this can reward them for that behavior. Use treats only when they are calm.

, If your dog did something right, tell them. Use a happy, gentle tone as you praise their behavior. Be sure to pet them as you do so. The dog will pick up on the signal and understand that this is the appropriate way to act.Shouting or yelling at the dog can increase aggression. If the dog is an aggressive state, yelling at the dog may worsen the situation., In some cases, aggressive behavior cannot be completely controlled. If you know that your dog is aggressive towards strangers or if your dog has a tendency to lunge at small children or animals, you can prevent a bad situation by removing the dog from these circumstances.


Confine the dog in a separate room while guests are over.
Keep the dog on a leash when going outside of your home.
Make sure that children and other animals do not have access to their food bowl or toys., A behaviorist is a special type of trainer that helps teach both the dog and the owner appropriate socializing techniques. This can prevent aggression in the dog and help the owner communicate effectively with the dog. Each behaviorist can tailor the program towards the specific dog and owner. Seek a behaviorist who excels in positive training techniques, as these have been proven to be the most effective.You can ask your vet for a recommendation for a behaviorist. Your vet may also be able to recommend hormone therapy or other ways to manage your dog’s aggression.Aggression is one of the most common reasons that people seek out dog behaviorists."

Be sure not to unconsciously reinforce shyness.,
Find what triggers shy behavior.,
Assess the dog's tolerance level.,
Try counter conditioning.,
Add motion to stressors during desensitization.,
Add noise to desensitization exercises.",How to Rehabilitate an Overly Shy Dog2," If you notice any signs of clingy behavior, for instance, when confronted with stressors, be careful not to accidentally praise the dog as this rewards the fearful behavior. Instead, ignore the shy behavior (so you don't reward it) and praise any ""brave"" actions by the dog such as taking a step closer or going to investigate.

, Triggers, specifically, are what we call those things that cause your dog to exhibit shy behavior.Examples of triggers include men, women, people with deep voices, people with beards, vacuum cleaner, bicycle etc. Triggers may not even be humans; they could be hair dryers or slick flooring or pretty much anything. Observe the dog's behavior and, if needed, keep a journal for a few days to figure out specifically what the trigger to shy behavior is.


In short, anything has the potential to be a trigger if the dog didn't encounter it during their socialization period an have a good experience with it.

, Without deliberately stressing the dog, observe at what distance from the feared object the dog starts to become uncomfortable with its presence. This is important because you will use distance from the object to help desensitize the dog to the object., The aim of counter conditioning is for the dog to relearn how to react to an object they fear or are suspicious of. This means teaching them to associate a pleasant experience (typically a treat or praise) when they are calm in the presence of the object.


Teach the response you want away from the stressor. A good example would be""Sit"" or ""Look"" for eye contact.
Expose the dog to the stressor well within his tolerance, and ask for the trained behavior and reinforce. For instance, if he gets upset when a bearded man is walking on his side of the street, have a friend with a beard stand across the street and ask your dog to sit, then praise him and give him treats.
Slowly decrease distance from the dog, advancing when your dog is fully confident in doing the trained behavior.
This will become an automatic response after a period of time and you will notice he will voluntarily offer the behavior when he sees the stressor, distracting him and making the stressor into an opportunity for reinforcement instead of a predictor of bad things.Desensitization can go beyond simple exposure to the stressor to include motion and auditory desensitization (see below).

, Slowly add increasingly more motion to stressors. This adds a new dimension to the dog's ability to tolerate stressors.


Next, move the stressor while it is in close proximity to the dog. Combining movement and proximity intensifies desensitization.
For instance, if the dog is shy around a specific object, like a newspaper, let him become comfortable with its presence, perhaps by leaving a newspaper by his food bowl. When he is comfortable, you can then begin moving it around on the floor near him with your foot while he eats.

, Using the newspaper example, you could hide cellophane inside the newspaper, and, as you move it around with your foot, the sound of the cellophane crinkling inside adds noise. This, along with the proximity of the newspaper and you moving it around, can help desensitize the dog to the stressor, minimizing or even eradicating his shyness around the stressor.

Reward the dog with treats.,
Encourage socialization with other dogs.,
Build trust with traumatized dogs.,
Respect a traumatized dog.",How to Rehabilitate an Overly Shy Dog3," If the dog is performing a desired behavior such as being relaxed, improving confidence, etc., give him a treat. This will help him make a connection between you and good things, but, in particular, it will reinforce that good things happen when he isn't exhibiting shy behavior. This is called positive reinforcement, and it is very effective and highly recommended for shy dogs.Be sure to accompany treats with praise.

, If you notice your dog is shy around other dogs, find a very friendly and easygoing dog with whom to socialize your dog. Introduce the two dogs very briefly at first—at a distance—and monitor the interaction on leashes. Re-introduce the dogs daily, building up the time spent together.


Consider positive progressive agility or obedience training as another good place to meet new dogs and situations.

, There are several ways to build trust with dogs who have experienced past trauma, which is important to helping your dog stop exhibiting shy behavior. If you have a dog that is showing signs of trauma, do your best to build trust with the dog to minimize shyness.


Trauma can result from many different circumstances, including mistreatment or abuse, time spent living feral, or even life in a so-called puppy mill, where the dog may be bred repeatedly but not receive love from humans., Speak calmly, but do not pet the dog. Allow the dog time to adjust to his surroundings. He may mark territory — even inside — but be patient and careful with discipline.


Traumatized dogs may benefit from having a quiet place all to themselves indoors. If you have other pets, you should expose the traumatized animal to them carefully, but make sure the quiet space is off-limits to other pets.
Desensitize traumatized dogs to individuals they are shy around by having those people feed and play with him or her while you ignore the dog.

Block out as much of the noise and light as possible.,
Drown out the impact of the storm.,
Give your dog a safe space to hide in.,
Put a body wrap on the dog.,
Use dryer sheets to eliminate static on your dog's coat.",How to Stop Your Dog from Being Frightened During a Storm2," If you can minimize the amount of the storm that the dog experiences, it may reduce the dog's discomfort. Close curtains, especially if you have blackout curtains, and move the dog to a room in your home where you can hear the thunder the least.


Doing this in combination with distracting the dog with its favorite toy or game can really alleviate a dog's fear response.

, For example, if your dog is afraid of lightening, try turning on a light in the room your dog is in. This will minimize the impact of the lightening.


Turn on music, or some other kind of noise, to drown out the noise of the thunder. If your dog can't hear it very well, the dog is likely to be less fearful.

, This may be its crate or under the covers in your bed. Dogs naturally look for a den to hide in, so give it that space.If your dog goes into its crate, consider covering it with a blanket to muffle the sounds of the storm further.
Make sure that your dog can get into its den area without your assistance. This will allow it this comfort whether or not you are home.

, There are several products on the market that are basically coats to put on your dog. These coats put gentle pressure on the dog's body, which calms it immensely.Calming body wraps are sold in most pet stores and online. When you are purchasing one, be sure to get the correct size for your dog.

, It may sound weird, but many dogs dislike lightning because it causes static in their fur. Rubbing your dog down with a dryer sheet will help make the uncomfortable sensations go away. It may even help the dog get back to sleep if it wakes up due to the storm.


Do not let the dog chew dryer sheets. Once you rub it on your dog's coat, put it out of reach of the dog. It can make a dog very sick.

Try using pheromones.,
Give your dog natural calming remedies.There is no scientific evidence that calming tonics, such as homeopathic remedies.,

The come in plug-in diffusers and can also be applied to a bandana around your dog's neck.Researchers are investigating which hormones work best for calming distressed dogs. One researcher has used a hormone emitted by mother dogs to calm their puppies to great effect with dogs scared of storms., However, many pet owners swear by them and they are worth trying if they can possibly calm your dog.

, If the dog's anxiety level is so high that it destroys the house trying to find refuge from the storm, or it spreads anxiety to other dogs in the house, ask a veterinarian about having a sedative on hand to deal with this. To get a strong medication for your dog, you will need a prescription from a veterinarian."

Wait until your dog shows no sign of fear at each stage before moving closer.,
Walk your dog near traffic.,
Train your dog to walk a particular route.",How to Deal With Your Dog's Fear of Vehicles1," If you tense up every time a car passes, afraid of your dog’s reaction, your dog will notice. Your anxiety will reinforce his own. Instead, use a cheerful tone of voice and smile as you deal with passing traffic.Do not pet and soothe your anxious dog. Petting is a reward, so petting him when he is anxious will only reinforce the behavior.
Do not scold or physically punish your dog for being afraid. Yelling at him will only intensify his fear.Do not try to “cure” your dog by making him confront his fear. This will only increase his fear, not remove it.;
, Your dog might bark or lunge at the end of the leash when a car passes, but this is only an extreme display of anxiety. To train him, you’ll need to know when he is even mildly anxious, so you can go slow, and when he is relaxed, so you can move on to the next step.


Common signs of fear are trembling, panting, whining, drooling, cowering, and tucking his tail.Signs that your dog is relaxed include relaxed posture, normal breathing, tails and ears held normally (not tucked or lowered), wagging, and eating at a normal pace., Start by opening the windows when you are playing with your dog or feeding him, so that he can start to associate the noise of cars with pleasurable activities., Once or twice a day, take your dog to a place in a park or a part of your yard that is far enough away from the street that your dog shows no fearful reaction when a car passes.


Reward your dog with treats every time a car passes and praise him for staying calm.
Do this for about a minute, then go inside or walk around the park for a couple of minutes before returning to the traffic for another minute.
In all, expose your dog to traffic for a minute at a time, 5 or 6 times per training session.
For the next session, increase the time your dog is exposed to traffic to 1.5 minutes. Continue gradually increasing the time from session to session., Giving your dog something to do can help to distract him from passing cars. As you gradually move closer to traffic, start giving a command like “touch” or “look here” whenever you see a car coming. Give your dog a treat when he obeys.If your dog is not able to focus on you or obey your commands because of traffic, take a break, move further from the traffic, and try again.

, Sometimes it might take 2 or 3 weeks of training before your dog relaxes at a given distance. Other times it might happen in days. Always wait until your dog is relaxed and calm before moving closer.

, Once your dog can deal with near-by passing cars while standing still, it’s time to start practicing while walking. However, if the dog shows signs of fear, do not force him to continue as this will only heighten and reinforce his anxiety. Bring plenty of treats, and just as you did while stationary, have your dog perform a command whenever you see a car coming. Give your dog a treat when he obeys.

, For extremely fearful dogs, it is often best to start with one particular route where they feel safe. If your dog is still having trouble walking near cars, consider conditioning him to walk a particular route – such as the path to your local park.Teach your dog to walk home first. Drive a quarter block from home along the path you will take, get out and walk home. If your dog pulls out of fear, stop and wait for him to stop pulling before you start again. Moving towards “safety” is his reward for good behavior. Be sure to keep distracting and treating your dog whenever cars pass.
Each day, drive a quarter of a block further away along the path until you are driving him to the park and walking him home. Spend 1-2 weeks walking your dog home from the park.
Next, teach your dog to walk to the park. Start by parking a quarter block from the park, walk him there, play, and then walk home.
Continue adding a quarter block to your walk to the park each day until you are leaving from your home, walking to the park, and walking home.

, Your dog can sense anxiety. If you are upset, your dog will know, and this will only make matters worse. During a storm, give your dog no indications that something is wrong. Follow the same routine you would any other night. Smile and speak in a calm, reassuring tone.


Even reassuring the dog can convince it that something is wrong. Help your dog by being calm and happy, not by overloading it with sympathy.
Soft singing can help calm some dogs.

, Find a small ""safe spot"" for the dog to hide. Ideally, this spot will block light and noise, while allowing the dog to be near its owner. Here are a few options:


Under a table or bed
In a dog crate, with a blanket draped over it
In a closet or windowless bathroom

, Try wrapping a garment around your dog or let the dog huddle under your arm on the sofa. Your dog may feel reassured by the added pressure, much like a baby feels safe when swaddled. If this seems to help, consider buying a special anti-anxiety garment, such as the Thundershirt or Anxiety Wrap. The garment should be snug around the dog's chest, but make sure you get one in the correct size for the best result, to ensure the acupressure points throughout the body are being targeted, and to avoid injuring your dog.


Some of these garments (Anxiety Wrap) press against acupressure points associated with stress relief.
If you're in hot weather conditions and are concerned about your dog overheating, some garments (Anxiety Wrap) can be moistened with water. The air flowing through the moistened fabric will act as a cooling agent. Always supervise your dog if you're concerned about health/safety.
Some of these garments are also appropriate to put on your dog and help him/her stay calm if you need to leave the house. Consult the product directions for safety information.

, A loud television, music, or other source of noise (washing machine) can help drown out the thunder. Choose a sound your dog finds familiar and comforting.


Covering the dog's ears can also help.

, If possible, keep your dog away from windows, or put up heavy curtains. Seeing the flash of lightning can be an additional source of anxiety. Block the dog's access to exits, since some scared dogs may try to run away or harm visitors.

, Encourage your dog to participate in indoor activities. You could play fetch or put on music and dance together. Try to find an activity that will turn your dog’s attention away from the storm.

, These include herbal and homeopathic remedies to treat anxiety. Always use remedies specifically intended for dogs. Some essential oils that work for humans may cause discomfort or injury in animals. Less concentrated doses are usually required as well.


Be sure to consult your veterinarian before using, the oils are very concentrated and can be harmful to your skin as well as your dog's. They can also damage furniture.
Lavender is one popular option that seems to help dogs, when used in the correct dose.Another option is petting your dog with a dryer sheet- it reduces static.

, If these methods are ineffective, ask your vet about anti-anxiety medications. Your dog can take some medications such as amitriptyline for the duration of the storm season. There are also quick-acting medications such as acepromazine (""Ace"") or diazepam that can be taken for individual storms.To be effective, quick-acting medications must be administered before your dog exhibits any behavioral changes.
Never give a dog medication without consulting a veterinarian first.

, To teach your dog that storms are nothing to fear, play a recording of a thunderstorm on very low volume for several hours, once a week. Each week, if the dog shows no signs of agitation, turn up the volume slightly. It can take a long time for your dog to adapt, but eventually your dog may learn not to fear thunder.


If this agitates your dog too much, start with 5–10 minute daily sessions instead.

, Give your dog a treat or a toy when it shows calm behavior during a storm, or when it obeys a command despite its fear. Train it to respond to a ""relax,"" ""calm,"" or ""settle"" command.


Training your dog with an indoor leash is also highly effective. For example, treat your house like an indoor obstacle course and lead your dog around asking him/her to perform certain commands. If at any time this appears to be causing more stress, stop, and work on calming your dog. , To curb stress and anxiety, engage with your dog before the storm hits. Prepare indoor activities, and make sure your dog’s safe place is set up.

Avoid reinforcing bad behavior.,
Break down hyperactive episodes.,
Lavish your dog with praise for good behavior.",How to Calm a Hyperactive Dog1," Attention of any kind can be bad if your dog is acting out or being hyperactive- dogs tend to value bad attention over no attention at all. If your pet is behaving in an unwanted way, stay calm and firm- to express your disapproval, distance yourself from your dog and leave the room if necessary. Once this reaction is repeated enough times for your dog to register it, it will be understood as the negative consequence of its bad, hyperactive behavior.Note that when you first attempt to ignore your dog's bad behavior, it might increase in severity temporarily.;
, When your dog gets too hyper, take the time to break down exactly what bad behaviors need to be addressed. In the moment, remain calm and firm to avoid exacerbating the situation. Later, you can concentrate on training your dog out of these problems.


For instance, if your hyper dog jumps on people, train it to sit instead. Set up ""practice"" scenarios and keep your dog on its leash, in the house, to better control its actions; repeat this regularly and reward it when it sits, and refrains from jumping on anyone.

, When your dog is calm and well-behaved, lavish it with love, praise, petting, and treats. Increasing positive associations when your dog is acting in the way you want it to is necessary to let it know that this behavior is good. Attention earned by good behavior will result in more good behavior."

Bring the dog indoors, and close all windows and doors. Draw the curtains so the dog can't see the flashes. If appropriate (not during an electrical storm) put the TV on with the volume low, to act as a distraction. Remember to act normally and go about your normal business so as to send out the message that everything is OK and you aren't worried., A fearful dog instinctively wants to hide. If the dog chooses to go to ground and hide under a bed or behind a sofa then let it. You may wish to provide additional security by laying a blanket over the edge of the bed to provide additional sound insulation.


If the dog is crate trained, it may wish to go to its crate. Cover most of the crate with a thick blanket so that it is even more cave-like and secure than normal. Place something with your scent on it inside the crate to add to the dog's feelings of security.If your dog is not crate trained then consider doing so as part of your strategy for helping him overcome this fear.

, When a lot of fireworks are anticipated plug-in DAP diffuser in your house beforehand. These devices give off a synthetic dog pheromone that makes dogs feel safe and secure. The diffusers help to give an anxious dog heightened feelings of security, and can diffuse some of its anxiety.

, These work by fitting the dog snugly and pressing against its body. This is akin to swaddling a young baby, which gives a sense of security and safety. For some dogs it takes the edge off of the anxiety and helps to bolster their confidence., Some dogs are so fearful they try to escape, harm themselves, or lose control of their bladder or bowels. If your dog has this type of extreme anxiety then get it checked by your vet. If there is no medical explanation for the dog's extreme fear, then the vet may be able to prescribe medications to calm the dog during the event.


There is no one drug that is perfect, but one useful combination is diazepam and propranolol. Diazepam is a tranquilizer, which lessens the feelings of anxiety, while propranolol is a beta blocker, which prevents the heart from racing. This combination helps to keep the animal relaxed during a scary event.Acepromazine (ACP) sedates the dog but it still experiences the fear. So externally the dog seems improved, but it is still fearful. This is why this drug has fallen out of favor.

Offer your dog a favorite toy and play with it before you leave.,
Play it cool when you come and go.,
Switch up your exit routine.,
Give your dog more exercise.,
Crate train your dog.",How to Avoid Separation Anxiety in Newly Adopted Dogs1," Spend some time playing with your dog before heading out so it will be in a positive mood before you leave. Choose a couple favorite toys to play with for 15 minutes or so before departing.Puzzle or food-dispensing toys are especially useful when trying to keep your dog occupied and avoid giving it anxiety when you leave the house. A toy might take about 20 minutes for your dog to figure out, and by the time it does, it will tire and rest until you return.;
, Try not to make a big deal about greeting your dog or saying goodbye when you enter and leave the house. Do your best to avoid indications that you’re leaving in order to keep your dog’s arousal level at a minimum. While some owners might offer low-key hellos and goodbyes, consider leaving the greetings out altogether., Try keeping your keys in your bag, keeping your coat in a different location, or leaving the house without wearing a coat or bringing a bag. Randomly change your exit routine so your dog doesn’t come to associate you putting on a coat or the sound of keys with being alone.Make sure to keep mixing up your routine instead of just changing it once in order to desensitize your dog.

, Exercise can be an effective way of avoiding both canine boredom and separation anxiety. Depending on its breed or mix of breeds, your dog will, on average, require at least an hour of exercise daily.Consider increasing the length of your walks, and try to vary the locations you walk your dog. Switching up its walk will expose it to more sights and smells, which will keep your dog stimulated and curb boredom.

Command training and games like fetch and hide and seek with treats can give your dog beneficial mental exertion in addition to physical exercise. A combination of physical and mental exercise can help prevent anxiety and increase the chance that your dog will rest until you return.

, Since dogs are den animals, they find safety and security in enclosed spaces. You should consider crate training your new dog, especially if it’s a puppy. However, be sure that you don’t treat the crate as a form of punishment.Avoid putting your dog in a crate if it exhibits signs of severe separation anxiety and you’re afraid that it might injure itself. If your dog has tried to escape, is extremely destructive, or is an older dog that has never been crated, use desensitization training and consider talking to a trainer instead of using a crate.

Check for travel sickness before assuming your dog is afraid of the car for any other reasons.,
Make your car comfortable for your dog.,
Watch for signs of fear and of relaxation in your dog.,
Do not take your dog on car trips if he is afraid.,
Start by teaching your dog to approach the car without fear.,
Train your dog to spend time in the car while it is not moving.,
Turn the ignition on.,
Move the car a few feet and back.,
Take short, fun trips.,
Add more fun destinations.,
Drive on the highway.",How to Deal With Your Dog's Fear of Vehicles2," If not addressed, a simple case of motion sickness can be compounded by anxiety brought on by associating the car with sickness. See your vet for advice about medication that can alleviate the motion sickness.Some symptoms of motion sickness include:Whining and pacing
Excessive drooling
Lethargy
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, Creating an environment that is comfortable and enjoyable for your dog will make overcoming his fears much easier and in some cases, may solve your dog’s dislike of the car.Ensure that his harness fits properly or that his crate is the right size.
Provide a blanket or toy that is special for your dog to help reassure him and to give him something to concentrate on.
Ensure adequate air flow and a cool temperature. Never leave your dog in a car with the windows closed because the car will overheat and can kill your dog.
Get rid of air fresheners. Any overwhelming smell in a car can be too much for your dog’s sensitive nose. Also avoid wearing too much perfume in the car.

, To train him, you’ll need to know when he is uncomfortable, so you can back off, and when he is relaxed, so you can move on to the next step.


Dogs who are afraid will often tremble, pant, whine, drool, cower, or tuck their tails.Relaxed dogs will adopt a relaxed posture, breath normally, hold their tails and ears normally (not tucked or lowered), wag, and eat at a normal pace., Trips in the car will only reinforce his fear, so avoid them, save for emergencies, until you've overcome his fear through desensitization (making him less sensitive to the experience) and counterconditioning (creating pleasant associations with the car to replace the negative ones)., When you go for a walk, give your dog a treat as you pass near the car. Play games like fetch or tug-of-war near the car. Feed your dog near the car, starting further away and moving the bowl progressively closer. When your dog shows no anxiety while eating or walking near your car, you are ready for the next step., You may need to lure your dog into the car with treats at first. While he is in the car continue to give treats or give him a chew bone or treat filled KONG. Leave the door open, and take these treats away when your dog leaves the car. Practice this once or twice a day for a week or two.If it the engine starting that frightens your dog, try turning the car on before he gets in. You can attempt to desensitize him, or simply continue starting the car before putting your dog in it.
When your dog is comfortable in the car, start closing the door.
As your dog’s comfort increases, try feeding him in the car.

, Once your dog is comfortable in the car, try starting it with him in it. If your dog shows anxiety, then you might want to desensitize him. Start by starting the car with your dog nearby, but not in it. Have someone give treats as the car starts. Once your dog is comfortable, move him into the car and repeat the process., Drive your car down the driveway or a few feet down the street. Stop and with the engine running give your dog some treats or have a quick play session. Move back to your parking spot and end the session. Continue this until your dog is totally relaxed during these sessions., You want to make your dog’s first training drives in the car short, with a fun destination – preferably a park or hiking trail your dog enjoys. If there is one within a block or two, head there. If not, get in your car without your dog and drive it to within one or two blocks of your destination. Then, walk your dog to the car and drive the short remaining distance. Afterwards, walk your dog home.Continue until your dog is comfortable with this short trip.
Park further and further away as your dog grows comfortable in the car.

, You want your dog to see the car not as a place of fear, but as a place of treats leading to wonderful destinations. Once your dog can handle short trips, try gradually longer ones to places he loves like friend’s houses, pet stores, or other parks.

, Uninterrupted motion makes dogs sleepy and will help your dog to relax in the car. The highway is a great way to get your dog accustomed to longer trips in a relaxed manner."

Familiarize your puppy with the vehicle as early as possible.,
Teach your puppy that the car is a fun place.,
Get your puppy accustomed to being restrained in either a crate or under a harness for travel.,
Start with short rides.,
Take your dog to places he likes.,
Have your dog get in and out of the car by himself as soon as he can.",How to Deal With Your Dog's Fear of Vehicles3," A puppy under three months will be easier to train to get used to a vehicle than an older dog. The best way to overcome fear of your car is to avoid it in the first place with early training., Before you take any trips with your puppy, introduce him to the car so that he can grow accustomed to it. Especially in the summer, make sure the car is running so you can keep it cool. This will also help your dog grow accustomed to the sound of the motor. To help your puppy get comfortable:Place a bed on the seat so your dog is comfortable and doesn’t slip on the upholstery.
Feed you your puppy meals in the car.
Give your dogs treats, such as a stuffed KONG or bone to chew on.

, Always travel with your dog restrained for his safety. When introducing your dog to the car, it is important that he wear the same restraint he will when traveling, or go in a carrier if that is how you will transport him.


If using a harness, you can practice putting it on in your home before trying it in the car. Give your dog lots of treats when you put it on, then take it off. Gradually increase the amount of time he wears it, eventually giving him a bone or chew toy to play with while in the harness.
If using a crate, you should crate train your dog before trying the crate in the car.

, Dogs often suffer from motion sickness during their first few car rides, so you’ll want to keep your puppies first trips short. Start with just going in and out of the driveway and gradually build up to more.For the first 2-3 days, just back out of the driveway or drive a few feet down the street, then return to you parking place. Do this once or twice a day.
Next, try driving around the block for a couple of days.
Move on to a five minute drive. As long as your dog shows no signs of anxiety – panting, trembling, whining, cowering, or drooling – you can slowly increase the lengthy of trips over several weeks.

, If you only use the car to take your dog to the vet, your dog is not going to like the car. Especially when you dog is a puppy, try to have most car trips end somewhere fun, like the park, the hiking trail, a pet store, a friend’s house, or a dog park. If your dog is anticipating the destination, he won’t mind the drive so much., Especially for bigger breeds, teaching your dog to get in and out by himself will save you a lot of back pain when he is full grown.


Getting In – Pick a command word like “in” for entering the car. If necessary, use treats to lure your dog into the car at first. Be sure to use the command word as your dog enters, so he starts to associate the word with the action.
Getting Out – Pick a command word like “out”. It is very important to teach you dog to wait to leave the car until asked. Teach your dog “wait” at home. Have your dog wait in the car, then get out on command. Practice with a leash on at first, to be sure your dog won’t run off.

Take your dog on an intensive walk.,
Let your dog run free.,
Play games.,
Buy your dog a treat release toy.,
Consider some help from kids.",How to Calm a Hyperactive Dog2," To overhaul your dog's hyperactivity, take it for a vigorous walk; rather than quelling your dog's energy, this is a way of repurposing it to avoid bad behaviour. The exercise can calm your dog's nerves and leave it happily exhausted. Try walking in a park or field rather than a busy street- the lack of stimuli like traffic, crowds, and city noises will allow your dog to relax more., If possible, bring your dog to a fenced in yard or local dog park where it can run around without a leash. Running freely and being actively engaged can help burn off your dog's pent-up energy and frustration. Socialization with other dogs may also allow for play and enjoyment that your dog would not otherwise get., Activity that engages your dog physically and mentally might be the ticket to neutralizing its hyperactivity. Hyperactive dogs are not merely energetic dogs, but dogs who lack focus, are easily distracted, or are highly impulsive. Playing games with your dog, which will allow it time to unwind but also require its focus, is one way to channel energy in a positive way.Games suitable for helping a hyper dog may include:


fetch: a classic game that you can vary by using different objects
frisbee: another classic game that requires agility and concentrationtug of war: a basic game that should incorporate the use of commands (e.g. ""Get it"" and ""let go"")

, Treat release toys require your dog to focus and engage with the toy in order to access the treats inside. They are a good solution for boredom, which can lead your pet to hyperactive behavior. Choose a model that is size appropriate for your dog and made of good quality, safe materials (i.e. non-toxic substances like rubber).Be sure to choose a model that is easy to clean so you can wash the toy regularly. Dispose of any uneaten food that remains inside for more than a few hours.

, Since kids have boundless energy, it may be a perfect idea to have them play with your hyper dog to tire it out and prevent hyperactivity. Make sure that your dog and the children have a good rapport, and that your dog respects the children (and vice-versa); if your dog has a tendency to jump all over people, be sure to supervise the play closely. Note that, since dogs have a tendency to mirror the behavior of humans close to them, a child’s excitement may spark your dog’s hyperactivity. Make sure that excitement levels stay in check, and that neither the dog nor the kids get aggressive. Avoid letting your dog play with children that you don't know, or trust to be respectful and responsible with your pet.

Consider your own emotions.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Practice ""quiet time"" with your dog.,
Seek help if necessary.,
Feed your dog the best possible diet.",How to Calm a Hyperactive Dog3," Dogs tend to reflect back their owner's energy, so think about your own mood and behavior when analyzing your dog's. Your own nervous or anxious mood may be adversely affecting your dog, meaning that helping yourself also means helping your pet. Portraying calm, assertive confidence for your dog will definitely help them and will likely benefit you as well., Aromatherapy has gained acceptance as a way to relieve anxiety and stress in humans, and it is also a viable option for pets. Dogs experience life largely through scent so aromatherapy can be helpful, especially in relieving stress that might manifest itself as hyperactivity. A calming scent like lavender could make a world of difference for your hyperactive dog.Be careful not to overdo it with aromatherapy oils; dogs are incredibly responsive to smell and could suffer an allergic reaction.

, Get your dog accustomed to periods of quiet, relaxed time with you or another family member. Introducing this kind of calm to your dog may encourage it to behave. Try to exercise with your dog right beforehand to reduce its anxiety before attempting ""quiet time"", which could include:


lounging in the living room with a favorite chew toy
resting comfortably with you while you watch a movie or read

, There is no shame in seeking an expert opinion if your efforts to calm your hyperactive dog don't work. A vet can determine whether physical, hormonal, or physiologic factors are responsible for your pet's hyperactivity and prescribe medication or other treatments accordingly. If this is not the case, a dog trainer may be able to help improve your dog's erratic behavior., Your dog's hyper behavior could be attributed to an allergy to its food- most commercial pet food is full of additives, including by-products, pesticides, preservatives, and food coloring. They are also filled with cheap ingredients like inferior meat and corn, rice and soy. Discuss feeding options with your vet- to avoid food intolerances that could contribute to your dog's erratic behavior, a vet might suggest feeding it a diet of healthy, raw food."

Act normally.,
Never force a dog to face its fears head on.,
Expose the dog to a very low level of the feared sound.,
Gradually increase the volume of the feared sound.,
Expose the dog to the CD sounds on a daily basis.",How to Help a Dog Overcome a Fear of Fireworks or Thunder2," It is important that the owner ignores any fearful behavior the dog is displaying. While it is perfectly natural to want to reassure an animal in distress, in reality it trains the dog to give in to the distressed behavior. Retraining is doomed from the start unless you understand this.By acting unconcerned you send out a strong message that you are not worried and therefore the dog has nothing to be fearful of.

, In other words, don't take a fearful dog to a fireworks show and expect it to adjust. This is a technique called sensory flooding and it is inhumane. The dog is bombarded by what it fears and instead of overcoming that fear, the dog may become traumatized and emotionally damaged instead.

, Train the dog to remain calm during the sound by rewarding calm behavior with a treat or affection.This is different than sensory flooding because you are using very low levels of sound and working gradually.


To do this, purchase a CD of the sound the dog fears, for example fireworks or thunderstorms. The idea is to play the CD on the lowest possible volume so that the dog remains calm. Praise the dog and reward it for being calm in the presence of the sounds.
If possible, leave the CD playing quietly in the background for an hour at a time but don't leave the dog alone while it is playing.

, Once the dog is regularly taking no notice of the quiet background sounds, turn the volume up a tiny amount. This should be slightly louder than previously, but not enough to make the dog shows signs of anxiety, such as lip licking, pacing, whining, shivering, or shaking.


Again, reward the dog with love or treats for being in the presence of the alarming noise, but not being fearful of it.
Repeat this exposure until you are sure the dog is not reacting at all, and then you are ready to turn the volume up one more notch.

, If at any stage the dog becomes fearful, restart the next session with the volume one notch lower. Don't forget to act very relaxed yourself while doing this training. The dog needs to see that you are unconcerned.


It may take a large amount of time, but with determination and dedication, it is possible to help your dog overcome its fear of fireworks or thunder.

Consider the care required for a new puppy.,
Decide how you will care for the puppy and your pregnant dog.,
Think about if your dog will get along with a new puppy.,
Look for a puppy that is compatible with your dog.,
Try to get the puppy early into your dog’s pregnancy.,
Make sure the puppy has a clean bill of health.,
Introduce the dogs with a walk.,
Set up separate areas for the dogs.,
Watch for signs of stress in either dog.,
Socialize the dogs together.,
Isolate your puppy from your dog.,
Keep the puppy away from the litter.",How to Add a Puppy to the Family Whilst Your Dog Is Pregnant," Before you dive into getting a new puppy, you should consider the care required for a new puppy. You should also consider if you will have enough time and energy to take care of a new puppy and take care of your pregnant dog. You must be responsible enough to take care of the puppy and also still fulfill the demands of caring for your pregnant dog.A new puppy will require a visit to the vet as well as feedings two to four times a day, depending on how young the puppy is. You will also need to commit to taking your puppy out to go to the bathroom and work on potty training your puppy.
You will need to do obedience training with your new puppy to ensure it is well trained and spend lots of time playing with the puppy so it learns how to be social. You should also observe the puppy for any signs of illness or injury, as puppies can be fragile and susceptible to falling ill.;
, Once you have thought more about the care required for the new puppy, you should decide how you will be able to cover the responsibility of caring for the puppy and caring for your pregnant dog. You should also consider how you will have enough time to care for the puppy, the pregnant dog, and the litter of puppies, once they are born.You may enlist the help of family members in your home or roommates who can assist you in the care of the puppy and the pregnant dog. You should make sure you have individuals who are willing to commit to helping you take care of the puppy while you focus on the pregnant dog.
You should make sure you have enough time in your day to fulfill the duties of caring for a new puppy and for the pregnant dog. You may look at your current schedule and list of responsibilities to make sure you will have enough time to take care of both animals.

, You should also consider your pregnant dog’s temperament and whether she will respond well to a new puppy in her home. Pregnant dogs can get overly tired and are not as active as other dogs. Having a new puppy could be overstimulating for your pregnant dog, especially if she was pretty docile to begin with.You may want to consider fostering a puppy, rather than getting one out right, to see if your pregnant dog can handle a new puppy in her space. Fostering a puppy will allow you to try out having a puppy around your pregnant dog and gives you the flexibility of not keeping the puppy if your pregnant dog does not react well to it.

, You should consider how your puppy will fit in with your pregnant dog, as this will make the addition much easier. Think about the temperament of your pregnant dog. Is your pregnant dog high energy or pretty docile? Does your pregnant dog often nap and rest? If your pregnant dog is pretty docile and relaxed, you may not want to bring in a puppy who is a high-energy breed. Instead, you may opt for a puppy who comes from a more docile breed.You should think about whether your pregnant dog is dominant or assertive. Your dog may appear more dominant due to her pregnancy, so you may want to consider a puppy who is more submissive. Getting a dominant puppy could lead to tension and issues between your two pets.
You may also consider if your pregnant dog prefers playing with male or female dogs. If she seems to prefer playing with male dogs, you may opt for a male puppy. However, with the right training, your pregnant dog may be fine with co-existing with either a male or female puppy.
Size should also be a consideration, especially because your pregnant dog may be extra sensitive to being around other dogs. If your pregnant dog is a smaller breed, you may opt for a puppy that is also a smaller breed, rather than a breed that will grow to be much bigger than your pregnant dog. You may also get a puppy that is a bit older in age so it is not as small and fragile.

, You should consider getting the new puppy early in your dog’s pregnancy to give both animals time to get used to each other. The more time the two pets have to get to know each other, the better.Having more time upfront will also ensure both animals can co-exist before your pregnant dog has her litter. This will make caring for the puppy, the dog, and the litter much easier.
Avoid getting a puppy within the last three weeks of your dog’s pregnancy. Your pregnant dog will need to be isolated from all other dogs during the last three weeks, and introducing a new puppy into the household may make it difficult for both dogs to bond and socialize., Once you get the puppy, you should make sure the puppy has a full check up at the vet before you introduce it to your dog. Take your puppy to the vet as soon as you get it so you can be sure the puppy is healthy and able to be around your pregnant dog.Your vet should be able to answer any questions you may have about food for your puppy, feeding times, and portion sizes for your puppy’s meals. You may also ask the vet about introducing your puppy to your pregnant dog and how to do this well.
Your vet should also set up a vaccination plan for your puppy and discuss any illnesses or injuries you should watch out for. You should also talk to your vet about spaying or neutering your new pup.

, Taking both dogs on a short walk will allow them to be active and get to know each other in a neutral space. You should make sure both dogs are on a leash and that there is one person per dog so you are not trying to walk both dogs at once.You can keep the leashes loose and let both dogs start to get to know each other. They may smell each other briefly before or during the walk. You should try to keep both dogs moving and praise both dogs in a lighthearted tone.
You should also bring treats and reward both dogs if they remain calm and engaged in each other. If the walk goes well, you can take the dogs to a fenced in area, such as your backyard, and allow them to interact further.
Always supervise the two dogs when they are together for the first few weeks. Do not leave the dogs alone in the house, the car, or the yard, as you will need to be there to intervene if either dog gets stressed or aggressive.

, You can prevent conflicts between your puppy and your pregnant dog by setting up separate feeding and playing areas for each animal. Doing this will ensure there are no turf wars between your puppy and your adult dog. It will also make it easier for both dogs to get along.You should give each dog its own food bowl and water bowl. You may feed each dog in a separate dog crate to avoid conflicts at feeding time. Make sure you give each dog their own treats and separate bones.
You should also set up a separate sleeping area for each dog, with their own bed.

, Most puppies will be curious of adult dogs. Your puppy may end up bothering your adult dog and your adult dog may react with some playful growling or snarling at first. This is to be expected and over time both dogs should start to bond and get along. However, you should watch both dogs for signs of stress, such as staring, growling, tails lifted, forward ears, and body stiffness.If you notice your puppy or your pregnant dog acting stressed, you should call them apart and tell them to sit and stay in separate areas of the space. You may also need to put them back on separate leashes.

, Though the dogs should have separate feeding and sleeping areas, they should be socialized together. You should take them on walks together and try to get them to play together on a daily basis. Doing fun things with both dogs together will help them grow to like each other and view each other’s company in a positive way.You should also be sure to give both dogs individual attention so they feel acknowledged and loved separate of each other. You may alternate doing training with your puppy and then having a grooming session with your pregnant dog, for example, or reward each dog separately during a walk. Try to strike a balance between individual attention and activities as a threesome., In the last three weeks of your dog’s pregnancy, you should isolate her from other dogs, including your new puppy. This will ensure she is not at risk of illness or viruses that could trigger a miscarriage. Prepare for the delivery of the litter and keep your new puppy in a blocked off area so it does not get too close during the birth.Most female dogs give birth 64 days after conception and often the mother dog knows what to do by instinct. Still, you should be aware of the signs of labor in your adult dog so you are prepared.Your pregnant dog may stop eating 24 hours before labor and she may become restless leading up to the birth. She may also paw at her bedding and begin to lick her vulva. She may discharge mucus or vomit leading up to labor.

, Once your pregnant dog has her litter, you should clean her up and place the litter in a whelping box. You should also keep the puppy away from the litter until you take the litter to the vet. You should have a vet examine the litter at least 48 hours after the birth.Once the vet gives the puppies a clean bill of health, you may allow the puppy near the litter. However, you should never leave the puppy alone with the mother and the litter.

Go about your exit routine, then come back immediately.,
Repeat the training over gradually longer periods of time.,
Ask a trainer for help.,
Ask a vet about anti-anxiety medication.",How to Avoid Separation Anxiety in Newly Adopted Dogs2," Grab your keys or put on your coat and walk out the door. Then, immediately re-enter the house. Repeat this several times so the dog starts to associate any part of your exit routine with an immediate return instead of your departure.While desensitization training can be a highly effective way of treating separation anxiety, its major con is that it should be systematic and consistent. When you’re just beginning desensitization training, you can’t leave the dog alone other than when you practice exiting with an immediately return.
Try working on desensitization training during vacation time. If you live alone, consider having a family member or friend help you by staying with your dog while you’re at work. If it’s within your budget, you could also hire a dog sitter. Ask your dog’s vet, a friend, or family member for a referral, or search online for a well-reviewed local pet sitting service.

, Keep practicing the desensitization training over the course of days and weeks. Gradually increase the amount of time you spend outside before re-entering your house. Start with standing outside for a few minutes, then proceed to drive around the block or run a quick errand.For best results, the dog should not be left alone for periods of time longer than you’ve practiced. If you’ve practiced leaving your dog alone for 10 minutes, stick to that boundary until you’ve worked your way up to the next threshold.  

, When you start the desensitization routine, you might want to consult a trainer to discuss the severity of your dog’s separation anxiety. They can help customize your training routine for your specific dog. If you haven’t consulted a trainer and your dog isn’t responding to desensitization training, consider asking one for help.You can ask your dog’s vet for a referral to a trainer, or ask dog-owning friends and family. When looking for a trainer, try to find someone accredited by the International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP), the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT), or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC)., If your dog displays symptoms of separation anxiety, discuss their severity with its vet and ask them if and when medication is the preferred option. Some trainers and vets will recommend giving your dog an anti-anxiety medication in combination with desensitization training. Medication could also be your best option if you don’t have the time that a desensitization routine requires.Explain your situation in detail to the vet. For instance: “Max starts to bark as soon as I put my coat on. My neighbors tell me he howls non-stop until I get back. I’ve come back to chewed pillows and visible scratches on the door, but he’s not crate trained so I’m afraid how he’d react to a crate at this point. I’ve read about desensitization training but I live alone and don’t have time to do it properly.""
Ask the vet about the best solutions for your situation: ""Do you think anti-anxiety medication is the best option given Max's symptoms and my time constraints? Would medication be more helpful and cost-effective than hiring a pet sitter or using doggie daycare?”

Ask the shelter or rescue group about your new dog’s history.,
Try setting up a video camera while you’re gone.,
Make sure the cause isn’t incontinence or a digestion issue.",How to Avoid Separation Anxiety in Newly Adopted Dogs3," Separation anxiety is a common reason why dogs are given up and put in shelters. If it wasn’t given up by previous owners due to the the behaviors associated with separation anxiety, a dog could have been abandoned or neglected, which could also lead it to develop anxious behavior.Alternatively, a previous owner may have spent all of their time with your new dog. The dog might not be used to spending any time alone or out of its owners sight.
Try asking, “Do you know anything about my new dog’s previous owners? Does it have a history of separation anxiety or anxious behavior?”

, Barking excessively when you leave, destructive behavior, and going to the bathroom indoors can indicate separation anxiety in addition to other potential issues. If your dog exhibits these behaviors, you should consider setting up a video camera to verify your suspicions.A dog might bark excessively when you leave, then go to sleep within a few minutes. If this is the case, the problem is likely boredom rather than separation anxiety.
Similarly, if you find that your dog is calm for a while then proceeds to chew or destroy objects, it’s most likely bored.
However, if you find that your dog barks excessively and constantly howls or immediately engages in destructive behavior the entire time you’re gone, it’s probably suffering from anxiety. In addition, look to see if destruction is concentrated at your home’s exits.

, If your dog predominantly goes to the bathroom inside without destructive behavior or barking, the issue is probably not separation anxiety. Try to notice when the issue happens, like after you offer a particular treat or a certain duration after feeding time. Call your dog’s vet or bring it in for a checkup to rule out incontinence or other medical issues.Have a little patience when it comes to puppies and accidents. If you find yourself coming home to messes, keep in mind that your newly adopted puppy might not have fully developed the muscles that help it control when it goes to the bathroom.

Have fun with your multiple dog household.",How to Live in a Multi Dog Household," If you're thinking about adopting a new dog, there are a few key things to consider first, to ensure that you're going to be able to cope with a lifestyle that involves more than one dog. Every extra dog will take extra time and effort to feed, groom, exercise, and play with, as well as costing more money. And, if one dog misbehaves, it can incite the other dog to join in, leaving you with two ""Marley's"" (badly behaved dogs). Be considerate of the existing dog's needs too; if your dog is senior and unlikely to welcome the rough and tumble of a puppy due to infirmity or illness, this might not be a good time to bring a new dog into the family. On the other hand, it might be what a healthy but lazy elderly dog needs!;
, One of the wonderful benefits of having two dogs or more is that they develop bonds and entertain one another. However, you will also need to be clear from the outset that each dog means more work for you and more one-to-one bonding to ensure that your multi-dog relationships work.

, One great way to introduce your new dog to existing dogs is to take the dogs to meet her first. If they seem to get along together, then you know it's a good bet but if there are instant problems of aggression, perhaps this isn't the dog to adopt.


Don't introduce the newcomer to existing dogs on the day of arrival at home. Keep existing dogs outside and give the newcomer time to explore your home and become familiar with it first.
When you finally introduce the newcomer to the existing dogs, choose a neutral spot; basically, somewhere your current dog doesn't spend much time in. And take it slowly; it may take a while before they establish themselves.

, Let your dogs off their leashes so that they can explore one another on dog terms. Expect rear-end sniffing, nose-to-nose sniffing, and posturing (stiff leg walks, placing a leg over the other dog's shoulders, raised fur, etc.). Noises that may occur include barks, whines, and whimpers.This is ""canine socializing"" and you'd do best to keep out and just watch as most dogs will sort out this part of greeting and acceptance on their own; they work out where in the pack each dog stands while you just wait to reassure all of them that you and the other humans remain alpha! Also pay attention to whether territorial marking occurs. While it is considered a natural form of communication among dogs and a means for them to establish dominance and social standing, it could be a major nuisance if it occurs inside your home.Dog training techniques or anti-marking products such as sprays, dog diapers, and specialized dog clothes can help prevent this from being an issue.



Stay positive. Dogs pick up on negative emotions. Instead of worrying, be positive about their encounter and expect them to get along. If you're enthusiastic about the encounter, they will pick up on this and take it as one cue to reacting positively to each other.
Take notice and remove the dogs from each other if you see or hear snarling, rushing at one another and growling, both dogs doing a posture and attempting to get on top of each other, disinterest in one dog but the other persists in bugging them (common with a senior/much younger dog combination), or there is nothing but staring going on (a fight for dominance).In these cases, intervene and separate them. You'll just have to try to introduce them more gradually (and walking them together in full leash control between you or two people is a good way to begin).
Seek professional advice if the dogs continue to fail to get along. It happens and the advice is definitely worth it. The type of person to contact includes your vet, a professional dog trainer or an animal behaviorist.
Watch for the dog hierarchy. The hierarchy will form quickly and it will show itself to you in which dog gets to walk first, eat first, share time with you first, etc.You need to reinforce this hierarchy with your own behavior (with you still alpha) and yet not let the submissive dog(s) feel left out.

, Once you have successfully introduced the dogs, it's time to start running your multi-dog household with you in charge, not the dogs. It may sound easy but once there is more than one dog, the canine pack mentality can take over and there can be a tendency for the dogs to start viewing you or other family members as lower down the pack (often with your unknowing acquiescence through your own behavior and actions). And worse, many people assume that two dogs means that they'll take care for one another, thereby relinquishing the need to maintain control over each dog individually and to bond with each dog individually. The reality is that you need to put in as much effort to training and spending time with dog number two, three, four, etc., that you put into training and bonding with dog number one.

, Start training your dogs and start noticing your own behaviors toward the dogs as well. Teach both of the dogs basic obedience; if your existing dog is already trained (which he should be before your get another dog), simply test his willingness to obey and do any refreshers as needed. And train the new dog to the same standard as the existing dog. Have every single dog in your multi-dog household treat you as boss and every other human family member as above them in the pack. If you don't do this, they will fight each other for the top position and ignore your commands.


Avoid shifting yourself down the pack. You must remain the boss, or the ""alpha"" pack member. Maintain expectations that each one of your dogs will listen and respond to your commands learned through obedience training. If your dogs are not listening to you, return to training basics. No walk, treats, play, etc., until commands are obeyed! And do not let your dog through the door before you; retrain a dog that starts doing this to you.
Training multiple dogs is an entire field of knowledge in its own right; do your research on the best approaches to going about this for you, and seek advice from a professional dog trainer if needed. Good training is essential to multi-dog household harmony.

, If this works out well from the beginning, that's great. However, it may take some time to reach this point and if so, consider separating them while you're out and slowly leaving them together when you're home and increasing the time until they can be left alone together. The importance of this is that when they're home alone, ultimately it's best if they can keep one another company and not miss you or other human companionship while you're away.



Crate training can help initially when training your dogs to get used to one another. Keep them in the same room so that they can see one another.

, Research dog body language and you'll be able to tell what's ""just play,"" what's a real fight, and when a fight is about to start. This isn't any different from watching the signs of greeting at the start; it is important to remain alert to possible aggression any time they're together. However, if your dogs are getting along fine and you've trained them well, there are likely to be few occasions when aggression breaks out between them. Times to be alert include: illness, food territoriality, pregnancy or raising puppies, introduction of any other new pet, a new baby in the family, and any time when every human in the family is too busy to spend at least a little regular time with the dogs.


Take care with objects one dog appears really attached to. This could cause friction if the other dog doesn't realize that there is a need to back off. Most dogs will get the message when there are growls involved. If it becomes a real problem, remove the object when the territorial dog isn't looking and dispose of it.
Never punish growling. Dogs growl to warn each other when they're upset and prevent fights. It is essentially the dog version of diplomacy. Punishing this may stop the vocalization, but it does not stop the associated anxiety. Dogs that have been scolded in this way can attack without warning.

, Feeding multiple dogs should not be a battleground. Ensure that they are not fed on top of each other or that they're fed in such a way as to make one dog feel it is missing out on food that another dog is getting. Be sure to give each dog its own feeding bowl and area, and feed them at the same time. Crate feeding or separate room feeding can alleviate any challenges provoked by dominant and submissive dog relations, something humans might want the dogs to ""get over"" but which in canine behavioral terms isn't going to happen and pushing them too close together can simply make things worse. And, when feeding time is finished, remove the food so that there is no temptation to wander over to the other dog's food bowl and start getting all territorial over it.


Feed the alpha dog first to prevent competition in the hierarchy.
When giving dogs a bone, give each dog a decent bone of their own, at the same time and if there is any sign of a fight over the bone, shift one dog to one part of the yard and the other dog to another to avoid theft of the submissive dog's bone by the dominant dog. Even if you have to create separate bone-eating areas with chicken wire or such, do something that ensures both dogs are getting their bones.
One water bowl for all dogs can suffice if it is large enough for the amount of dogs you have,but if you have any concerns, add another water bowl as well.

, Dogs are pack animals and will naturally sort themselves into a pack order. They generally do not care where they are in the pack, so long as they are certain of their position. Most people feel a natural tendency to make things fair and equitable by ""sticking up"" for the omega dog, and by doing so they unknowingly disrupt the hierarchy. Fights can break out if dogs are unsure which of them is supposed to take on the role of alpha. Make sure that the alpha in your household is fed first, given the toys first, goes through doors first and receives attention first. Do not ignore the omega dog, but simply give praise and attention after the alpha has received it. This will reduce the need to compete for dominance., As with food bowls, beds need to be tailored to each dog. Make it clear which bed belongs to which dog and keep these in distinct parts of the sleeping area so that they don't feel on top of one another. Left to their own devices, dogs in a multi-dog household will tend to choose their own sleeping spots. If you don't like their choices, you will need to train them to sleep elsewhere. And don't be surprised if they choose to sleep together; just be sure there is enough space and a cushion or bedding for each dog., If you're constantly on edge or freaking out when your dogs interact, a fight is much more likely to start because they sense their owner's emotions and fears. Instead, relax and have fun!


Keep the dogs amused. Have lots of dog toys for them and replace the toys as they fall apart. Have toy bones, tug ropes, balls, etc., for them to access whenever needed. If the dogs vary considerably in size, ensure that there are toys matched to their size.
Exercise your dogs regularly. This will release pent-up energy and will also reduce the desire to bark a lot, something your neighbors don't appreciate about noisy multi-dog households.

This is when you swap the dogs' blankets to allow them to get used to each other's scents.Take the blankets off of the dogs' beds and swap them so that each dog has the other dog's blanket.
Try to do this at least a day before they meet to give them a chance to investigate the smell and get used to it.;
, This will prevent both of your dogs from being territorial if they view the location as theirs.


If you introduce your dogs to each other at home, the old dog may display aggressive, territorial behavior toward the new dog.
If you obtain your new dog from a shelter, the shelter may require you to introduce your dogs to one another at the shelter before you are allowed to take them home.

, Ask a friend or family member to meet you at the location separately with one of your dogs. This will allow you to keep the dogs separated until a proper introduction is made.Keep leashes on both dogs. This will restrain your dogs and prevent them from attacking one another if aggressive behavior is displayed.

, The dogs should be able to see each other but should not be so close that they would feel threatened by the other dog's presence. Then you will gradually move the dogs closer together as you walk.


If there is no sign of aggression at a distance, you can then move closer to each other.
Pay attention to both dog's body language. Growling, teeth baring, raised hair, and long, uninterrupted stares can all indicate aggression. If this occurs you should move the dogs away from each other or immediately redirect the dog's attention., Instruct your partner to start walking their dog, then begin to follow them with your dog. You should be walking close enough so that your dog is walking directly behind the other dog. Continue to walk until your dog begins to sniff the other dog from behind as they are walking.Although the dog in front may pause when they sense your dog sniffing, encourage all parties to continue to walk. Trade positions with your partner after your dog has sniffed the other dog. This will allow the dog that was previously in front to sniff your dog from behind.
Continue to trade positions with your partner until both dogs have experienced the front and back walking positions several times. This will allow your dogs to become more acclimated and familiar with one another.
Also allow your dogs to sniff one another's excrement and urine after each dog has finished the act. This is a form of communication between dogs and indicates that they are becoming acclimated and comfortable with one another.

, After the dogs have met each other, you should walk them together for at least 30 minutes. This will allow your dogs to establish direct contact as they continue to maintain a companionable relationship.Give your dogs positive praise when you see them acting friendly with one another. Petting your dogs and using verbal praise will encourage them to continue to get along with each other.
Take a break every few minutes to let the dogs have direct interaction but then continue on the walk. Keep close supervision during direct contact so that you can redirect your dogs if problems arise.

, After the walk, your dogs will hopefully be relaxed and familiar enough with one another to co-exist in the same living environment without displaying aggressive behavior. At this point you can take your old dog and your new dog home and begin introducing your new dog to its new home.


If you need to transport the dogs in a car at this point, you will want to keep them separated. They have met each other but are by no means ready to be put in the back of a car together, for example.

, Also bring it to the area where you want it to go to the bathroom and allow it to do its business.


Bring the dog into the house and immediately into the room where it will get food and water. Feed the dog and give it water, which will calm it down and get it ready for the grand tour.
Then walk the dog through every room in the house slowly. Keep the dog on its leash while you walk it through the house.

, This will allow you to monitor interactions between dogs closely. Let the dogs sniff at each other through a baby gate. This will allow them each to get used to the scent of the other dog without the risk of aggression.If you need to be out of the room, place the dogs in separate rooms, so that no conflict arises without you being able to defuse it.

, You need to let them work out this relationship on their own, as long as they are not hurting each other in the process.


There will naturally be a more dominant dog and a more submissive dog in the new relationship. This does not mean that one dog should beat up on the other dog continually. You will need to use your best judgement about whether the relationship is on the right path toward pack behavior or if it is rooted in aggression.

, They should be able to give you good strategies that you can use to acclimate your dogs to each other.


To find a trainer or animal behaviorist in your area, ask your veterinarian or the organization you got your new dog from for a recommendation.

Approach the owner, rather than the dog.,
Move to the dog’s side.,
Let the dog come to you.,
Pet the dog’s shoulder, neck, or chest.",How to Be Good With Small Dogs1," You should always approach the owner of the small dog and greet them first. Acknowledging the owner first, rather than running to greet the dog, will allow the dog to calm down. Dogs also take cues from their owner, so it they see that their owner is relaxed and friendly with you, they will be more likely to be that way towards you.You should maintain eye contact with the owner but avoid making eye contact with the dog. Making contact with the dog can seem like an act of aggression to the dog. Instead, look at the dog’s owner or at a neutral area on the dog, such as her chest.
Ask the owner for permission to approach the dog before doing so. You may say, “Your dog is really cute. Is it okay if I pet him/her?” Once the owner says “yes”, you should approach the dog. If the owner says “no” to you petting the dog, respect this and keep your distance from the dog.;
, Do not crouch or stand in front of the dog, as this can seem threatening to her. Instead, move to one side of the dog and squat or stand up straight next to the dog. Standing to the side of the dog will appear less threatening to her and show her you are trying to be friendly.You may chat with the dog’s owner as you move to the dog’s side or say friendly words to the dog, such as “Nice to meet you” or “You are so sweet.” Try to project a friendly, calm demeanor, as dogs can sense fear and may act fearful if you show or feel any fear around them.

, You should then let the dog approach you, rather than try to touch the dog or get the dog to come to you. This will appear less threatening to the dog and allow the dog to feel in control. You may offer a fist or closed hand to the dog at the level of her nose so she can sniff you and check you out.Avoid offering up an open hand, as this can seem threatening to the dog. Instead, let the dog sniff your closed hand. If she sniffs, wags her tail, and seems calm, you may slowly open your hand.

, Use your open hand to gently pet the dog’s shoulder, neck, and chest from the side. Do not pat her head or her back-end, as these are vulnerable areas for the dog. The small dog should appear relaxed, with a wagging tail. These are all signs that she is into a small petting session with you.Once the small dog is done with meeting you, she will likely change her body position so your hand no longer makes contact with her. She may also move away from you. Do not force her to keep hanging out with you or try to hold her down. Instead, simply say goodbye to the dog and to her owner.

An unvaccinated dog could catch parvo, kennel cough, hookworms, rabies, or another potentially fatal disease. Keep all of your dog’s vaccinations up to date as recommended by a veterinarian.


If the dog is very young or was recently ill or malnourished, check with a veterinarian first, even after vaccination. The dog may need some time to build up its immune system.;
, At minimum, your dog should respond to the ""come"" command while off the leash. Down, sit, and stay are also useful commands to teach your dog. An untrained dog can be a safety risk to itself and others at the dog park. If you're not sure whether your dog is ready, try practicing commands off-leash in a fenced-in backyard or in your apartment hallway.


To teach your dog a new command, you will need to mark the behavior with the corresponding word. For example, if you are training your dog to sit, then say “sit” and gently guide your dog’s bottom to the floor. Or, you can also use a treat as a lure to get your dog to sit by holding it above their head. Just remember to say “sit” as you do this.Be sure to provide plenty of positive reinforcement when training your dog. For example, if you dog responds to your command to “sit,” then reward him with some praise. You can even give your dog a treat now and then to help motivate him.
If you know your dog has behavioral problems, especially aggression, consider attending puppy classes or hiring a professional trainer. Don't visit the park until you are confident you can prevent the bad behavior and stop it promptly if it happens.
A trainer can also help teach a puppy appropriate play/bow behavior. These are the body language cues used by dogs when playing with each other., While walking your dog, pay attention to how it reacts to other dogs and to people. Some dogs are anxious or hostile around men, overly friendly people, or large dogs. If you know how your dog tends to react, you can respond quickly to calm it down at the park.


Your dog can start to learn socialization skills outside of the park. Try taking it to areas with lots of foot traffic, or better yet, arrange play dates with another dog.
Don’t put your dog in a position where it has a chance to fail until you are confident of its behavior. Work on socialization skills in controlled environments until both you and your dog are confident in its good behavior., There is always a chance your dog will get into a fight at a dog park. Before you go, learn how to break up a fight effectively. Never use your bare hands. Always place something between the two dogs, such as a piece of cardboard or a jacket. You can also break up a fight by making loud noises, like blowing a small air horn or clapping your hands, or spraying water or a citronella spray in the middle of the skirmish.

Don’t yell at your dog, try to pull it away by the collar, or get in the middle of the fight. Doing so will only add to the chaos., Make sure you meet your dog's exercise needs, based on its age and breed. If your dog is cooped up longer than it should be, it might get over excited when let off the leash at the dog park.


Dogs are like people in that they get out of shape and can suffer needless injury by being a “weekend warrior” and overdoing it when they are not in shape. Be especially wary in warmer weather, which can cause heat stroke quickly, especially for dogs with chronic illnesses, heart issues, and for brachycephalic breeds (those with pushed in faces)., Look for fleas and ticks regularly to avoid spreading them to other dogs at the park. Consider using preventative medicine for these parasites, since your dog will probably be exposed to them at the park.If your dog has lost energy or appetite, visit a vet to check for heartworm as well. Your vet can also recommend medication to help prevent heartworm, which is transmitted by mosquitoes., Some dog parks will require your dog to have an off-leash permit in order to play in the park. Check with any dog parks you’re considering visiting to find out what their regulations are regarding this and how to go about getting one.

An off-leash permit shows authorities (and other dog owners) that your dog is up-to-date with vaccinations and that you are a responsible dog owner who is concerned with the safety of your dog as well as the other people and dogs at the park., There are lots of considerations when choosing a dog park. Many of these considerations may depend on the size of your dog, its socialization skills, its attitude toward other dogs, and your own personal preferences. Some things to look for include:


Look for a park that separates dogs by size. For example, some parks may have a separate enclosure for dogs under 20 pounds or by age (puppies and elderly dogs).
If you're not 100% confident in your dog's training, choose a park with containment fencing or plan to keep the dog on a leash at all times. Look for fences that have separate entrance and exit gates and don’t contain any 90 degree angles so that your dog cannot be cornered by another dog.
Also, look for parks that have plenty of open space for your dog to run, shade, and water.
Try to avoid parks next to busy roads unless your dog knows to stay away, even if the gate is normally closed.
If visiting a park in the evening, make sure it is well lit.
Large parks with underbrush may contain wild animals. Be aware of the risk of skunks, raccoons, or other animals native to your area.

, Whether or not you and your dog have a positive experience at the dog park depends, in part, on the other dogs there. Before you go in, take a few minutes to watch the other dogs. If they seem too aggressive or excited, it may be better to bring your dog back at a different time or choose a different park.If you have a puppy or tiny dog, look for other dogs the same age and size. If large or aggressive dogs are dominating the park, this may not be a comfortable place to visit.

, Dog parks are often packed on evenings and weekends. If you can, visit during a weekday afternoon for your first trip. This will give your dog the chance to explore in a calmer environment.


Try to keep your first couple visits to only 20 or 30 minutes as well., Let your dog become familiar with the area by walking it on the sidewalk just outside the park. Let it stop and sniff the edges of the park as you walk. The dog is ready to go in when he looks relaxed. A stiff neck, bulging eyes, or freezing in place are all signs of anxiety.


Doing this is also a great way to start introducing your dog to the other dogs at the park without the anxiety of not being able to get away from them., Check for signs or watch what other dog owners are doing regarding leash rules. Many large dog parks have a double-gate system, where you remove your dog's leash when you're between the gates. Be careful entering the park with a leashed dog, as the leash can cause your dog to act defensive or aggressive toward the unleashed dogs.


In less dog-friendly cities, ""dog parks"" are more like ordinary parks where dogs are allowed. Some of these parks require you to keep your dog on leash.
If your dog is not well-trained, it's best to avoid off-leash parks completely.

, If your dog isn’t used to being off-leash, you can ease it into this by trying a couple different methods:

Take off your dog’s leash for a while after entering the park—about 20 or 30 minutes—and then put it back on. Gradually increase the time you let your dog off-leash until you are comfortable doing so all the time.
You can also switch your dog’s short leash for a longer one when you get to the dog park. Leave the longer leash on your dog while it plays. This will allow you to more easily catch your dog if it isn’t responding to your commands., A crowd of dogs often rushes up to meet the newcomer. Don't be startled or anxious. Keep an eye on the dogs, but let them do their thing while you meet their owners.


If possible, try to introduce your dog to other dogs at the park gradually. Take your dog to any secluded areas of the park at first where the number of dogs is limited., Stay alert and know where your dog is at all times. You will both be making new friends, but don't get too distracted. It is your responsibility as a dog owner to ensure your dog is behaving itself and to make sure another dog isn’t causing your dog harm.


If you also have small children, bringing them to the dog park might not be a good idea. It can be tough to watch both your dog and a young child at the same time.
Be especially vigilant of small dogs around big dogs. Whether your dog is the big or small one, don’t allow big dogs to threaten or play too rough with small dogs.
If your dog is too frightened, excited, or aggressive toward other dogs, leave the park for a bit. Doing so will ensure you prevent any problems before they begin and give your dog a chance to calm down.
Don’t be ashamed to muzzle your dog the first few times you visit the park if you’re not sure how it will react to other dogs.
Know how to read dog body postures and social behavior before going to the dog park. Educate yourself so that you can recognize the difference between stress, fear, play, and aggressive behavior., It's a good idea to bring something to calm your dog down if it gets nervous, or to attract its attention. That said, you don't want to be responsible for the Great Bacon Stampede when three dozen dogs notice what you're holding. Pick a basic treat that your dog enjoys, but nothing with too strong a smell. And of course, a toy to play with is always welcome.


Don’t, however, bring a toy or treat you know your dog won’t be willing to share, as this could cause a fight., The whole point of taking your dog to a dog park is for it to have a good time with other dogs. You can determine if it is having fun by watching is body movements and actions. The following body language is a good indication your dog is having a good time:

Your dog’s movements are bouncy and exaggerated. It may also wiggle its body around with excitement.
Your dog will engage in back and forth play with other dogs. This means that the dogs will switch roles while they are playing. For example, your dog may start off chasing another dog, but eventually the roles will switch and the other dog will be chasing yours.
Your dog’s mouth will be open and relaxed.
Your dog will play-bow around the other dogs. Play-bowing is when a dog lowers the front half of its body, stretching out its front legs and raising its hind quarters in the air.
Your dog might also show excitement with twisted leaps or pawing at the air.

, This should go without saying, but pick up after your dog promptly. Many dog parks have a box stocked with plastic bags, but always bring your own baggie or scooper just in case., Let them know your dog is new to the dog park and ask them to respect your dog's boundaries. The other owners can be very helpful when it comes to socializing your dog.


For example, say ""My dog is fearful when other dogs race over to him. Can you help me make sure we keep a safe boundary between our dogs?"", If your dog starts harassing other dogs, or if the other dogs harass yours, leave the park right away. This prevents the conflict from escalating and, if your dog was the culprit, sends a message that the behavior is not allowed.


It is also a good idea to have the number for animal control handy in case there is an owner who will not remove its aggressive dog from the park."

Go for a short walk.,
Play hide and seek inside.,
Have a game of fetch at the park.,
Take the dog to a calm lake or pool.",How to Be Good With Small Dogs2," You can learn how to play well with a small dog by taking her for short walks. You may go for a stroll along the beach, in a park, or around the neighborhood. Make sure you keep the small dog close to you and on a leash. Use a four to six foot (1.2 to 1.8 meter) lead so your dog stays close to you during the walk.Try to walk your small dog at least once a day. Keep the walks short, about 15-20 minutes tops. This will ensure your small dog’s joints do not get too worn out.

, You can also play with your small dog by having a game of hide and seek indoors. Hide and seek can be a good way to get your dog running around and interacting with you in a fun way.You may play hide and seek by first having a friend hold your small dog while you hide. Then, you may call the dog’s name a few times to get her to find you. You can also try using the command “come”, if the small dog already knows this command, to get the dog to search for you.
Playing hide and seek inside will ensure your small dog does not get lost outdoors where you cannot find her. It also allows you to keep tabs on your dog and prevent the risk of her running off into a dangerous area during the hide and seek game.

, Make sure you use a fetch toy that is soft, such as a small soft plush toy or doll. The fetch toy should be light enough for your small dog to pick up and hold in her mouth. Avoid using sticks or rope toys to play fetch, as they can be hard on your dog’s teeth.You may get your dog use to retrieving the toy in the park as part of a game or practice playing fetch at home. You can demonstrate how to chase and retrieve the toy. Your dog should mirror your actions and start to understand the game.
To avoid overworking your small dog, make sure you keep fetch to 10 minutes at a time. Take a break every 10 minutes to pet your dog and give your dog access to water.

, Most dogs love water, even small dogs. You should encourage your small dog to try going into the water at a calm lake or a pool, as it is a low-impact workout that will not put too much stress on your dog’s joints. You may start by introducing your dog to a calm lake or pool to see if she will jump in or enter the water on her own.You may get your dog a pet-appropriate life vest so she is safe in the water. You may take this precaution even when your dog is going into calm waters to prevent drowning.
Let your dog swim in calm waters for 10 minutes at a time. Do not let your dog enter water that is turbulent or rough, such as the ocean or a river with a strong currant.
If your small dog does not seem to enjoy being in or by water, do not try to force her to like it. Putting her in the water when she does not seem to enjoy it can lead to panic and anxiety, which could increase your dog’s risk of injury in the water.

Start with basic commands like “come,” “sit,” and “stay.” If you own a small dog, you may teach your dog basic commands so she behaves well around other people and other dogs.,
Teach your small dog to place.,
Show your dog how to act around small children.",How to Be Good With Small Dogs3," You may start with commands like “come” and “sit.” You may also teach your dog to “stay” so she does not move or jump around without your permission.


These basic commands can be useful for keeping your small dog calm when you take her for walks or when you have a play session. Having a well trained dog will also make it easier for others to interact with her and have a positive experience around your dog.

, You can also teach your dog how to “place” or stay in one spot on your command. The “place” cue can be useful for small dogs who tend to get too excited and jumpy when someone is at the door or when they meet someone new.


To teach your dog to “place”, you will need a new mat, towel, or bed. You will then work with your dog to help her learn how to go to the mat or towel and stay on it at your command.

, Small dogs can get a little skittish around small children. Small children can also accidentally step on your small dog or play too roughly with your dog. You may want to teach your small dog to not jump up on children or interact too much with them.You can teach your small dog how to sit and stay when she is around small children.

Place a book on the ground.,
Have your dog place its back feet on the book.,
Move the book against the wall.,
Add another book.,
Remove the books.,
Hold a treat in front of its nose.",How to Get a Dog to Do a Handstand1," Start teaching this trick by having your dog target something with its back legs. To do this, place a book or another flat, but elevated object on the ground. Then, place your dog in front of the book.If your dog is having trouble with a book, use a larger object, like a towel or a ramp. If you have a smaller dog, try using an object that is not as elevated, like a magazine.;
, Once your dog is standing in front of the book, have your dog place its back feet on it. To get your dog to do this, try walking into your dog. As soon as your dog places its back feet on the book, use a cue word like “up” and reward your dog with a treat to reinforce the behavior.If your dog will not move its feet onto the book, then place your dog’s back feet on the book yourself. Give your dog a treat once its back feet are on the book.
Repeat this step until your dog places its back feet on the book by itself.

, Once your dog is comfortable with placing both its back feet on the book, move the book against the wall. The pressure of the wall might make some dogs feel apprehensive at first. If this is your dog, reassure your dog by petting and talking to it in a soothing voice.For example, while petting it you can say, “That’s a good girl (or boy). I want you to place your feet on the book like we practiced. Up.”
Make sure to reward your dog once it places its feet on the book against the wall.

, Once your dog is comfortable with placing its back feet on one book against the wall, slowly begin to increase the height of the books. To do this, place a second book that is equal in thickness on top of the first book. Then, cue your dog to place its back feet on the stacked books by saying “up.”Keep adding a new book every week until the stack is high enough to where your dog is using the front part of its body to lift its hind legs onto the top of the stack.
Because your dog is using new muscles, you will need to take this step slowly. It is recommended that you only add one book per week to allow your dog’s muscles time to adjust.

, Once you have added enough books so that your dog is almost vertical when placing its back feet on the stack of books, it is time to remove the books. Have your dog stand in front of the wall as usual. Cue the desired behavior the same way as if the books were there by saying your cue word, i.e., up.If your dog makes any effort to lift its hind legs onto the wall, reward your dog with a treat.
Repeat this step until your dog is comfortable placing its hind legs on the wall without the books.

, Once your dog is comfortable lifting its hind feet onto the wall, hold a treat in front of its nose to encourage it to move away from the wall. Encourage your dog to move away from the wall while holding the “handstand” position by placing a hand on your dog’s belly. This will help your dog balance as it moves away from the wall.Repeat this step until your dog can balance on its front legs by itself.

Consult your vet.,
Take it slow.,
Use a clicker.",How to Get a Dog to Do a Handstand2," Because not all dogs have the upper body strength to do this trick, speak with your vet before teaching your dog this trick. If your dog does not have the upper body strength, you might inadvertently injure your dog while teaching it this trick.Age is also a factor. It is recommended that you wait until your dog is an adult before teaching it to do a handstand. Additionally, arthritis or other conditions might prevent older dogs from being able to perform this trick.

, When teaching your dog this trick, remember to take it slow. Your dog is using muscles that it does not normally use. Therefore, if you are in a hurry, you might inadvertently injure your dog. By taking it slow, you are allowing your dog’s muscles time to adjust and strengthen., When teaching this trick, a clicker is very useful. Whenever your dog performs the correct behavior, click and reward the behavior with a treat. It is important that you click while the correct behavior is being performed and not after.


If you do not have a clicker, cue words such as “up” or “yes” accompanied with a treat will work, too.

Puppies and young dogs can more easily damage their developing bones and muscles while jumping.Wait until your dog is fully grown and ask your veterinarian about whether they think it’s appropriate to begin training.


If you have a senior dog, check with your veterinarian to make sure it is safe for your dog to jump poles.;
, Before you begin training your dog to jump, decide what command or cue to use while training your dog. Select a word such as “over” or “jump.” Use your chosen command or cue consistently throughout the training. Switching between commands may confuse your dog, so decide which one to use early on.

, Training with lightweight, easy-to-assemble jumping poles are great for training your dog to jump, but you can use a variety of objects around your home, too. Teach your dog to jump over your legs, or use a broom handle, a PVC pipe, a hula-hoop, a tree branch, a box, or a taut rope.

, Place your dog on a leash and bring it toward the jumping poles (or whatever other object you're using for your dog to jump over). If it seems hesitant about approaching this new fixture, allow it to sniff around the poles.This will help the dog become familiar with them and realize that they are not a threat.

, Place the pole on the lowest rung. With your dog on a leash, bring your dog toward the jumping pole and have it walk over it.Say your command word as it walks over. Bring your dog across several times and continue to repeat the command word. This will help the dog acclimate to the pole and the command word. Reward your dog with praise or a treat.


If your dog does not want to walk over the jumping pole, do not force it over by pulling on the leash.Instead, try placing a treat on the other side of the lowered pole, or throw a treat over to encourage your dog to jump after it.

, Once your dog has successfully walked over the pole several times, make it a little more challenging by raising the pole to the next rung.Place a treat on the other side of the pole. Bring your dog toward it and, as it approaches, say your command word. As the dog jumps over, reward it with praise and a treat.

, As your dog becomes more comfortable jumping at a lower level, remove the leash and raise the bar little by little. Be sure that the jumping pole does not to exceed the height of your dog.Performing these incremental jumps will help your dog feel more comfortable in its abilities.

, Once your dog is comfortable jumping over one object, introduce another obstacle for your dog to jump over in succession. Be sure that the second obstacle is lower than the first jump and is set at its lowest possible height.Continue to add more obstacles as your dog’s abilities improve.


Let your dog explore and sniff around both jumping obstacles.
Place your dog on a leash and lead it over the first obstacle. Continue to lead your dog toward the second jump, making sure to state your command word as you approach. If your dog hesitates as it approaches the second jump, pause, and place a treat on the other side of the jump.
When your dog completes the second jump, reward it with praise and a treat.

, During the initial stages of training, do not encourage your dog to jump over the poles quickly. It is important to proceed slowly and with caution. If your dog begins its training at high speeds before it builds its foundation, it may injure or strain itself.Work slowly and watch to see that the jump is not too high for your dog. Look at your dog’s legs to ensure that they are not catching or hitting the pole as they jump over. If this is happening, lower the jump.
As you approach the jumping obstacles, do not run with your dog on a leash. Walk toward the obstacles to ensure that your dog is aware of the upcoming jump.
If you dog is approaching the jump at a speed that you feel is too fast, lead the dog away from the obstacle and do not stay the command word., Rewarding your dog with praise and treats will make your dog more likely to repeat desired or correct behaviors. Rewards can include offering your dog treats, petting or praising your dog, or providing it with its favorite toy. Treats are the most effective for training since dogs are motivated by food.The treat should be something your dog enjoys. Buy a few different treats and see what it most appealing to your dog.
The treats should be a small, soft piece of food that your dog can quickly and safely swallow., Timing is crucial when you are using positive reinforcement. After your dog completes a jump correctly, you should reward your dog immediately. If there is a delay, your dog may not realize that it is being rewarded for completing a jump.

, Your dog will associate the sound of the clicking with the correct behavior and with a treat or praise.Be sure you are using the clicker during the jump and not afterward.Clickers can cost anywhere between $2 and $20 and can be purchased online or at your local pet store.

, Once your dog has learned to jump consistently, you may wish to cut back on the number of treats it receives. Continue to verbally praise your dog after it completes a jump. Reward your dog with a treat 4 out of every 5 times it completes a jump, and slowly reduce the rewards until you are only providing a treat on occasion.Vary how often you give your dog a treat, and don’t establish a pattern. Establishing a fluctuating reward system will ensure that your dog will keep performing the jumps each time., In the U.S., there are several major agility organizations, including American Kennel Club, the United States Dog Agility Association, and The North American Dog Agility Council. Each organization sets forth a set of rules and guidelines for the sport, hosts sponsored competitions throughout the year, and has varying heights for the jumping portions of the competition. If you have a small dog or a senior dog, you will want to be sure that your dog can safely reach the required heights.The American Kennel Club only offers membership to purebred dogs, while the United States Dog Agility Association happily includes mixed breed dogs. Research the requirements and expectations of each organization to see if it is a good fit for you and your dog.

, Find a local dog trainer in your area to see if they offer training sessions geared toward jumping and other agility moves. These classes offer great introductions to agility training and they can help improve your dog’s abilities in a short period of time.Classes typically have 6 to 10 owners and their pets, which allows the trainer to focus on each dog’s abilities, skills, and areas for improvement.


Classes meet once or twice a week for 4 to 8 weeks. The entire course can cost around $200, depending on your location., There are two types of agility events, matches and sanctioned trails. Matches are more relaxed and typically allow mixed breed dogs to participate. The fee to enter the competition is typically much lower than sanctioned trails, which are often hosted by national agility organizations. These obstacles typically include a variety of jumps, including bar jumps, double-bar jumps, tire jumps, and panel jumps.Subscribe to an organization’s newsletter or ask your agility trainer to learn about upcoming events in your area."

Choose the right setting.,
Hold kibble in your hand.,
Practice the next day.,
Require longer eye contact.,
Practice in places with distractions.",How to Teach Your Dog to Focus1," When you begin training your dog to focus, you want to start in a place with as few distractions as possible. Find a place that is quiet, where you can control the circumstances during training.An indoor space in your house may be ideal.
Turn off devices such as phones and televisions.
Keep children and other animals in another room so they don’t distract the dog.;
, This should be the food that your dog already knows and eats. Hold as much of the kibble in your hand as you can. Offer it to the dog.Open your hand and let him eat the food directly from your hand.

, Go to the same location that you trained in yesterday. Hold the handful of kibble the same way you did the day before. Wait until your dog makes eye contact with you. When he does, offer him the kibble.Offer him the entire ration of kibble at this time.
If the dog does not make eye contact with you on his own, you can say his name to get his attention.
Do not open your hand to show or offer the kibble until he makes eye contact. That will defeat the training.

, The next day, go to the same place, free from distractions. Hold the kibble in your hand so that he can see your hand. Wait until your dog makes eye contact with you for three entire seconds. When he does, say, “take it,” and open your hand for him to eat.Practice this everyday. Each day, require that he maintain eye contact for a little bit longer, until he can maintain eye contact for at least eight seconds before you offer the ration of kibble.

, Once the dog has mastered eye contact and focus in the calm environment, begin to practice in places with distractions. There can be other people around, or even other animals. You may want to try going outside while keeping the dog on a leash, just in case.Do not attempt to practice in a place with distractions until the dog has mastered eye contact and focus in a controlled environment.
Increase the amount of distractions slowly. Don’t just go from complete seclusion to a raucous dog park.
Once your dog has mastered the behavior in a place with distractions, practice without offering him a treat. Instead, simply give him verbal praise and pet him.

Bring your dog a friend.,
Turn on the TV.,
Give your dog a toy.,
Play tug of war with your dog.,
Play hide and seek with your dog.Like humans, dogs are very curious and get anxious when they haven't seen you for awhile.,
Play fetch.,
Have your dog chase a laser light.",How to Keep Your Dog Busy for Hours1," Dogs love playing together.Together, your dogs will have hours of fun sniffing each other, chasing one another around the house, and cuddling together on the sofa.


Make sure your new pet gets along with your original one. Rescue shelters usually allow you to foster a pet before you adopt it permanently. Treat the fostering period as a trial run.
Ensure your new pet is vaccinated and receives all its shots. If you do not spay or neuter your pets, get a dog which is the same sex as your original dog.
You might also choose to get another house pet, such as a cat or pig. Both can befriend your dog and offer a source of steadfast companionship. Just as you would with another dog, though, make sure your new pet gets all of his or her shots and vaccines.;
, Dogs have excellent vision and are very attentive to moving images.If you have Animal Planet, Nat Geo, or a similar station which features lots of pet and animal programming, your pet will like those best.


Not every breed will be amused by television. But if you have one that is, such as a terrier or bichon frise, your doggy will have hours of amusement ahead of them.

, There are a variety of options, all of which provide many hours of fun for your dog. Which toy you choose depends on your dog's preferences. If one toy fails to keep your pet busy, try another.


Chew toys can offer hours of fun for a good dog. Whether they are a simple rope knotted at the ends or a more complex design of cloth covering a squeaker, chew toys provide dogs with tons of fun.
Rawhide dog bones are also fun for dogs. A dog can easily pass the whole day gnawing on a rawhide bone.
Balls and rolling toys are great fun, and dogs will playfully chase a ball toy for hours.

, This can be a great outlet for your dog’s pent-up energy after he or she waited all day to see you. Choose a soft toy of fleece or soft rope, something which will be both gentle on your hand and the dog’s jaw.While you could just give the toy a gentle wiggle after your dog has grabbed it in its mouth, and pull until either you or the dog let go, it’s best to use the game as a teaching opportunity. After pulling back and forth on the toy for a few moments, make your dog let go of the toy when you tell it to by pulling their face close to yours and intoning the phrase “Drop it” or “Give.”Give him or her a treat after obeying these commands. Initiate a new game of tug to reinforce the lesson.
You can also train your dog to pick the toy back up with a command like “Get it!” and offering the toy to them. As before, utilize treats when your dog correctly obeys you. Having learned this command, do not let your dog pull the toy until you tell him or her to “Get it!”
Repeat the process with a new game to ensure your pet learns this command. Get another round of tug going immediately so your pet doesn’t become bored.
Playing tug of war with your dog simulates a struggle for power/dominance. A pack leader or alpha dog would never play tug of war with another dog in the pack. A dog should therefore surrender the toy to you and wait for you to initiate play.

, You can take this natural tendency and turn it into a great game for your pet.


Hide somewhere accessible like a closet, under the bed, or behind the couch or other large furniture.
Wait for your dog to find you.
You can accelerate the process if you hold a doggy treat while you wait. The scent will provide a clue for the dog and make a good reward when you've been found.
After your dog finds you, start the game again. Hide in a variety of locations so your dog doesn't become bored and always has a challenge.

, It's a timeless classic. With a rag toy, a stick, a Frisbee, or a tennis ball in hand, throw it as far as you can and let your dog run after it. After he or she picks it up and returns it to you, smiling all the while with that silly grin of anticipation, throw it again! A game of fetch can go on and on.Play in an enclosed area such as a dog park or backyard.
Do not play fetch near traffic or busy streets. A mistimed throw or a bad bounce can send the thrown object into traffic, with Fido close behind.

, A simple laser pointer can make a dog go crazy. With the laser in hand, shine it in a spot where the dog can see it. You may need to attract his or her attention by pointing at the laser light and saying excitedly ""Hey! What's that?"" When the dog sees the light, they will pursue it. When the dog gets close to the point of light, move it to another visible location 3-5 feet away. A dog can easily wile away hours with this simple game.


The laser light excites the dog's natural predator instincts.When they see the zigzagging laser light, they will fixate on it, jumping, clawing, and digging at it until they can ""capture"" it.
Be sure to have extra batteries on hand.
You can shine the light while lying down, resting, or watching TV.
Laser pointers are readily available at many big box retail stores or online.

Get a training clicker.,
Put a stash of treats in your pocket or bag.,
Toss a treat behind the dog.,
Reward him when he looks back at you.,
Repeat this.,
Hold the treat near your face if necessary.",How to Teach Your Dog to Focus2," Training clickers are very simple devices that you can buy from your local pet store. They make a small clicking sound that your dog will learn to associate with positive behavior.Clickers are useful because they provide a sound that is more consistent than your own voice or vocal commands.
Clickers are most effective when used in tandem with treats. That way, the dog will associate the clicking sound with the positive reinforcement of the treat.

, They can be small, fingernail-sized treats. You can purchase these from your local pet store or grocery store. Avoid using human food as treats. It may not be healthy for your dog and may encourage begging at the table., Do this in a quiet, secluded place with no distractions or other dogs. Don’t say anything to the dog before tossing the treat. Simply show it to him, then throw it behind him.After the dog eats the treat, he may spend time looking for more. Stay patient and wait while he does this.

, Eventually, your dog will look back at you. As soon as you see him turn toward you, mark it with a click and a treat. Do this immediately so that he’ll associate the treat with the fact that he looked at you.You can also praise the dog for performing the desired behavior.

, Toss another treat behind your dog. Again, he’ll find it and eat it, and likely search for more. Wait for him to look at you. When he does, respond immediately with a treat and a click.Repeat this pattern five to ten times in one sitting. By then end of the session, your dog will probably look back at you pretty quickly after finding the treat.
Continue to practice this for a week or more depending on how long it takes your dog to master orienting toward you.
Once your dog has mastered the behavior in a place with distractions, practice without offering him a treat or using the clicker. Instead, simply give him verbal praise and pet him.

, If your dog fails to grasp the goal of orienting toward you, try holding the treat up to your face before you give it to him. Some trainers consider this “cheating,” but it can be helpful if the dog is struggling to meet your eyes."

Choose a toy that your dog responds to.,
Hold the toy so the dog can see it.,
Keep your focus on his face.,
Respond positively when he looks at you.,
Practice this game many times.,
Add a verbal command.",How to Teach Your Dog to Focus3," Not all dogs like the same toys. Pick a toy that your dog seems interested in, but use it exclusively for this training. Don’t leave it around for him to play with any time he wants., You should be standing or sitting in front of the dog. Hold the toy in your hand away from your body. Keep it completely still so the dog can see it and doesn’t think you’re already playing.In your other hand, hold a clicker. A clicker can be bought at a pet supply store for very little money. It's a tool that makes small clicking sounds to signal to the dog that he's done a good job.
Your dog will probably focus on the toy. He may jump or bark to get you to start playing.
Stay calm and be patient. Do not move. Don’t move the toy.

, Stand or sit totally still. Keep your eyes locked on your dog’s. Eventually he will realize that you’re not going to play and he will look you in the eyes. He may be sad or frustrated. That’s okay, you’ll play with him soon.Your dog may act very frustrated or upset when you won’t play with him. Stay strong. You need to allow your dog to feel a little uncomfortable in order to train him.

, Eventually, your dog will look at you. When he does, immediately mark that moment with a clicker. Then give him the toy or throw it for him to go fetch.Be sure to respond immediately to the desired behavior so that your dog will associate it with positive feedback.

, Keep playing this game with your dog until his attention wears thin. He will eventually begin to look at you very quickly when he realizes that looking at you gets him what he wants.Dogs have different attention spans. If your dog seems tired or disinterested, rest for the day and play again tomorrow.
Keep your method and reward consistent until your dog has mastered the art of focusing.

, Once your dog is generally successful at this game, add a verbal command. A common command is, “Watch me.” Use the command whenever you play the game with him.Eventually, you’ll be able to simply use the verbal command without needing the toy.

Take your dog to the dog park.,
Think of the best time to go.Being surrounded with too many dogs can be bad for the dogs.,
Find an appropriate space for your dog.,
Pay attention to your dog.,
Look out for conflicts.,
Leave nothing behind.",How to Keep Your Dog Busy for Hours2," The park has a multitude of smells, sights, and sounds that your dog doesn't encounter every day in his domestic life. The plants and animals, as well as the other dogs and their humans, make the park a place of endless wonder and excitement for a doggy.


If the weather and facilities allow, your pet may want to go for a swim. However, beware of waterborne illness and only allow your pet to swim in and drink clean waters., Crowding can lead to aggression and stress for dogs who are poorly socialized.


Most dogs and their humans go to the park in the evening or on weekends. Try to avoid these most busy times.

, The kind of park experience your doggy has depends on his or her reproductive status, size, and general attitude.If your dog is small, don’t let him or her play with or near larger dogs; typically, there is a separate area for smaller dogs.
Try not to bring dogs younger than 12 weeks old to the dog park. Not only could they get trampled, but their immune systems may not have fully developed yet.If your dog isn’t spayed or neutered, do not let him or her play with doggies of the opposite sex.
If your dog is not well-socialized, avoid letting them play with many other dogs. Give them a chance to understand how to interact one-on-one before leaving them to a large crowd. Dogs who are very territorial might try to pick a fight with the wrong dog and get hurt.

, Some dog parks can be quite expansive, and are usually leash-free, meaning the dogs can roam wherever they want to within the bounds of the park. Stay nearby and don't let them wander too far afield.


Don’t spend all your time looking at your phone, reading a book, or chatting with a friend.While humans as well as dogs can find valuable social time at the dog park, keep your canine friend first and foremost in your mind.
Pay attention to your dog’s movements and moods, and encourage them when they see or discover something neat (“Yes, that’s a very fast squirrel over there!”) Treat your doggy as you would your baby and shower them with attention.

, Like people, not all dogs can get along. If you see trouble brewing, recall your dog immediately. Step in front of your dog if you need to remind them you’re there.


In the event of a conflict, recall your dog immediately.
Don’t confuse play with conflict. Just because your dog and another are barking at each other doesn’t mean they are fighting. Signs of play include:Barking or growling
Playful nips, not full bites
Side-to-side, rather than forward movement
Rear quarters up with front legs outstretched


Signs of real trouble include:

Staring at one another
Snarling (lifting the lips and revealing teeth)Arched neck
Stiff legs



, Don’t leave empty dog treat boxes or bags on the grass or tables. And under no circumstances should you leave your dog poo behind.Bring some vinyl gloves, a plastic bag, paper towels, and sanitary wipes with you just in case Fido has to do some business.

Give your dog a KONG toy.,
Choose foods your dog will love.,
Keep it simple at first.,
Turn it into a challenge.",How to Keep Your Dog Busy for Hours3," KONG toys are nontoxic rubber toys with a hollow center. They are available at local pet stores and come in many sizes, with variations appropriate for small puppies up through massive German Shepherds.Since they're hollow, many pet owners use the toys to occupy their dogs for hours on end by stuffing yummy snacks inside for their pet. Find one with an appropriate size and shape for your dog.


If it is too big for your dog to pick up and shake in its mouth, it is probably too big.

, Every dog has his or her favorite snack. Some like carrots and celery, others like cheese and sausages. Does your dog prefer dog snacks or human food? Find out what your doggy loves the most and use it in the KONG toy.


Some people choose to put less solid foods inside the toy and freeze them. Cottage cheese, gravy, or runny canned foods are good choices for these Kongsicles., When your dog first encounters a KONG toy, it will probably not know what to do. You may need to show your dog that you are putting a yummy snack inside the toy. Make a big show of it, waving the snack before him or her and intoning ""Look what I have!"" Since it's your pet's first experience with the KONG toy, choose a small snack which is easily recoverable., As your dog becomes more proficient at accessing the KONG toy's snacks, use bigger pieces of food that are more difficult to recover.


You can also try hiding the toys around the house in places that are difficult -- but not impossible -- to get to. Try placing them beneath or behind furniture where they can only be accessed with a swipe of the paw. To help your dog understand this game, hide the KONG toy in front of him or her the first time you play it.After placing the hidden snack, encourage your dog to recover it with an encouraging phrase like “Where is it?” Next time you hide it, use the same phrase to indicate to your doggy that there is a snack hidden in a KONG toy somewhere in the vicinity.

Make sure your dog knows basic commands.,
Obtain a clicker.,
Pick a quiet, non-distracting time.,
Press the clicker while your dog is dipping its head.,
Bring the dog’s head to the floor.,
Aim the pencil towards the chest, but behind the legs.,
Re-set your dog.,
Add a cue.,
Be aware of timing.,
Keep training sessions short.,
Use tasty, small treats.",How to Clicker Train a Dog to Bow," If your dog does not know basic commands like sit, down, come, and stay, then it will be very hard to train your dog to bow. Training your dog to bow is a more advanced trick that builds off of your dog’s knowledge of basic commands.If you have never trained your dog before, it will also be much harder for you, the trainer, to train your dog to do more advanced tricks, like bowing.;
, You can buy a clicker from your local pet supply store or online. You will need to introduce your dog to the clicker before training it with a clicker. When using your clicker, make sure to press the clicker at the moment your dog is performing the desired behavior. Then, reward your dog with a treat afterwards. If you are not familiar with a clicker, learn how to use a clicker here.

, Whenever training your dog, make sure you pick a time where there are no distractions. This way, you and your dog can focus on the task at hand. Try going to a separate room if there are too many distractions, and close the door behind you to ensure that the training session is not interrupted.If you have more than one pet, train them separately. Take one of the dogs to a separate room and close the door.

, While your dog is in a standing position, have your dog dip its head by bringing the pencil or the stick just below its head. As soon as your dog dips its head to sniff the pencil, press the clicker. Repeat this motion three to four times for a minute.Make sure to press the clicker when your dog begins to dip its head, not afterwards.
Reward your dog with a treat each time afterwards.
If your dog does not respond to the pencil, then use your hand that is holding the treats to guide your dog's head, instead.

, Make sure you dog is in standing position, again. This time, bring the pencil closer to the floor and near the dog’s chest. As soon as your dog’s head dips to sniff the pencil, press your clicker. Repeat this step three to four times for a minute.Your dog’s nose should almost be touching the floor at this point.
Give your dog a treat each time it successfully completes the movement.
If your dog does not respond to the pencil, then use your hand that is holding the treats to bring your dog's head to the floor.

, This time, the aim is to have your dog’s elbows touch the floor. To do this, aim the pencil towards its chest, but slightly behind its legs. By aiming the pencil slightly behind its legs, the dog will naturally make a “bowing” position. As soon as your dog’s elbows touch the floor, press the clicker.Give the dog a treat each time its elbows touch the floor.

, If your dog goes into a full down position, by setting his backside on the ground, simply re-set your dog. Re-set your dog by starting it from the standing position again.Do not click or reward the dog while it is in the down position.
To discourage the dog from going into a full down position, keep a hand under your dog’s tail or its belly to keep its backside up., Once your dog has perfected the behavior, add a cue. Because the cue “bow” sounds like the cue “down,” choose a different cue, like “stretch” or “ta-da.” If your dog does not bow with a verbal cue, also use a hand signal, such as an open hand near the floor.Once you use a cue, do not reinforce un-cued responses afterwards. Make sure to use the cue each time.

, When using a clicker, make sure to click during the desired behavior, not after it is completed. Do not worry if your dog stops the behavior when it hears a click. This is because a click ends the behavior. Then, give your dog a treat afterwards., If practice sessions go on for too long, they become repetitive and boring, and your dog will lose interest or become overwhelmed. Instead, practice in small sessions of four to five minutes each. Fit a few small sessions into your daily routine.For example, practice for five minutes each morning and evening after your dog has eaten and used the restroom.

, When training your dog, try to use extra tasty treats to reinforce good behavior, for example, pieces of hot dog, chicken, bacon, or an extra tasty dog treat. Dice the treats into small pieces to prevent your dog from becoming full during the training session. This will also help you keep track of how many times you use the clicker in a minute.To build the duration of the position, withhold the reward a second or two longer each time you and your dog practice.

Follow these instructions if you are new to dog training.,
Get the dog's attention with a reward.,
Wave the reward slowly back and forth.,
Move your own head, if necessary.,
Add the verbal command.,
Train in short sessions.,
Train the dog to respond to the command alone.",How to Train Your Dog to Shake Its Head1," This method demonstrates the fundamentals of dog training, and how to use them to teach this trick. If you already know how to train your dog but your dog is having trouble with this specific trick, check out the sticky notes method below.;
, Choose a specific reward that the dog enjoys, such as a ball, a plastic bone, or a smelly treat. Show the dog the reward at a time when the dog is attentive, but not overly excited. Command the dog to sit.


If the dog is too energetic, it won't focus on the lesson. Tire it out a little before training, or choose a slightly less exciting reward.
If your dog doesn't respond to ""Sit,"" teach your dog that command before you teach it this one.

, Start waving the reward very slowly on a horizontal line 30 centimeter (11.8 in) in length (about the length of a ruler). This shouldn't look like you're saying no or scolding the dog; it should look as if you're trying to hypnotize your dog. As soon as the dog follows the treat back and forth with its whole head (not just its eyes), reward and praise him. If the dog doesn't follow the movement, let him sniff the object, then try again.



Clicker training makes it much easier for the dog to understand your behavior. The basic idea is to use a ""clicker"" (or any short, sharp noise) immediately when the dog displays the correct behavior. Do this in addition to giving praise and treats.

, If your dog doesn't respond to the moving treat, try snapping your own head to one side. If the dog mimics you, say ""good head shake!"" and give it the reward. This may take several tries or even several training sessions.


If the dog still doesn't understand what you want, you may have to wait for the dog to shake its head naturally. Immediately reward the dog for this behavior.

, Choose ""Head shake!"" or any other verbal command, but stick to one exact choice of words. Give this command at the same time you wave the treat or move your own head. As before, reward the dog and praise it as soon as it responds correctly.

, Keep the first session to ten or fewer repetitions, to avoid making the dog tired or bored. Repeat the training daily, but stop each session as soon as the dog starts to tire, looks distracted, or resists your commands (typically within a few minutes). As you continue the daily training sessions, your dog should respond more consistently. Give him time and patience. Some dogs learn much faster than others.


End sessions on a positive note whenever possible. Praise the dog for its efforts.

, As your dog learns the command, repeat it with just a hand motion and a verbal command, without holding a treat. When your dog successfully responds, reward it and praise it as usual. When the dog consistently responds to this, start giving it just the verbal command. Continue the training until it responds to the command alone.

"
"
Identify what you want your dog to learn.,
Choose a school.,
Research all the institutions in your area.,
Meet the staff.,
Always ask for details.Ensure the school you're considering has a rigorous curriculum with plenty of structure, as well as time for bathroom breaks, snacks, and play.",How to Keep Your Dog Busy for Hours4," The objectives you hope to achieve will guide your decision as to which educational institute you'll be sending your doggy to. Do you want them to:


Not bark at visitors?
Not beg for food from the table?
Not be so territorial / temperamental?
Get along better with other pets?
Not to chew on furniture or shoes?, There are two kinds of schools for dogs: boarding schools and training schools. Both kinds of schools provide your dog with training and ""manners"" to keep them well-behaved. The main difference is that the boarding school will keep your dog overnight for an extended stay; the training schools will only take your pooch for the day.


How much reform your dog needs is the determining factor in choosing one or the other type of dog school. A pooch in need of serious reform might do best when separated from you and their usual routine for a few days. A dog who needs only minor correcting is probably better left at the training school.
If your main motive for signing the dog up for school is to keep them occupied for hours, a stint at training school for the day is your best option.

, Ask your vet for a referral, or consult your other dog-owning friends to see if they sent their dogs to any local schools, and ask for their opinions on the value they felt they received from each school. You can also check reviews online to see what various people thought about the education their pups received.


Find a reputable trainer through the Association of Professional Dog Trainers. Visit their searchable trainer database at https://apdt.com/trainer-search/.

, The training or care staff should be well-qualified and have lots of experience with animals. They should be caring, gentle, and attentive to the particular needs of your pet. Ask for credentials and resumes of the staff employed at each school you investigate.


Dog training is a serious occupation. Many trainers today obtain professional certificates.A good school will have trainers with credentials as well as experience.

, Find out what kind of things your dog will be doing. Ask for a schedule that explains exactly what the dogs will be doing and for how long.


Most schools have customizable curricula so you can choose which areas the dog receives instruction in.

Find a quiet place to train your dog.,
Get the best treats.,
Train your dog carefully.,
Start training with a treat.,
Start hiding the treat from your dog.,
Remove hand signals.,
Get a treat ready.,
Introduce the high-five command.,
Reduce rewarding with treats.",How to Teach Your Dog to Do a High Five," You will want to find an area to work with your dog that is as free from distractions as possible. By removing your dog from a noisy or busy location, you can help it to focus and learn how to high-five quickly.Never train your dog for more than fifteen minutes at a time. This can cause your dog to become frustrated and hinder training efforts.;
, When you train your dog, you will be rewarding them with treats until they learn how to high-five. Make sure you find a good mix between healthy ingredients and your dog's favorite flavors when selecting a treat.Store bought treats are considered safe to give to your dog. However, you must still avoid over-feeding your dog.
Apples, strawberries, bananas, cooked sweet potatoes, carrots, lettuce and spinach are some examples of healthy and safe treats for your dog.

, When you reward your dog, you will have to do so at the exact moment they behave in a way you want them to. Rewarding too far before or after they respond to your command will only confuse them and may accidentally reinforce poor behaviors.At the same time, give your dog a treat and offer a positive response such as “Good boy”.
Reward your dog just after they perform an action that you want to encourage.

, Before you teach your dog how to high-five, they will need to learn how to sit. If your dog already knows how to sit, you can skip this part, and proceed directly to teaching them how to high-five. Otherwise, take the following actions to begin introducing the sit command to your dog:Get your dogs attention.
Present your dogs favorite treat, holding it in your closed hand, a few inches from its nose.
Bring the treat above your dogs head and slowly move it behind.
Your dog will try to follow the treat with its nose and will have to sit down to do so.
Say “Sit” as your dog does so.
Reward the dog with the treat after it sits.

, Once your dog begins to sit on your command, you can begin hiding the treat from them. This phase of training is done by guiding your dog into a seated position with and empty hand. Your dog will learn to equate your verbal commands with the treat.Keep a treat nearby, either in your opposite hand or in a pocket.
Even though the treat is hidden during this phase, you will still reward your dog with it after it sits.

, Once your dog begins to sit with your hand guiding it into to position, you will want to start removing the hand signals. Instead of bringing your hand back and over your dog's head, simply say “sit” and wait for your dog to do so.Try holding your hand out, in front of your dog, but do not bring it over their head.
If your dog still doesn't sit, use your hand to guide it into position, using less range of motion each time.
Keep training your dog in this way, using the hand signal less and less, until they sit with only the verbal command.
Reward your dog with treats when they sit by verbal command only.

, Take one of your dogs favorite treats and hold it in a closed fist. Present the hand with the treat to your dog, allowing it to become aware of the treat you are holding. Wait patiently for your dog to paw at your hand.Hold the treat around four or five inches away from your dog's nose.
Reward the dog once it paws at your hand. This reinforces the behavior that you are trying to train.
Don't grab your dogs paw and try to force the high-five.

, Once your dog begins to paw at your hand, trying to get the treat, you can start to introduce the high-five command. Instead of presenting a closed fist with the treat held within, offer your hand in the high-five position.Wait patiently for your dog to paw your open palm.
Once the dog high-fives your hand, say “high-five” and reward your dog.

, Eventually you will want your dog to high-five on command, without offering a treat first. This can be done over time, by gradually reducing the amount that you reward your dog with a treat after it high-fives you.Start slowly, removing treats as rewards only occasionally.
Gradually decrease the amount of treats you reward your dog with until it is able to high-five without them.
Replace treats with affection and verbal praise.

Teach the dog to touch a sticky note with his nose.,
Move the sticky note to different locations.,
Stick two sticky notes at your dog's head height.,
Raise your standards gradually.,
Phase out the sticky note.",How to Train Your Dog to Shake Its Head2," As with most tricks, clicker training and some treats is the easiest way to accomplish this. Bring the sticky note near the dog's face, give a verbal cue, then ""click"" and reward the dog immediately if he sniffs or investigates it. Train in short sessions once or twice a day.

, Once your dog understands and can fluently touch his nose to the sticky note, start to stick the sticky note in different places. Repeat the training until the dog will respond to the command and touch it in any location.


You can stick it to your trouser leg, the wall or a chair.

, Next, stick one sticky note to the wall at your dog’s head height. Stick a second to the back of a chair opposite, so the two sticky notes face each other. Get your dog to sit in the gap between the chair and the wall. Command the dog to touch one of the sticky notes, then click and deliver your reward at the other sticky note. After enough repetitions, the dog will touch one and then the other. You now have a complete head shake.

, As you continue this training, start insisting that the dog make complete contact with both sticky notes before you give the reward. Once your dog understand this, start requiring the dog to move from side to side repeatedly, touching each sticky note multiple times.

, Once your dog has a good head shake going, have the dog sit further forward before you begin. The sticky notes will now be behind the dog, so the dog will not touch them when he turns side to side. Your dog may try to get up and turn around to actually touch the sticky notes, so you must be careful to click and reward right as they turn their head, not once they have turned around and actually touched the sticky notes. Gradually move your dog further and further away from the sticky notes, until it's learned to make the head shake motion with no props.

Make sure that your dog knows how to come, sit and lie down on command.,
Have your dog stand facing you, about two feet (60 cm) away.,
Holding the treat in your hand, wave the treat downward (or even drop it to the floor).,
Repeat this for a few times to get him used to the movement and receiving a reward.,
Add the verbal cue.,
Repeat the trick a few times.,
After several repetitions, try giving the ""Bow"" or ""Stretch"" command without moving your hand to signal.",How to Teach a Dog to Bow," Your dog should also know what his name is and be responsive to it. If he can't do these things reliably, you will need to teach him these basic commands first.;
, Hold a treat or toy so that he can see it, but don't let him eat the treat yet. If necessary, wave the treat a little to be sure that he is paying attention.

, He should lower his head to keep his eyes on the treat.


Immediately praise and pet him.
Let him have the treat and take out another one in readiness.
If using a clicker, click just prior to giving your dog his treat.

, Don't worry if your dog stands up straight away. He will learn to associate the treat (and clicker if using) with the movement after repetition.

, Say your dog's name, then add an appropriate phrase, such as ""Bow"" or ""Stretch"". Say the word as your dog gets into position, for example, ""Fido! Bow!"".


Use your hand coming down to the floor to indicate to your dog to bring his head to the ground.
Give the treat as before. If using a clicker, click just prior to giving the treat.

,


Continue with the verbal cue and moving your hand to the ground.
Switch to a pretend treat. When you open your hand on the floor, it should contain nothing.
Instead, give the treat after opening your empty hand. Give the treat with your other hand.

,


Give your dog lots of praise and treat every time you see the desired bow action. You can use the praise and treat method to reward natural bows every time that you see them, provided you associate the praise with the word ""Bow"" or whatever word you wish to use. By association, your dog may learn to bow naturally.Always reinforce an action you have taught your dog with praise treats and love.

Reward him when he completes the first two tasks with one command.",How to Teach Your Dog to Get a Beer," To make it easier for him, hang something from the handle of the refrigerator door. A rope with a thick knot on the end works particularly well for this, but a towel will work too. Just make sure it is properly secured to the handle.


If you decide to use an old rope or towel (i.e., something you don't mind ruining), check the integrity of the threads. If strands come off or it rips with little effort, find something newer. The fibers and dust will distract your dog and may be harmful to his health.;
, Hanging a towel or rope won't usually inspire your dog to start opening the door. If you are lucky, he will at least investigate the new door accessory. If you want to draw his attention to the towel or rope, point at it with your finger. When he pays the towel or rope any attention, click your and give him a reward.


First, click and reward when he looks at the towel or rope. Second, make him touch the rope with their nose before clicking and rewarding. This is the first part of shaping your dog's behavior into the acceptable form.

, Once he knows paying attention to the towel or rope is an avenue for rewards he will expect them. Now, you want to start training your dog to open the door on command. While standing near the refrigerator (i.e., close enough to point and touch the towel or rope), use a command such as ""Open the fridge"". Click and reward when he successfully bites the towel or rope.


Your dog may not initially understand the new command. He has been getting rewards without it so far. First, click and reward when he touches the towel or rope. Second, stop clicking and rewarding for just touching the rope. He will get aggravated and naturally bite the rope. Any motion to bite the rope should get a click and reward (e.g., touching it with his teeth or licking it). Don't move on until he actually bites the rope or towel.

, Stop providing clicks and rewards for simply biting the rope. Make him hold or pull on the rope next. Taper your clicks and rewards so that he must pull harder and harder to get rewarded.

, Train your dog to pull harder and harder on the rope. Start holding off clicking and rewarding until he pulls so hard the door opens. Click and reward if the door even opens a little and closes again. Continue clicking and rewarding until he opens the door all the way.


This can be difficult if your dog is pulling in the wrong direction. If you notice this is happening, stand in your dog's way so that he will have to move in a direction that causes the door to open. Once he starts associating the door opening with a reward he will not need to be guided.
Continue using the command throughout the process. When your dog opens the door all the way and it stays open, reward your dog excessively. Keep practicing this exercise until the dog will open the door on command. Eventually, he will become much more proficient at the task.

, Glass bottles will work too, but cans will not shatter when dropped. Your dog will be carrying the can sideways. Some beers may provide you options with cans. If you have a smaller dog you may opt to choose a tall can that has a smaller diameter. However, your beer of choice may not be packaged in these bottle-shaped aluminum cans.

, You want to get the beer cold for now. Your dog may not be accustomed to the temperature of the cold can. If you use a lukewarm to train with, your dog may become distracted by the coldness of the can when attempting to grab the beer from the refrigerator.

, This training can take some time. There's no need to defrost your refrigerator and freezer during training. Use a cold beer placed on the floor during this exercise. You may want to stick with a carpeted floor at the beginning. If he immediately picks up a can and drops it, then the damage to the can will be minimal.

, Click and reward when your dog looks at the can. Then click and reward when he investigates the can. Anything that gets him closer to biting or picking up the can. With luck, a can in the middle of the room will be very attention-getting. He may naturally investigate.

, As your dog investigates the can, he may engage in a number of behaviors. Any behavior that is closer to biting and picking up the can should receive a click and a reward. He may first sniff. Then he may lick. Then he may try to bite the can to carry it to another spot for more comfortable licking.


Your dog may start licking the can profusely. It is cold, and licking the can will provide a very novel experience for him. If he starts doing nothing but lick the can, stop rewarding him for licking the can.
If it takes a while to get your dog to bite the can, replace the can with a cold one from the refrigerator. This way he is biting and picking up a cold can instead of a lukewarm one.
If you have a ""pick it up"" command typically used with a ball, use that command to teach the dog to pick up the beer can.

, Start using a command such as ""Bring me a beer"" to encourage the on-command behavior. If your dog does bite the can it may be for the purpose of carrying it off for himself. Be sure to have some favorite treats ready to give him when he picks up the can and brings it to you. If the cold can, in and of itself, is a treat to your dog, you will need to find a treat he likes a lot more. Reward him for picking up the can, and, later, for bringing the can to you and releasing it into your hand.


If you regularly play fetch with your dog, use the same command to get him to bring the can to you.
This is where carpet comes in handy. If he has trouble picking up the can or drops it when a reward is presented, the can will fall softly on the carpet.
If your dog is reluctant to release the can, consider bring the treat closer to his mouth. He will have to release the can to receive the treat.
Consider having your dog pick up the can first, while the can is lying on its side, and second, while the can is standing up normally. Most likely the beers will be sitting upright in the refrigerator, so that's the orientation your dog needs to be accustomed to.
If your dog fetches your beer but drops it in front of you, do not reward him. Repeat the command and point to the beer in front of you. Reward him only when he puts the beer in your hand or you can expect a lot of shaken-up beers in the future.

, Once you know he will pick up and bring you a cold can of beer on command its time to move to the real deal. Open the refrigerator door to reveal a low shelf of beers. Put your cans near the bottom where your dog can get to him.Leave enough space so that your dog can reach in with his snout and grab a beer.

, The fact that the beer is in the refrigerator and not the floor will not be lost on your dog. This is a completely new scenario. Your goal is to activate the same behavior as before but within the new setting. Pointing will help focus your dog's attention, while giving the command will activate the instinct to perform the associated reward-seeking behavior.

, Click and reward for anything resembling the original behavior. Your goal is to get him to grab the beer from the fridge, and bring it to you. Ignore the fact that he neither opened nor closed the door. You will work on the proper sequence of behaviors later.

, Teaching your dog to close the refrigerator door works best when he already knows how to close a door. Primarily because you don't want to leave your refrigerator door open for an extended period of time. Choose a door that the dog can easily move behind when the door is opened.

, This can be difficult because he is not doing anything specific. Try putting a treat between your fingers. Then put the treat in front of their face. Without releasing the treat, move your hand toward the spot you want your dog to be (i.e., behind the door). When your dog gets behind the door, release the treat.


If you already have a command for your dog to sit on a specific spot or on or near an item or blanket, use that to get your dog to move behind the door. Place the item he sits close to or on behind the door, and use the proper command.

, Hold a treat above your dog's head. He will likely try to stand up to get it. Lift your hand higher to get him to stand up more. When he is standing up, click the clicker and give him the reward. If you can get him to stand up and remain balanced, then he is doing well. This is not required though. He just needs to be up high enough so he can push the door closed.

, Once your dog is trying to get the treat in the air, move your hand closer and closer to the door. Don't touch the door yourself. Wait for your dog to touch the door. Click and reward as soon as your dog makes any contact with the door. When he looks at the door and hit it then look at you for the treat, that's when you know you are ready to move forward.


This may be difficult if he does not want to touch the door. Try positioning the treat at the very edge of the door so that he almost have to touch the door to get it. If he moves around the door to avoid touching the door, position yourself perpendicular to the edge of the door (i.e., as if you are the door frame) so your dog will have to touch either you or the door to get to the treat.
This is really where the clicker is helpful. He may have so much tunnel vision he doesn't notice he touched the door while getting the treat. The clicker should help clue him in that touching the door is what you want him to do.

, Start giving him a specific command such as ""Close the door"". Gradually encourage him to push the door harder and harder. Let him get the door all the way to the door frame. Keep clicking and rewarding as he gets closer and closer to causing the door to close completely. Start clicking and rewarding only when he shuts the door.

, Now it’s time to move to the last subtask. Just as you taught your dog to close a door, you now need to teach him to close the refrigerator door. This time you will want to change the verbal command. Instead of ""close the door"", try ""close the fridge"". This way he knows exactly which door to close even if you are in another room.

, Start with the original command to see if he will understand. If he does, click and reward him. Then move to the new command. If he does not understand, use the same technique you used to teach him to close a door to close the refrigerator door.

, Continue clicking and rewarding when he touches, pushes, or closes the door. If he closes the door once, you are not yet finished. You want him to hear the command, look at the door, close it, and then look back at you for his treat. Re-open the door each time he closes it and repeat.

, First have him obey the command while you stand in front of the refrigerator. Then move farther away so he has to walk to the refrigerator to obey the command. Keep moving farther from the refrigerator until you are in a different room and out of eyesight of the refrigerator.

, This time you want to do the same thing with the second command. Open the refrigerator. While standing in front of the refrigerator, give the ""Bring me a beer"" command. Click and reward when he completes the task. Then repeat the task as you move farther and farther and into a different room.

, This last one is important. Although your dog may be able to put together that he has to open the refrigerator to get a beer, he will likely not remember to then go back and close the refrigerator. Practice having him complete this task just as you did with the previous tasks. Just don't forget to re-open the refrigerator each time he closes it.

, While standing near the refrigerator, give your dog each command in sequence. First ""Open the fridge"", then ""Bring me a beer"", then ""Close the fridge"". At first, reward him for each task completed. Then start rewarding him only when he finishes the last task. Keep giving the commands as you move into a different room.

, The final task is to train your dog to complete the ""Bring me a beer"" task without needing to provide the ""Open the fridge"" command. Stand in front of the refrigerator and give the ""Bring me a beer"" command. If you are lucky, he will almost immediately pulls the refrigerator open to get to the beers. If not, don't use the ""Open the fridge"" command. Instead, keep using the ""Bring me a beer"" command but train him to open the door first just as if the pulling the rope was the first part of the ""Bring me a beer"" command.


Training your dog to close the refrigerator in the middle of the second task may be very confusing for your dog. If you insist that this is necessary, you will want to start training your dog to first pick up a beer, then close a door, and then bring the beer to you. You may find it is easier to give the ""Bring me a beer"" command and follow with a ""Now close the fridge"".

They are usually said to be good with children, other pets, and even enjoy time alone. They love to play and interact with their family.Their small size makes them suitable for apartment life, but their energetic personalities also make them great dogs for owners with a lot of land to roam.;
, Every breed of dog, especially purebred ones, has its own set of medical possibilities that the breed is more prone to. Spend some time reading about schnauzers and their medical history to figure out if this is the kind of dog for you.Schnauzers are typically more often affected by eye cataracts than other breeds. This can eventually lead to blindness in old age.
Schnauzers also are prone to urinary stones, pancreatitis, diabetes, and kidney disease.
Consult a veterinarian about specific problems affecting schnauzers to get all the information. Ask good questions to fully prepare yourself.
Consider if you can afford pet insurance to protect yourself from the cost of expensive veterinary treatments.

, Schnauzers aren’t the highest maintenance type of dogs, but they do have a lot of energy. A schnauzer will require some significant exercise and vigorous play time from you as their owner.If you want a lapdog, a schnauzer will be happy to accommodate this, but they will also need to be exercised regularly.
Try to give your schnauzer between 30 minutes and one hour of exercise every day.
Schnauzers will also need to be groomed regularly, which is another time consideration. Their coats get matted easily, so they need to be brushed often or taken to the groomers.

, When you decide to adopt a schnauzer, you should decide if you want an adult dog or a puppy. If you want to adopt a schnauzer, it will probably be easier to find an adult dog to adopt, but there may be some puppies available if you are willing to spend some time searching.


An adult dog will be less work than a puppy. They may already be housetrained and will have probably outgrown the puppy tendency to chew things up. They will probably have a calmer temperament and be less active.
Puppies sure are cute, but they also require a lot of time and energy. They will need more exercise than an older dog and more attention to ensure they don’t pee in the house or tear up your belongings. They’ll need to be housetrained and trained in obedience and require a lot of attention.

, There are many schnauzer rescue agencies across the country that specialize in finding homes for this particular breed of dog. Search the internet for agencies near you and look at their listings for schnauzers currently in their care that are available for adoption.Try searching on adoptapet.com, petfinder.com, or Schnauzer Love Rescue, Inc., Once you find a schnauzer that you would like to adopt, you’ll need to fill out the adoption application with a perspective rescue agency. They will ask questions about your home, what kind of dog you’re interested in, and how much time you can devote to a dog.The application process will help the agency match you with a dog that is the right fit for you.

, Most rescue agencies will require references with their application. These should come from a veterinarian or a close friend who can attest to your ability to care for a dog. If you have an existing veterinarian, ask them to write the letter so they can tell the agency about your past history as a pet owner.Some applications may require a reference from a veterinarian, so be sure to check that before you ask someone else to write your reference letter.

, If you are adopting from a rescue agency, you will likely have to pay an application/adoption fee. This fee is usually applied to any vet bills the agency had to pay for routine shots, medical treatment, or just for day-to-day care of the dog.Application fees are usually around $300, depending on the agency.

, Once you submit your application, it can take several weeks for a decision to be reached. The agency must ensure that you will be a suitable owner for the schnauzer in question. Don’t call the agency a million times. They will contact you when they have reached a decision.

, A new dog requires a lot of supplies. You’ll need to purchase them ahead of time so that your house is ready when you bring your new schnauzer friend home. Make sure you plan ahead so that you don’t find yourself missing something when your pup arrives.You will need to purchase food, food/water dishes, collar, ID tag, leash, dog bed, and several toys and treats, and possibly a crate.

, Arrange a time and place to pick up your adopted schnauzer. Make sure you agree on the time with the agency so that someone knows to be there to meet you; otherwise you might find yourself waiting around for awhile.Bring some things with you to the pick up like the dog’s collar, leash, some treats, and a comfy bed for the ride home.

, Let your new schnauzer friend explore their new surroundings, but stay close to provide comfort and a feeling of safety for the pup. Be patient while your dog learns the rules of the house and how to interact in this new environment.If you have other pets already in the house, take some time to introduce them slowly so that they can get used to each other. You may have to be diligent about keeping them mostly separated for the first few days while they adjust.

, If you are using a tub with a slick surface like a sink, your bichon may slip and slide around during the bath. Since the pup will likely try to run away during the bath, they could slip and hurt themselves or end up inhaling water unless you have a rubber surface underneath that will prevent this.You can find a viable rubber mat at any

, Bichons have a lot of hair in their inner ears. It will act as a sponge during the bath and be difficult to dry afterwards. If water leaks into their ear canals, it could cause an infection. Gently place a single cotton ball in each ear before the bath begins and remove them after you dry the pup off., Bichons are prone to dry, sensitive skin so you’ll want a shampoo that is specifically designed for dogs like this. Most shampoos will include a list of breeds that they are ideal for on the label.

, Hold your dog with one hand so it doesn’t jump out of the tub and apply the shampoo directly to the fur. Place a dollop on each side of the torso to start and rub it in so that it lathers and covers all of the dog’s fur. Try to massage the shampoo deep into the fur. Apply more as needed., Use either a hose or a jug to pour warm water over the pup. Do this several times until all of the suds are out. You may need to hold the dog tight as it may squirm and try to get away.

, Apply the conditioner the same way as the shampoo. Start with a small dollop and add more until you thoroughly saturate the fur. Leave it in the fur for about five minutes before rinsing it out thoroughly. Wrap the pup in a soft towel and rub it all over to dry the fur. You can also use a blow dryer on a low heat setting to create a puffy look.

Understand the diversity of the group.,
Consider the health problems of non-sporting breeds.,
Evaluate your resources.,
Think about your lifestyle.,
Check with the people in your life.",How to Adopt a Non‐Sporting Breed1," Because the non-sporting breeds group is an arbitrary categorization created by the American Kennel Club, the dogs in the group share few characteristics outside of congenital health problems. Non-sporting dogs range from large to small and have a variety of personality types. Be sure to do some research into the specific breeds of non-sporting dogs and determine which works best for you.Tiny breeds in this group include the Tibetan spaniel and the Schipperke.
Medium sized dogs include the Boston terrier, the French bulldog, and the Shiba Inu.
Large breeds include the Dalmatian, the poodle, and the chow chow.;
, Because of inbreeding and other irresponsible breeding practices, dog breeds in the non-sporting group tend to suffer from significant congenital health problems. English bulldogs tend to have major breathing difficulties, many Dalmatians are deaf, and poodles tend to display a number of different congenital health problems. Because all of the dogs in this category are purebred, you can expect your dog to have significant health problems that result in high veterinary bills., A new dog can be expensive, especially one that will likely have significant health problems. Before you adopt a dog, be sure to look at your financial situation and determine if you can afford to take care of a dog. Make sure that you can afford your dog’s food, medical care, and other miscellaneous expenses.The ASPCA estimates that a dog costs anywhere from $500 - $1,000 each year depending on the size and health., Because the non-sporting group is so diverse, you should think about what kind of dog would fit well with your lifestyle. If you are a more active person who wants to play with the dog a lot, you might want to consider a Dalmatian or a poodle. If you are looking for a low energy dog that can hang out inside all day, you might be inclined to adopt an English bulldog. Do some research and find a dog from a non-sporting breed that works for you.Consider talking to your veterinarian about different breeds in the non-sporting group.

, If you have a family or live with roommates, you should talk with them before adopting a dog. Make sure that everyone is okay with you adopting a dog and avoid any conflicts. If a roommate or family member is allergic to dogs, you may need to reconsider your adoption.Be sure to check with your landlord about whether or not pets are allowed in your building. Depending on where you live, they may also have the right to increase your security deposit.

Get all of your supplies together.,
Bathe your dog in an area with plenty of space.,
Brush your dog.,
Coax your dog into the tub.,
Protect the ears.,
Wet your dog with lukewarm water.,
Apply dog shampoo.,
Dry off your dog.",How to Bathe a Great Dane1," Bathing a large dog can be quite a chore. Have everything you need before you start the process. Gather your towels, brush, shampoo, and a pitcher or cup. Having your supplies together will make bath time faster and keep you from leaving your dog unattended.You may need 3 or 4 large towels depending on the size of your dog.;
, Bathe your Great Dane in a walk-in shower, bathtub, or a portable bath tub. Both you and your dog should fit comfortably in the bath area. If your bathroom is small, a portable bath tub would be better.If it is warm outside, you can bathe your dog outside. However, if your dog tends to squirm a lot during bath time, it will be harder to keep him still if you are outside.

, Use a soft bristle brush to remove any loose hair.You can use a rubber grooming mitt instead of a brush of you prefer. Your Great Dane has a short coat so be very gentle when you brush. You do not want to hurt the skin.


Always brush in the direction the coat grows in. It is more comfortable for your dog.Great Danes are not prone to matting, but gently untangle any mats with your fingers or a comb. Do not try to brush matted hair.

, If your dog is unwilling to get in the tub, take him out for some exercise first. Your dog is more likely to enjoy the water after exercise and will have less energy to fight you.You can also put a treat or a toy in the tub to make it more attractive for your dog.


Never use anger or force to get your dog into the tub. This will make the experience unpleasant for both of you, and your dog will begin to think of bath time as something negative that needs to be avoided., Avoid getting water into your dog's ears. This is uncomfortable for your dog and can cause some health problems. Stuff the ears with cotton balls before the bath.Be sure not to put the cotton balls in too deep. You need to remove them once the bath is over.Excess moisture in the ears can lead to ear infections.Clean the ears once a week with an ear cleaner formulated for dogs. Typically, you apply the cleaner and then wipe out the ear with a soft, damp cloth., Once your dog is in the tub, use the shower head, spray hose, large plastic pitcher, or cup to wet your dog.The water should not be too cold or too hot. If the water is too hot or cold for a baby, then it is the wrong temperature for your dog as well.


Wet your dog from the neck down. This will protect its eyes, ears, and mouth.
Large dogs tend to overheat more easily so make sure that you choose the right temperature.
The water should be between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (or between 22 and 26 degrees Celsius).Talk to your dog in a calm voice as you wet him. This will make him feel comfortable and safe.

, Use a shampoo that is made for dogs. Human shampoo is too harsh for your dog's skin. Gently massage the shampoo into your dog's fur. Work from head to tail. Thoroughly rinse your dog with water.Avoid getting shampoo in the eyes, ears, and nose. You can use a wet washcloth to wipe your dog's face instead of applying shampoo to its head.
You may have to rinse multiple times to ensure that all of the shampoo is removed. Your dog's skin may become irritated if you do not rinse all of the shampoo off.
If your dog got into mud or is really dirty, you may need to shampoo and rinse multiple times.

, It will probably take 2 or 3 beach towels to dry your dog. Put a towel on the floor of the bathroom to keep your floor from getting too wet and place a towel on your dog as soon as he gets out of the bath. Rub him down. Use another towel if the towel gets soaked. Try to get your dog as dry as possible.It is best to air dry, but you can blow dry your dog. It is best to use a doggie blow dryer. Human blow dryers often blow out air that is too hot and can cause itching and dandruff.The sound of the hair dryer may scare some dogs. If your dog reacts to the sound, stick with towel drying.
If it is cold outside, keep your dog indoors until he is completely dry.
It is completely normal for your dog to shake off excess water, and there is not much you can do to prevent it. This is a reflex that prevents them from getting hypothermia.Place towels on the floor, wear clothes that you don't mind getting wet, and remove anything that you do not want to get wet.

It also shows you how many puppies she is having.A veterinarian will not always be able to identify a preemie puppy with an ultrasound or x-rays. However, that is a chance that he or she will.
Getting x-rays done is just one part of comprehensive prenatal care.;
, Set up an area where your dog will give birth. This area should be isolated from other dogs. It should also be warm and comfortable for the dog. It should include a ""nesting box,"" which is usually a low-sided box with towels or cushioning inside.Set up the nesting area about a week before you think the mother dog will give birth. This will give her time to adjust to the space.
The padding inside the nesting box should be a material that can be easily cleaned or disposed of. It will get soiled during labor and delivery, and will need to be replaced.

, You may also need a separate space where the preemie can be warmed even further. If a puppy is not warm enough it cannot digest food, so it is imperative that a preemie be kept very warm. This space can simply be a shoe box that can be warmed from the bottom and top.


The bottom of the preemie can be warmed by a hot water bottle covered with towels. The top can be warmed with a heat lamp or light.This space should have the capability of keeping the puppy at around 90°F (30°C)., New born puppies need to eat every two to four hours throughout the day and night. Preemie puppies are especially prone to malnutrition, so you may need to give them extra food on top of what they get from nursing. Have the formula ready in case the puppies have a hard time nursing.


If the puppy is extremely small and weak, it may not have the strength to nurse. If this is the case, you will need to give it all its nutrition.Puppy formula is sold in most pet stores and online.

, As the mother dog is giving birth you should assess the puppies. You do not need to physically touch them so much as see if they are generally the same size and if they are breathing on their own.


Preemies will be small, weak, thin, and may have less fur than full-sized puppies., If a preemie is born you need to assess whether it needs your assistance or if it can get enough warmth and nutrition from its mother. If a preemie is a lot smaller than its siblings, then chances are that it will need assistance. If one of the puppies is just slightly smaller than the other puppies, then it will likely get enough food and warmth but you should keep an eye on its growth and development.A very small preemie is at risk of dying. You should intervene in its care and get it veterinary care as soon as possible. A veterinarian will be able to assess its health and give it life-saving treatment, such as feeding it with a feeding tube.

, Even if you decide to allow the preemie puppy to be cared for by the mother, you should still keep a close eye on that care. You may need to assist the mother in caring for the preemie.


For example, a preemie can have a hard time getting its fair share of its mother's milk if it has larger siblings. You may need to keep the other puppies away from the preemie when it suckles so that it gets enough to eat., A preemie puppy needs food every couple hours in order to help it grow stronger. This means that you may need to hand feed it if it is unable to nurse on its own or if it is not getting enough milk from its mother.Some preemies need to tube fed instead of bottle fed. Tube feeding requires you to place the formula in a syringe and then shoot the formula into the puppy's stomach via a tube. Discuss the health of the preemie with your veterinarian and discuss this option. You should get instructions from your vet about this process.
This feeding even needs to occur throughout the night. This is one reason that caring for a preemie is a lot of work.

, A puppy needs to be warm in order to successfully digest its food. Preemies in particular have a hard time keeping warm, so they will need some help.The puppy should be kept at around 90°F (30°C). This will assure that it is warm enough but not too hot.

, You may need to increase the moisture where you are keeping the puppy in order for it to avoid getting dehydrated. When you are heating the area, dehydration can happen very easily and quickly.Set up a humidifier near the puppy. This will help it to avoid getting dehydrated.
If you don't have a humidifier you can introduce humidity by bringing boiling water into the room, placing the puppy in the bathroom with the shower running, or placing a damp towel on a heat vent in the room. However, you need to be very careful that you are not creating a safety hazard by using these methods., You want to make sure that the preemie is gaining weight and reaching developmental milestones. Weigh it regularly and make sure it does not have any health issues developing.If the preemie is getting regular veterinary checkups, then your veterinarian will weigh it and assess its health as well. This does not mean that you don't have to keep an eye on the puppy's development and progression as well.
A preemie should gain about ten percent of their birth weight every day after the day they are born. If it is not gaining that weight, then you should intervene to make sure it is getting enough food."

Consult an animal nutritionist.,
Feed her the right amount.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Keep an eye on her weight.,
Hydrate your dog.",How to Care for Bernese Mountain Dogs1," Bernese mountain dogs have special dietary needs. Since they are so large, these dogs need a dog food that is high-quality and provides a balance of nutrients. Look for dog foods that have real ingredients instead of fillers. The first three or four ingredients should be meat and vegetables. Meat by products and wheat should be farther down on the list.


If you are unsure of what to feed your dog, ask your vet or the breeder you get your dog from.
Bernese mountain dogs will live long, happy lives with these foods. However, look out for food sensitivity or intolerance in relation to certain ingredients. This can cause your dog to vomit, have diarrhea, or experience skin irritation.If this happens, see your vet to help determine what is causing the issue.;
, If you are unsure of certain foods, you may want to make your own dog food or put your Bernese mountain dog on a raw diet. This may be a good choice, but you will have to work with an animal nutritionist to make sure your dog is getting a balanced diet. This is important since your Bernese mountain dog, as well as all dogs, need certain nutrients to be healthy, just like humans.


Ask for a referral from your vet for a trusted and qualified animal nutritionist. There are also many online sources that describe the different homemade foods you can make., To avoid over or under feeding your dog, follow the suggested food amount on your pet's dog food. This will be a considerable amount since Bernese mountain dogs are so large, so make sure your dog is getting the right amount. To decrease this risk, feed your dog the recommended amount every day and avoid feeding her too many treats or table scraps.


Consider giving your pet natural treats, such a baby carrots or unsalted canned green beans., There are certain foods that can harm, and in some cases kill, your dog. This is because your dog's body cannot process certain foods, which is why the foods cause problems. Keep these away from your Bernese mountain dog, which can be more difficult since she can easily access counters and even low shelves. Keep these products in closed shelves that she cannot reach. These foods include:


Chocolate
Avocados
Grapes and raisins
Certain nuts
Alcohol
Onions, garlic and chives
Yeast dough
Sugar free foods, Although Bernese mountain dogs are large dogs, they can still be overweight. This may be hard to spot since they are already so big, but you should always be aware of your dog's weight. The recommended healthy weight for a female Bernese mountain dog is 100 pounds and 110 pounds or a little over for a male dog.


Your Bernese mountain dog is considered overweight if she weight 10 to 20% more than her ideal weight. This is around 110 to 120 pounds.
Anything more than 20% in weight is considered obese. Obesity can greatly decrease her lifespan and cause many health problems., Dogs need a constant supply of fresh and clean water to help them digest their food. Since Bernese mountain dogs are so large, she will likely drink more than a smaller dog, so keep a close watch on the water levels to ensure she has plenty.


You should also clean the water bowl every so often with dish soap and water, then rinse and dry it. This will cut down on any possibility of algae or bacteria that may grow in the bowl if not cleaned properly.

Search for dogs online.,
Visit the dogs.,
Get the animal’s history.",How to Adopt a Non‐Sporting Breed2," To begin your search, you should first visit the websites of local groups that are adopting out dogs. There are also a number of adoption websites that will help match you with the kind of dog that you are looking for.These resources will help you narrow down your search and limit it to a few dogs.You should also consider the ASPCA’s “Meet Your Match” program that will help you match with a dog that is right for you., Once you have found some prospective dogs, you should call the shelters and make plans for a visit. An in-person visit will help you get a better feel for the energy levels of different dogs. In order to determine how well you will get along, you should take the dog for a short walk and play with it.Most shelters will allow you to walk the dog and play with it. This should help you gauge the dog’s temperament and get a better feel for its personality.
If you have any other pets, be sure to bring them along. If your pets do not get along with the potential adoptee, it is not a good match.
You should also bring along any family members to help you get a feel for your family’s connection to the potential pet.

, Once you have had an opportunity to spend some time with the dogs, chat with the shelter’s staff members about their history and temperament. Because these people have been caring for the dogs, they may have important insights about their behavior and any issues that you should be aware of. You should also talk with the animal’s previous veterinarian, if it had one, to get an idea of its medical history. This is particularly important when dealing with the myriad health issues of non-sporting breeds.Ask the staff things like “How has the dog behaved since coming to the shelter?” and “What do you know about the dog’s history before coming to the shelter?”
You should ask the veterinarian things like “What medications is this dog taking?” and “What medical concerns should I be aware of?”

Begin the adoption process.,
Sleep on it.,
Complete the adoption process.",How to Adopt a Non‐Sporting Breed3," Once you have decided on a dog to adopt, you will need to complete an adoption process. This will initially include an interview with the staff of the shelter or rescue group where they ask you questions about your employment and pet ownership history. They may also ask about your veterinarian and how you will address the dog’s medical issues.Each shelter/rescue has different requirements of its owners, so this process will be different for each organization.

, Although it might seem tempting to adopt a dog the day you visit it, you should take at least 24 hours and think about it. Consider whether you are really capable of caring for a dog, particularly one with significant health problems. Talk with your friends and family members and weight the pros and cons of the adoption.Remember that dogs that are repeatedly returned to shelters or rescue groups suffer emotional and mental trauma that can lead to physical harm and illness. Most dogs that are returned to a shelter end up dying there.

, If you have had time to think it over and are still interested in adopting the dog, you will need to complete a little paperwork and pay some fees. The paperwork will likely document your agreement to adopt the dog and care for it. It may also have information about the dog’s medical history. The fees will go towards the shelter’s expenses. Once you have signed everything and paid the fees, the dog is yours.The fee can run anywhere from $20 to over $100. The adoption fee for rescue groups is often higher, ranging between $150 and $400.

Visit the veterinarian.,
Ease your dog into its new life.,
Develop a routine.",How to Adopt a Non‐Sporting Breed4," Because spending time in a shelter is a traumatic experience for most animals, you need to help your dog transition to your home. You can do this by creating a friendly and inviting environment for it. Before you bring your dog home, purchase a crate and place it in a quiet part of your home. Be sure to ask your family members or roommates to try to be quiet over the coming weeks as your dog acclimates to its new surroundings.Keep your dog’s crate in a place where it can interact with everyone. This will speed up its socialization. Do not put the dog’s things in the garage or closet.

, Because your dog may suffer from a congenital health issue, you should be on the lookout for any health concerns. Dogs, like poodles, that may suffer from deafness will exhibit a number of behavioral problems like increased aggression, skittishness, or a failure to respond to commands.Short-nosed dogs, like bulldogs, have a host of respiratory issues that cause it to wheeze, pant, and generally have difficulty breathing.In addition, your dog may experience seizures or be more prone to illness due to a weakened immune system. If you notice any of these symptoms, be sure to talk to your veterinarian right away.


If you dog is behaving strangely or improperly, be sure you visit a veterinarian right away. Changes in temperament are often the first indications of a serious health problem.

, After a few days at home, you should take your dog to the vet. You will want to have the veterinarian evaluate the dog’s overall health and make sure that it has received all of its vaccinations. You should also talk with your veterinarian about how to best care for any congenital health concerns that your dog may have.Many dogs develop ear infections and other minor diseases while in a shelter or rescue home.

, Over the first few weeks, gradually introduce your dog to new things. Allow it to explore your home at its leisure. If you have other pets, introduce them one at a time. It will likely take a few months and a significant amount of training to get your dog accustomed to living with other pets.Try not to have any major social gatherings at your home for a few months after you adopt your new dog. This could overwhelm it.

, Start your dog’s new routine as soon as possible after you bring it home. Take the dog on walks at the times when you intend to walk it. More importantly, feed it during regular feeding times. Establishing a routine will help your dog relax and feel more at home.If your non-sporting breed dog is taking any medications, make sure that it continues taking those medications regularly.
To help regulate its digestive tract, consider feeding your dog the same food that it ate at the kennel. This will help it feel less anxious and avoid developing any digestive issues.

Purchase dry shampoo.,
Apply the shampoo to your dog's fur.,
Alternate dry shampoo with water baths as needed.",How to Bathe a Great Dane2," Dry shampoo should be used instead of giving your dog a full bath. Great Danes are very large and bathing can be difficult.Full baths remove natural oils from your dog's coat and can lead to dry skin.Dry shampoo for dogs can be purchased from your local pet store or online.


Apply dry shampoo once a week or whenever your dog gets dirty. If you do this, you will only need to give your Great Dane wet baths in particular situations, like if your Great Dane rolls in something.
Dry shampoo is a great option in the colder months. You do not have to worry about your dog going outside with wet fur.

, Brush your dog and then rub the shampoo into his coat. Allow the shampoo to sit on your dog for the recommended duration. Then brush the shampoo out. Always read the instructions on the bottle before you apply. The amount of time you allow the shampoo to sit on the skin will depend on the product that you use.Dry shampoo is not as effective as bathing with water, but it will keep your dog clean.
You may also use waterless shampoo. You usually spray these products onto your dog's coat, rub your hands through the fur, and then pat the dog dry with a towel.

, For most Great Danes, regular dry shampooing is enough. If your dog gets sprayed by a skunk, smells really bad, or gets really muddy, a full bath may be necessary. Regular brushing and dry shampoo use will reduce the need for you to bathe your dog with water.Pay attention to how your dog's skin reacts to the dry shampoo. If you notice any irritation, you may be using the dry shampoo to frequently.
It may take some trial and error to find the right dry shampoo for your dog. If the shampoo leaves a white residue or is difficult to brush out, choose another brand.

Put toys in the tub.,
Get your dog used to getting wet.,
Have a positive attitude.",How to Bathe a Great Dane3," Help your dog associate bath time with something that is fun. Allow your dog to play with its favorite toys during bath time. Your dog will be calmer and will feel like bath time is play time.Allow your dog to play in the tub a few times before you give him a bath in there.
Instead of toys, you can also feed your dog in the bathing area.

, If your dog does not like getting wet, bath time can be very hard. Do small exercises to help your dog feel comfortable getting wet. Dry your dog after each exercise. All of these exercises will help your dog associate water with treats and fun.Wet a sponge and rub it on your dog's back before he eats. Dry off your dog when he is done eating. Do this three days in a row.
If it is raining lightly, play fetch with your dog outside for a little while. Dry your dog off when you come back inside.
You can also squirt your dog with a little bit of water and then give him a treat. Turn the squirting and treat into a little game. This is great to do with a garden hose and the weather is warm.

, If you dread bath time, your dog will too. Be upbeat and have positive body language when it's time to bathe your dog. Use the same attitude as you do when you take your dog outside to play or when it's time to eat.Speak to your dog with a happy, upbeat tone and say his name.Praise your dog or give a treat when he behaves during bath time.

Take care of her fur.,
Trim her nails.,
Take care of her teeth.",How to Care for Bernese Mountain Dogs2," Bernese mountain dogs have long, silky fur that needs weekly care. Brush her fur at least once a week to keep it from getting tangled and knotted. This will also help her skin development and encourage circulation.


You should also check for ticks and fleas while brushing her. Look close at the skin and run your fingers over her fur while your brush her to check for ticks.
Also use this time to check for any skin abnormalities, such as cysts, lumps, or bumps. Also look for skin irritation and redness. If you find any, you should contact your vet to find the cause.
Bernese mountain dog's fur is not generally cut short but is just kept trimmed neatly., In addition to taking care of her fur, you should also take care of her nails. You can get your vet to do this or you can try it at home. It may be hard to do it at first at home, but after she gets used to it, she will likely let you do it. Just make sure you know what you are doing so you avoid cutting to much off and injuring the quick of her nails. This is painful and may cause them to get infected.


Even if the vet takes care of her nails, you should groom the fur around her paws. It should be kept neatly trimmed but long enough to keep her paws covered., Bernese mountain dogs benefit from brushing their teeth every day. This will help remove plague and bacteria that builds up in her mouth. Never use human toothpaste on a dog because it can cause illness because the fluoride is poisonous to dogs. Buy dog toothpaste and a dog toothbrush, which can be bought at pet stores or from your vet.


You may have to start slow to acclimate her to the feeling of brushing her teeth. Start off by letting her lick the toothpaste off your finger, rubbing it into her gums with your finger, and then brushing a little at a time until she lets you do all of her teeth. This may take a week or more.
While you brush her teeth, also look for loose or damaged teeth and check the overall health of the mouth.5
You can also give her dental fortified treats or food to help fight plaque buildup. If your dog gets a lot of buildup despite bushing her teeth, your vet can clean her teeth as well."

Have large enough living arrangements.,
Exercise your dog.,
Socialize her.",How to Care for Bernese Mountain Dogs3," A Bernese mountain dog cannot live in a small apartment or house. Since they are so large, they need adequate space. She can be very happy in a medium sized or large house. If you don't have a large house, consider housing her outside. Many Bernese mountain dogs can live quite happily outside, especially in cold weather, as long as they have the right supplies. This includes:


A large dog house
Plenty of insulated bedding, such as dry, clean straw and a warm blanket
Access to shade during hot weather
Access to plenty of water
Make sure you never chain your dog up outside., Bernese mountain dogs need to exercise daily. Start with at least a 30 minute walk or job twice a day. Just putting them outside is not enough, especially if your yard is small. Consider running or jogging with your dog as she gets stronger. This will help burn more energy and help her be happier.


In addition to walks, play games with your dog, such as Frisbee or fetch to give her more exercise and make it fun. Plus, it will help her bond with you more.Never give your Bernese mountain dog small toys or balls because she may accidently swallow it, which can cause her to suffocate or choke.

, Starting when she is a puppy, your Bernese mountain dog should be socialized with other dogs as well as people. Introduce her to people and dogs through walks in the park or through a neighborhood. Consider taking her to a dog park with other dog lovers.


If you can't find a group or dog park on your own, many pet stores and community groups have socialization classes. This will her start this process in a safe and controlled atmosphere. manners.You can also take her to obedience classes at the same time, which also gives her exposure to other dogs.

Plan ahead if crossbreeding.",How to Select a Male Dog for Breeding," Many inexperienced owners of female dogs do not consider the time commitment and responsibilities of breeding their dog, and may not fully think through the process. There are already plenty of puppies and breeders, and if you don’t find a suitable home for all of the puppies in your litter, they may wind up as stray animals or living in animal shelters.If you are only planning to breed your dog for the sake of having puppies for yourself, your children, or your friends: reconsider.
Also reconsider if you only want to breed a litter of puppies so that your dog can experience sex, so that you children can see what birth looks like, or to have another dog “just like” the female. None of these are sufficient reasons to breed your dog.;
, Many pedigreed dogs—especially those bred to be shown and to match the rigorous breed requirements established by specific show organizations or kennel clubs, including the World Canine Organization. Certain breeds—such as pugs and weimaraners—have been bred to match physical standards that leave the dogs with serious health problems in their adulthood. If you are breeding pedigreed animals together, make sure that the dogs’ offspring will still have functional bodies and be able to live comfortable lives.Pugs have been bred to have large, bulging eyes, and they often suffer serious eye problems and eventual blindness.
Weimaraners are bred to have broad, deep chests, but overbreeding for this feature often results in dogs with life-threatening gastric and intestinal conditions.

, Breeding the dogs, delivering the litter, and raising the pups until they get adopted (around 8 weeks old) takes work, and will often occupy the majority of your time, even once the pups have been weaned. You will need to care for your dog while she gestates—about 63 days in most breeds—and take the dog to the vet for natal checkups.Once your dog is pregnant, talk to your veterinarian about how you can prepare for the pregnancy and birthing processes.
Your responsibilities as a breeder also extend to each puppy produced: you need to find each a safe, permanent home, whether there are 2 or 12 pups.

, Finding a male and breeding the dogs requires logistics and planning, and raising a litter of pups for roughly 8 weeks requires financial commitment. Make sure you’re your schedule, budget, and personal life will allow you to devote time and resources to the breeding, and You also need to be prepared ahead of time for unanticipated complications, such as the mother (your female dog) dying in the birthing process, or medical problems with one or more of the newborn pups., When breeding your dog, it’s smart to begin by looking for someone who owns a male dog of the same breed. Establishing trust with the owner of the male dog will give you the benefit of working with someone you trust, and will simplify the process of coordinating a stud fee and breeding logistics.If you’re registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC), start there, as the AKC will be able to recommend viable breeders in your area. You may also be able to research pedigreed genetic lines and individual dogs online.

, This is a standard step when breeding two pedigreed dogs together, but one that cannot be overlooked. A pedigree will show the dog’s siblings, parents, grandparents, and in some cases, great-grandparents. For breeders of pedigreed dogs, it’s important to see this document, as it will indicate the legitimacy of a breeder’s claim to their dog’s pedigree, and point out any genetic incompatibilities between the two dogs.In the United States, in order for pedigreed puppies to be registered with the AKC, they must be birthed by a pedigreed sire (father) and dam (mother).AKC registration maintains records of pedigreed dogs and their offspring.

, The male dog that you select to breed with your female needs to complement her genetic makeup. While both dogs should have strong pedigrees and genetic histories—without any serious medical issues—you should look for a male dog whose genetic and behavioral strengths can compensate for problem areas in your female, and vice versa.For example, if your female has a thin coat of hair, select a male dog with a thick, appealing coat of hair.

, Even if you’re not concerned about breeding for specific genetic traits, and not trying to maintain a bloodline, you should make sure that the male dog does not exhibit any concerning or unpleasant behaviors. These behaviors could be passed on to any pops that result from the litter, and result in them being unpleasant pets.For example, concerning behaviors in the male dog include: excessive anxiety or shyness when meeting new people, aggressive or temperamental behavior, separation anxiety, or hyperactivity.
Of course, keep in mind that the dog behaviors will differ from one breed to the next. What is considered “abnormal” behavior for one breed may be fine in a different breed.

, The male dog may bring medical problems to the union which could be passed on to the pups. Discuss the dog’s medical history with its owners. Ask if the dog has been screened for diseases that could be passed on genetically—if the dog hasn’t been, insist that the screening take place before the male dog and your female breed. If the male dog has Diseases with genetic components, find another mate for your dog.If the male dog’s owner has taken their animal to the vet regularly (which they should have), ask to peruse the veterinarian’s records. These will indicate if the dog has any serious or recurring problems that may be passed on to the pups.
Ask specifically about diseases of common concern among pedigreed dogs, including hip and elbow dysplasia. These unfortunately common conditions are painful and affect many domesticated dogs.

, Once you decide on a breeder and a male dog to breed with your female, communicate regularly with the breeder, especially if they have had more experience breeding dogs than you. Ask if their dog—or its parents or grandparents—has a history of any genetic illnesses, or a disposition towards and problematic behaviors. Also ask if the breeder’s male corresponds with the “breed standard” (as established by the AKC).Before mating your female dog with the male dog you select, sign a legal agreement with the dog’s owners. This should specify the stud fee (a fee for the act of breeding), and specify the payment or number of puppies that the male dog’s owner will receive., The practice of crossbreeding involves breeding together two different breeds of dog—whether intentionally or unintentionally. Crossbreeding is occasionally used as a deliberate practice, in order to introduce new genetic material and physical and behavioral traits into an overbred purebred bloodline, or to produce cute and well-behaved puppies.If crossbreeding your female with a male dog, be sensitive to the size difference. While the breeding itself may not be a problem, if the male is much larger than the female, the birthing process could be painful and potentially life-threatening.

Monitor the litter closely.,
Call the vet if any pups separate from the litter or cry excessively.,
Prepare the whelp box for transport.,
Have the mother tested for malnutrition and infection.",How to Save a Fading Newborn Puppy1," Look for abnormalities like pups without suckling instincts, excessive crying, and physical deformities such as flattened chests or any absent body parts. Seek emergency care as soon as possible if you suspect something’s not right. Be ready to report your observations to the vet.Take an initial weight of each pup after birth. Continue to weigh them a couple times per day afterward. Within 24 hours, a pup’s weight might decrease by less than 10%, but should increase steadily after the first day.
Take the pups’ and mother’s temperatures at least a couple times per day.
Be ready to describe the mother’s diet to the vet.
Closely monitor nursing and make sure nursing begins within a maximum of 12 hours of birth. Note if the mother disregards or is disinterested in nursing or attending to the pups.
Be ready to describe any interactions your pregnant dog had with other animals in the weeks prior to delivery. This will help the vet diagnose any communicable diseases that might be affecting the pups.  ;
, Newborn pups should do little more than nurse and sleep, and should cry only very little, if at all. They should huddle with the other pups without crawling away from the group. If pups deviate from any of these normal behaviors, call the vet immediately., The vet will most likely have you bring the mother and full litter in for examination. Use the whelp box to transport the mother and pups.


It’s a good idea to create a whelp box instead of just designating a whelp area for your dog to deliver its litter. That way, you’ll be able to transport the mother and litter more easily in the event that emergency care is needed.

, The vet will screen the mother’s blood for low iron and protein content and ask you about her diet. They’ll also check for birth defects and test for viral and bacterial infections, such as E. coli and parvovirus.These steps will help the vet determine whether antibiotics should be administered.

Review your results of the ancestry analysis.,
Talk to the laboratory about the results.",How to Test Dog DNA and Analyze Parentage," Start by asking your veterinarian about the most appropriate laboratory to obtain the test you want. Two of the bigger companies that offer DNA testing are Wisdom Panel and DNA My Dog. Consider asking your veterinarian which laboratories are the most reputable and whether there are significant differences in price. Ask them:


“What is the best laboratory to test my dog’s DNA?”
“How many laboratories offer these tests in our region?”
“What are the cost differences between the competing laboratories?”
“Are there any major differences in customer service between the laboratories?”;
, DNA tests can vary in cost depending on what you're testing for and where you're having the test done. If you are shopping around, consider both the price of the actual DNA test and any additional costs involved in transporting the DNA sample and following up with a veterinarian at the lab. If the price difference between laboratories is small, you should also consider whether or not it is worth spending a little more and whether there are any associated differences in expertise or service., If you are a dog owner or a breeder, you may want to determine the parentage of your dog, and you may also want to figure out the ancestry of your dog. Ask your veterinarian to order the particular type of test that you'd like. Alternately, visit a laboratory in person or online to order the test directly from a laboratory that specializes in dog DNA.


For a DNA parentage test, a lab will charge a fee per sample so you will be paying more or less depending on how many samples you need tested. You will need to have access to your dog, as well as the mother and father dogs that you want tested for parentage. The test will tell you whether there is a match between your dog and the possible mother and father dogs.
You can also order a DNA parentage test for an entire litter of dogs. If you are managing a lot of dogs, this will give you confidence that all of the puppies belong to the same parents.Laboratories sometimes offer a DNA test to determine if there is any wolf or coyote DNA in your dog. This is often a separate test.

, Ask your veterinarian to help you order a DNA profile for your dog. Getting a DNA profile of your dog is a highly secure way of identifying your dog in the event of loss or illness. If your dog is ever lost, the profile will be invaluable as a way of ensuring any dog you find is actually your dog. In the event of illness, your dog’s DNA profile will also be crucial for determining that the correct sample is being used to test your dog for particular diseases. You can order DNA profiles from a variety of laboratories, which your veterinarian will know.


In addition to the DNA profile, it is worthwhile microchipping your dog. Although your dog’s DNA profile is the most fool proof way of identifying your dog in the event of loss, the microchip will be the faster method. Ask your veterinarian to insert a microchip between your dog’s collarbones.Once you have figured out your dog’s DNA profile, you should get it stored at the laboratory and at your veterinary office. If your dog gets sick or lost, the DNA profile will be very useful., You can collect the sample yourself using the DNA test kit. The swab will come in a collection tube. Using the swab included in your DNA test, take a swab from inside your dog’s cheek. Rub it on the inside of your dog’s cheek and underneath their tongue for sixty seconds. Take it out and put it in the collection tube., You can collect the sample yourself but it will help to have your veterinarian direct the process. You will need to use a swab to collect DNA samples from the puppy, mother and father. If the puppy has been feeding from the mother, you will need to separate them for a few minutes before taking the swab to avoid sending milk to the lab. You should collect one sample at a time and write the names of the dogs on the sample tubes., If you feel unsure about how to collect a sample of your dog’s DNA, you could ask your veterinarian. Tell them you want to collect your dog’s DNA for a laboratory test to determine parentage, ancestry or DNA profile.


If you ordered a test, you should bring the entire test kit to the veterinarian so they will have all of the details.

, Using the address given to you by the company, mail your DNA sample back to the laboratory. Once the company receives your dog’s DNA sample, it will probably take them a few weeks to analyze it. Phone them to find out the processing time for your sample.You can also get your veterinarian to send the sample to the laboratory.

, Review the details of the parentage profile summary including with relation to DNA markers, matches, and inclusion or exclusion of possible parents. Figure out whether the test has positively identified specific parents as a DNA match and whether any dogs have been excluded as possible parents.


If you are testing for multiple fathers, you will probably find a complete DNA match for only one father. This will ensure you know the correct father or sire of the dog.If neither parent is a match, you will have to do another DNA test.

, Look at the results of your dog’s DNA test analysis. Depending on the DNA test you ordered, these results may include information on the specific breeds in your dog’s ancestry, as well as information on types of breeds and fitness levels.Reflect on the relationship between the laboratory analysis and what you thought your dog’s ancestry might be. Consider whether you are surprised or whether the results confirmed your suspicions with regards to the specific breeds in your dog’s ancestry.

, To further understand your dog’s DNA test results, it can help to phone the laboratory and talk to one of the veterinarians. They may be able to give you some further insight into the results of your dog’s DNA test, especially if there is anything surprising about the results. You can also bring the results to your vet to see if they can clarify any questions or provide further explanation."

Prepare the whelping box.,
Line the whelping box.,
Place a heat lamp above the whelping box.",How to Whelp Large Breed Dogs1," The whelping box is the space in which your dog gives birth to its puppies. It is also the space to which all puppies should return after their mother has completed birthing its litter. You can buy a whelping box commercially or construct one from wood or a cardboard box.If you think your dog will become pregnant again, you might as well invest in a sturdier commercially-made whelping box. These are readily available at most pet stores.
If you don’t foresee your dog bearing more pups, you can make your own whelping box and then simply discard it once it is no longer useful. If you’re handy you could construct one of wood. If you’re less handy, you could simply take the top off a cardboard box that could accommodate your dog (for large breed dogs, you’ll need an area of at least one square meter, or nine square feet).
For large breed dogs, you’ll need a large whelping box. If you construct your own whelping box, ensure that it is large enough for the dog to lie down and turn around comfortably.
The sides of the whelping box should be tall enough that puppies cannot escape, but low enough that your dog can hop in and out comfortably. For instance, your box might have three sides that are 15 inches high (38 centimeters) and one side that is 4 inches (10 centimeters) high.
Since you have a large breed dog, there will be enough space in the whelping box for you or another caretaker to sit with your dog and comfort it during labor.;
, Your whelping box needs to be soft and cozy inside for your new puppies and your large breed dog. Place a large plastic bag in the bottom of the box. Place layers of newspaper and/or a few cozy blankets or sheets over the bag.Never add wood shavings, sand, or other particulate to the whelping box.

, The lamp should be suspended over one corner of the whelping box so that pups can move toward or away from it depending on their temperature preference. Newborn pups have a lower core body temperature than adult dogs and are extremely sensitive to temperature changes.Aim for a whelping box temperature of 85 degree Fahrenheit.

Check the puppy.,
Instruct another person to call the veterinarian.,
Engage in emergency care.,
Drain the airway using gravity.,
Remove fluid using a suction bulb syringe.,
Breathe into the puppy's nose and mouth.,
Check for a heartbeat.,
Compress the puppy's chest.,
Repeat both respiratory and cardiac treatment as needed.,
Stimulate the puppy once its heart begins to beat.,
Know how long to continue.,
Monitor the puppy closely.",How to Revive a Puppy," When a puppy does not immediately begin to cry after birth, there is a high risk that it may not be breathing. Puppies that are struggling to breathe and those that do not start breathing within a few seconds will need emergency CPR.


Breech birth puppies—those that are born feet-first, rather than head-first—are more likely to face danger than those birthed normally. As soon as you see that a puppy is experiencing a breech birth, you should be prepared to check its breathing and perform CPR as needed.
Even a puppy born normally may not immediately begin breathing, though. Any puppy that does not begin breathing within a few seconds of birth should be given emergency CPR.
A puppy that opens its mouth in a gasping motion without making a sound puppy has likely inhaled amniotic fluid and could be suffocating. On the other hand, a puppy that is completely lifeless has probably stopped breathing and may or may not have a heartbeat. It will be harder to save a newborn puppy that enters into complete cardiac arrest, but you should continue to work with this puppy since saving it may still be possible.
That being said, at this point, you only need to determine whether or not the puppy has stopped breathing. Don't worry about how lifeless the puppy appears overall, and focus on clearing the airways before checking for a heartbeat.;
, Another person should call your veterinarian or an emergency animal clinic while you begin CPR procedures.


A veterinarian should be able to guide you through the process more thoroughly. He or she should also be able to consult you on how long to continue working on the puppy based on your specific circumstances.
If you are the only person around, perform emergency CPR before contacting the veterinarian. Once the puppy starts breathing, call the veterinarian for advice on continued care.

, In many cases, you will need to provide both pulmonary and cardiac treatment to the lifeless puppy.


Initial respiratory treatment should be provided first, followed by cardiac stimulation. You will then need to rotate back and forth between respiratory and cardiac care until the puppy is stable.
If the puppy's heart is not beating at all, you will need to try restarting it. If the puppy's heartbeat is present but slow or weak, you will only need to stimulate the puppy in an effort to keep its heart working.

, Gently hold the puppy's head downward for 5 to 10 seconds so that gravity can help drain any amniotic fluid and/or mucus from the mouth, throat, and lungs.


Centrifugal force can also be used to drain the fluid of the puppy's lungs, but you should ask a veterinarian to demonstrate the process before attempting to do it. You'll need to hold the puppy's head and neck very secure while smoothly swinging the puppy down and in between your legs. The movement should not be jerky and you must ease the puppy into a gradual stop., While keeping the puppy's head tilted downward, use a medical suction bulb syringe to remove fluid from the puppy's mouth.


Squeeze the bulb to remove the air from inside. Do this before inserting the bulb into the puppy's mouth since doing so afterward would drive fluid further down into the lungs.Insert the tip of the suction bulb into the puppy's mouth. The tip should reach the entrance of the puppy's throat, but try not to force it too far into the throat since doing so could cause injury to the puppy's airways.
Once the syringe is positioned, gradually release the squeezed bulb. The suction should draw fluid from the mouth and throat into the bulb.
Remove the bulb from the puppy's mouth and squeeze it again to evacuate fluid and air. Repeat two or three more times, or until you stop drawing fluid out.

, Gently breathe into the puppy's nose and mouth two or three times to fill the lungs with air.


Position your mouth so that it is sealed around both the mouth and nose of the newborn puppy. Alternatively, you can hold the puppy's mouth closed with your hand while positioning your own mouth over the puppy's nose.
Breathe small, gently puffs of air into the puppy. Do not breathe too deeply since doing so can damage the puppy's lungs.

, After administering initial respiratory treatment, check the puppy's chest for a heartbeat.


Place your fingers against the chest wall. A strong heartbeat should be easy to identify with no additional tools.
You may need to use a stethoscope to identify the difference between a weak heartbeat and no heartbeat, however. If you have a stethoscope, place it over the chest wall and listen for a few seconds.
Note that a normal, healthy newborn puppy should have a heartbeat between 120 and 180 beats per minute.

, If the heart is not beating at all, you will need to perform a few gently chest compressions.Place your thumb and index finger around the puppy's chest, directly at the back of the puppy's bent elbow. This is roughly where the heart should be.
Squeeze or compress the chest quickly to stimulate the heart. Do so once or twice.

, You will need to switch between mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compression until the puppy shows signs of life.


Give the puppy two to four puffs of air every 15 to 20 seconds.
Continue to gently compress the puppy's chest in between puffs of air.
Check the puppy every minute to determine if it has begun to breathe on its own. You should also check for a heartbeat every minute.

, As soon as the puppy's heart begins to beat, stop performing chest compressions and focus on stimulating the puppy.Using light, careful pressure, vigorously rub the puppy with a towel.
Gently turn the puppy over in your hands several times.
Grab the puppy by the scruff of its neck several times, as well.
While stimulating the puppy, you may still need to provide a few puffs of air every 20 to 30 seconds to keep its lungs pumping.

, Once the puppy's heart starts beating, you should continue stimulating the puppy for at least 20 minutes.


Most puppies that revive after receiving emergency CPR will stabilize after 20 minutes.
If the puppy's heart does not start beating within 5 minutes of treatment, however, it is unlikely that the puppy will revive.

, All newborn puppies should be closely monitored for several days, but it is especially important to keep a close eye on puppies who needed to be revived upon birth.


One of the most important things you can do is to keep the puppy warm. Puppies that get chilled during the first week of life can easily weaken and pass away. Provide hot water bottles, heating pads, heating lamps, and plenty of warm blankets in an effort to keep the box at a minimum constant temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).
Professional veterinary care is also strongly recommended. If you have not already called the veterinarian, do so after the mother has given birth to the remainder of her puppies. Let the veterinarian know about any puppies you needed to revive and follow his or her instructions on additional aftercare.

Report them to a complaint website.",How to Report an Unethical Dog Breeder1," You may want to start by contacting the animal control in your community. When you contact them, you can explain to them why you believe the breeder is unethical and what complaints you have.They may ask you specific questions about the situation to try to gather facts. It's generally the job of animal control to investigate any claims of mistreatment of pets.Animal control may check it out or refer you to someone else to talk to. However, even if animal control goes to investigate, they cannot enter a home or check out the property without the owner's consent, unless they have a warrant.If this doesn’t yield results, then move on to animal organizations.;
, One way you can report unethical breeding is through the Humane Society’s website. They have a form on their website where you can report a puppy mill by providing the basic information for the breeder, including their name, address, website, email, or phone number. You can find the form .You will have to give them basic information about yourself as well.
The Humane Society will look for key signs of unethical breeding. They will start with registration and pedigrees, then talk to the breeders. Ethical breeders are knowledgeable, so they will evaluate the knowledge of the breeder. Next, they will assess where the breeders are breeding and keeping the dogs, if the breeder will even allow them to see it. These things will give them an idea of the ethics of the breeder.

, If animal control or the Humane Society doesn’t help, you may want to try other animal advocate organizations. Many of these organizations have hotlines or contact emails where you can report unethical activity or ask for advice.


You may want to try the American Kennel Club, the ASPCA, or PETA. They may be able to launch their own investigations.
You can also contact the AKC to see if the breeder is a member, though unethical breeders can still be members without the AKC's knowledge of their practices. Alerting the AKC may help them figure out if something unethical is occurring.
These organizations may be able to send people out to investigate.

, There are websites you can submit complaints to about unethical breeding. On these sites, you can state the name of the breeder or kennel and share your story about why they are unethical breeders.Websites such as Complaints Board and Consumer Affairs allows you to post reviews on specific breeders, or make posts about the specific breeder under headings like “dog breeders” or “pet breeders.”
When you write a complaint post, you should provide specific information. Give the name of the breeder or kennel and the location, followed by a detailed description of why you believe they are unethical. Include things like their business practices, the state of the kennel, and the health of the puppies. These key things help distinguish ethical from unethical breeders.

Make an appointment and ask for estimates.,
Follow the vet’s directions.,
Write down your concerns before the visit.,
Transport the dog to the vet.",How to Take Newborn Puppies for Their First Vet Checkup1," You will need to set aside significant funds for the veterinary care of your new puppy. The costs of veterinary care for dogs has been increasing. Costs tend to be slightly more expensive in urban areas so you should phone a few veterinary clinics to find out the average costs associated with owning a puppy. Average costs for some typical veterinary services are outlined below:You may pay approximately $200-500 per year for flea and tick prevention.
You may pay approximately $60-150 per year for vaccinations.
Annual physical exams cost $45-200 for the first year and $20-100 for subsequent years.
Heartworm test and preventions cost between $0-35.
Neuter costs between $35-200.;
, Pet insurance is worth considering for your new puppy. The costs of emergency medical treatment from an accident or a rare disease can be exorbitant. Similarly, dealing with poisoning or other unanticipated events can be prohibitive. To cope with these risks, you should look into the affordability and details of pet insurance policies.Typically, you will have to pay for the costs upfront and then the insurance company will reimburse you. However, there are some plans that will pay the veterinarian upfront.The costs of pet insurance increase if you have particular breeds or for older dogs.Most plans are focused on accidents and illnesses, although some also cover some forms of routine care such as annual exams.Instead of pet insurance, you could start an emergency savings fund to deal with possible future accidents or emergencies.Large breeds such as Great Danes and Rottweilers cost the most to insure. Small dogs like shih tzus and poodles are the least expensive to insure., If you purchased your puppy from a breeder, they should have already been examined by a veterinarian. If you got your puppy from a friend or if it is the child of one of your dogs, you should make sure you get it to the veterinarian right away. Puppies should be examined for birth defects such as cleft palate and to have their dewclaws removed and tails docked right away (e.g., 2-4 days of age)., Veterinarian costs are rising so you should shop around for a reputable, honest and affordable veterinarian.Do a google search or look in your local phone book to find a few local veterinarians. Phone the veterinarians on your list and ask them about their area of specialization such as whether they focus on larger farm animals or on pets. Based on this information, choose a veterinarian that is suitable for you.

, Once you have chosen a veterinarian, give them a ring to make an appointment and ask for estimates. You might ask for the price of the following services that you will have to cover for your puppy:Annual physical exam.
Flea and tick prevention. Preventing fleas and ticks will save you a lot of money in the long run, so you should make sure they do a good job on this service.
Vaccinations. Ask if it is possible to personalize your pet’s vaccine costs. Some vaccines are required by law and some are optional and may be more or less effective for your dog. You might be able to save money on vaccinations.
Heartworm test and preventions.
Dental cleaning.
Fecal exam.
Neuter costs. Neutering your pet can save a lot of money in the long run. It can help you avoid health conditions like uterine, ovarian and testicular cancers.

, Find out if you need to bring anything to the appointment such as medications, dietary information or a stool sample. Phone your veterinarian and find out if you need to bring anything.


You may need to bring a stool sample. Many dogs have roundworms when they are born. Your veterinarian will check for roundworms and potentially give you deworming medication at the check-up., Write down your main concerns in a notebook and bring this list of concerns to your first appointment. If you are nervous about any behavior or symptoms, write these concerns down so that you can discuss them with your vet.

, You should leave yourself plenty of time to get to the appointment. Put your dog in a dog carrier and take them to the appointment.


Try to pack everything you need the night before the appointment in order to reduce any anxiety.
You will need a dog carrier, which is a small container that is designed to transport dogs. You should find a dog carrier that is comfortable for your dog and is easy to carry in your car or on the bus.If you plan to fly with your dog, you should look for a dog carrier that is approved by the FAA.You could try spraying your dog carrier with a pheromone such as Adaptil, which will calm them down.If you are driving to the vet’s office, you could try playing relaxing music in the car."

Determine what type of dog you want to breed.,
Judge the dog according to her breed standard.,
Contact local kennel clubs or breeders.,
Check the dog’s pedigree.,
Choose features that complement the sire.",How to Select a Female Dog for Breeding1," The types of characteristics that you are looking for will depend what breed or purpose you are looking for in the puppies. Puppies typically inherit temperament, health, and social behaviors from their parents, so it is important to choose a dam carefully.


If you are looking to breed purebreds, you will need to decide if the dog will be a home pet or a working dog. A working dog will require certain traits, such as athleticism, a keen sense of smell, intelligence, or herding instincts, that a pet will not.
If you are looking to produce hybrid puppies, such as a Cockapoo or Labradoodle, you will need to decide if you want to breed two purebreds, a purebred and a mix, or two mixes. You may end up with different characteristics depending on your choice.
If you want to train the puppies to be guide or therapy dogs, you may want to look for breeds that are known to be suited for this type of work, such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds.;
, If you are looking for a particular breed of dog, you can research their respective breed standard. The breed standard is a set of guidelines that describes the physical ideals of that breed.When looking for the breed standard, take in account the dog’s:


General Appearance
Size and weight
Coat
Color
Gait
Temperament

, If you do not already have a female dog or if you are looking to mate a breeding bitch to your stud, a good place to look is with a breed-specific kennel club or local breeders. Some breed-specific rescue organizations may be able to help you find a dam as well.


If you want to register a purebred litter with a kennel club, you may need to have both parents be registered with that club. Common kennel clubs include the American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, and The Kennel Club (UK).

, Behavior, temperament, physical traits, and certain disorders can be passed down through multiple generations. You should make sure that not only the dam is healthy and friendly but that her parents are fit as well. If the dog is registered with a kennel club, you may be able to find her pedigree by contacting the breeder or club.


Knowing the dog’s pedigree will also allow you to make sure that the sire and dam are not closely related. If they are, inbreeding can cause genetic defects in the puppies. Do not mate siblings, parents, aunts, or uncles together. Mating cousins may or may not produce defects.If you know the breeder of the female dog, you can ask them about the dam’s parents, their temperaments, health issues, and strengths., If you know which sire or stud dog you will be using to father the puppies, you should analyze his features as well. Choose a female dog that will improve upon the father’s weaknesses while passing on her own strong traits. The same is also true in reverse. If the female has any weaknesses, such as a thin coat or a short build, you should look for a sire that has a better version of those qualities.If the stud will be a large breed of dog, such as a Great Dane or Mastiff, do not mate him with a small breed, such as a Norwich Terrier or toy breed. The mother may not be able to carry a litter of large puppies, and you may need to have a cesarean section to remove the puppies.

Get regular check-ups.,
Look for breed specific diseases.,
Have your dog spayed or neutered.,
Provide preventative medication.",How to Care for Bernese Mountain Dogs4," To keep your dog in good health, you need to make sure you take her to the vet often. This will ensue her continued health and well being. This starts before you get her with the breeder, who will her at six weeks for an exam to check for hernias and worms as well as eye, heart, ear, and lung problems as well as proper vaccinations.


At 12 weeks, your dog needs her rabies vaccination.
If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, you might need to look into the Lyme disease vaccination. This may also be helpful if your dog spends a lot of time outside or if you live on a farm., There are certain conditions that Bernese mountain dogs are more prone to have. These conditions hip dysplasia, bloat, and cranial cruciate ligament rupture, which attacks the knee. They also have an increased risk of cancer.


If you notice your dog showing signs of sickness, such as lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting, restlessness, or pain, talk to your vet immediately. These can be signs of bloat., When your dog is six to nine months old, consider having her spayed or neutered. This will provide health benefits for her, such as the decreased chance tumors, testicular cancer, and urinary tract infections. It can also help with some behavioral issues and unwanted puppies.If you want to breed your pet, you obviously should not do this.

, To ensure the overall health of your dog, give her preventative medication. This can be flea medication, such as topical ointments or flea collars. This also includes heartworm medication, which comes as a once a month tablet or a shot that lasts up to six months. These will kill any heartworm organisms in your dog’s system.


Make sure she is regularly checked for heartworms. This disease if widespread and can cause major issues, even death.
If your dog does end up with heartworms, treatment is available but is generally hard on her as well as you. It is also expensive and may take months to get rid of."

Separate the fading pup from the litter.,
Place the fading pup in a separate box.,
Keep the fading pup warm.",How to Save a Fading Newborn Puppy2," If any pups do show signs of fading or cry excessively, you should separate them from the litter and call the vet for help. Depending on the symptoms you report, the vet will instruct you to bring the fading pup in for emergency care or advise you attempt alternative feeding methods., After removing any fading pups from the litter, place them in a separate whelp box. Line the box’s floor with a bath mat or newspaper.


Go with newspaper if the pup is emitting discharges or if soiling is a concern. You’ll be able to quickly swap out dirty paper for a clean replacement.

, Use a heating pad to warm the separate container. Be sure to check the pad and box frequently with the back of your hand to make sure they aren’t hot to the touch. Keep a newborn pup’s temperature within 95 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (34.4 to 37.2 degrees Celsius).


Place the heating pad under the box’s floor lining, or if you’re using a wood box, you can place the heat under the box to let the wood conduct heat.

Give your dog a trim.,
Assemble some emergency supplies.,
Look for signs that your dog is in labor.",How to Whelp Large Breed Dogs2," Birth is always messy. Whelping means not only new puppies, but amniotic fluid, placental sacs, and umbilical cords, all of which have their own unique juices. These birth liquids are difficult to get out of matted dog hair. You can easily avoid the unpleasant task of scrubbing your dog’s rear legs and tail by trimming the hair in that area at least a few days before labor is expected.Use your knowledge of how far along your dog is in its pregnancy to determine when to trim it. Remove hair in the area of the vulva, the rear legs, and tail.

, In case your dog has trouble getting its puppies out and going to the vet isn’t an option, you should be ready to intervene on your dog’s behalf. Collect three or four pairs of sterile hemostat forceps, sutures, a tube of lubricating jelly, a small bottle of povidone iodine solution, and your whelping manual.These common medical supplies can be obtained online or at your local pharmacy. Forceps might need to be obtained through a larger big-box store or through your local medical supply company.
In the event that you need to remove a pup from your dog, consult your whelping manual or call your vet and have them walk you through it.
You might also want to get a book or deck of cards for yourself so you have something to do while waiting for your dog to deliver.

, In the early stages of labor, your dog might pace, shiver, dig, or vomit. This might last six to 12 hours, after which your dog’s amniotic sac – a gray balloon-like bulb, also known as the placental sac – will emerge from your dog’s vulva. The sac will appear small at first, then grow in size. Eventually the dog’s puppies will slide into this sac, at which point the mother will nibble at it to deflate it.

"
"
Clean the puppies off.,
Snip the umbilical cord.,
Allow the pups to nurse.,
Move puppies to an incubation chamber.,
Note the details of the births.,
Change the bedding.,
Put the dog family together.",How to Whelp Large Breed Dogs3," When the puppies are born, they will be covered in a thin membrane – the placental sac – which their mother should remove by licking it off. However, if the mother is too engaged in pacing and concentrating on her labor, you might need to intervene and remove the placental sac yourself.


If your dog has not removed its pup’s placental sac after a few seconds, take a damp cloth and gently rub the puppy’s face. This approximates the natural licking behavior of the pup’s mother that should remove the sac.
If the sac remains on the pup too long, it might suffocate.
Once the sac is off, the pup will be wet with placental fluid. Use a clean, warm towel to dry the puppy off, making vigorous rubbing motions along the length of its body.

, The umbilical cord is a long cord that connects the uterus of the mother to the abdomen of its puppy. During the mother dog’s pregnancy, the umbilical cord provides food and nutrients to the growing puppy. After the pup is born, however, the umbilical cord is no longer needed. The mother dog should gnaw at the cord until it is severed, but if she doesn’t you should be ready to help.


To snip the umbilical cord, measure ½ an inch (1 centimeter) away from the puppy’s body, and tie it with thread or unwaxed floss. This will narrow the diameter of the cord, making it easier to cut. Then, use a sharp pair of shears and cut straight through it.
If the cord bleeds, tie it with a suture.
The two portions will shrivel up and drop off in time.

, All the excitement of being born will make your puppies hungry. Some pups need a brief rest before nursing. Other pups are able to head straight for their mother and suckle their fill. In either case, wait until the puppy has finished nursing and your dog is back on its feet before removing the pup to the incubation chamber., You can easily craft a makeshift incubation chamber by placing a heating pad in the bottom of a laundry basket or medium-sized cardboard box, then placing a heavy blanket over the heating pad. As your dog births puppies, remove them to the incubation chamber until your dog is no longer in labor.


Large breed dogs, especially, may accidentally stomp on their own puppies while pacing about in the whelping box during labor. Removing puppies to an incubation chamber is, for that reason, especially important.
Try not to overcrowd the incubation chamber. If necessary, create another. Try to keep no more than two puppies together in one chamber.

, When your new puppies come out, you’ll need to keep track of who’s who. Note all the details associated with the birth in a journal or chart. Assign each puppy a number (i.e., Pup 1, Pup 2, Pup 3…), the time they were born, their sex, weight, and any marking you might have made (some people like to dab a small bit of colored, nontoxic nail polish on their puppies to keep track of which is which).Most importantly of all, make sure that after each puppy is born, the placenta comes out. The placenta is an organ that provides nutrients and eliminates waste of unborn animals. If the mother does not eject the placenta after giving birth, she can get very ill.
Normally, the placenta will immediately come out after the puppy is born and the mother will consume it. But sometimes the placenta might not eject right away, and sometimes the mother might not eat all the placenta. It’s possible that your dog will bear two puppies and then eject two placenta.
Use the chart to mark down when the placenta come out and contact your vet if your dog does not eject all its placenta.
As your puppies grow over the next couple of weeks, use the chart to monitor their weight. Their weights might decrease slightly immediately after birth, but by the end of the week they should weigh twice as much as they did when they were born. If they do not, contact your vet.

, Once your dog has finished whelping, take it outside so it can relieve itself. While it’s out, change the blankets and other materials lining your whelping box. It will likely have wet layers of newsprint or damp blankets at this point. Remove them along with the underlying plastic bag and replace them with dry materials., After your large breed dog is back in its whelping box, take the pups out of their incubation chamber and reunite them with their mother. They may be hungry and want to suckle again. The puppies will remain vulnerable for several weeks and should not be separated from their mother until your vet indicates that it is okay to do so."

Look for knowledge of the breed.,
Evaluate the breeder's behavior.,
Assess the puppy's health.,
Determine if the breeder is involved in the dog community.,
Evaluate registration papers carefully.,
Ask for a guarantee.,
Evaluate the age of the dogs.,
Evaluate the payment.,
Notice how the breeder interacts with the dogs.",How to Report an Unethical Dog Breeder2," Respectable breeders will be very knowledgeable about the breed, which includes any genetic problems. Unethical breeders will not be able to answer questions about the breed, and they may try to tell you there are no genetic defects.Try asking the breeder questions about the dog or the breed and listen carefully to the answers. If it sounds like they are skirting the question or not answering, you may have an unethical breeder on your hands.
Be wary of any breeder who breeds more than two breeds. Also be wary of breeders who promise ""rare"" dogs, or ""rare"" colors or sizes., Ask plenty of questions about the dogs before you buy them. You should ask to see where the puppies and parent dogs spend their time. Ethical breeders will have no problems letting you see this area. Unethical breeders will not let you see where they keep the dogs, and often only let you see one dog at a time instead of the entire litter.Unethical breeders will often request that you meet them somewhere else to get the puppy, often before meeting you. Ethical breeders will want to meet you first before letting you take the dog, and they will want to do it where they keep the puppies.
Ask for health records for the puppies. Responsible breeders will have all the tests, shots, and other records from a vet. Many unethical breeders will have the care list provided on their own letterhead, with no proof they have been seen by a vet at all.

, Responsible breeders will not try to sell unhealthy or sickly dogs. Dogs that look sick, are too skinny, or have a poor coat may indicate you are dealing with an unethical breeder. Dogs that are scared or antisocial also point to irresponsible breeding.This is why it's important to see the puppy with the whole litter. Puppies should be socialized with the litter and their parent.
Look for dirty or unhygienic living conditions. This can be a sign of poor health or health problems in the dogs.

, Ethical dog breeders breed their dogs to improve the breed. They are proud of their dogs and are active at dog shows and in breed organizations. An unethical breeder probably won’t participate in any types of dog shows or other sports. They are not interested in the betterment of the breed, only making a profit., Respectable breeders will have their litters registered by the American Kennel Club or the Kennel Club UK. However, unethical breeders can also get registrations for dogs that are not purebred. Ask for pedigree papers and study them carefully.


An unethical breeder won’t have documentation of their dogs, they won’t have registration certificates, and they won’t have pedigrees.Be suspicious of registrations from other organizations. These don’t guarantee anything. Only papers from the official kennel clubs have authority.

, Respectable breeders are proud of the litters they produce and put a lot of time into breeding them. This means the breeders have had the dogs tested for genetic problems that occur within the breed and can provide documentation of this.Respectable breeders will also give you a lifelong guarantee for the health of the dog, and they will have a policy where they will take the dog if you want to give it up for any reason.
Be wary of ""health guarantees."" Not all breeders who have health guarantees will be unethical, but if you sign a contract or waiver, make sure to read it very carefully. These are usually given to remove any liability from the breeder., Puppies for adoption should be at least eight weeks old and not younger. Unethical breeders may try to get you to adopt the dogs earlier. The mother should also be at least two years old when they start having litters.Female dogs should only have had a limited number of litters. Most female dogs shouldn’t have litters every year.

, If a breeder asks for an astronomical fee for a dog, or a large down payment, it may point to an unethical breeder. Sometimes a dog that is much cheaper than other breeders may be from an unethical breeder. Most purebred dogs are expensive, so you should check the price your breeder is charging against others. Purebred puppies can range from around $800 to a couple of thousand.Some unethical breeders and puppy mills may charge only from $500 to $900 for a dog, while a respectable breeder may be more expensive.Many unethical breeders require a large down payment up front. Sometimes, they will take the down payment and never deliver the puppy. Or they will require you to pay hundreds of dollars before even seeing the puppy.

, You should also see the way the breeder interacts with their dogs. Many unethical breeders abuse their dogs, so if the dogs seem afraid or skittish around the breeder, this is a cause for concern.


If the breeder will not let you see them interact with their dogs or the litter, this is cause for concern. A respectable breeder will love their dogs and have a good relationship with them.

Take her to the vet.,
Establish her age.,
Weigh her.,
Perform a temperament test.",How to Select a Female Dog for Breeding2," A vet will test the female dog to make sure that she is able to breed. The vet will check for eye problems, hip and elbow dysplasia, and diseases. Be sure to inform the vet that you are looking for a female dog to breed, and the vet will be able to tell you if this dog is a good choice or not.


Hormone testing can tell you how fertile a female dog is by evaluating her hormone levels. It can also give you a window of the best time to mate the dogs.Ask the vet to test for brucellosis. This is a bacterial disease that can spread during mating, and it can cause the dam to lose the litter or to become infertile.Genetic testing can inform you if the dog is a carrier for any genetic disorders. While susceptibility to genetic disorders can vary from breed to breed, some common ones include hip or elbow dysplasia, autoimmune diseases such as skin, blood, and thyroid disorders, or progressive retinal atrophy., A dog that is too young or too old may have problems when carrying a litter of puppies. Furthermore, some kennel clubs will not register a litter of puppies born from a dog that is below or above a certain age. In general, large dogs can start breeding between 18 and 24 months of age; medium dogs can breed between 15 and 18 months of age, and small dogs can start breeding between 12 and 18 months.If you have a young dog, you should avoid breeding her when she first goes into heat. Although the dog is sexually mature, she may be too young to successfully carry a litter of puppies.
While the age can vary from breed to breed, generally eight years of age is considered too old to breed a female dog.If the dog has just given birth to another litter, wait for a few successive heats to pass until you breed her again. This allows her to fully heal from the first pregnancy., An over or underweight dog can have many problems during pregnancy. Ideal weights vary from breed to breed. If your dog is mixed, you should ask your vet what her ideal weight might be based on her size and build.


If you can feel but not see the dog’s ribs, she is a healthy weight. If you can see her ribs, she may be underweight, but if you cannot feel them, she may be overweight., Temperaments tests provide a dog with different types of stimuli. How the dog reacts to these determines if she is responsive, shy, aggressive, or independent. You should not breed shy or aggressive dogs. You can hire a service, such as the American Temperament Test Society, to test the dog. You can also try to a few tests yourself.


Try to put a leash on the dog and take her for a walk. If she walks next to you with minimal tugging at her leash, she may have a good temperament. If she is lunging at small animals, other dogs, or people, it is a sign of aggression.
The dog should willingly play with toys with you. She should not bite or snarl at your over the toys. If the dog is possessive or aggressive over the toys, it is a sign of aggression.
When you pet the dog, the dog should relax. She should be willing to be touched. If she seems tense or if she tries to escape, she may be shy. Growling in this situation is a sign of aggression."

Check the pups for dehydration.,
Warm the pups gradually if they’re too chilled to nurse.,
Give the pup a sugar or honey solution.,
Feed the pup colostrum.,
Inject subcutaneous fluids.",How to Save a Fading Newborn Puppy3," Gently pull back the skin between pups’ shoulders. It should snap back into place quickly. If it doesn’t spring back into place promptly, the puppy is likely dehydrated.Under the vet’s advisement, you can try using a clean eyedropper to feed the dehydrated pup a solution of a half teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of sugar, and two teaspoons of honey dissolved in one cup of boiled water. Be sure that the solution has cooled enough to be comfortably ingested.

, Chilled pups are unable to suckle and digest food, but warming them too quickly can be dangerous. The best way to carefully and gradually warm a chilled pup is to hold it against a large patch of your skin. That way, your body will transfer to the pup without overheating it.If pups are too cold, they won’t be able to suckle or digest food, which will cause fading. Pups under a week that are too warm aren’t yet able to pant to reduce their body temperature.

, If any pups are dehydrated or if you haven’t observed them nursing, call the vet and ask if you should administer honey, corn syrup, or a sugar-water solution. If the vet approves, put on surgical gloves and administer a drop of the syrup onto the pup’s gums every few hours. Avoid alternative feeding without the vet’s approval., During the first one to two days of delivery, the mother produces a special milk called colostrum. By feeding on this fluid within 12 hours of birth, the pups ingest needed antibodies from the mother’s bloodstream. Without prompt nursing, the pups will be susceptible to infection in addition to dehydration and malnutrition.If you don’t have supplemental colostrum on hand, you can attempt to express it from the mother’s teat into an eyedropper and manually feed a pup that hasn’t suckled. Your vet can also attempt this process, might have a supply of colostrum on hand, or can supply any fading pups with blood plasma from a healthy dog.

, Under the vet’s advisement, use a sterile drawing syringe to inject a Ringer’s lactate solution subcutaneously, or beneath the skin. Be sure the solution is warm, and never inject cold solution. Avoid touching the tip of the syringe or otherwise contaminating it.Have your vet recommend an amount suitable for the pup.

Avoid breeding a dog over six years old.,
Maintain a healthy diet for your older pregnant dog.,
Talk to your dog’s vet about a Cesarean section.,
Familiarize yourself with the hours of your vet and emergency clinic.,
Build a whelp box for your older dog.,
Have necessary supplies handy.,
Accustom your dog the whelping box or area before labor.,
Notice when your dog begins to go into the first stage of labor.,
Allow the dog to deliver and clean the pups.,
Tear the birthing sac and cut the umbilical cord if necessary.,
Get help right away if any complications arise.,
Continue to monitor your dog and pups after delivery.",How to Promote Safe Whelping for Older Dogs," Depending on breed, it’s best to mate your dog between the ages of two and six. A pregnancy after age six can pose significant health risks to both the mother and pups, even if the mother was in good health before the pregnancy. If your dog is pregnant at an older age, you will need to stay in close contact with its vet throughout the pregnancy.It’s always wise to take your dog to the vet for a pre-breeding exam before mating it, regardless of age.;
, An older dog’s digestive system is more sensitive to abrupt changes in diet, so you should be cautious about modifying what you feed it. After about six weeks, or two-thirds into the pregnancy, it will need to start eating about 30 to 50% more calories per day.Be sure to feed your dog several small meals per day, rather than one large meal. It doesn’t have as much room for its stomach to expand after meals. This is all the more important for older dogs, whose internal tissues can’t stretch as much as younger dogs.
Higher calorie puppy food can be a good option, but keep in mind your older dog might not tolerate the switch.

, Your dog will need close veterinarian attention throughout the pregnancy. One major point you’ll want to discuss with the vet is whether to get a Cesarean section when labor occurs. If this is the first time your dog has been pregnant, your vet will most likely recommend a C-section.A planned C-section might be costly, but it is cheaper and safer than an emergency C-section.

, Prepare an emergency contact sheet with your vet’s number and, if your vet isn’t open 24 hours a day, contact information for the nearest emergency veterinary clinic. Complications are more likely to arise when an older dog gives birth. Even if your vet authorizes a home birth, you’ll want to be prepared to contact them or get assistance in the event of an emergency.Contact your vet or emergency clinic when your dog goes into labor to let them know they should be on call if you need assistance.

,  Using a box is preferable to just designating a whelp area, since older dogs might require emergency care. You’ll need to choose a box large enough for the dog to stretch out and nurse the pups, but one that you can lift and put in a car if you have to bring the dog to the clinic. Line the floor with paper before birth, since it can easily be swapped out when soiled.After birth, switch from paper to matting, such as bath mats, for better traction for the newborn pups.
Include a shelf or roll away area in the box to provide the pups with protective shelter if the mother rolls over.
Keep a heating pad in the box to help keep both the mother and the pups warm after birth.

, Prepare a labor kit in advance with a thermometer, scissors, unwaxed dental floss, and iodine. You’ll need floss to tie the umbilical cords and scissors to cut them if the mother doesn’t do so. You’ll then use the iodine to sanitize the pup after cutting., A few days before the approximate due date, build a whelp box or designate a whelp area. This is especially vital if it’s the dog’s first pregnancy. Build the box or prepare the area, bring your dog to it, and allow her to inspect and lay in it.Without a designated whelp box or area, your dog might try to seclude itself by hiding in a closet or other undesirable area.
It is essential that you or a veterinarian be present when your older dog gives birth, so getting it accustomed to a whelp area beforehand is essential.

, Mark the expected due date on a calendar, and try to commit it to memory. A few days prior, start taking your dog’s temperature every few hours. Within 24 hours of whelping, its temperature will drop under 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or 37.8 degrees Celsius). Take the dog to the vet if you’ve arranged a C-section, or prepare for a home birth.After its temperature drops, signs of labor include restlessness, plump or dripping nipples, panting, and the start of abdominal straining.
The first stage of labor lasts up to 12 hours. Prior to and during labor, your dog won’t want to eat, but make sure to offer plenty of cool water.

, When the second stage of labor begins, your dog will begin having regular contractions, which are clearly visible as waves across the belly. Provided you haven’t arranged a C-section, monitor the birth closely from several feet away to avoid hovering, as your dog will want privacy before delivering.Your dog will deliver, on average, one pup every 45 to 60 minutes. Prior to delivering a pup, it will pass foetal fluid. If more than 2 hours go by after passing fluid without delivering a pup, call the vet.
After delivering each pup, your dog will remove its birth membrane and clean it by licking, which also encourages the pup to breathe.
Keep track of each pup delivered, and keep in mind the number your vet observed on ultrasounds so you know how many more to expect.

, If the mother doesn’t do so, you must promptly tear the birth sac, or membrane, around the pup’s head. Failure to do so could cause suffocation. Use a towel to clean off the pup, taking special care to remove mucous and fluid from its mouth and nose.Then, tie the cord off about two inches from the abdomen and cut it on the far side of the tie. Paint the cut end promptly with iodine to prevent infection.

, Call the vet if the second stage of labor lasts more than twelve hours. Prepare to bring your dog to the clinic if it is in obvious extreme pain, if a puppy is stuck in the birth canal, or if there’s a foetal discharge but no puppy delivered two or three hours after the discharge., Schedule a vet visit for your dog and the pups for three days after whelping, provided there are no complications.Older dogs are, however, more likely to experience post-whelping issues. Reddish brown discharges are normal in the days after whelping, but black discharges with a odor might indicate a uterine infection, which requires immediate veterinary care. In addition, check for these symptoms, and bring your dog to the vet as soon as possible if it shows any of them:Disinterest in or ignoring the puppies.
Muscle spasms or abdominal swelling.
Refusing food or water after whelping.

Inspect the dog's coat.,
Watch how she walks.,
Observe her working habits.",How to Select a Female Dog for Breeding3," A dog's coat is a good sign of their health and nutrition. A healthy dam will have a shiny coat. If she is long haired, her coat will be thick. There should be no patches or bald spots in the dog's coat. The fur should be flexible, not brittle or coarse.If the dog's fur smells, she may have fleas or a bacterial infection. Do not breed her until it is taken care of.
If you want puppies with a particular coat color, try to match the dam and the sire's coat color. While this cannot guarantee you puppies of a particular color, it can increase your chances.

, A gait is often used in breed standards to judge how well a dog walks, but a dog's gait can also help you figure out if she has hip or weight problems. Ask someone to walk the dog while you watch. If the dog is stumbling, unbalanced, or unable to walk straight, you may not want to breed her.


A pacing gait is one in which both legs on side of the body hit the ground at the same time. Overweight or tired dogs may demonstrate this gait. Most breeds are penalized in the show ring for this gait. The only exceptions are the English sheepdog, Polish Lowland Sheepdog, and the Neapolitan Mastiff.Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers, have unique gaits. Check the breed standard if you are looking to breed these as show dogs.

, If you are looking for a working dog, such as a herding dog or livestock guarding dog, you should watch her as she works. Test the mother dog on the skills that you want to pass on to the puppies.


For example, if you want a scent hound to sniff out people for search and rescue, have a person hide, and give the dog a piece of their clothing with their scent on it. See if the dog can find the person based on their scent.If you do not own the dog, ask her owner if you can come by for a demonstration of her abilities.
If you are looking for a dog that can compete in lure coursing, agility courses, herding competitions, or other athletic sports, you might look for a mother that has won prizes in these fields.

Ensure your pregnant dog eats a healthy diet.,
Provide folic acid supplements to your pregnant dog.,
Protect your pregnant dog from infection.,
Keep your pregnant dog away from potential poisons.,
Medicate a pregnant dog carefully.",How to Reduce the Risk of Breeding Cleft Palate Puppies1," Aside from a dog’s genetic make up, the health and well-being of it mother during pregnancy are also extremely important. During the first two trimesters - or roughly 40 days - of the dog’s pregnancy, her nutritional requirements are that same as that of a healthy adult dog. The puppies really begin to develop physically in the third trimester, meaning you’ll need to provide more food for the mother dog.During the first two trimesters, monitor your dog’s weight and behavior and feed her normally. If she begins to lose any weight at all, slowly increase the amount you are feeding her.
Week 6 through week 8 of your dog’s pregnancy demand particularly high energy output for the mother. She will need anywhere from 30-60% more food than normal, depending in party on the size of her litter. She also may struggle to eat, as she will be quite literally filled with puppies.
Provide a dog food designed to be highly digestible during the third semester in particular. These foods are often labeled as puppy, growth, or development foods. Provide small meals throughout the day to allow the mother to eat whenever she is able.;
, Folic acid is a nutrient that has proven to be especially important to puppies’ healthy development. In fact, supplements of this nutrient alone will reduce the risk of cleft palate, even in genetically predisposed breeds.Give your pregnant dog 2.5mg tablets pf folic acid every day for the first three weeks of their pregnancy., Viral infections in a mother dog may increase the risk of her puppies having cleft palates. Further, pregnant dogs are also more susceptible to infection. You can help prevent infection by keeping your dog up-to-date on their vaccinations, allowing them to only drink clean, fresh water, and regularly cleaning their living space, especially any outdoor areas in which they regularly defecate.If your dog is behind on their vaccinations and become pregnant, talk to your veterinarian about potentially vaccinating the dog.

, Exposure of a pregnant dog to any toxic substances may increase the likelihood that her puppies will have cleft palates. As such, make sure your dog does not get anything that may poison her during her pregnancy, such as household chemicals, prescription drugs, etc., There are many medications that are commonly provided to dogs that are unsafe to provide to a pregnant dog. For instance, do not give a pregnant dog corticosteroids, as they may be especially likely to cause a cleft palate. Talk to your vet about any medications you may be providing to your dog. Ask something like, “Do these medications place the health of her puppies at risk?”"

Feed the dog a high-quality meat based diet.,
Avoid calcium supplements.,
Ask your vet about giving the dog cortisone.",How to Prevent Eclampsia in Dogs1," The best way to prevent eclampsia in a pregnant dog is to give the dam a well-balanced diet rich in high-quality meat. Make sure the dam gets enough vitamins and minerals in the food she is eating on a daily basis.However, a common cause of eclampsia is when an owner gives extra meat, believing the extra protein will do the dog good. In fact, the meat is low calcium and alters the calcium:phosphate ratio in the blood, and actually drives down blood calcium levels. The best solution is to feed a diet for growth (such as a puppy food) in the last part of pregnancy.
For the first four to five weeks of your dog's pregnancy, feed her a regular amount of high-quality dog food. For the last four weeks of your dog's pregnancy, give her 30 to 50% more calories than her regular diet.You can ask your vet for food recommendations if you are not sure what to feed a pregnant dog.;
, Though eclampsia is caused by low calcium levels, giving your dog supplements will only increase her risk of eclampsia. The dog should get enough calcium, phosphorus, and Vitamin D from her food. If you want to add supplements to her diet, only give her a small amount when she is mid-term in her pregnancy. You can give her a balanced source of calcium, phosphorus and Vitamin D in very small amounts.Always give your dog a balanced amount of calcium and phosphorus, with a ratio of one calcium to two parts phosphorus. Never give the dog calcium supplements alone, as this can increase her risk of eclampsia.
Milk is can be a good supplement source of Vitamin D and calcium for your dog. Make sure the milk is not causing your dog to have loose stool. If so, stop giving it to her.
You can also give the dog fish oil to make sure she is getting enough omega-3 fatty acids.

, Cortisone has been shown in exceptional cases to be helpful at preventing eclampsia in dogs. Cortisone usually comes in the form of an injection. Talk to your vet about this preventative measure.Try to talk to your vet about cortisone treatment while your dog is still pregnant or if this is your dog’s second pregnancy and you are worried about her developing eclampsia.

Provide each dog with proper identification.,
Ensure all dogs are in good health.,
Provide all dogs with access to food and water.,
Groom your dogs.,
Exercise your dogs regularly.",How to Pass an AKC Inspection1," In order to pass an AKC inspection, you will need to make sure that all of your dogs can be identified either through a microchip, tattoo, or collar tag. Proper identification is a requirement of the American Kennel Club and it is up to each breeder, which method they choose. Microchips: Are tiny electronic chips that are injected into the dog’s upper back. These chips can be scanned in order to identify the dog.Tattoos: Are an identification marker that are tattooed onto the dog’s skin usually under the ear flap or on the inner thigh. The problem with tattoos is that they can fade over time and become difficult to read.Collar tags. Are a visible form of identification that is worn around the dog’s neck. The major drawback is that in order for them to be effective the dog always needs to be wearing a collar.;
, The AKC inspectors will also check the overall health of the dogs to make sure there are no visible illnesses. In order to pass this part of the inspection, your dogs should be in good health and receive appropriate routine and preventative health care.For instance, all of your dogs should be up-to-date on their shots including rabies, parvovirus, hepatitis, and canine distemper.
There should be no visible external parasites on the dogs, such as ticks or fleas.

, Inspectors will also check to make sure that all dogs have access to drinking water and proper food. Food does not need to be left down at all times, but should be provided at appropriate intervals throughout the day. If a dog has a protruding rib cage and looks skinny or weak, then the inspector may determine the dog is malnourished., If your dogs are not regularly groomed, this may be considered a sign of neglect to the inspector. For example, dogs that have a lot of matts in their coats or are visible dirty, are likely uncomfortable and not properly cared for. Make sure that all of your dogs receive regular brushing and grooming., It is also important that all of the dogs receive exercise and play time daily. One way to make this apparent to an inspector is to demonstrate that there is a space provided for play. For example, you could have a fenced in portion of the yard that is used by the dogs to play and run around. You should also have toys available for the dogs to play with."

Keep your dog healthy.",How to Perform Pre‐Breeding Health Checks for Dogs," Although any dog to be bred needs to be healthy, the specifics of a pre-breeding health check can vary between dog breeds. Your vet or breeder can help you determine which specific pre-breeding health checks your dog will need.When you meet with your vet, ask questions about the pre-breeding health checks:


Which health checks will my dog need?
How much will the health checks cost?
What if health problems are detected? Does that mean my dog can’t be bred?
If my dog doesn’t pass the health checks, can I try again when my dog is older?
Are there specific forms that need to be filled out?;
, Begin the pre-breeding health checks one month before you plan to breed your dog.Your vet will first perform a thorough physical exam. During this exam, your vet will check your dog from head to toe. Aspects of a complete physical exam include:


Listening to the heart and lungs
Looking in the mouth
Examining the fur and skin
Testing the range of motion in the joints
A vaginal exam to check for vaginal abnormalities(your vet will do this with a gloved finger)
Vaginal cytology to look at the cells in the vagina, A dog’s body condition describes its overall physique—whether it is underweight, overweight, or at an ideal weight. Your vet may use a scale from 1 (severely underweight) to 9 (obese) to determine your dog’s body condition.A score of 5 indicates an ideal body weight.
If your dog is overweight, it should reach an ideal weight before being bred. Help your dog lose weight by increasing its exercise and improving its diet.

, Blood work can reveal a lot about a dog’s health. Your vet will look for any abnormally high or levels of substances in the blood, indicating illness. They will also test your dog’s blood for heartworm disease., Your vet will perform a fecal exam to test for intestinal worms.Fortunately, intestinal worms are easy to treat. If your dog has intestinal worms, your vet will prescribe a medication called a dewormer that will kill the worms.

, Being up-to-date on vaccinations helps your dog stay healthy. While you are at the vet’s office for the physical exam, have your vet make sure your dog is current on all of its required vaccinations, such as rabies.If your dog is not current on its vaccinations, ask your vet to administer the vaccinations your dog will need.

, Certain pre-breeding health checks are required for all dogs to be bred. Because dog breeds can have their own specific diseases, talk with your vet which other pre-breeding health checks your dog will need. Pre-breeding health checks include:Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) certification
Hip certification, either through the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Plan (PennHip)
Test for brucellosis
Breed-specific checks, including genetic testing and evaluation of the heart and thyroid glands

, The goal of the CERF exam is to detect genetic eye diseases that could cause blindness, such as cataracts. It is performed yearly. A veterinary ophthalmologist will perform the exam, then complete and submit an eye certification form.After the exam, you can send the owner’s copy of the form to the OFA Eye Certification Registry with the appropriate fee.If your dog passed the CERF exam, meaning it’s free of genetic eye diseases, you will receive an official Eye Certification Registry certificate number.Because the CERF exam is a yearly exam, your dog’s eyes will need to be certified each year, even after it stops breeding., A dog should not be bred if it has bad hips. The OFA test looks for hip dysplasia, a genetic hip condition in dogs. The PennHip exam looks for looseness in the hip joints, which can lead to hip dysplasia.A hip evaluation involves taking multiple x-rays of the hips. To get accurate x-rays, a dog needs to be sedated.The PennHip test, which can be performed in dogs as young as four months old, is performed by a PennHip-certified vet. Use this website to find a PennHip-certified vet in your area: http://info.antechimagingservices.com/pennhip/navigation/locate-pennHIP-vet/locate-pennHIP-vet.html

A dog must be at least two years old for the OFA hip evaluation.The hip x-rays will be sent to the OFA, which will evaluate the x-rays and determine the health of your dog’s hips.

, Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by Brucella canis. This disease can cause infertility and spontaneous abortions.Have your vet test your dog for brucellosis one month before being bred.If your dog has B. canis, it should not be bred.

, Your dog’s breed may be prone to certain genetic diseases.Talk with a knowledgeable breeder and your vet to learn about breed-specific genetic diseases. Then, decide whether to have genetic testing performed to look for those diseases.

, Breeding a dog is a serious undertaking. In addition to making sure your dog is healthy, you should be sure you’re ready to take on the responsibility of dog breeding. Consider these questions:Will your dog contribute to improvement of the breed?
Do you have money set aside for emergency veterinary care?
Are you knowledgeable about what’s involved in a dog pregnancy, including whelping (giving birth) and raising newborn puppies?
Do you know about your dog breed’s genetic diseases?
Would you be willing to take the puppies back if an owner decides it doesn’t want them?
Can you make yourself or another adult available 24 hours a day after the mother dog gives birth?

, Male dogs reach full sexual maturity by 12 to 15 months of age. Female dogs have their first menstrual cycle anywhere from 6 to 24 months of age. A female dog should not be bred during its first cycle.Ideally, a female dog should not be bred until it’s at least two years old and has had two or three cycles.By not breeding your dog too soon, you will ensure your dog is physically able to breed. This is very important for female dogs, to make sure their bodies are physically mature enough to handle pregnancy., In addition to the specific pre-breeding health checks, your dog should be as healthy as possible overall. There are a few things you can do to keep your dog healthy before being bred:Feed your dog a healthy diet.
Make sure dog gets plenty of exercise each day.
Take your dog to your vet for regular wellness exams.

Talk to your vet about the hair loss.",How to Manage Postpartum Shedding in Dogs," After the dog has given birth to the litter, she will shed part of the uterine lining, which is called lochia. Right after the birth, you should immediately change the bedding. During the birth, she will have shed not just lochia, but also other fetal tissue. As soon as the birthing is done, switch the blankets, newspaper, and other materials in the whelping box.To change the bedding, you can try to get the help of another person. You or the other person can hold the dog while the other changes the bedding. If you don't have help, move the mother and puppies to one side of the whelping box, then lift up the empty side and immediately place the new bedding. Once that is down, move the mother and puppies to the clean side and do the same for the other side.
Doing this helps reduce the risk of the mother dog and the puppies getting an infection.;
, After the birth, the mother dog will continue to shed lochia. To keep the whelping box clean, make sure to change the bedding often until she stops shedding. Depending on how much she is shedding, you may need to do this multiple times a day or once a day.She may not shed a lot of lochia, but it can still leave a mess on the bed or lead to infection for the dog and the litter. Keep an eye on the bedding as you check on the puppies. If you notice a mess on the bedding, change it.

, As your dog sheds lochia, you should give her a sponge bath. Do this immediately after she has given birth to remove any of the fetal fluids and blood. Then, wipe her down once or twice each day, depending on how much she is shedding.When sponging off your dog, you should use warm water and wipe the area gently.

, You should do this while the dog is still shedding the lochia. Make sure the shedding decreases as the days pass, that it changes in color from greenish to red and then brown, and note the consistency.You should do this for at least two weeks. However, some dogs will shed small amounts for up to six weeks.

, After your dog gives birth, she will shed part of the uterine lining as it cleans itself. The shedding occurs in vaginal discharge called lochia. After the birth, the discharge is generally greenish or blackish for around two days, and then it becomes reddish and brownish.The discharge the dog sheds should not have an odor.

, If the lochia that your dog sheds changes, there may be a problem. If the discharge is thick, grey or pale in color, or starts to have an odor, there is something wrong. You should take your dog to the vet or have the vet visit your home immediately.If you notice any blood in the discharge, not just a normal reddish color, contact the vet.
This is a symptom of an infection of the uterus or an infected retained placenta.
Tell your vet, ""My dog's discharge isn't normal. It has an odor, it is very thick, it's black, or it's full of blood. I think she needs to be checked out.""

, The hair loss the occurs after pregnancy happens because new hairs are pushing out old hairs. Hormonal changes and stress may also lead to postpartum hair loss. To help the dog shed the hair in a contained way, brush her hair every day.This can help prevent hair from getting all over your home.

, After the dog gives birth, make sure that she starts eating after around 12 hours. You can feed her twice what she normally eats because she needs more calories to recover from the birth. Choose a high quality dog food with quality protein and fats.You may want to give your dog puppy food. Puppy food can provide her the nutrients she needs for recovering after the birth and while lactating.
Talk to your vet about the proper diet for your dog. They should advise you on what to feed your nursing dog, but if she's shedding, they can suggest some food that may help.

, If the hair is staying in the whelping box or getting on the furniture, you can use a lint roller to collect hair. This is an easy and quick way to gather the hair and remove it from surfaces., Hair loss is normal after a dog gives birth. However, hair loss may also be a symptom of a separate condition. To be safe, tell your vet about the hair loss during one of the postpartum visits. They can check to make sure everything is okay with your dog.Tell your vet, ""My dog is shedding a lot of fur. I'm worried something is wrong. I think she should be checked out just to make sure she is healthy.""

Determine if your dog's breed is at particular risk.,
Do not breed dogs that carry the genes for cleft palates.,
Spay or neuter dogs with cleft palates.",How to Reduce the Risk of Breeding Cleft Palate Puppies2," While any dog breed of dog can be born with a cleft palate, purebred dogs suffer from a higher incidence of this developmental issue. Brachycephalic breeds, which tend to have short or effectively absent muzzles, are the most commonly affected. The specific breeds that are at greatest risk include Boston terriers, Pekingese, bulldogs, miniature schnauzers, beagles, cocker spaniels, and dachshunds., More to the point, do not breed dogs that were born with cleft palates or parents of offspring with cleft palates. It is likely that the gene for particular types of cleft palate is recessive, and can be carried by male as well as female dogs. As such, dogs that were born with cleft palates and their parents are all likely carries of genetic material that is likely to cause cleft palates in their offspring., Not all pregnancies are intended. Accordingly, the best way to remove the genetic defects that cause cleft palates from the gene pool is by neutering or spaying the dogs that carry the genes corresponding with these defects. It is cruel to breed dogs knowing that the puppies are especially likely to suffer from genetic maladies."

Many are immediately apparent, causing teeth and gums to show unnaturally, or a nostril to be misshapen. Secondary cleft palates may be hidden within the mouth, but can still put a puppy at considerable health risk.Signs that may indicate a secondary cleft palate include sneezing and snorting during nursing or eating, a runny nose after eating, coughing or gagging while drinking water, stunted growth, and breathing issues.

, You can peer into a puppy's mouth or reach within it to check for a cleft palate in the hard palate. Simply look at the roof of the dog’s mouth or run your finger along this area. Look or feel for signs that the palate is not entirely fused. A puppy will likely have to be anesthetized for check their soft palate, as this is located further back in the throat.Whether or not you are able to find evidence of a cleft palate yourself, take your dog to the vet if you are concerned about their health.

, A puppy with a cleft palate may need surgery. Unfortunately, the surgery will likely be risky. Obey all of your veterinarian's directions following a pet’s surgery, which will likely include the following:Provide antibiotics in the event of an infection.
Have the puppy wear an e-collar for at least a week to prevent them from rubbing their face.
Feed the puppy soft, wet food that has been blended for 2-4 weeks following the surgery.
Withhold hard food or toys for a month following the surgery.

Register the litter at four weeks old.,
Assign the puppies appropriate names.,
Choose the correct register.",How to Register Your Litter with the Kennel Club (UK)2," Though there is no limit on when you can register your litter, it is generally advised to do so at four weeks of age. This ensures that registration documents are available for the new owner when the puppies are old enough to be sold.If you wait until the dog is over one year, there will be a late fee.

, When you register your litter, the puppies must be given the appropriate name for the registration. You should be aware of the following rules when choosing names:Names need more than one word, but can’t go over 24 letters.
A name cannot be repeated in a breed. You also can’t have the same name of an approved Kennel Name.
You can’t use your last name. You also can’t repeat any words in the names of the puppies.
The Kennel Name must be the first word in the dog’s name.
Initials, numeric numbers, and abbreviations are not allowed. Using canine words, like dog, champion, or a breed name, is also not allowed.

, The Kennel Club registers all types of dogs, including pedigree, crossbreeds, and others. They have three different types of registers, and which one you place your dog in depends on the type of dog you have.The breed register is for pedigree dogs.
The companion dog register is for companion dogs, and is open to crossbreeds and purebreds.
The activity register is for dogs that love activities, like flyball, agility, or obedience. This register is for dogs that are not on the breed register, and it is open to crossbreeds and purebreds.

Make sure the parent dogs are registered.,
Ensure the mother dog hasn’t had too many litters.,
Determine if the mother is the right age.,
Ensure the dogs are proper matches.,
Check other eligibility requirements.",How to Register Your Litter with the Kennel Club (UK)3," To register the litter with the Kennel Club, the mother dog and the father dog both must be registered with the Kennel Club. Their registration must be in order before the male dog gets the female pregnant and by the time the mother gives birth., The Kennel Club changed their policy on how many litters a mother dog can have. If a female dog gives birth to more than four litters, any litters after the fourth will not be eligible to be registered with the Kennel Club.The Kennel Club keeps a record of the amount of litters the dog has, so if the dog has had four or more, the litter is ineligible.

, Litters can only be registered if the mother dog is the correct age. Female dogs that are eight years old or older at the time of the birth make the litters disqualified for registering. Additionally, female dogs that are under one year old at the time of pregnancy are also disqualified.There are a few exceptions. If the application is submitted before the dog get pregnant, the dog has given birth to one litter that is registered, and the vet provides evidence that the dog can successfully give birth to the litter, the Kennel Club may make an exception.

, To prevent inbreeding, the Kennel Club does not register litters that are the result of close relationship matings. For example, a parent-offspring or sibling mating is not accepted.This means that you cannot register father-daughter, mother-son, or brother-sister matings.

, There are a few other reasons why a litter may not be eligible for registration. The mother dog has to be at a UK resident at the time of the birth. The mother dog also cannot have two litters by c-section.The mother and father dog must not have any puppies on file that were ineligible for registering in the past. This information will be on the owner’s certificate.

Provide calcium supplements for the nursing dog.,
Give the puppies milk replacer.,
Wean the puppies off the mother.",How to Prevent Eclampsia in Dogs2," Once the dog has given birth to the litter and is nursing the pups, you should give her a calcium supplement. This will ensure her calcium levels do not drop. It can also be beneficial for the puppies, especially a large litter of puppies.You can find calcium supplements for dogs at your local pet store or online. Make sure you check the label of the supplement to confirm it contains mostly calcium. If you are unsure about the supplement, speak to your vet before giving it to your nursing dog.

, You should also try to get the puppies to have milk replacer instead of their mother’s milk within the first 24 hours of birth. This will put less of a demand on the mother to produce milk for the puppies and reduce her risk of developing eclampsia.You should then start giving the puppies solid food when they are three to four weeks old. This will help to lessen the demand on the mother to produce subsistence for the puppies.

, When the puppies are three to four weeks old, they should be weaned off the mother so they can be self-sufficient and not put the mother at risk of eclampsia. Start by separating the mother from the litter for a few hours at a time. Once the puppies are separated from the mother, have the puppies eat high-quality puppy food from a pan. Moisten the food with water or milk replacer.Encourage the puppies to eat from the pan by allowing them to lick the food off your fingers. Most puppies will get the hint and feed from the pan on their own.
Put a bowl of fresh water out so the puppies can also drink whenever they’d like. This will ensure they stay hydrated.
Make sure the mother is on a separate feeding schedule as the puppies so she remains healthy and does not overproduce milk. You can speak to your vet about exactly how much food to feed the mother so she gets the nutrients she needs once she stops producing milk.

Notice if the nursing dog is panting, whining or appears nauseous.,
Pay attention to how the nursing dog walks and moves.,
Check the nursing dog’s temperature and breathing.,
Bring the dog to the vet if you suspect eclampsia.",How to Prevent Eclampsia in Dogs3," Most dogs will show signs of eclampsia within 40 days of giving birth. The symptoms of the disorder rarely appear while the dog is pregnant. If you notice the nursing dog is panting, whining, or appears nauseous, she may have developed eclampsia.You should also notice if she is vomiting or has diarrhea. These are also symptoms of eclampsia.

, You should also observe how the nursing dog walks. Does she have a stiff gait or a clumsy walk? Does she get muscle tremors or does her body go stiff when she tries to move? You should also note if the mother seems disoriented, restless, or nervous. These are all possible signs of eclampsia.Notice if the nursing dog lies down with her paws rigidly extended within 8 to 12 hours of her other symptoms. This is often a symptom of eclampsia.
Sometimes dogs with eclampsia have poor maternal skills and show little interest in the puppies or in nursing the puppies.

, You should also note if the nursing dog has a high body temperature or a fever. You may use an animal thermometer to take her temperature to confirm it is higher than normal. Rapid, heavy breathing is also another symptom of eclampsia.When you are examining her temperature and her breathing, you may notice her pupils are dilated and slow to contract when they are exposed to light.

, The vet will do a physical exam on the nursing dog and confirm the dog’s symptoms. Once your dog is diagnosed with eclampsia, the vet may recommend a slow injection of calcium solution to treat the issue. They may also give the dog calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with the issue, as well as cortisone or steroid injections.With the right treatment, many nursing dogs recover from eclampsia.

Make records of each litter.,
Create records for all adult dogs.,
Keep records of breed histories.",How to Pass an AKC Inspection2," Typically during an inspection the agent will have a digital copy of the registration you have submitted to the AKC and will want to check that these match your individual records. For instance, they may ask you questions about a specific litter and want to know the number of puppies, breeding and sale dates, names of buyers, and registration numbers.In order to help keep records you can use the kennel management software provided by the AKC or download printable forms from the AKC website.
Breeders are expected to keep records up to five years.AKC inspectors may provide you with tips on how to improve your record keeping.

, It is also important to have individual records for each adult dog that you own, breed, or show. For example, you will need to know their registration information, any litters they have produced, medical records, awards etc. The inspector will likely ask you a few questions about a particular dog to ensure that your records match with the ones you have provided them.If you co-own a dog with another breeder, you will need to check in regularly to make sure that all of your records concerning that dog are up to date.

, Record keeping is very important to the AKC because this helps to ensure that the breed standard is maintained over time. For example, your records should include the history and lineage of each dog. This information is crucial to the AKC because it is used to ensure that purebreds remain pure which can help to protect against genetic diseases.If you have more than one breed at your facility, you will need to keep track of each lineage separately.

"

Maintain a clean facility.,
Ensure the primary enclosure is a suitable size for the dogs.,
Post a disaster plan.",How to Pass an AKC Inspection3," AKC inspectors will check to ensure that the facility and all enclosures are clean, free from debris, and that feces are picked up in a timely manner. A lack of cleanliness can also signal neglect which may result in suspension from the American Kennel Club., In order to demonstrate that you are complying with the AKC’s policy on caring for dogs, all enclosures will need to be an appropriate size for the dog. This means that the dog is able to sit, stand, lie down, and turn around comfortably within their enclosure. Solid floors are preferred; however, the AKC will allow a perforated floor as long as there is a protective coating. An area with solid flooring must be provided somewhere within the enclosure., The inspector will also check that you have a disaster plan prepared in case of an emergency. Although most people have thought or talked about what they would do in an emergency, it is very important to have the disaster plan written down and posted so that all staff can access the plan. The disaster preparedness plan should reflect the facility and type of dog breed(s) owned.For example, create a portable kit that includes food, bowls, water, leashes, first aid equipment, emergency escape routes, and blankets in case of an evacuation."

Opt for the mother's milk whenever possible.,
Use only a milk replacer.,
Cool the formula to room temperature.,
Figure out the amount of formula your puppy needs.,
Feed your puppy carefully.,
Make sure you feed your puppies frequently enough.,
Transition puppies to solid food after four weeks.,
Separate the mother and puppies gradually.,
Feed the puppies healthy food during weaning.,
Feed your puppies the proper amount.,
Consult with a vet before bottle feeding.,
Make sure a puppy is warm before bottle feeding.,
Do not hold a puppy upside down during feeding.",How to Make Sure Newborn Puppies Receive Enough Nutrition," A mother's milk has the nutrients necessary for puppies to thrive. A mother will also be able to feed her puppies enough milk without a lot of intervention. When possible, a mother's milk is always the best option. You should only attempt to bottle or syringe feed if the puppies are orphaned or if the mother rejects the litter., You should never use cow's milk or goat's milk as a substitute for a mother's milk. You should only use milk replacement formula designed specifically for newborn puppies, which you can buy online or at a vet's office.It's always best to get your formula straight from a vet's office. This way, a vet can recommend a safe formula to meet your puppy's needs.

, You never want to serve a puppy formula that's too warm or too hot. Let it cool to room temperature before feeding your puppies.Check the storage instructions on the formula. You want to make sure you don't leave the formula out too long when cooling it.

, You want to make sure your puppies are getting enough calories for their age and weight. Puppies should be fed six to twelve times a day, with calories divided equally between each feeding. During the first week, puppies need between 60 and 69 calories per pound each day. As they age, that number increases.In the second week, puppies need between 70 and 79 calories per pound a day. In the third week, up that to 80 to 89 calories. Beyond four weeks, puppies need between 90 and 100 calories a day.
These ranges are general rules, however. You should consult a veterinarian for precise instructions, especially if your puppies have any specific health risks.

, Make sure you're feeding your puppies correctly to avoid injury. You should use a bottle that releases milk very slowly. Milk should come out one to two drops at a time rather than pouring out.Hold your puppy in your lap to feed it. Keep it face down. Holding it on its back is dangerous.
Gently guide the puppy's mouth to the nipple and slowly feed it the proper dose of food. Only feed the puppy one to two drops at a time.

, Puppies should be fed six to 12 times a day. They should be fed every two hours when they're younger. You should also feed them once or twice during the night., To make sure puppies continue to get adequate nutrition after weaning, introduce solid food at the right time. Most puppies are ready for solid food after four weeks of age. Talk to a vet before weaning your puppies just to make sure it's safe to switch your puppies to solid food.A vet can also recommend a quality puppy chow to keep your puppies healthy. Ask something like, ""What type of puppy chow do you recommend for this breed and size?""

, If the mother is still feeding her newborns at the time of weaning, you do not want to make the separation too abrupt. A gradual separation is best for the mother and puppies.At first, start by separating the puppies and mother for a few hours at a time. During this time, give the puppies access to a pan of food.
Over time, increase the amount of food and length of separation.
It's normal for the puppies to resist at first and there may be some setbacks during the weaning process. Try to accept this without becoming discouraged. Be strict with the rules even if the puppies appear distressed and eventually they will calm down.

, Opt for a high quality puppy chow recommended by your veterinarian. Puppy chow should have 25% to 30% protein. A puppy's teeth are still developing during weaning, so water down the puppy chow with warm water. This will make it soggy, allowing the puppy to more easily eat it.Do not get discouraged if your puppies play with their food instead of eating it at first. This is a normal part of the transition and the puppies will eventually learn what their food is for.
As a goal, aim to have puppies consuming mainly dry food by seven to eight weeks of age.

, You want to make sure your puppies are getting adequate nutrition during the weaning process. Make sure you know how much food puppies should receive during this time.Puppies are unlikely to overeat when they're getting used to their dry food. It's okay to leave dry food out for puppies to peck at until they're nine to twelve months old.
At nine to twelves months, most puppies reach their adult weights. Talk to your vet about the proper portions for your puppy based on its size and breed once it reaches this age.

, Bottle feeding is a difficult task and can be dangerous for your puppy if done incorrectly. In the event your puppies are orphaned, or the mother rejects them, talk to your veterinarian about bottle feeding before attempting to do so on your own. You do not want to put your puppy's health and safety at risk., If puppies are cold for whatever reason, bottle feeding can actually be deadly. Organs start to close down if a puppy is cold and body feeding can speed up this process. If a puppy seems cold or sick, take it to a vet., If held upside down, a puppy can choke during bottle feeding. Always hold a puppy face down on your lap to bottle feed, imitating the natural position it would be in when feeding from its mother."

Ensure that your dog is a good breeding candidate.,
Feed your dog a high-quality dog food that has passed the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) feeding tests.,
Know the facts before breeding.,
Consider adopting a shelter dog instead of breeding.",How to Care for a Pregnant Dog1," Many canine diseases can pass from a mother dog to her puppies. Have your veterinarian examine your dog before you breed her to minimize the risk of passing a genetic disease to the puppies. Heritable diseases can affect the bones, joints, heart, teeth, skin, blood cells, kidneys, liver, nervous system (brain and spinal cord), digestive tract, reproductive organs, and the immune system. Some common examples include hip dysplasia, allergies, cryptorchidism, and hernias. Certain breeds have an increased risk of heritable diseases.Think about your dog’s (and the male dog’s) personality and behavior. Some scientific studies show that aggression can be genetic. You should breed friendly dogs that do not have aggressive tendencies.;
, Foods that have passed the AAFCO feeding tests will read, “Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that _____ provides complete and balanced nutrition for ______ .”Feeding your dog high-quality food prior to pregnancy can improve her and her puppies’ health.

, Although puppies are very cute, they also require a lot of time, attention, and clean-up. Puppies typically stay with their mother for 8 weeks after birth, longer if you have trouble finding them a home. Raising multiple puppies will take a lot of your time and energy, not to mention it can be expensive.


If your dog has trouble delivering her puppies, emergency veterinary treatment will be necessary. Cesarean sections (C-sections) can be very expensive, so be prepared to shell out some cash if there is an emergency.

, There is a dog overpopulation problem in the United States, meaning that there are more dogs than there are homes for them. According to the ASPCA, 1,200,000 dogs are euthanized in shelters each year.For each puppy that your dog delivers, there could be one less home available for a shelter dog.

Get your dog proper prenatal care.,
See your veterinarian if you believe that your dog may be pregnant.,
Talk to your veterinarian about ALL medications and treatments that you give your dog.,
Make sure you know where the nearest Vet Emergency hospital is located.",How to Care for a Pregnant Dog2," Your dog should be vaccinated before she gets pregnant. This will protect your dog and your dog’s puppies. Newborn puppies have an increased risk getting serious (and even fatal) diseases if their mother is not vaccinated.


Most experts advise against vaccinating pregnant dogs, so vaccines should be given ahead of time.
Get your dog dewormed. Internal parasites (such as roundworms and hookworms) can pass from a mother to her puppies. Your dog’s veterinarian will prescribe an appropriate medication that will protect both your dog and her puppies.
Have a heartworm test performed by your vet and start an appropriate heartworm preventative. Heartworm microfilaria can pass from a dog to her unborn puppies through the placenta.

, Your veterinarian can help you verify the pregnancy, determine the due date, discuss any medication changes, and even estimate the number of expected puppies. Your veterinarian can also help you determine if your dog is having a false pregnancy, a condition in which she looks and acts pregnant when she’s not.


Ultrasound machines can visualize puppy embryos approximately 3 weeks into the pregnancy. Your veterinarian may be able to feel the puppies inside your dog’s belly 20-30 days into the pregnancy. Unborn puppies can be seen on x-rays after 45 days (5 weeks) of pregnancy.
Your veterinarian will count the fetal skeletons to determine the number of expected puppies. This way, you will know if all the puppies have been delivered successfully when your dog gives birth. If you are expecting 6 puppies but only 4 are born, you will know to take your dog in for emergency medical care.

, Some medications can be dangerous to the unborn puppies and can cause birth defects and even death. For instance, veterinarians typically recommend that you keep your dog on their monthly heartworm preventatives, but talk to your veterinarian to be certain.


Talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s flea and tick treatments and her risk for these parasites. Your veterinarian will recommend an appropriate product if treatment is indicated. Examples of products that your veterinarian may recommend for your pregnant dog include FrontlineⓇ Plus Topspot (but not FrontlineⓇ Spray), RevolutionⓇ, ProgramⓇ, and CapstarⓇ.Your veterinarian may recommend a dewormer during the last third of your dog’s pregnancy. Fenbendazole is typically considered safe for pregnant dogs and can treat worms that can be passed from a dog to her puppies.
Do not give any over-the-counter medications, treatments, or supplements to your dog without asking your veterinarian whether they are safe during pregnancy.
Do not vaccinate your pregnant dog. Talk to your veterinarian about vaccinations if your dog is pregnant and is overdue on vaccines.
If your dog is on long-term medications for a chronic disease, talk to your veterinarian immediately to determine if you should continue or stop the medications.

, This should be a 24 hr clinic, not your regular vet office. It is best to be prepared for an emergency, just in case your dog is giving birth in the evening and she has serious complications.

"
Check the label on the food you feed your dog.,
Feed a normal amount of high-quality commercial dog food for the first 4 weeks of pregnancy.,
Switch to a high-quality puppy food during the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy.,
Increase the amount that you feed your dog by another 25% for the end of her pregnancy, during the 8th and 9th week.,
Do not supplement your dog’s food with vitamins, minerals, or meats unless directed by your veterinarian.",How to Care for a Pregnant Dog3," Ensure that the food has passed an AAFCO feeding test. The label should read, “Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that _____ provides complete and balanced nutrition for ______.”, Commercial dog foods are sold at pet food and grocery stores. These foods typically contain all necessary nutrients in the correct amounts and ratios.


Homemade foods often do not contain the proper balance of the necessary nutrients and should be avoided.

, At this point in the pregnancy, your dog will have higher nutritional demands. Puppy food contains higher amounts of protein, fat, energy and minerals.


At this point you should also increase the amount that you feed your dog by 20-25%.
Do not feed large-breed dog or large-breed puppy foods, even if you have a large-breed dog. These foods typically do not contain enough energy or calcium for a pregnant dog.

, At this point your dog will be eating 50% more than she did before pregnancy. For example, if your dog ate 2 cups of food twice daily before she was pregnant, she will need 6 cups of food per day by the end of her pregnancy.


Because the puppies will be pushing on her stomach, she may not be able to eat this much food in one meal. Dividing her food into smaller, more frequent meals will ensure that she gets all of her nutritional requirements. Some dogs need to be “free fed” at this point, meaning that their food is left down throughout the day to allow them to eat as needed.

, You may think that additional calcium is required, and some inaccurate websites even recommend it, but do not give your dog any additional calcium. Additional calcium can affect your dog’s internal ability to regulate calcium and can put your dog at risk for a life-threatening drop in calcium (called eclampsia).Adding meats to your dog’s food can cause them to eat fewer carbohydrates and decrease her energy intake.

"
"
Do not overexert your pregnant dog.,
Continue daily walks.,
Keep your dog away from other dogs during the last 3 weeks of pregnancy and for the first 3 weeks after she gives birth.",How to Care for a Pregnant Dog4," This is particularly important after the 6th week of pregnancy. Allow her to rest as long as she needs to, as pregnancy can be exhausting.


If you have a working dog, talk to your veterinarian about an appropriate exercise plan.

, Daily walks are a great low-intensity exercise for your pregnant dog. Most dogs can continue daily walks throughout their pregnancy.


Choose an appropriate time of day for the weather in your neighborhood (ie, early morning during the summer or mid-afternoon in the winter).
If your dog jogged regularly before getting pregnant, she can continue to do so for the first 4-6 weeks of pregnancy. After the 6th week, however, discontinue jogging in favor of daily walks.

, This means that you should avoid taking her to the dog park or on routes in your neighborhood that are heavily populated with dogs. This will help keep her protected from infectious diseases that could seriously harm both her and her puppies.


Also, pregnant dogs and dogs with young puppies can have behavior changes. Your dog may become aggressive towards other dogs if she feels that they are threatening her puppies.

"
"
Buy or make a whelping box.,
Make the box comfortable for your dog and her puppies.,
Place the box in a familiar yet private location.",How to Care for a Pregnant Dog5," The whelping box will serve as a safe place or “den” for your dog to deliver her puppies. It consists of a soft bed area surrounded by relatively high walls. You can make one out of plywood or firm plastic, or you can buy a commercially available box.


The whelping box needs to be large enough to allow your dog to fully stretch out and still leave room for all of the puppies.
The walls of the box need to be high enough to prevent the puppies from climbing out when they are 6 weeks old, but short enough that their mother can leave as she desires.
The walls need to be firm and secure enough that they will not collapse and squish the puppies.
If you don’t provide a box, your dog may choose a less-than-desirable location on her own.

, Line the bottom of the box with towels. Replace and wash the towels frequently after the puppies arrive. Both delivery and the puppies can make a mess, so plan accordingly.


Lining the box with newspaper is not recommended because it is neither soft nor warm, and newspaper ink can transfer to the puppies’ fur.
Keep the floor of the box is around 75°F by using low wattage light bulbs. For your dog’s and the puppies’ safety, make sure that the floor doesn’t get too hot or too cold.

, You will need to access the site frequently to assist your dog, but it should be tucked away from distractions and other pets. Allow your dog access to her whelping box for at least 1-2 weeks before she delivers. This will help her become comfortable with box when it is time to have the puppies.

Watch for signs of hypocalcemia.,
Educate yourself about hypocalcemia.,
Monitor dogs giving birth to first litters closely.,
Keep a close eye on smaller breeds.,
Monitor your dog's diet.",How to Deal with Hypocalcemia in Pregnant Dogs1," Hypocalcemia can occur at any stage in a dog’s pregnancy, but is most common in the weeks immediately preceding birth, the weeks following birth, and the time while the dog is lactating, or nursing its puppies. Signs of hypocalcemia include:Restlessness
Excessive whining and salivation
Sensitivity to stimuli
Panting
Pacing
Stiff gait
Muscle twitching or tremors
Muscle stiffness
Convulsions;
, A deficiency of blood calcium, or hypocalcemia, can develop in mother dogs prior to giving birth, in the immediate weeks following giving birth, or during lactation. This condition is also referred to as “milk fever,” and is caused by an underactive parathyroid gland. When this gland does not respond quickly enough to body’s demand for calcium, the dog can suffer from convulsive muscle contractions that limit the dog’s movement., Dogs that are pregnant with, or have given birth to, their first litter are more likely to develop hypocalcemia. If your dog is expecting its first litter of puppies, you should be especially vigilant about monitoring your dogs for the signs of hypocalcemia. If possible, you should also take measures to prevent hypocalcemia in your pregnant dog., Certain breeds of dogs, particularly toy breeds, are more likely to develop hypocalcemia than larger breeds. Breeds that are at a particularly high risk include Mexican hairless dogs, Pomeranians, shih-tzus, miniature poodles, Chihuahuas, and miniature pinschers., Diet and weight can increase the risk of hypocalcemia. There are certain risk factors aside from breed and giving birth to a first litter that can increase a dog’s risk of hypocalcemia. These factors include a disproportionate ratio of phosphorus to calcium in a dog’s diet while pregnant, as well as overall poor nutrition during your dog’s pregnancy. Your dog is also at a higher risk if its body weight is low in proportion to the size of its litter.For a pregnant dog, the correct ratio of calcium to phosphorus is between 1:1 and 1:2:1.
You should avoid feeding a pregnant dog puppy-growth diets, as these foods are higher in calcium and can be problematic.

Do a blood test after day 28.,
Have an ultrasound for early detection.,
Understand why radiography (x-ray) is not recommended.",How to Detect Pregnancy in Your Female Dog," If you have had her since she was a puppy, then you will know if she has been neutered (had her womb removed) or not. However, if the dog came to you as an adult from a rescue center, then you might not know for sure. An entire (unneutered) bitch comes into heat twice a year, so if you have owned her for well over nine months and she has not been in heat, the likelihood of her being neutered increases.While the duration of heat, or estrus, depends on the individual dog, it averages about 18 days. Dogs usually experience their first heat between six and 24 months of age.See the next steps for signs of heat.;
, When your dog is in heat, you can observe changes in her vaginal area.


An enlarged, swollen vulva: The swelling in the external area of her vagina often lasts around four weeks, from shortly before the heat starts, to just after it finishes.
Vaginal discharge: In the first seven to ten days of heat your dog may spot blood. It is helpful to put a white sheet in her bed and check for tell-tale signs of blood spotting. If your dog is fastidious, she may spend a lot of time washing her vulva, so the discharge may not be obvious. This discharge becomes lighter in the middle seven days of the season (which is when she is ovulating and most likely to get pregnant), and then returns for the final seven to ten days of the heat., When your dog is in heat, she is experiencing a major hormonal event that usually causes a change in her behavior. How exactly she changes depends on her personality; it may mean that if she's usually placid, she'll become snappy and short-tempered, or if she's home-loving, she might suddenly get the desire to escape and go wandering.


Aside from these changes, your dog should be otherwise well. If she lacks energy, loses her appetite, vomits, or drinks heavily, contact a vet for advice. Other womb conditions such as pyometra (pus in the womb) can mimic heat in rare cases, and may be life-threatening if left untreated., Obviously, it takes the participation of a male dog to get her pregnant. Think whether she has mated with a male dog, or whether it's possible that she escaped and found one to mate with.

, Castrated or neutered male dogs can mate with a female but cannot produce sperm to impregnate her. Entire (unneutered) male dogs, however, can impregnate her. If possible, contact the dog's owners to confirm.


The exception is a dog who was castrated in the recent past–less than four weeks before the mating. There is a theoretical risk that he could have sperm retained in his tubes, which he ejaculates during the mating. This risk is small, but cannot be completely ruled out., This can give you vital information about whether it's possible she is pregnant. If the event happened three months ago, then she cannot be pregnant. This is because the average gestation (length of pregnancy) is 62 to 65 days (with a range from 57 to 72 days). If she had got pregnant then, by 90 days she would have given birth already., This can help your vet decide which is the best test to detect pregnancy. Pregnancy diagnosis methods depend on detecting hormonal changes, physical changes, or identifying embryos in the womb. Which test is the most likely to give a definitive answer depends on the number of days that have passed since mating.


If a bitch was mated and the heat has not yet finished, it is too early to know if she is pregnant., Many owners remark that their bitch changes character during pregnancy: she seems sleepier, more lethargic, and starts to build nests. However, these are also the signs associated with pseudopregnancy, or false pregnancy, where the bitch behaves as if she is pregnant when in fact she isn't. Some bitches with a false pregnancy even start producing milk, so enlarged mammary glands are not conclusive evidence of pregnancy., One of the more reliable signs of pregnancy is if a female dog ""pinks up,"" which describes the enlargement of her nipples. They become larger and often develop a rosy hue (hence the term ""pinking"").


A pregnant bitch doesn't produce milk until near the end of gestation (or sometimes only after the puppies are born).
Note that you'll still need to have your dog tested for pregnancy to confirm. Prominent pink nipples four or so weeks after mating are a highly suspect (but inconclusive) clue to pregnancy., As with pregnant women, an expanding center is a strong hint–but it should be interpreted with caution. In a healthy, fit bitch, her body silhouette may not show obvious changes until 50-55 days of pregnancy, when the womb is sufficiently enlarged to fill the tummy.


Your dog does not need to take in extra calories until the final third of the pregnancy (after about 40 days). This means if you feed her extra early in the suspected pregnancy, she is likely to gain weight, but it will be fat and not necessarily puppies., If your dog is struggling during pregnancy, she needs help; however, there is also a distinct chance she is not pregnant, but has a condition mimicking pregnancy, including false pregnancy and pyometra. While a false pregnancy (usually caused by a hormonal imbalance after heat)is not life-threatening, a pyometra definitely is. The latter is where the womb fills with pus, which causes blood poisoning, organ failure, and, if left untreated, death.


The symptoms of pyometra can mimic pregnancy in that your dog's tummy may enlarge and she lacks energy. However, she is also likely to lose her appetite and have increased thirst. If these symptoms are present, call your vet at once., During the abdominal palpation, the vet feels the bitch's tummy for the presence of puppies. The earliest date that this is likely to be successful is at least 21 days after mating. At this early stage the vet is feeling for an enlarged, thickened womb rather than puppies (which are like small blobs of jelly at this point).


The best time for abdominal palpation is day 28. This is because the puppies are now big enough to make a ""bump"" in the womb, much like beads strung along a necklace.
By day 35, the each puppy is surrounded by his own fluid capsule and the vet feels something akin to a fluid string of sausages., Bear in mind that at 28 days each puppy swelling is a maximum of 25 mm (1 inch) in diameter, making it difficult to differentiate embryos in a womb from food in the gut or feces in the bowel. Furthermore, if your dog is tense and braces her belly wall, it can be impossible to feel anything worthwhile–the equivalent of trying to see through a window that has been painted over. Likewise, a single puppy can easily be missed, or mistaken for another structure such as the bladder, a kidney, or even feces in the bowel.


Don't feel too frustrated with the veterinarian when she suggests a pregnancy test, as the abdominal palpitation can be inconclusive., The blood tests looks for high levels of the pregnancy hormone, progesterone. To be reliable, this test should be done after day 28. Before this it's possible to get false positive results, because the high levels might be a result of delayed decay of the hormone present during ovulation. However, after day 28, high levels of progesterone confirm pregnancy., Ultrasound scans are a popular way of confirming pregnancy, because in the hands of a skilled operator small changes in the womb can be detected as early as 18 days. The other advantage is that the technician may be able to give you an idea of how many puppies are in the litter, which is useful to know when it comes to the birth, or whelping.


Placental units can be visible from day 18, and from day 28 the fetal heartbeats are visible.Note that the ultrasound is a noninvasive procedure that is done while your dog is conscious. The ultrasound equipment sends a beam of high-frequency sound waves toward your dog's uterus, and the waves created ""echoes"" which are converted into images. This is considered a safe procedure. The fur on your dog's abdomen needs to be clipped so that the probe can make good contact with the skin., X-rays have largely been replaced by ultrasound for detecting pregnancy in dogs. Because they are only of use once the fetal skeleton is calcified, which happens after day 49, the diagnosis is made relatively late in the pregnancy. As for safety, while the risk of irradiating puppies in the womb is unlikely to do harm, it is likely your dog will need to be sedated, because current health and safety regulations for the operators of x-ray equipment mean they are not allowed to be in the room when the exposure is made. Since many bitches, especially when heavily pregnant, are not comfortable lying still and are likely to get up when left, the only other option is to sedate them.


Sedating a pregnant bitch is best avoided because of the risk of a drop in blood pressure to puppies in the womb. For these reasons, the use of radiography for pregnancy diagnosis has gone out of vogue."
"
Start planning ahead right away to find the date that the pups' arrival is due.,
Make sure you take extra care of your dog.,
Prepare a whelping box, the place where your dog will have the puppies.,
Get other birthing equipment ready.",How to Deal with a Dog Pregnancy1," Remember that not all dogs are the same, so this will be different depending on the breed and characteristics of your dog.

The average time it takes for a dog to make puppies is 63 days from the time of mating. Once you have calculated this, you will be able to tell when she will give birth and make all of your plans from there.



 


Dogs can sometimes have pups 5 days before or after the date expected, but if it gets any longer than 5 days after contact a vet.






If your dog has had a scan and it says she is pregnant but she does not look it it may be she has absorbed the puppies after the scan. Dogs can sometimes absorb puppies when they are sad or depressed. It could also be that the scan in wrong as it is not 100% accurate all the time, for instance some people thought that their dog would have only 3 puppies when they have close to 11! It can be very confusing especially if you thought they were pregnant in the first place, but scans are not as accurate as they seem. You can also have an X-ray done at a skilled vet centre but again these can be not that accurate.





;
, She is going through lots of hormonal changes and may need your affection. At other times however, she may want to be left alone, and it is best if you do just that, you don't want to upset her or cause her harm.

She may go through morning sickness, a common occurrence in dogs, but this should wear off halfway through the pregnancy. She will also begin to show on the outside, for example her nipples may start to grow and turn pinker and she may begin to lose her waistline.






These signs are all a stronger indication that your dog is pregnant and that things are going to work out but to be sure you can get an ultrasound scan or a x-ray from your vet to confirm that she really is pregnant. However, do not worry if your dog does not experience some of the symptoms of pregnancy, some owners do not know their dog is pregnant until the day of arrival!







, You can make a whelping box out of cardboard, it should be big enough for your dog to fit two of herself inside and for her to get in and out easily while the puppies can not.
The whelping box can be made by yourself or you can buy one off the Internet. Making your whelping box is good because it saves money, but on the other hand the boxes are sturdier when you buy them.






It is a good idea to put a heat pad set on 'low' underneath some blankets so that the puppies can be warm when in the whelping box and feed off their mother.







, You will a thermometer for taking your dogs temperature, powdered milk substitute, a pair of sterilised scissors and some dental floss, a baby bottle, some examination gloves and some weighing scales for weighing the puppies. You should also keep a notepad handy to record times of birth and weight.

Keep her calm.,
Stick to your normal routine.,
Gather your supplies.,
Place a non-slip surface in the tub.,
Lift the dog into the tub.,
Start the water.,
Fill the tub first if running water frightens your dog.,
Lather her up with dog shampoo.,
Rinse the shampoo from her fur.,
Lift her out of the tub.,
Dry your dog.",How to Bathe a Pregnant Dog," When dealing with a pregnant dog, it's even more important than usual to make sure she stays calm. Her extra weight might make her harder to hold down if she starts to struggle. Pet her in long strokes and speak to her in a soft voice. Do everything you can to relax her.


If you think she might try to escape, get another person to help you. More hands means more petting!
If your dog is afraid of baths, don’t force her. Just brush through her coat instead, trying to get as much dirt off the fur as you can. It will be easier on you both.
Allow wet mud to dry into dirt before brushing her.;
, Even if you’re feeling worried about bathing her because she's pregnant, don't let her pick up on your anxiety. Act like it's a completely normal bath, and don't change the routine at all.


For example, if you usually lift your dog into the bathtub, give her the bath in her normal place. Don't decide to spray her with a hose outside instead because you're afraid of lifting her.

, Keep treats on hand to reward her for calm behavior or coax her into the tub. You'll also need shampoo for the bath and several towels to dry her off before letting her loose in your home.You can put one of the towels on the edge of the tub to stop some of the water from splashing onto the floor at your feet.


Use a nice, mild oatmeal shampoo for dogs that won't irritate her skin.
You're going to get wet, too, so dress down in clothes you don't mind getting dirty., You know from experience that bathtubs can get slippery when you add water and soap to the mix. A non-slip mat will help your dog keep her footing while she's getting her bath. You can find non-slip mats in any department store or online.

, Be gentle! Depending on how big she is, you may need two people to lift her. Don't lift her from under the belly, as this might be uncomfortable or painful for her. Instead, scoop one arm under her hind legs (behind the belly), and one under her neck. Lift lift her from the rump and chest.


If your dog is small enough, you may be able to use the kitchen (or utility) sink.

, Turn both the hot and cold nozzles to make sure the water comes out lukewarm. If you have a shower nozzle, spray down your dog's fur to get it completely wet. If you don't have a nozzle, just pour cups of water over her.


Pet her and talk softly to her the whole time to keep her calm.

, The sound of a loud faucet can be scary! For some dogs, it may be less stressful to start with the tub already filled with as much water as you need. Once you’ve filled the tub, you can gently lift her in. Use a cup to pour water over her instead of using a shower nozzle with running water.

, Work from the front to the back of her body. Start behind her head, then move your way down her neck and body. Lather her legs and tail last. Touch her stomach very lightly, and only just enough to make sure it's clean. Don't rub forcefully or push on her stomach in any way.


Don't put soap on her face, as it could get into her eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, use a damp washcloth to wash her face with water.Avoid getting shampoo in her ears, too.

, If the sound of running water doesn't scare her, turn the water back on and use the shower nozzle to rinse the shampoo off her. If she's scared, use a glass to pour water over her coat.


Rinse until you can't see suds in her coat anymore.

, Use the same method you used when putting her in the tub: lift her from the rump and chest. Again, be careful not to put any pressure on her belly. Make sure she has her footing on the ground before letting go her, so she doesn't fall.

, If your dog is fearless in the face of loud noises, you can speed up the drying process by using a blow dryer. Most dogs prefer a light towel-dry, though. She has a lot more hair than humans, so you may need to go through a few towels.


You don't need to get her completely dry. Just dry her off enough to make sure she doesn't drip water all over your house.
Let her coat air dry the rest of the way.

Seek treatment immediately.,
Ask your vet to perform blood tests.,
Educate yourself about how vets treat hypocalcemia.,
Ask your vet if a calcium supplement will be prescribed.",How to Deal with Hypocalcemia in Pregnant Dogs2," If your dog exhibits any signs of hypocalcemia, you need to take it to the vet immediately. Do not delay seeking treatment. Hypocalcemia is a potentially fatal disease and should be taken very seriously., When you take your dog to the veterinarian, make sure you ask that blood tests be performed immediately to measure calcium levels. These tests will either confirm or deny that your dog is suffering from hypocalcemia. It is important that these tests are done as soon as possible so that treatment can be administered., Many veterinarians will begin treating your dog for hypocalcemia prior to receiving the results of blood tests because the condition is life threatening. Your vet will likely give your dog calcium slowly and intravenously. It will cause your dog’s muscles to relax quickly, and in most cases your dog will be in a normal state within 15 minutes., Once your dog is treated for hypocalcemia, your vet will likely instruct you to give the dog a calcium supplement. This will help you manage your dog’s condition. Supplementation is especially important for dogs who have no given birth yet, as there is a high risk the condition could return once your dog begins lactating and nursing.Never give a pregnant dog a calcium supplement unless your veterinarian prescribes it.

Get your dog in her whelping box when the time for birth comes.,
Monitor the labour and help as needed.,
Take care of the puppies right away if needed.,
Keep the mother and puppies together.",How to Deal with a Dog Pregnancy2," If she chooses somewhere else (a closet, the garden), lead her to the whelping box as you do not want to go into labour there.

, When she goes into labour she will pant heavily and start to push but it is only when the first water breaks will she give birth to the first puppy. She will then tear the sack with her tongue and lick up the excess but if you see the puppy is not breathing you can tear the sack from around the nose and mouth until the puppy starts to breathe.

, If she has too many puppies and not enough nipples or one puppy cannot get through, drastic action is needed, You must hand rear and feed this puppy from birth, this needs doing every two hours by a responsible adult.


No children below the age of 12 should hold the puppies before their eyes have opened, as puppies can be fragile. Children, who do not know how to handle them with care, can easily snap the neck of a newborn puppy if they are holding them too tight.

, The mother should stay in the whelping box for 5 days before leaving her puppies for a short while.

"
"
Keep an eye on their development.,
Wean the puppies when it's time.,
Prepare for adoption or the other next steps.",How to Deal with a Dog Pregnancy3," The puppies should open their eyes at about two weeks of age. However this, of course, depends on the breed of your dog and puppies, some puppies eyes can open as late as three weeks from birth. Obviously the larger the litter the smaller the pups will be, and in some litters you will get a runt. In nature the runt would be left to die but luckily humans can hand feed puppies using bottles of formula milk for puppies.

, When the mother starts to stand up to feed the puppies you will know it is time to wean them off milk and onto solid foods that they can digest easily. Start by mushing up solid food into puppy milk and progress from there until the pups can eat solid food all by themselves.

, One of the worst parts of having puppies is unfortunately, having to let them go. Puppies are ready to leave their mother at a very young age, 8-9 weeks. Finding homes for all the puppies is a tough job and an art in itself and can be made even worse if the puppies are crossbreeds as lots of people prefer pedigrees to crossbreeds.


One of the hardest parts is letting them go yourself. Puppies can often form an emotional bond with humans, especially in first time breeders and families, although some breeders have no difficulty giving away puppies. You may want to keep them all but they deserve homes with loving families who will care for them. In the end the puppies will have gone and your bitch will be able to rest, without having any pups to look after!

,
Once you have had both dogs checked, it is time to breed.,
Once they have been bred, some of the signs that you should look for in your dog that may tell you if she is pregnant is a decrease or increase in appetite, more affectionate, vomiting (also known as morning sickness), lack of energy and her nipples may start to become more visible.

Remember to consult your vet about when your puppies will need their vaccinations and other health checks.,
When the puppies are ( 7-8 weeks old for large breeds and 9-10 weeks old for small breeds)they can go to their forever homes that you should of found through the pregnancy.

,
Spoil your female dog when the puppies have all left for their homes.","How to Care for a Dog Before, During, and After Pregnancy"," The stud dog should be no bigger than the female as this could cause complications during labor. You can find a stud dog through breeders in your local area, at dog parks, vets, social networking sites and other social events.

It should be noted that breeding dogs should be left to breeders (not puppy mills) and not done in the back yard. This is bad for everyone.;
, If yes, then it is time to find out when your female is ready to mate.

,, Your female will go into an estrus cycle (known as heat) usually 2 times a year, though large breeds may only go into heat once a year. During heat, a females ""bottom"" will start to swell and in the next couple of days after this swelling, blood may appear. Wait 10 days after this period then allow the male and female to breed as this is prime breeding time.

,, Puppy food is a great source for protein and other important vitamins and minerals that that your dog will need through the pregnancy but also her puppies inside her will need to keep up their strength and help with growth development., This means having fresh, clean water available everyday, getting regular exercise and grooming if required, though she should already have access to all these things.

, During the next couple of weeks your dog should have an increase in appetite. You should gradually split her food up into 4 separate meals a day as this will make it easier to digest- especially with all those little puppies taking up so much room! Her exercise should remain the same until around week 4 when you should be slowing it down to a gentle stroll up and down the road.

, This is a good idea as it tells you how many puppies to expect and to detect any complications that may arise such as if a puppy might be in a difficult position or is to big to pass through.

, This is a natural instinct, she is trying to find somewhere to give birth and raise her pups in. But unless you want her giving birth under your bed you might want to start thinking about a whelping box. This is an enclosed area where the mother dog will raise her puppies. It should be double the size of your dog when it is lying down. There should be an area with toys, blankets etc for the pups and mother but a separate, closed off area as well where only the mother can access it. This private section could be where you feed her and give her water.The whelping box should be small enough for the mother to jump in and out without any stress but tall enough to keep naughty little puppies from climbing out!

, By the last week or so you should start frequently taking the dams temperature. Her normal temp should be 100-101 so when it drops to 99-98 you know that labor will begin in 12-24 hours. She will begin to show signs of labor by panting, shivering, and digging.

, Plenty of towels, a nasal aspirator, gloves, wet wipes, food and water for the mother, scissors to cut umbilical cords, KY jelly, weight scale, notebook and pen, a good book and lots of COFFEE as this is a very long process.

, This is when she will begin contracting and expelling the puppies. When a puppy is emerging you will see a dark kind of bubble appear. This is the puppy, it's head will usually be the first thing you will see but if his legs are coming out first this is known as a breech. If the female is pushing hard but the puppy will not move then you will have to step in. With gloves, wipe KY jelly all around the area and try to grab as much of the puppy as possible. If you can try to grab the tail and not the legs as this will cause less damage to the puppy. Once out the puppy will be enclosed in a sack, if the mother does not remove this sack within a minute you must immediately remove it as it is suffocating the puppy and he needs to breathe. To remove it, at the head of the puppy grab the sack with your fingertips and peel down. After that aspirate the puppy remembering to clear the nose first then the mouth.

, Suckling is a good way for mother and puppy to bind but it also helps bring on more contractions. Once your dog starts contracting again, remove the puppy from the mother and put it in a separate box. This box should only have enough room for the little puppies to move around in and lie down. Make sure it is very warm and clean! Keep the puppies in here whenever mum is in the process of delivering puppies as it helps keep the puppies safe from mum as she might roll over onto them when she is delivering a puppy but also to warm the pups up and let them sleep.

, Their environment that they will sleep, play and eat in must be kept immaculate. They are extremely vulnerable to germs and other harmful bacteria at this critical stage of their development. Also, weigh the puppies and write down their gender, colour and birth date. This way you can see if they are gaining weight or if you have to supplement feed them if they are underweight., This is when a bigger whelping box is needed so that the puppies have room to play in and explore. When they are around 4-5 weeks old start introducing soft food to them.

, There are extremely important as they will protect your dog from dangerous diseases later on in life.

,, She has just gone through a HUGE process and definitely deserves a big bone, groom and most importantly, a tummy rub!!!! :)

Check for painful mammary glands.,
Notice any behavioral changes.,
Watch for any neglect of the puppies.,
Determine if the puppies are ill or failing to thrive.",How to Diagnose Mastitis in Dogs1," If the dog has mastitis, the mammary glands will cause pain for the dog. The breast area will be firm and swollen because of the fluid from the infection, and it will be hot to the touch.The teats may be enlarged or red.The mammary glands may also have pus or blood coming from them. Any milk may have pus or blood mixed into it. The pus or milk may have a foul odor.The skin around the nipple may be damaged or cracked.If the mastitis is really bad, the glands may have abscesses or have gangrene.;
, Another symptom of mastitis is behavioral changes in your dog. Mastitis may cause the dog to lose their appetite and refuse to eat food. The dog may also be lethargic, depressed, and be less active than they used to be.Some dogs may have a fever and act sickly.

, If your dog has mastitis, they might respond negatively to their puppies. The dog may neglect or not pay attention to the puppies because of the swollen or painful teats. In some cases, the mother may even act aggressively towards the puppies.The dog may not allow the puppies to nurse because it’s too painful on the infected mammary glands., Due to the mother’s neglect, the puppies may not be able to nurse. This means the puppies may not thrive or grow. The puppies may end up whining or crying, or they may try to paw at the mother to get her to pay attention to them. If the neglect is prolonged without prompt care and assistance, the puppies may get sick or die. The milk may not have all the nutrients, so the puppies may end up malnourished.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Know what to expect from your visit.,
Allow the veterinarian to perform additional tests.",How to Diagnose Mastitis in Dogs2," If your suspect that your dog has mastitis, you should take your dog to the vet immediately. You should take your dog to the vet if the mammary glands show significant swelling and inflammation, or if the condition is preventing the puppies from getting the proper nutrition.Your vet will ask for a medical history and then conduct a physical exam of the dog.

, One way to diagnose mastitis is to take samples from the swollen glands and analyze them. Your vet will take the samples and send them off to the lab. Your vet will probably start by getting a sample of the milk or pus from the glands and checking it for bacteria.Your vet may also want to to a sample of the firm mass collected in the breast area. To do this, they will insert a needle and remove a sample of the solid substance.
Your vet may also take a culture to check for bacteria.

, In some cases, mastitis can become severe and start infecting the blood. This can lead to serious side effects, including death. To check for this, your vet will need to perform additional tests. They may start with a blood count.The vet may also do a biochemical profile where they check the liver, kidney, pancreas, and sugar levels. They ay also do a blood count or a urinalysis.In some instances, the vet may do chest or abdominal x-rays.

Treat mastitis.,
Prevent mastitis.,
Identify the risk factors.,
Know what mastitis is.",How to Diagnose Mastitis in Dogs3," If your dog has mastitis, there are treatments available to cure it. The most common treatment is antibiotics to kill the bacteria. When the mastitis is too severe, the mammary glands may need to be surgically drained. If the glands get infected often, the dog may have to have their mammary glands removed.If the dog is ill or septic, they may need an IV.
You may need to place a warm compress on the swollen glands to help reduce pain and help the milk flow better.

, Measures can be taken to prevent mastitis if your dog has just given birth. Make sure to keep your dog and the puppies clean. Trim the hair around the dog's mammary glands and wipe away any dirt, debris, or urine from that area. You should also clean the puppies' litter area.Make sure the puppies don't scratch the mammary glands with their nails. Clip their nails if possible.
Make sure each mammary gland is expelling milk. If the puppies aren't using each teat, manually squeeze milk from them to clear bacteria and help milk not to get backed up.

, Some risk factors may lead to mastitis in dogs. The condition is most commonly seen in female dogs who are lactating. Trauma to the mammary glands can lead to mastitis. Trauma can come from nursing puppies who bite the teat or scratch it. Trauma may also occur if the dog has short legs and the teats drag along the ground and get scratched or damaged.Poor hygiene around the mammary glands may also cause the bacterial infection.
It may also occur due to the infection spreading through the blood.

, Mastitis is an infection of the mammary glands caused by bacteria. It leads to inflammation. The infection usually starts at the opening of the teat. It can occur in one or multiple mammary glands. It generally affects female dogs who have already given birth and who are lactating.The infection is not common.

Consult your dog’s vet about its dietary needs.,
Provide a balanced diet high in protein and carbohydrates.,
Take your dog on frequent gentle walks.,
Increase its food intake by 15% during the last three weeks of pregnancy.",How to Promote Safe Whelping for Overweight Dogs1," In order to create the best meal plan for your overweight pregnant dog, you’ll need to find out some specifics about its health. Bring your dog to the vet for a physical examination and blood count.Ask its vet, “Did the blood count show any signs of anemia or low protein?” If your dog has a low iron or protein count, you’ll most likely need to switch up its food during the pregnancy. You can keep to the brand it’s used to, but look for a variety marked for pregnant dogs or for puppies.;
, Dogs generally don’t require any additional food intake during the first six weeks of pregnancy, which lasts nine weeks on average. While more food isn’t required, especially if your dog is already overweight, its diet should ideally be high in carbohydrates and be composed of about 25% protein.Ask the vet for guidance when planning your dog’s diet, since feeding a dog that’s overweight and pregnant is a delicate balance. Keeping with the brand your dog is used to will help prevent digestion issues, as long as its label notes that it contains enough protein and carbohydrates.
If you’ve been feeding your dog as much as it wants prior to the pregnancy, you’ll need to develop a careful feeding plan based on your dog’s size, lifestyle, and blood counts. Regular small meals are preferable to keeping food out or feeding your dog one large meal.

, You should avoid giving your dog strenuous exercise, and weight loss is not recommended during pregnancy, even in overweight dogs. However, regular easy walks are necessary to keep your dog active.While overall weight loss shouldn’t be a goal, reducing fat deposits along the abdomen and around the birth canal through consistent exercise can help reduce the risk of an abnormal delivery.

, Puppies grow exponentially during the pregnancy’s final third. This places a nutritional strain on your dog, and dogs in the best of health will require at least 25% more food. Increasing food intake slightly less than normal, at around 15% more calories, will be best for your overweight dog.Remember that more frequent meals are better than offering one larger meal. Instead of increasing the size of each meal, try to add in an another feeding time to your dog’s routine.

Check on the mother and her puppies regularly.,
Recognize the signs of immediate danger.,
Make the appointment.,
Take notes about your pet’s condition.,
Think about what you should ask the vet.",How to Take a Mother Dog to a Postnatal Veterinary Exam1," For the first week, check at least twice a day to make sure that your dog is recovering and that the puppies are doing well.

Monitor your mother dog's vaginal discharge post-whelping.
Take your dog's temperature to make sure that she doesn't spike a fever. A high temperature for a dog is a temperature over 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. You can take your dog's temperature either rectally with a mercury thermometer or in your dog's ear with an ear thermometer.Weigh the puppies every day, and track their weights to make sure that they gain every day. You will need to find a way to distinguish the puppies from each other if they look similar to each other. It's important that you know if one of the puppies is not gaining.;
, There are certain symptoms that, if exhibited by the mother dog or pups, may require the immediate attention of a veterinarian. If the mother dog has difficulty nursing, runs a fever, develops any swelling or tenderness in her teats, or generally seems disinterested in her pups, you should seek veterinary assistance immediately. If the pups struggle to gain weight, fail to nurse properly, or die, you should also visit a veterinarian as soon as possible. To save the life of your dog and the pups, prompt action is essential.It is important that you are able to recognize the symptoms of Eclampsia (milk fever), metritis, and mastitis in your mother dog.
Eclampsia occurs when a mother dog's calcium is low and usually happens in small dogs. Symptoms include stiff gait, trouble standing, restlessness, pacing, panting, fever, muscle spasms, seizures, and lack of interest in her puppies.
Metritis is usually caused by after-birth or a stillborn puppy that remains in the mother dog. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, smelly discharge, fast heart rate, dehydration, panting, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Mastitis is an infection in the dog's mammary glands. Symptoms include red, hot, inflamed nipples.You should also be sure to deal with nipple guarding among your puppies, which can lead to fading puppy syndrome and death.

, Once the mother dog has delivered her pups, you will want to contact your vet to schedule a visit. If the birth normal and all of the animals are healthy, you should have a postpartum checkup 24 to 48 hours after the delivery of the pups. You will also want to schedule an appointment for the veterinarian to examine your dog and the puppies at the same time.Because you want to avoid the risk of infection with your newborn pups and the mother, ask if the veterinarian will make a home visit. Although it may cost extra, it prevents you from risking the health of your dog and pups.
Be clear with the clinic staff about why you are bringing your dog, especially if the mother or pups are experiencing any postpartum complications, such as eclampsia, metritis, or mastitis. Say, ""My dog recently gave birth, and I need to have her evaluated to make sure that she is recovering well. I also want to have the puppies checked. Her temperature has peaked at 102 degrees Fahrenheit, so she appears to be doing well. However, one of the puppies is struggling to gain weight.""

, Before you go to the veterinarian, write down the condition of the mother and the pups. Try to be as detailed as possible when describing any problems that you notice. This will help the veterinarian get a better idea of what potential complications may arise.Detailed notes can help your veterinarian diagnose things like fading puppy syndrome in the pups or mastitis in the mother.

, Before the appointment, make a list of questions that you would like the veterinarian to answer. This will help you avoid forgetting any important questions about your animals’ health. Since you will be taking the mother and the pups, try to think of questions for both.You might ask things like “What do I do if a puppy doesn’t nurse?” “What do I do if the mother does not produce enough milk?” ""What do I do if the mother refuses to nurse the puppies?"" ""What can I do if a puppy prevents other puppies from nursing?"" ""What is normal behavior for a postnatal dog?"" ""How often should the puppies nurse?"" and ""When should I call for an appointment?""

Monitor your dog for signs of malnutrition.,
Ask the vet about a Cesarean section.,
Look up the hours of your vet and nearest emergency clinic.",How to Promote Safe Whelping for Overweight Dogs2," While counterintuitive, overweight dogs are at risk of malnutrition, since some owners are hesitant to provide them with the calories and nutrients a pregnancy demands. Remember that pregnancy and nursing are the most physically demanding nutritional challenges your dog will ever experience.Symptoms like weight loss and lethargy can indicate malnutrition. It can be difficult to spot in overweight dogs, so consult the vet about continued testing for anemia and blood protein., Overweight dogs are at a higher risk of dystocia, which is an abnormal or difficult delivery that requires a C-section. You’ll want to ask the vet if they recommend a planned C-section.While it can be costly, a planned C-section is cheaper and safer than an emergency C-section.

, As the due date approaches, make sure to have an emergency contact sheet handy. Include the vet’s number and, if your vet isn’t open 24 hours a day, list the contact information for the nearest emergency veterinary clinic. Even if the vet approves of a home birth, you’ll want to be prepared to call them or get your dog emergency help.Call the vet or nearest clinic when your dog starts the first stage of labor. Advise them to be ready if you need emergency assistance.

Build a whelp box.,
Introduce your dog to the whelping box before labor.,
Use a heating pad to warm the whelp box.,
Have necessary supplies handy.,
Notice when the first stage of labor begins.,
Give your dog some space to deliver the pups.,
Tear each pup’s birthing sac and cut umbilical cords if necessary.,
Call for help right away if any complications arise.,
Continue to monitor your dog and pups after delivery.",How to Promote Safe Whelping for Overweight Dogs3," Your dog will need a designated area to deliver its pups, or else it’ll find a closet or other secluded place to whelp. Using a box is preferable to just designating a whelp area, since overweight dogs might require emergency care. You’ll need to choose a box large enough for the dog to stretch out and nurse the pups, but one that you can lift and put in a car if you have to bring the dog to the clinic.Line the floor with newspaper before birth, since it can easily be exchanged for clean lining when soiled. After your dog delivers, switch from newspaper to bath mats or plastic placemats so the newborn pups have better footing.
Include a shelf or roll away area in the box to provide the pups with protective shelter if the mother rolls over.

, Get your dog used to the whelp box a few days before the approximate due date. This is particularly important if your dog is whelping for the first time. Bring your dog to the box and allow it to inspect and lay in it.You or a veterinarian must be present when your overweight dog gives birth, so getting it accustomed to a whelp box beforehand is essential.

, You’ll need to help keep both the mother and the pups warm after birth. Some owners put the heating pad inside the box, but if you use a heat-conductive material like wood, you can place the pad under the box.Make sure to check the pad or box regularly with the back of your hand to make sure it’s warm but not hot to the touch.

, Prepare a kit ahead of time with a thermometer, surgical gloves, scissors, unwaxed dental floss, and iodine. You’ll use the floss to tie the umbilical cords and the scissors to cut them if the mother doesn’t do so. Either way, you’ll use the iodine to sanitize the area after cutting., Try to commit the expected due date to memory and mark it on a calendar. A couple days prior, begin taking your dog’s temperature every few hours. Within a day of the start of labor, its temperature will drop under 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or 37.8 degrees Celsius). When that happens, take the dog to the vet if you’ve arranged a C-section, or prepare for a home birth.Other signs of the first stage of labor include panting, restlessness, plump or dripping nipples, and abdominal straining.
The first stage lasts up to 12 hours. Your dog probably won’t want to eat once labor begins, but be sure it has access to plenty of water.

, Regular contractions, which are clearly visible as waves across the belly, mark the second stage of labor. If you haven’t arranged a C-section, monitor the birth from several feet away, but avoid hovering. Your dog will resist delivering unless it feels that it has some privacy.On average, your dog will deliver one pup per hour. Before delivering each pup, it will pass foetal fluid. If it passes fluid and more than 2 hours go by without delivering a pup, call the vet.
After delivering each pup, your dog will remove the birth membrane and lick the pup to cleaning it. This licking also encourages the pup to breathe.
Know how many pups the vet observed on ultrasounds and keep track of each pup delivered so you know how many more to expect.

, If the mother doesn’t do so, you must immediately tear the membrane around the pup’s head. If you don’t do so promptly, the pup could suffocate. Use a towel to clean off the pup, and be sure to remove mucous and fluid from the mouth and nose so it can breath.After you remove the sac, tie the cord off about two inches from the abdomen and cut it on the far side of the tie. Paint the cut end promptly with iodine to prevent infection.

, Call the vet or clinic and bring your dog in for help if it is in obvious extreme pain, if a puppy is stuck in the birth canal, or if there’s a foetal discharge but no puppy delivered two or three hours after the discharge. Call the vet if the second stage of labor lasts more than twelve hours.These are all indications of emergency birthing complications that overweight dogs are prone to experiencing.

, If there are no complications, you should still schedule a vet visit for your dog and the pups within three days of whelping.Look for signs of infection and other post-whelping issues. Odorless reddish-brown discharges are normal for days after whelping, but black discharges with a odor can indicate a uterine infection, which requires immediate veterinary care. In addition bring your dog to the vet as soon as possible if it shows any of these symptoms:Disinterest in or ignoring the puppies.
Muscle spasms or abdominal swelling.
Refusing food or water after whelping.

Groom the mother.,
Walk the mother.,
Feed the mother normally.",How to Take a Mother Dog to a Postnatal Veterinary Exam2," After the mother gives birth, it is important that you clean her. Remove any soiled materials from the whelping box to keep the mother and pups sanitary and fresh. Gently clean the mother with a warm damp cloth, washing away any fecal matter, blood, or other bodily fluids and tissues. Besides being sanitary, cleaning your dog before the visit will also make it easier for the veterinarian to assess your animal’s health.You should not clean the pups. The mother will do that and it is an important part of the bonding process. Wait until your dog has cleaned her puppies, and then throw out the soiled bedding. Replace it with clean bedding.

, Although it is unlikely that your new mother will be particularly energetic after giving birth, it may be a good idea to take her for a walk if she has the energy. This will help her stay calm during your visit to the veterinarian and will give her a chance to urinate and defecate. However, if the mother is weak, do not push her physically., Although it is sometimes advised to not feed your dog before going to the veterinarian, you should continue feeding the nursing mother dog regularly, regardless of the vet visit. Limiting the mother’s caloric intake during nursing will place an immense strain on her body. This could cause her to become ill or limit her milk production. For the health of the mother and the pups, make sure you continue to feed her normally.Because of the demands of nursing, the mother will likely eat much more than she did before the delivery. Ask your vet how much and what kind of food to feed your dog.

"
"
Restrain the animals.,
Bring treats.,
Minimize distractions.",How to Take a Mother Dog to a Postnatal Veterinary Exam3," If your dog is small enough, consider keeping it in a carrier with its pups. This will help keep it calm and prevent it from getting combative with any other pets. If your dog is too big for a carrier, keep it on a leash. Keep the puppies in a box, bin, or carrier for their protection and cover it with a blanket to keep them calm.A carrier may also make it easier to transport your dog and pups to the veterinarian.
Because the mother dog will be protective of her puppies, she may need to be removed during the check-up while the vet is handling the pups. If you can, have another adult attend the visit with you who can sit with your dog.

, During the visit, you should bring treats in order to reward your dog for good behavior. This will help you manage the mother’s behavior while she is in a particularly stressful situation. The veterinarian will also likely give the dog some treats during the checkup.


You may also want to bring along one of your dog’s favorite toys to play with.

, When you take the dogs to the veterinarian, try to limit the number of distractions your mother and pups encounter. If you have children, leave them at home. They may excite your mother dog or the cause the pups to become agitated. It may also be best to schedule a time to go to the veterinarian when it will not be too busy. A weekday morning or afternoon might be the ideal time to take the new mother and her pups to the vet.It is important to keep the pups calm. Once they begin to cry, the mother will become anxious and agitated.
Because it may be nearly impossible to avoid distractions, it may be easier to ask your veterinarian to make a house call.

"
Get to your appointment on time.,
Bring your dog’s medical records.,
Ask questions.,
Arrange follow-up visits.,
Know how to give your dog any treatments that are prescribed.",How to Take a Mother Dog to a Postnatal Veterinary Exam4," Try to be punctual for your appointment. Your dog will notice your stress if you are running late, which will increase its anxiety. However, you do not want to be too early and sit in the waiting room for an extended amount of time. This increases the likelihood that your vulnerable animals will catch some illness at the vet’s office.Try to get the clinic 10 to 15 minutes before your appointment.

, When you get to the veterinarian, make sure that you have your dog’s full health records. This includes all of its immunizations and past medical conditions. You should also be prepared to explain your dog’s diet. This is particularly important for gauging the health of your nursing mother dog.You should also let the staff know if your dog has a history of being aggressive. If your dog is aggressive, she may need to be restrained and/or muzzled.

, While the veterinarian is examining your animal, you should ask questions about the health of the mother and the pups. This is the time to bring out the list of questions that you wrote earlier. You should also ask the veterinarian questions in the moment and respond to their inquiries about the delivery and the health of the animals.Ask things like “When should I get the pups vaccinated?” “When should I spay the mother dog?” ""How can I keep the puppies healthy?"" ""When should I start transitioning the puppies to puppy food?"" ""What kind of puppy food should I feed them?"" ""Does my mother dog require additional walks?"" and ""How can I keep my dog's nipples healthy?""

, After the visit, you should arrange for follow-up visits. If your animals are in poor health, your vet may want to do a follow-up to see how they are doing. Your puppies will also need to get a series of vaccinations once they reach 6 weeks. In addition, unless you are a professional breeder, you will likely want to arrange to get the mother dog spayed. Talk with the veterinarian and the clinic staff about scheduling these appointments.Once your puppies reach 6 weeks, it is important that you get them immunized. A puppy’s immune system is particularly weak and vulnerable to a number of dangerous illnesses.

, If your vet does give your dog a medication, ask them how to administer it and how it will affect your dog. Find out when you should call the vet if you're having trouble getting your dog to take the medication and what side effects you should watch for.

Ask ""What's the best way to get my dog to take her medicine?"" ""How do I know that my dog's condition is worsening instead of improving?"" and ""Can my dog still nurse while she's taking the medication?""
Ask when to come in for a follow-up exam.

Contact your vet if there are whelping problems.",How to Predict when Your Dog Will Whelp Her Puppies," Progesterone is the hormone that maintains pregnancy. Its levels start to rise at ovulation (ovary releases an egg to be fertilized), become higher during pregnancy, then decrease shortly before whelping. When progesterone reaches a certain level in the blood, your vet will know your dog is ovulating and predict the whelping date.Your vet will take daily blood samples for several days to measure your dog’s progesterone levels.Whelping will take place about 62 to 64 days after progesterone levels indicate ovulation.When progesterone drops at the end of a dog’s pregnancy, whelping will likely occur in one to three days.;
, LH is the hormone that stimulates ovulation. Its blood levels will peak at ovulation, allowing your vet to predict when your dog will whelp. However, LH levels peak for only a short period of time, so it can be easy to miss this peak.Because the LH peak is so short, your vet may prefer to measure only progesterone levels.

, Diestrus is the phase of a female dog’s reproductive cycle when it is out of heat. It lasts about 57 days.To know when your dog is in diestrus, your vet will swab the inside of your dog’s vagina and look at the vaginal cells with a microscope.


Vaginal cells look different in each phase of a dog’s reproductive cycle. Once the cells indicate diestrus, your vet will predict that whelping will occur in about 57 days (give or take 3 days)., After your dog is 25 days pregnant, your vet will be able to see the puppy fetuses, and even detect their heartbeats, on an abdominal ultrasound.Using this information, your vet can estimate the number of days until your dog will whelp.

, Later in the pregnancy, between days 42 and 52, your vet will be able to see the fetuses on an x-ray. Before day 42, the fetuses’ bones are not developed enough to be seen on an x-ray.At this point in the pregnancy, your vet will predict that your dog will whelp in the next few weeks.

, A drop in body temperature is one of the most reliable clinical signs to use when predicting whelping. Your dog’s body temperature will drop below 99 degrees Fahrenheit/37 degrees Celsius approximately 8 to 24 hours before whelping.Starting on day 60 of your dog’s pregnancy, take her rectal temperature twice a day., Your dog will probably start acting differently at the end of her pregnancy. About one day before whelping, she may become restless, prefer to be by herself, and demonstrate nesting behavior.Nesting behavior is when a female starts building a nest or safe area to care for her babies.


Examples of nesting behavior in dogs are dragging papers and blankets to a quiet area.Your dog may also start panting the day before she whelps.Some dogs can become extra sweet and loving right before whelping, and others can become very irritable., Dogs that are within one day of whelping will typically start eating less. This does not happen with all dog breeds, though.Your dog may continue eating as usual the day before she whelps.

, One day before whelping, your dog’s vulva (external part of her reproductive system) will start to swell. It may also start leaking a clear mucus.You may want to put some extra blankets on your floor so the mucus does not get on your floors.

, Knowing when your dog will whelp is half the battle. You will also need to prepare for the whelping process. Prepare a whelping area an area in your home where your dog can comfortably give birth and nurse her puppies. This area should be warm, quiet, and secluded. This area should also have supplies:Rectal thermometer (and KY jelly to lubricate the thermometer)
Blankets
Gram scale to weigh the puppies
Heated whelping nest
Pen and paper to record notes about the puppies (weight, coat color, etc.) and mother
Puppy formula and feeding tubes for puppies that aren’t nursing on their own

, Most whelpings occur without complications and without need for human intervention. In fact, too much help from you make your dog nervous about giving birth. There may be times, though, when she will need your help with the whelping process:Tearing the placental membrane from the puppies’ mouth and nose, in case the mother is tired or inexperienced
Rubbing the puppies with a towel until they start breathing and crying
Using clean scissors to cut the umbilical cord to about 1/2 inch (1cm) from the puppy’s abdomen
Tying the end of the umbilical cord with a piece of clean thread

, If something doesn’t seem right about the whelping process, contact your vet as soon as possible. For example, call your vet if your dog is past her scheduled whelping date. Here are some other reasons to call your vet:Intense labor for 20 minutes, but a puppy hasn’t been delivered
The mother develops a fever (rectal temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit/39 degrees Celsius)
Bloody discharge from the mother’s vagina for 10 minutes
Green discharge coming from the vagina, but no puppies have been delivered

Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Give your dog antibiotics.,
Inquire about pain medication.,
Apply warm compresses.,
Drain the infected teat.,
Talk with your veterinarian about caring for the puppies.",How to Deal with Mastitis in Small Breed Dogs1," If you believe that your dog has mastitis, you should take it to your veterinarian immediately. Failure to treat mastitis properly can result in septic shock and the death of your dog. To avoid any serious complications, have a veterinarian check your dog right away.A serious infection can also lead to the development of gangrene and, eventually, a mastectomy.;
, Antibiotics are the most common course of treatment for dogs suffering from mastitis. In treating your dog, your veterinarian will likely give it an antibiotic injection at the clinic. Your vet will also prescribe a course of oral antibiotics that your dog will need to take daily for an extended period of time.Your veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics based on the results of bacterial cultures taken from your dog.
It is important that you give your dog the full course of antibiotics. Failure to give the full course can result in the return and intensification of the infection.
Some small breed dogs may develop diarrhea as a result of taking certain antibiotics., Because of the swelling and inflammation caused by the infection, you should ask your veterinarian about pain medications that you can give your dog. Your veterinarian may recommend an oral or a topical pain reliever. This will help your dog deal with the discomfort of the infection.A topical medication may also have some antiseptic properties to help clear out the infection.

, To ease the pain and discomfort of mastitis, your veterinarian may also recommend applying warm compresses. Your veterinarian may give your some warm packs from the clinic. You can also make your own using a warm, wet towel or a warm plastic bag of water.Apply a warm compress to the teat four times a day.
Make sure that the compress is not so hot that it burns the dog. Test it on your own skin before applying it to the dog.

, Your veterinarian may instruct you to drain the infected teat regularly of blood, pus, and milk. Holding it between your forefinger and thumb, gently squeeze on the infected teat and drain any infected discharge. This will help clear up the infection and alleviate some of the pain your dog is experiencing. However, this is only an option if your dog is not experiencing intense pain that leads to aggression.Do not try draining your dog’s teat unless instructed to do so by your veterinarian.
If your dog growls, whimpers, or snaps at you when you touch its teat, you should avoid draining.

, Depending on the severity of the infection and the type of bacteria present, your veterinarian may decide that your dog should stop nursing the puppies. In that case, the vet will likely recommend a nutritional supplement to give to the puppies. You should also prepare to wean the puppies.If your dog can still nurse, your veterinarian will recommend antibiotics and pain medications that will not limit the puppies’ ability to nurse.
In certain instances, letting the puppies nurse on the infected teat will help clear up the mastitis.
Some infections could be transferred to the puppies from the infected teat.

Several strategies are available to determine when a C-section should take place. One strategy is measuring LH, a hormone that stimulates ovulation (egg released from the ovary).Peak LH levels mark the beginning of pregnancy, which lasts an average of 65 days in a dog.Your vet will measure your dog’s LH levels for several days to determine when they peak. Your vet will schedule the C-section about 65 days after the LH peak.The LH peak will last 24 hours or less.Your vet will take a blood sample to measure LH.;
, Progesterone helps your dog maintain its pregnancy. Its levels start to rise at around the same time as LH levels peak.Progesterone levels also help determine when to schedule a dog's C-section. Your vet will measure progesterone for a few days to determine when levels indicate ovulation.


Your vet will take a blood sample to measure progesterone.

, In addition to measuring blood hormone levels, your vet can also look at vaginal cells to estimate the date of the C-section. When the cells indicate your dog is in diestrus (out of heat), your dog will be ready for the C-section in about 57 days.Diestrus lasts about 57 days., Between days 25 to 35 of your dog's pregnancy, your vet can use ultrasound to look at the fetuses and determine when to perform the C-section, within about three days of variability.Remember that, with any of these strategies, there will be at least a day or two of variability for determining the best day for the C-section.

, When your vet determines when the C-section should be performed, mark the date on your calendar and make the appointment. Knowing the C-section date at the beginning of your dog’s pregnancy will help you plan for a successful surgical procedure.

, In the days leading up to the C-section, you can do a few things to help your dog prepare for the procedure. For example, you can give your dog a bath. This will get your dog nice and clean before the C-section.Because of the pregnant belly, you will need to be careful when bathing your dog. Be gentle when moving your dog around.
Be especially careful with bathing your dog's belly.
If your dog resists being bathed, don’t force the bath. Forcing the bath could cause your dog to be stressed, which could be bad for the puppies. The stress could also make it harder for your brachycephalic dog to breathe, causing even more stress.

, As you prepare for your dog’s C-section, keep a close eye on it. Even though the C-section has already been scheduled, you should still watch your dog for signs that it’s getting close to whelping (giving birth) time. Signs to look for include:Nipples getting larger and possibly leaking milk (1 to 2 weeks prior)
Restlessness, wanting to be alone, making a ‘nest’ (12 to 24 hours prior)
Body temperature below 99 degrees Fahrenheit/37 degrees Celsius (8 to 24 hours prior)

, Your dog can have food the night before the C-section, but not on the day of the procedure.An empty stomach will prevent your dog from regurgitating and possibly breathing stomach contents into its lungs by accident.


Your dog can probably have water on the day of surgery.
Your vet will give you instructions on when your dog should stop eating and drinking water before the C-section.

, Even though your brachycephalic dog will not be giving birth naturally, it will still need an area in your home to nurse and raise its puppies after the C-section. This area should be warm and away from other pets and household members. Before the C-section, place supplies in this area:Rectal thermometer
Heated whelping nest (look for one online or at your local pet store)
Puppy scale
Notebook to record puppies’ weights and body temperatures, and other notes
Feeding tube, for puppies that are not nursing well
Tincture of iodine to care for the puppies’ umbilical cords

, In the days leading up to the C-section, organize supplies to take with you to the vet's office. These supplies will prepare you for taking the mother dog and its puppies back home after the C-section:Large crate for the mother dog
Blankets and towels
Large sheet or piece of tarp to cover the back seat
Laundry basket to hold the puppies
Heating pad

, About one to two days before the end of your dog’s pregnancy, its progesterone levels will drop back down.When the progesterone drops to a certain level, it will be time to perform the C-section. Before the scheduled C-section date, take your dog to your vet so they can measure its progesterone levels."

Observe swelling and discoloration in the teats.,
Look for a discharge of blood and pus.,
Recognize a loss of appetite.,
Notice a change in attitude.,
Check for a fever.",How to Deal with Mastitis in Small Breed Dogs2," One of the most recognizable indicators of mastitis is the development of a hard lump under the infected teat that causes it to be swollen and distended. This swelling is accompanied by a red discoloration of the teat. When compared to the dog’s healthy teats, this physical change is very noticeable., Once your dog has developed mastitis, it will begin producing blood and pus through the infected teat. You may notice this discharge by gently squeezing your dog’s teat between your forefinger and thumb. Depending on the severity of the infection, you may also notice that milk comes out with the blood and pus.If the teat only produces blood and pus, it is seriously infected and needs immediate medical attention.

, One of the early indications that something is wrong with your dog is a general loss of appetite. If you notice that your dog is not eating as much as it normally does, it is likely feeling ill. If your dog is nursing, this is problematic because it will quickly become malnourished. If you notice a loss of appetite in your nursing dog, take it to the veterinarian immediately.Although this symptom is not unique to mastitis, it is important that you have your veterinarian check your dog if you notice a loss of appetite.

, Because of the infection, your dog will be listless and less energetic than normal. Your dog may also become increasingly aggressive due to the pain of the infection. If you notice a significant change in your dog’s attitude, take it to the doctor and have it checked out., If you notice a general change in your dog’s behavior, you should check its temperature. If it is running a fever, it may have developed an infection. If your dog has a high temperature, contact your veterinarian.The normal temperature range for a dog is 99.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 to 39.2 degrees Celsius)."

Wash its bedding regularly, especially if any bodily fluids or foreign substances get on it. Be sure to clean the floors and surfaces of your dog’s living space regularly to prevent a bacterial infection., Once your dog starts lactating, check its teats every day. Look for signs of redness, swelling, or abnormal discharge. These may be indications that your dog has developed an infection., Because puppies can claw at their mother’s teats as they nurse, you will want to clip their toenails to prevent mastitis. Scratches or cuts from the puppies’ nails can become infected, resulting in mastitis. Be sure to groom your puppy properly to prevent the spread of infectious disease., Since mastitis is associated with lactating dogs, preventing pregnancy is also effective at preventing mastitis. Therefore, consider getting your dog spayed."

Make sure that the mother's nipples are used equally.,
Cover nipples between feedings.,
Feed the mother dog properly.,
Apply warm compresses.",How to Treat Mother Dogs with Sore or Infected Nipples1," In order for nipples to stay in good shape, they should be used but not abused.A nipple that is overused can get irritated and sore rather quickly. To help alleviate this soreness and help the nipple recover, make sure the puppies are using all nipples equally.


However, a nipple should not be completely abandoned indefinitely. They need to be used to avoid an infection in the ducts.
Positioning puppies away from a sore nipple can be difficult. You will need to keep a close eye on the puppies and mother at all times.;
, If your mother dog is crawled on and active with her puppies between feedings, her nipples may be getting irritated unnecessarily. Instead of letting this occur, try putting a dog shirt or sweater on the mother between feedings in order to protect her nipples.


This will allow the mother to remain with her puppies while not allowing them to injure her further.
Remember that you will need to remove the clothing off the mother dog for the puppies' feedings.

, If a mother dog is not fed properly she will not produce enough milk for her puppies.In turn, as the puppies try to get milk that is not there, they will irritate the mother dog's nipples more and more.


If your mother dog is getting irritated nipples, you should assess the mother's nutrition, as well as the development of the puppies. This can help you determine if the mother is producing enough milk.

, If your mother dog's nipples are irritated, a warm compress may ease some of her discomfort. Make sure that the compresses are not too hot, as this can burn the dog's nipples and injure her further.Do not apply lotions or ointments. While it can be tempting to apply something to soothe the mother's nipples, anything you apply to them will go straight into the puppies' systems. With this in mind, avoid introducing a foreign chemical into the puppies' bodies even if you are just trying to ease the discomfort of the mother.

Offer stimulating toys.",How to Make Sure That Your Dog Is Ok After Giving Birth," Make sure she's clean of any trace of blood, placental fluid, or fecal matter. Good hygiene reduces the risk of bacterial infection following birth.


You may see leaking fluids, called lochia, for several weeks after giving birth. These fluids are natural and normal, resulting from the shedding of your dog's uterine lining. Healthy lochia should be odorless, and may range in color from greenish-brown to blood-red. If your dog hasn't licked her pups clean within a few minutes of birth, you should wipe the puppies' face and nostrils with a damp, clean cloth to remove the placental sac. Give the pup back to its mother immediately.
If your dog appears uninterested in cleaning her new pups, you may need to rub them with a clean cloth to stimulate breathing.;
, You may want to take your dog outside for a pee and/or poop while another person replaces bedding with clean, dry cloths.


Continue to replace soiled bedding regularly, ensuring that the area remains clean.
Keep a stash of clean bedding near your whelping box for easy access.

, Your dog may sleep for several hours following the birth, while her pups nurse or sleep. When she wakes, she should appear alert and interested in her new puppies.


If your dog doesn't appear interested in her new pups, this may be a sign of infection.Check her for other signs of distress, such as whining, dilated eyes, or foul-smelling discharge. If these are present, contact your veterinarian immediately.
Though your dog may sleep more than usual, you should be attentive to any signs of discomfort or restlessness.

,


If your dog doesn't want to drink water, try offering her chicken broth.

, Although she may sleep more than usual, when she's awake she should appear bright-eyed. Your dog should have a good appetite.Feed your dog several meals a day, rather than one or two larger ones. You can increase her food intake several weeks prior to the birth, and continue for several weeks following birth. It's not unusual for a nursing dog to consume 3-4 times her regular amount of food.Many veterinarians encourage feeding puppy food to your dog during this time for its higher caloric value. This may need to be introduced gradually with your dog's regular food for best results.
Include special treats to whet your dog's appetite. Consider offering cottage cheese, eggs, liver or other nutrition-packed delicacies.
Make sure your dog always has easy access to fresh water. Add chicken broth to your dog's dry kibble to help supplement your dog's liquid intake.

, Your dog may have a slightly elevated temperature in the first 24-48 hours following birth. A rise in temperature is normal, and should not be accompanied by signs of illness.


Signs of infection in dogs include: restlessness, disinterest in puppies, foul-smelling discharge.If you notice any of these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately.

, Normal nursing glands, or nipples, should be soft and enlarged from milk production. If the glands are hard or red, this may indicate presence of infection.


If your dog appears to be avoiding nursing her pups, check her mammary glands for signs of infection. Mastitis is a bacterial infection of the nursing glands, and easily treated with antibiotics. Contact your veterinarian for assistance.
You can easily check your dog's nursing glands by squeezing them. If your dog reacts with pain to your touch, or if you notice that the nipple is hard and/or hot to the touch, this is likely an indication of infection.
Your dog's milk should be white and smooth, with no signs of clotting. Signs of mastitis include coloration of the milk (usually pinkish or yellow)

, Metritis is inflammation of the uterus, and may be a result of an undelivered placenta or an experience of trauma during delivery.


Signs of metritis include: fever, foul-smelling discharge, loss of appetite or decreased interest in puppies.
If you notice signs of metritis, seek veterinary assistance immediately.

, Eclampsia (""milk fever"") is a result of depleted calcium, and can result in muscle spasms, seizures and death.

Signs of eclampsia include: restlessness, muscle tremors, and weakness.If you notice signs of eclampsia, seek veterinary assistance immediately.

, For the first week, she will spend most of her time with them. A healthy dog will be interested in her puppies, and happy to have them nurse.


Ensure the puppies have a clean, safe place to nurse. Make sure bedding is clean and dry. Move the whelping box out of high traffic areas.
Keep the whelping box warm. Ideally, the temperature should be around 85 degrees Fahrenheit for the puppies' first week. If your home is warmer than that, bring in a fan to keep the puppies cool. In cooler weather, bring a heating unit nearby to make sure the new pups are kept warm.
Clip the puppies' nails to prevent them from scratching their mother.

, Within the third week, puppies will start to be able to lap liquids. When this occurs, they can start to be weaned. Offer milk replacement for one meal per day. This will help teach them to ""lap"" liquids, as well as supplementing their nutritional intake. After two days of this, begin to mix milk replacement together with puppy food to create a very mushy meal.


Continue to gradually increase the amount of solid food over time. The texture of the food should go from soup to Cream-of-Wheat to oatmeal within about a week's time.
Puppies will continue to nurse as they are weaned. By week 6, they should be offered soft, moist food as well as puppy kibble. Puppies should be completely weaned by week 8.

, Puppies will be increasingly aware of their surroundings beginning in the third week. They will start to develop teeth, and the need to chew. You can help them by providing toys to focus their attention, and stimulate their play skills.


Start to accustom the puppies to the sounds of everyday life. Bring in new people, one at a time, to play with the pups. Turn on your household radio near the puppies for 5 minutes at a time.

Don't expect her to eat right away.",How to Keep a Mother Dog Healthy Postpartum," After birth, you need to do a bit of cleaning up. Take out anything that was soiled by the birthing process. Put in fresh, clean bedding for the pups and the mother, as that will help decrease her chance of developing an infection., You should also make sure the mother is clean and dry. Wipe up any fluids on the mother you see using a warm cloth, and gently pat her dry. Doing so will also reduce her risk of developing an infection later., Within the first day or so, it's a good idea to take the mother and puppies to the vet for a checkup. The vet can check the puppies and sex them, but more importantly, the vet will be able to check the mother and make sure everything is okay with her health and well-being following the birth., Your dog will be dehydrated and tired after giving birth, and she'll need plenty of water to help her recover and to start producing milk for her puppies. Therefore, make sure she has access to fresh water at all times while nursing., When a dog gives birth and is nursing puppies, she's going to need to eat often and well, though it may take her a day or two become interested in food again after giving birth. You don't need to limit what she eats at all. If she's hungry, let her eat. Try a food designed for dogs who are nursing, as that will provide the high-quality nutrients she needs.If she doesn't show much interest in food even after a day or two, take her to the see the vet, as that could be a sign that something is wrong., Your dog may be reluctant to leave her puppies after giving birth, particularly in the first day. You may need to encourage her to go outside to take care of business. Nonetheless, if she is very reluctant, it may be better to wait a bit., It's natural for the mother to continue to have drainage from her vaginal area for a few weeks. However, that drainage should be brownish, greenish/blackish, or red, and you shouldn't smell much. Pay attention if it changes to pale or gray discharge, particularly if it is thick and has a bad odor. That could indicate an infection, and she should be seen by a vet., Her teats can also develop infection, so it's important to keep an eye on them after she gives birth. Look for swelling, redness, irritation, and pain. Also, the milk should flow freely, and it should be white, not yellow, red, or green.If you notice these symptoms, you should take your dog to the vet immediately, as it indicates an infection called mastitis.

, Another problem dogs are in danger of developing after giving birth is a condition called eclampsia, where the dog's body is not pulling enough calcium from the bones to keep up with the demand of milk. In turn, the mother doesn't get the calcium she needs to survive, though usually it doesn't affect the puppies. This condition is particularly common in smaller breeds, and it usually develops in the first month or so after giving birth.Symptoms of eclampsia include strange behaviors from your dog, such as loss of interest in her puppies, disorientation, and nervousness.
Your dog may also whine, pant rapidly, and have stomach problems. She may also have a fever.
It will begin to affect her muscles, so she'll walk funny. She may have tremors. About 8 hours after symptoms she begin, she may lay on the floor with her legs extended straight out in front of her.
Visit a vet if you see these symptoms.

, Some panting after birth is to be expected. For one, the mother is tired. Plus, it may be connected to the contracting of the uterus after birth, as well as other pains she's having. Also, having the puppies and blankets around can make her warm, all leading to more panting.As long as she's not panting all the time and she seems healthy, panting shouldn't cause you too much concern.

, Mother dogs often develop diarrhea after giving birth, which can be due to the fact that they eat the placentas. It can also be due to stress. Either way, your dog may have loose stools for a bit. You can feed her a bit of pure pumpkin puree to help., While your dog will need to replenish her energy stores, she'll be very tired after giving birth. In other words, she may not want to eat for a day or two, so don't worry too much if she doesn't seem that hungry."

Identify infections.,
Take the mother dog to a veterinarian.,
Treat the infection.,
Care for the puppies in the mother's absence.",How to Treat Mother Dogs with Sore or Infected Nipples2," There are several types of infections that a nursing dog can get that can affect nursing. One of the most common is mastitis, which is an infection of the milk ducts. This occurs due to blocked milk ducts or swelling in the teat.Signs that the mother dog has mastitis include:


Lethargy
Fever
Lack of appetite
Firm and swollen teats
Puss coming from nipples
Refusal to let puppies nurse
Failure of puppies to grow

, Don't assume that the infection will go away on its own. If you leave even a slight a nipple infection to clear up on its own it can become a very serious infection.The veterinarian will ask you about the dog's symptoms and he or she will do a physical exam to assess the mother dog's health.Remember that getting veterinary care is important for the health of the mother dog and the health of the puppies.

, It is likely that the veterinarian will suggest putting the mother dog on antibiotics to clear up the infection. Additionally, the infected area may need to be opened and drained if the infection is severe.In the case of a mild case of mastitis, the vet may suggest applying warm compresses to the teats four to six times a day.
A mother dog with a serious infection will go on antibiotics but may need additional care at the veterinary office. If the infection has spread to other places in her body or is causing her system to shut down she may need to be put on an I.V. and watched by veterinary professionals.
Discuss the fact that the antibiotics will be passed on to the puppies when discussing the treatment with your veterinarian. This may affect the type and quantity of antibiotics used.

, If the mother dog cannot nurse her puppies, then you will need to provide them with food. There are formulas made specifically for new born puppies that can be bought at most pet stores or online. You will also need to keep the puppies warm, as the mother gives them a lot of body heat.


New born puppies need to be fed every two to three hours around the clock. This means that nursing them will be a big job for you to take on.

"
"
Make sure all nipples are used for nursing.,
Keep the mother's nipples clean.,
Look for signs of sore nipples.,
Look for trauma on the nipples.",How to Treat Mother Dogs with Sore or Infected Nipples3," It is good for the mother dog if her puppies nurse on all of the nipples. This will spread the wear on the nipples around equally and will use all of her mammary glands, which reduces the risk of her ducts getting blocked.If necessary, move the puppies around while they are nursing to use all of the mother's nipples. Puppies may naturally be drawn to certain nipples, especially the ones that give more milk, so you will need to intervene if you are concerned with the chance of an infection.

, Poor hygiene can promote infections and irritation of the nipples. If the mother is not adequately cleaning her nipples after nursing, then you should assist her.If you see the mother licking her nipples after nursing, then she is taking care of the nipple hygiene herself.
If she is not licking the nipples after nursing, you can use a warm, clean, damp cloth to wipe down the area. This should feel good to the mother dog in addition to keeping her nipples clean.

, If a mother dog is beginning to get sore nipples you should help alleviate the discomfort before they become really sore or infected. Look for signs that the mother is hesitant to let her puppies nurse. Also, inspect the mothers nipples for unusual redness or sensitivity.


If you see that a nipple is getting red and sensitive, try to keep puppies off of it for a feeding cycle. Apply a warm, moist compress to the nipple and make sure the nipple is clean. Then you can let the puppies back on it.

, Infections and irritation can be caused by trauma the puppies inflict while they are nursing. This is especially a risk factor once the puppies begin getting their baby teeth.If you see trauma on a nipple, such as a small cut, try to persuade the puppies to nurse from another nipple. Treat the nipple trauma under the direction of a veterinarian, as anything you apply to the nipple could be passed on to the puppies.

"
"
Look for bleeding.,
Pay attention to the rate of stomach growth.,
Assess whether the dog has risk factors or medical issues that could cause miscarriage.,
Get an ultrasound or X-rays.",How to Know if a Pregnant Dog Has Reabsorbed the Fetus1," The most common symptom of a miscarriage is bleeding from the vagina. This bleeding can be slight or dramatic, depending on how big the fetus was and how many fetus' were miscarried.Even bleeding may be hard to spot, as many dogs will clean up the blood themselves before you spot it. However, if you know your dog is pregnant, keep an eye out for bloody discharge.;
, If your dog is pregnant, its belly should grow at the puppies develop. If the belly of your pregnant dog is not growing, it may have lost one or all of its puppies.


A dog that has lost a pregnancy may even lose weight instead of gaining it.The usual gestational period of a dog is 63 days.Your pregnant dog's belly should grow dramatically during this time.

, There are some reasons that your dog may miscarry. If your dog has any of these issues, then it is more likely that she may have miscarried. Some factors that may induce a miscarriage include:Infectious diseases, such as Salmonella, Brucella canis, canine Herpes, Parvovirus, or Toxoplasma.
Trauma
Uterine infection
Hormonal problems
Medications that promote miscarriage, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, chloramphenicol, oestrogen, or high dose steroids

, If you suspect that your dog may have lost a fetus, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Your veterinarian may elect to do an X-ray or ultrasound exam to look at the fetus' developing in the dog.If your dog has already had an X-ray or ultrasound to document the pregnancy, you should be able to assess whether all of the fetus' that were in the uterus are still present.

Take your dog to see a veterinarian.,
Feel for puppies in the womb.,
Consider if your dog may have been mated.,
See if your dog adopts inanimate objects or other dogs' puppies.,
Watch for nesting behavior.,
Pay attention to changes in appetite.,
Watch for vomiting.,
Look for signs of milk production.,
Keep an eye out for abdominal contractions.,
Think about when the symptoms began.,
Know when to take your dog to the vet.,
Ask your veterinarian for help treating severe symptoms of false pregnancy.",How to Identify a False Pregnancy in Dogs," If your dog is displaying symptoms of pregnancy, the best thing to do is to take her to see a vet and find out if she is pregnant or not. Your dog’s vet can perform an ultrasound to check for puppies in the womb, a blood test to confirm a pregnancy, and a physical exam.If your dog is not pregnant, but is displaying signs of pregnancy, then it is likely that she is experiencing the symptoms of a false pregnancy.
If you do not wish for your dog to become pregnant, talk to your veterinarian about a spaying procedure. This will eliminate the possibility of pregnancy and prevent your dog from experiencing false pregnancy symptoms as well.;
, If your dog is actually pregnant, then you may be able to feel her puppies in the womb. It is important to be gentle when you feel for the puppies because too much pressure can hurt them. If you have never done this before, then ask your veterinarian for a demonstration first.Between the 28th and 35th days of a dog’s pregnancy, you should be able to feel the puppies in your dog’s womb. They will feel like walnuts.In the last two weeks of a pregnancy, you may actually be able to see the puppies moving in the womb.

, Since the symptoms of false and actual pregnancies are very similar, ask yourself whether there's a possibility that your dog could be pregnant. Think whether she was left unattended in the yard while in her fertile phase, or if she spent time in the company of unneutered male dogs during her fertile phase. If so, then she had the opportunity to mate and could actually be pregnant.If your dog hasn't been exposed to other dogs during her fertile cycle, it's unlikely she's pregnant. For example, if she lives in an apartment with no other dogs, toilets on puppy pads, is always leash walked and never left unattended, then pregnancy is not likely.

, Adopting an inanimate object is the most common behavioral change that your dog will show during a false pregnancy. This adoption (also called surrogate mothering) of objects like toys can make your dog protective or possessive. She may go so far as to collect bedding and nesting materials for the objects.During the later stages of the false pregnancy, your dog may also try to adopt another dog's puppy as her own. When you try to take the puppy or object away, your dog might seem excessively restless and anxious.

, Nesting behavior is a very common phenomena when a dog believes she is pregnant. You may notice your dog preparing a safe and secure place for a puppy. She'll try to accumulate her favorite items, water bowls, blankets, and newspapers in order to make a comfortable nest. Your dog might also carry some playing toys to the nest for the puppies she thinks will be born.


Your dog might groom more often than normal and change her behavior. For example, if your dog is normally outgoing, she may become quiet and withdrawn. If she's normally aloof, she may become more dependent and needy. She may also seem nervous and aggressive., Your dog may become very hungry, as though she's building herself up to prepare for feeding a litter. This will cause noticeable weight gain. Or, your dog might lose her appetite because she feels nauseous. Watch for either of these changes in appetite.Some dogs will also take treats and save them in their beds, rather than immediately eat them.
Many dogs with false pregnancies will also drink more water, which causes them to relieve themselves more often.

, Some dogs develop morning sickness as part of pregnancy and this may be a symptoms of a false pregnancy as well. If you notice that your dog is vomiting after eating and is not otherwise sick, then this may be a symptom of a false pregnancy.Appetite changes may also be part of your dog's symptoms. If you notice that your dog is eating more or less than usual, this may be due to a false pregnancy.

, Even though your dog might not actually be pregnant, the fluctuating hormones can cause changes in the mammary glands. The glands will be engorged and swollen. They might even produce milk to the extent that you can see milk leaking from her mammary glands. To check, press the tit of the mammary gland.Sometimes milk production may be more rapid than usual if an adopted puppy is stimulating her mammary glands.

, In the later stages of a false pregnancy, your dog may show mock labor and intense abdominal contractions. It may look exactly as if she's trying to deliver a pup. Along with abdominal contractions, she may show other common symptoms during a false pregnancy., Fluctuating hormone levels are thought to be the cause of false pregnancy in dogs. The hormone progesterone rises when your dog is at the end of her fertile cycle to prepare her for the implantation of fertilized eggs, whether she's pregnant or not. After 4 weeks, the levels will keep rising if she's pregnant, or will fall if she isn't. When the levels fall, another hormone may be released (prolactin) which makes your dog think she's pregnant. Prolactin is what causes the symptoms associated with a false pregnancy., Symptoms of false pregnancy will usually go away within three weeks, but if your dog shows them for longer, you may want to take her to the vet. The vet will clinically examine your dog and take any mating possibilities into account to confirm a case of false pregnancy. Other diseases, like late pregnancy, can also be ruled out. If your vet is unsure of a diagnosis, an ultrasound or radiographic test can confirm the condition.The vet may also order repeated blood tests to look at your dog's progesterone levels. Your vet will watch for falling hormones to determine if it is a false pregnancy., If a false pregnancy is causing your dog to be distressed, the vet may recommend treatment to reduce the severity of false pregnancy symptoms. In extreme cases, your dog may be tranquilized to relieve anxious behavior and agitation.Your vet may also recommend a cone to prevent your dog from licking herself to induce nursing."

Be prepared for the fact the dog may need a C-section.,
Wipe up the dog after she gives birth.,
Take her to the vet within a day of giving birth.,
Watch for low calcium.,
Look for signs of infection.",How to Promote Safe Whelping for Short Legged Dog Breeds," Because short-legged dogs are more likely to have problems, getting an x-ray done before she gives birth is a good idea. You'll know how many puppies she's going to have, so you'll be able to keep an eye on her while giving birth. Plus, if she's having a large puppy, your vet can go ahead and schedule a c-section if they think it's necessary., Throughout her pregnancy, it's important to feed the dog a high quality dog food, with about a third protein and 17 percent fat. It should provide about 1 to 1.8 percent calcium and 0.8 to 1.6 percent phosphorous to help her develop milk later.Ideally, the carbohydrates in the food should be low in fiber to make them more easily digestible. Similarly, the protein should be one that's easy to digest.
Often, a puppy food has the right balance, such as Hill's Science Diet Puppy Food; however, don't use a large breed formula.Often a food labelled ""performance"" or ""active"" will be a good choice.Slowly increase the amount of food she receives throughout her pregnancy. By about 5 weeks, she should have about 10 percent more, and by the time she is giving birth, she should have 15 to 25 percent more than she normally does.

, If the dog goes past her due date by a few days (usually after 63 days from breeding), consider taking the dog back to the vet. She may be having problems, and the vet will be able to tell by examining her., Short-legged dogs and other small dogs are more likely to have problems with giving birth. Therefore, it's a good idea to keep an eye on the time when they start giving birth. That is, once you start noticing signs of contractions, you should take note of the time. If they haven't given birth to a puppy in two hours, it's time to talk to the vet.Similarly, if you know how many puppies the dog is supposed to have, and the dog goes two hours between puppies, you should talk to your vet again. It's natural for dogs to take a break while whelping, but it shouldn't be more than two hours or so. If it's been more than four hours, go ahead and take the dog into the vet.At two hours, try taking your dog for a walk if she'll come. Sometimes, walking outside will help get the process going.

, You may need to give your dog assistance if she's having trouble, particularly if you can see a puppy's head that seems stuck. If she's been straining (having contractions every few minutes) for more than thirty minutes, you can see if you can help her get the puppy out.Put on latex gloves first, and then find a lubricant like KY Jelly. Rub it on your fingertips.
Check the dog's vulva for a puppy's head. Stick your fingers in, rubbing the lubricant around the puppy's head. Grasp the puppy, and move it back and forth to help it come out. You can also use a catheter-tipped syringe with some lubricant if your fingers won't fit.
You can also wrap a piece of tissue or washcloth around the puppy's head to help gently pull it out., Some discharge is natural while giving birth. However, if your dog is bleeding for more than ten minutes, you need to talk to your vet. Similarly, if you see a green fluid issuing from your dog (and you haven't seen puppies yet), you need to talk to the vet., If your dog seems especially lethargic, that could be a bad sign. Similarly, a fever above 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) could also mean trouble. Talk to your vet if you notice these signs., Short-legged dogs, including many dwarf breeds, need C-sections more often than other dogs because of their diminutive size. Your vet may recommend one right off the bat, but you should also look for signs your dog may need help.For instance, if while giving birth your dog is straining (having contractions every 30 seconds or so) for 30 minutes or more without giving birth to a puppy, that's a sign that she may need some help. You should at least call the vet to see what they suggest., It can help to wipe up the dog with a damp cloth after she finishes giving birth, and then pat her dry. Also, change the bedding after she gives birth, providing fresh blankets for her and the pups., It's a good idea to take your dog to the vet within a day of giving birth. That way, the vet can look for early signs of infection. They can also check out the puppies to make sure everything is okay., Small dogs, including short-legged dogs, are more prone to low calcium than other dogs, a condition that can develop after giving birth. You may notice your dog walking with a stiff gait, or she may have muscle tremors. A fever is also common, as well as nervousness or disorientation.You may also notice that your dog lays on her side with her legs straight out.
If you notice these symptoms, take your dog to a vet.

, While infection doesn't just affect short-legged dogs, you should still keep an eye out for it. Generally, dogs will develop infection in their uterus or teats, if they are going to develop an infection. Watching for symptoms can help increase your chances of catching it early.Uterine infections usually show up in a change in discharge. Some discharge after birth is common, but it should be green, black, brown, or red. If you notice it's pale or gray in color, she could have an infection. You also shouldn't notice much of a smell, and it should flow freely, not be thick.
In her teats, you may notice swelling and redness, as well as increased pain. Her milk may change from white to green, yellow, or red, and grow thicker if she has an infection. Take her to the vet if you suspect an infection.

Bring her in again about 30 days into the pregnancy.If the pregnancy wasn’t planned, take her to the vet as soon as you find out she’s pregnant.


If you plan to breed your dog, it’s recommended that you wait until she’s at least 24 months old. By that point she will be mature enough for any relevant medical problems to become apparent.
Some dog breeds may be prone to genetic conditions like dental problems, dislocating patellas, hip dysplasia, spine problems, allergies, heart conditions, and/or behavioral problems. It’s important to be aware of these conditions before breeding your dog.;
, Unless directly instructed by your vet, you should not give your dog medications unsafe for pregnancy. You also shouldn’t have her vaccinated.Your dog should have been vaccinated before she became pregnant so she can pass the antibodies on to her pups. But if not, don’t vaccinate her while pregnant, as some vaccines can be harmful to developing fetuses.
If using flea control, be sure to use a product that’s safe for use on pregnant dogs.
Do make sure that your dog is on a deworming program. An untreated mother can pass on roundworms, hookworms, or heartworms to her puppies.

, The average gestation period for a dog is between 58 and 68 days. Try to accurately pinpoint when conception occurred so you can anticipate labor accordingly.


By 45 days into the pregnancy, your vet can use x-rays to detect the number of puppies in the litter.
You may also notice nesting behavior and a tendency to want to withdraw or retreat; this is normal and to be expected.

, Most pregnant dogs who are not overweight should eat puppy food during the last third to the last half of pregnancy.


Puppy food typically has more calories than regular adult food, which the mother will need in order to pass on nutrition to the fetuses.
Do not supplement her diet with extra calcium unless instructed by your veterinarian. Milk fever, or eclampsia, is common for small breed dogs a few weeks after giving birth. It’s more likely to occur if the mother receives an over-supplementation of calcium during pregnancy.

, The vet will be able to count the number of puppies in the litter using x-rays by 45 days into the pregnancy.


If your dog is a large breed like a German shepherd or Labrador, as many as 10 puppies is common.
If your dog is a small breed like a Chihuahua or Shih Tzu, 3 or 4 puppies in a litter would be plenty.
If the vet can see only one or two puppies, it may pose problems at the time of birth. Fewer puppies mean the puppies will be larger and may be too big to pass through the birth canal naturally. In such cases, a planned C-section is often the best option.
Though a planned C-section will be more costly, it will still be cheaper than an emergency C-section. So plan ahead.

, About a week before your dog is due to begin labor, set up a nesting box in a quiet, private area where she can go to give birth.


Help your dog feel comfortable by setting up a cozy box in an area away from other pets.
A box or kiddy pool with bedding like clean old towels or blankets works well.

, As soon as you know your dog’s pregnant, whether it was planned or not, begin arranging for homes for the puppies.


If you aren’t able to find homes for all the puppies, be prepared to keep them yourself until you can find them a home. Thousands of dogs end up in over-crowded shelters because irresponsible owners breed their dogs without providing homes for the puppies. Don’t be part of the problem.
Prepare to live with puppies for at least 8 weeks before they leave your house for new homes. In certain states like California, it’s illegal to adopt out a puppy younger than 8 weeks of age.
To ensure the puppies go to good homes, have an application process and ask questions of the interested parties. It’s also a good idea to charge a modest amount for each puppy. This ensures the interested parties are serious about and committed to adopting the puppy.

, Newborn puppies will need to eat every 2-4 hours around the clock. Have formula on hand in case a puppy has trouble nursing.


You can buy puppy formula at most pet supply stores.

, To protect the mother and her puppies from contracting illness or disease like canine herpes, confine her away from all other dogs in the three weeks leading up to her expected delivery date.It’s also highly advisable to keep the mother away from other dogs for three weeks following the delivery.

, There will be several signs to help you anticipate when labor is imminent; watch for them so you can be prepared when your dog enters labor.


Her teats will appear enlarged when your dog is close to giving birth because her milk is coming in. This can happen within a few days or as labor begins, so watch closely.
The vulva will start to get more relaxed a few days before labor.
The dog’s temperature will also drop a degree or so about 24 hours before labor. Take her temperature every morning for the last week or two of pregnancy to get an idea of her normal temperature. To take her temperature, lubricate a rectal thermometer and insert it about half an inch. Leave the thermometer in for about three minutes to get an accurate reading. Her normal temperature will likely range between 101 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. When you notice a drop of a degree or more, it’s a likely sign she’ll go into labor in 24 hours or less.
In the early stages of labor, your dog may pant, whimper, move around as though uncomfortable, or hide. She will probably not want to eat, but be sure to offer her water, though she may also not drink.

, When she has a contraction, it will be easy to identify--it will appear as a sort of wave across her belly.


If you see contractions and suspect she is in labor, let her have access to her nesting area and monitor her from afar. Many dogs will give birth during the night to have ultimate privacy. You don’t need to hover, but you should start paying attention to the timing of contractions and the delivery of puppies.

, Again, observe from a respectful distance and don’t intervene unless necessary.


You will notice her contractions become more frequent and/or pronounced as she gets closer to delivery. She may stand up, which is fine--don’t try to force her to lie down.

, As she begins to deliver the puppies, keep a close eye on each birth and watch for warning signs of problems.


The puppies may be born either tail or head first; both are normal.
She may yelp or whimper as the pup comes out, which is to be expected. But if your dog appears to be in extreme or abnormal pain, call your veterinarian immediately.
Usually, a pup will appear every thirty minutes or so, after ten to thirty minutes of forceful straining (though she may go as long as four hours between pups). Call your veterinarian If no pup appears within 30-60 minutes of hard contractions. Also call your vet if it’s been over four hours since the last delivery and you know there are still unborn puppies.

, Keep an eye on each pup after it’s born and watch for signs of problems, though you likely won’t need to intervene.


When the mother delivers, the pup will be in a sac; she should tear it open and then chew off the umbilical cord and lick the pup. It's usually best to let her do this without human assistance because it’s part of her bonding experience with the puppies.
If she doesn’t tear open the sac within about two to four minutes, however, you should gently open the sac yourself with a clean hand. Clear all fluid away from the pup’s nose and mouth, then rub the pup vigorously but gently to stimulate breathing.
Make sure the puppies are warm, but, again, don’t intervene unless you see a problem. Neonatal death (ie, stillbirths or pups that survive only a few hours or days) is relatively common for most littered mammals, so be prepared for this possibility. If you see a newborn pup that is not breathing, try to clear the mouth and stimulate the puppy by rubbing its body to see if you can get it breathing.

, Provide her with a high-calorie diet (like puppy food) to help her stay nourished while nursing.It’s important for both mother and puppies to receive enough nutrition. This helps the mother can recover and helps the puppies develop.

, Dogs are susceptible to certain illnesses and complications after giving birth.Watch for signs of metritis (an inflamed uterus), which include fever, foul-smelling discharge, listlessness, loss of appetite, decreased milk production, and disinterest in the puppies.
Watch for signs of eclampsia, which can include nervousness, restlessness, disinterest in the puppies, and a stiff, pained gait. If left untreated, eclampsia can progress into muscle spasms, inability to stand, fever, and seizures.
Watch for signs of mastitis (inflammation of the breasts), which can include red, hardened, or painful mammary glands. The mother may try to discourage the puppies from nursing, but you should urge them to continue doing so. It will help flush out the infection without causing the puppies any harm.

, Watch out that the mother doesn’t stop caring for the pups or show signs of feeling ill after delivery.If that happens, call your vet and bring her in if necessary.

Start a few weeks before your dog is due.,
Make sure the box is the appropriate size.,
Choose a spot where your dog feels comfortable.",How to Accustom Your Pregnant Dog to the Whelping Box1," You will need a few weeks to get your dog accustomed to the whelping box. This means you need to buy the box early to start getting her used to it. If she is unfamiliar with the box, she won’t use it to give birth.Don’t wait to the last minute to buy the whelping box and introduce your dog to it.
A canine pregnancy lasts approximately 63 days. Once you find out from the vet how many weeks your dog is along, you can plan when to start introducing the whelping box.;
, Your dog needs to feel physically comfortable in the whelping box. This means the box should be the right size for your dog. The box should be large enough for your dog to lie down and stretch out to nurse the puppies.Make sure the box isn’t too big. The box needs to be keep the puppies and mother close together without a lot of extra room for the puppies to get away.

, If possible, place the whelping box in an area where the dog feels comfortable. This may be a room they are familiar with or like to sleep in. This will help her adjust more easily to the box.Remember, it is important that the room is quiet and not busy. For example, your dog may love the living room, but a living room is not a good place to place the whelping box.

Ask your vet when your dog is due.,
Take the rectal temperature of the dog.,
Call the vet if the stages of labour do not progress.",How to Monitor the Stages of Labor in Dogs1," The normal gestation period for a dog is approximately 63 days (give or take 7 days) from the time of breeding. You should take your dog to the vet twenty to thirty days after breeding to determine if the dog is pregnant. A veterinarian can determine if a dog is pregnant by feeling their abdomen or conducting an ultrasound. Gestation periods differ slightly depending on the breed. For example, smaller breeds will often deliver after 63 days and larger breeds may deliver before 63 days.Ask your veterinarian to give you an approximate due date for your dog.
Also get their on-call number so that you can contact the vet in case of an emergency during labor.;
, Take your dog’s temperature once a day starting about a week or two before the due date. This will allow you to learn the normal temperature of your dog. Typically, the normal body temperature for a dog is somewhere between 99 and 102.5 degrees. This will vary depending on the size of the dog. Labour will begin about 24 hours after a drastic drop in temperature occurs. For example, when the dog’s temperature drops below 99 degrees. In order to take the dog’s temperature, you can use an oral human thermometer.
Simply lubricate the thermometer with vaseline and insert it into the dog’s rectum. Make sure it is about an inch inside and leave it there for one minute to get a proper reading.
Take the dog’s temperature at the same time each day.

, If the dog does not enter into active labour within 24 hours of their temperature dropping, then you should call your vet. This may be a sign of a complication and you may need professional medical assistance.

Get your dog veterinary care.,
Understand that many times miscarriages are not preventable.,
Continue to give your dog prenatal care.",How to Know if a Pregnant Dog Has Reabsorbed the Fetus2," After your dog reabsorbs a fetus it should be looked at by a veterinarian. The veterinarian can assess the dog's health, as well as the health of any additional fetus'.Your dog may need to be kept under observation to make sure that it can successfully carry the remaining fetus'.There are a variety of reasons that your dog may have miscarried. A veterinarian may be able to figure out the reason why.
In some cases, a miscarriage occurs due to a infectious disease. Your veterinarian may need to do biological tests to confirm what type of infection caused the miscarriage. If this is the case with your dog, it will need veterinary care to recover from the infection., There are many reasons that your dog may miscarry that you have no control over. For example, many miscarriages are due to hormonal imbalances in the dog's system or infectious diseases that have gone undiagnosed. Keep this in mind when dealing with your dog and coming to grips with the loss of a potential puppy. The miscarriage is not your fault or the fault of your dog.

, Even if your dog has reabsorbed a fetus, there still may be additional developing fetus' that need to be cared for. In order for your dog to successfully carry these puppies to term, you need to continue proper care for the dog.


This includes feeding your pregnant dog properly, getting it proper healthcare, and preparing properly for labor and delivery.

Place the box in the birthing area.,
Choose a quiet location.,
Encourage your dog to sleep in the box.,
Lead your dog to the whelping box often.",How to Accustom Your Pregnant Dog to the Whelping Box2," As you get your dog used to the whelping box, you should place it in the spot your dog will give birth. This helps the dog get used to the area and feel like it is safe for her puppies.Don’t put the box in one room and then move it to a different room before the birth.

, To help your dog feel comfortable, place the whelping box in a private area. This room should be quiet, warm, dry, not too bright, and away from the usual traffic and excitement of your house. This will help your dog feel safe and secure after she gives birth.Good places are guest bedrooms, bathrooms that aren’t used, studies or offices, laundry rooms, or enclosed garages.
Make sure the area will be warm, away from drafts, and separate from people or other pets. Other dogs should not have access to the whelping box.

, During the weeks leading up to the birth, try to get your dog to sleep in the box. You can also let them lay in the box while they rest during the day. The goal is to help your dog view the whelping box as a comfortable location., Your dog may not want to lay in the box just yet. If she doesn’t take to it immediately, then take her to the box multiple times each day. Show her the box and help try to get her in the box.If your dog is small enough, you can physically place her in the box so she starts to smell her scent on it.
If your dog isn’t interested in getting in it, let her go away and bring her back the next day.

"
"
Watch the dog’s eating habits.,
Monitor restlessness in the dog.,
Help create a nesting space.",How to Monitor the Stages of Labor in Dogs2," Prior to active labor, the dog may develop a change in eating habits. For example, on the day of whelping female dogs may not eat or they may eat and then later vomit. Although loss of appetite is fairly common, it does not happen to all dogs. Some dogs will continue to eat right up until active labor and delivery.A loss of appetite in the latter stages of pregnancy is likely a sign of stage one labor.

, Dogs, in the early stages of labor, will also become quite restless and they may begin pacing, whining, and looking at their abdomen. This is very typical and essentially demonstrates their discomfort as they begin to experience irregular contractions. During the first stage of labor you will likely not be able to see the contractions, but the dog is preparing for delivery. This change in behavior is a clear sign that labor has begun.You can comfort your dog by saying soothing words and being present.
Avoid being overly affectionate and touchy during this stage. The dog likely wants some space.

, Your dog will also begin to nest during this stage of labor. They will look for a comfortable place to deliver their puppies. This is one of the few times when you should interfere with the delivery process. You can help your dog nest by building a whelping box for them. Add lots of blankets to the space in order to make it comfortable for the laboring dog. You can also add some of their favorite toys to encourage them to use the box. Introduce the whelping box a week prior to delivery so that the dog becomes comfortable with the space.Place the box in a quiet, warm, and traffic-free space in your home.
By helping your dog with the nesting process you can control where the delivery will take place.
For example, you may not want your dog to deliver on your bed!

"
"
Watch for abdominal contractions.,
Make sure the mother cleans the pups after delivery.,
Ensure the mother breaks each umbilical cord.,
Ensure the dog expels one placenta for every puppy.",How to Monitor the Stages of Labor in Dogs3," As the dog transitions from the first stage of labor to more active labor, you will begin to notice contractions. This stage is marked by the visible effort to expel the puppies. For instance, the female dog may get into a squatting or lying position in order to deliver the puppies.A normal delivery will begin after 10-60 minutes of active labour.
If the dog does not deliver a puppy after 60 minutes there may be a complication and you should call the vet.
Alternatively, if the mother is contracting forcefully and no puppy is born, you should call the vet.

, When a puppy is born it is encased in an amniotic sac. The mother should lick the puppy in order to break the sac and stimulate breathing. In some instances this may not happen and you will need to intervene. Using your fingers, break the sac and wipe away any fluids around the nose and mouth. Then rub the puppy’s back with a towel to stimulate blood flow and breathing.Keep the puppy close to the mother even if you have to interfere.
Only interfere if necessary because this is important bonding between the mother and puppy.

, Each puppy is tethered to the mother with an umbilical cord and this will need to be severed once the puppy is born. In a normal birth the mother will bite the cord and you will not need to interfere. If this does not happen, you will need to cut the umbilical cord.


Tie a piece of dental floss tightly around the umbilical cord, about an inch from the puppy’s body.
Cut the cord and then clot any blood using clean gauze.

, During the delivery of the puppies, the mother will also deliver the placenta or afterbirth. This is considered the third stage of delivery, but the placentas can be expelled sporadically throughout active delivery. There will be one placenta for each puppy that is birthed. Keep track of the placenta to ensure that all of them are removed. The mother may eat the placenta after it is delivered. Some people believe this is fine and healthy, but others prefer to remove the placenta from the whelping box.If the dog does not deliver the proper number of placentas take them to a veterinarian. Any unborn fetuses or afterbirth could result in serious health problems for the dog.

Watch for nipple color change.,
Be aware of body changes.,
Do not increase food ration prematurely.,
Monitor continuing body changes.,
Look and feel for puppy movement.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Pregnant1," One of the earliest hints that a dog might be pregnant is if she “pinks up.” This refers to a change in her nipples which makes them appear a rosier color than normal, slightly swollen and more prominent. This sign can develop 2 - 3 weeks after conception.;
, A pregnant dog’s body shape doesn't change until the second half of pregnancy. Between about 4 - 5 weeks her waist begins to thicken and her tummy fills out.

, A pregnant dog should be given increased food in the final third of pregnancy, but many owners tend to increase their dog's food ration too early. The additional calories lead to fat being laid down in the abdomen, which is often mistaken for a sign of pregnancy. It is not possible for the layman to discern whether her enlarged abdomen is due to fetuses taking up room, or fat.

, In the final third (weeks 6-9) of pregnancy, the dog’s belly becomes rounded and distended. Her mammary glands start to develop and become more obviously swollen, as they get ready to produce milk.

, In the final third of gestation, you may be able to see the dog’s flanks moving as the puppies wriggle around in her womb. If you place your palm flat against her side where you see the rippling, you might be able to feel movement.


Don't be too disappointed if you can't feel anything. The puppies are deep within her tummy and each pup is floating is a sac of fluid, so it isn't always possible to feel the actual outline of a puppy.

Wait until your puppies are 8 weeks old before giving them away.",How to Help Your Dog After Giving Birth," Schedule an appointment with the vet, so she can check on your pregnant dog. The vet will confirm the pregnancy and check for any complications., Provide a nesting area at least a week before you think she is due to give birth. You want to give her the space she needs by putting her in her bed or in a box with towels or blankets for comfort.


Choose an area that is secluded, such as in a separate room, so that she can have privacy and quiet.

, Make food and water available near your dog so she has easy access. This will also make it possible for her to not leave her puppies to eat and drink.

, The pregnant dog should eat a high quality puppy food that is high in protein and calcium. This will prepare her body to produce substantial amounts of milk.


Your dog will eat puppy food until the puppies are weaned., If it doesn’t make her anxious to have your presence, watch your dog while she is laboring. You don’t need to hover. Expect her to be uncomfortable during contractions, just like a woman would be. This is part of the process.


In many cases, puppies are born in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. Make it a habit to check on your dog as soon as you wake up as she approaches her due date.

, The mother dog should clean her puppies right after they are born. Give her a minute or two to take the sac off the puppy and start licking and cleaning the puppy. If your dog is taking longer than that, you can step in and get the sack off and vigorously rub the puppy to dry and stimulate breathing.If necessary, you can carefully tie off the umbilical cord about an inch from the puppy and cut it with clean scissors.

, Puppies should start nursing within 1-3 hours after birth. You may need to place the puppy in front of a nipple and gently squeeze a little milk out for the puppy to get the idea.


If the puppy absolutely will not nurse, or your dog won’t let the puppy nurse, there may be something wrong with the puppy, like a cleft palate. Open the puppy’s mouth and look at the roof of the mouth. It should be a solid surface without any holes into the sinuses. Consult your veterinarian if there are any concerns.
You may need to tube feed or bottle feed the puppy with puppy formula if they are not able to nurse and are otherwise healthy.

, After the puppies are born, count them so you know exactly how many there are. This will help you keep tabs on the pups.

, The mother dog may want to eat the placentas, which is not harmful. She is getting back all the nutrients she put into her pregnancy. Don’t feel compelled to remove them immediately. If she does not eat them, dispose of them in the trash.


In some cases, eating the placentas may cause vomiting later.
Remember that every puppy will have its own placenta.

, Puppies do not regulate their body temperature well and need to be kept warm. For the first few days after birth, keep one area of the whelping box around 85 degrees F. Then you can drop the temperature down to 75-80 degrees F.


Provide extra heat with the help of a heat lamp in one corner of the whelping box. If a puppy gets cold, it will not move much. Check to sure the birthing area is warm and the puppy is staying close to mom and the other puppies.

, Schedule a visit with your vet for checkups after the puppies are born. The vet will make sure that the mother is healing properly and that the puppies are growing.

, If you own the father dog, ensure that he is in an area separated from the female dog and the puppies. Other dogs in the household should not be allowed to bother the momma dog and her puppies either. There is a risk of fighting between the adult dogs and possible risk to the puppies themselves. The female may get aggressive because she is protecting her puppies. This is normal and you shouldn't punish her for this instinct.


Protective aggression toward humans may occur as well, so prevent children from bothering the puppies too.

, Unless she is filthy, wait a few weeks to give her a bath with a mild oatmeal shampoo formulated for dogs. Make sure to rinse her well in order to avoid leaving a residue that the puppies would come in contact with while nursing.

, The lactating dog needs to eat a high quality puppy food that is high in protein and calcium. This will allow her to produce substantial amounts of milk. She should eat puppy food until the puppies are weaned.


Let her eat as much as she wants, which can often be four times her non-pregnant intake. You cannot overfeed her during this period, as making milk for puppies requires a lot of calories.
Be aware that the first 24-48 hours after giving birth, she is likely not going to eat much of anything at all., Do not add more calcium to the mother dog’s diet without first talking to your veterinarian. Getting too much calcium can set her up for milk fever later on.Milk fever is caused by a significant drop in blood calcium levels and typically occurs 2-3 weeks into lactation. The dog’s muscles will start stiffening and the dog may develop tremors. This can lead to seizures because the calcium levels in the blood are too low.
If you suspect milk fever, seek immediate veterinary attention.

, During the first 2-4 weeks, the new mom will be very busy keeping track and taking care of the puppies. She won’t want to be too far from the puppies for very long. It will be important for her to have access to them to keep the puppies warm and fed and clean. Take her out for short bathroom breaks for only 5-10 minutes.

, If your dog has long fur, give her a “sanitary cut” around her tail and hind legs and her mammary glands to help keep these areas clean once the puppies are born.


A groomer or your veterinarian can do this procedure if you do not feel comfortable or do not have the equipment.

, Mammary gland infections (mastitis) do occur and can get very serious very quickly. If you see mammary glands that are very red (or purple), hard, hot or painful, there is a problem. In some cases, mastitis has the potential to kill the nursing mother dog.


If you suspect mastitis, take the dog immediately to your veterinarian. Even if you have to take her to an emergency veterinary hospital, it must happen immediately., ,, It is normal for you to see vaginal discharge from the momma dog for a few weeks (up to 8 weeks) after birth. This discharge can look brownish red and look stringy. Occasionally a mild odor will be noticed.


If you see yellow, green or gray material, or notice a foul odor, take your dog to your veterinarian. She may have an infection in her uterus., Make sure the puppies are nursing every few hours during the first few weeks. They should eat every 2-4 hours at minimum. Happy puppies are sleeping puppies; if they are crying a lot, they may not be getting enough nutrition. Check for fat little bellies and clean coats to signal that they are well cared for.


Try weighing the puppies on a digital scale to make sure that they are gaining weight every day. Puppies should double their weight in the first week.Do not disregard a puppy looking skinnier or less active than the other puppies. Take him to your veterinarian right away. He may require supplemental feeding or other help.

, If after the first few days, you see the rest of the puppies growing and one that is still small and skinny, this may be a sign of insufficient feeding or another problem. Take the puppy to a vet right away for an exam immediately. Newborn puppies, like newborn humans, can get sick and dehydrated quickly.

, As the puppies get older and more mobile, the confined area will get messier. Cleaning up after the puppies at least 2-3 times per day will be needed to keep the whelping box sanitary.

, Puppies need healthy socialization to their new world, including introductions to people. Hold each puppy several times per day. Get the puppies accustomed to being touched everywhere on their bodies so that it will not seem strange when they are older.

, If you are selling or giving away the puppies, wait until they are 8 weeks old before handing them over to the new owners. In some states, like California, it is illegal to sell or give away puppies before 8 weeks of age.


Puppies should be fully weaned and eating dog food on their own before they leave for a new home.
Starting a deworming and vaccination program is often recommended before the pup leaves. Consult with your veterinarian and follow her recommendations.

Watch for signs of infection.",How to Handle Late Whelping in Dogs," When a dog is near her due date, consider having an x-ray done. An x-ray can confirm that she's indeed still pregnant. It can also show how many pups she has. For instance, if she only has one large pup, that can make whelping difficult.A dog's gestation is generally about 63 days from ovulation.;
, Some dogs are more prone to difficulty when whelping. Pugs, bulldogs, and Boston terriers are prime examples of breeds who may have more trouble. Usually, it's best to schedule a C-section for these dogs., If your dog still hasn't had her puppies a few days past her due date, it's a good idea to take her into the vet. The vet can determine what problems she's having with the birth by examining her.You could say to your vet, ""Since she's several days past her due date, I started to get worried. Is there anything we need to do for her?""

, If a dog is several days past her due date, your vet will likely take medical interventions. For instance, the vet may take another x-ray to see what's wrong. They may also physically help the dog along if possible, or give her medications to induce labor. If all else fails, your dog may need a C-section.You could say, ""Can you explain to me in basic terms what's wrong with Lucy?"" You could also ask what you need to do when you take the dog home to care for her.

, Just like human labor, a dog giving birth can take quite a long time. It may happen fairly quickly, within the space of 2 hours, but it can also take up to a full day for a dog to give birth with breaks in between pups. Keep an eye on the time to see how long it has been between each puppy, as after a few hours, you may want to take other steps.Make sure to have food and water available while the dog is giving birth, as she'll need to keep her strength up.
Really, all you can do is wait for her to continue giving birth, with the exception of taking her for a walk.

, If it's been a long time between puppies, more than a couple of hours, you can try taking her outside for a walk. It doesn't have to be a long walk, but a short, fast walk can help her start delivering puppies again.She may not want to leave her puppies, but try to encourage her to come outside for a bit. You can carry her outside if she's willing or bribe her with treats.

, If she rests for more than 4 hours (and you know there are more puppies to be born), talk to your vet.She may have uterine inertia, meaning her uterus doesn't want to deliver anymore puppies, or she might have a more serious problem, such as a ruptured uterus., If you notice your dog is straining, you don't need to take immediate action. However, after half an hour, you should take action if your dog is straining without producing any puppies. That means she's having trouble giving birth.Physically assist your dog. Put on some gloves, and then add some KY Jelly or other similar type of lubricant to the tips of your fingers. Push into the dog's vagina to feel for the puppy's head. When you feel the head, try to spread lubricant all around the dog's head. Move the puppy around a bit, going back and forth to see if you can help guide it out.If you can't get your fingers inside the dog, try using a catheter-tipped syringe with lubricant.

, If you find that your assistance doesn't help your dog deliver her puppies, you'll need to go to the vet. It may be that a puppy is too large to come out, and the vet will need to do a C-section. Also, two puppies may be wedged into the uterus, trying to come out.You should also take your dog to the vet in the first day or so after birth to make sure she is doing okay.

, When your dog gives birth, it's important to clean up the area around her by taking out any soiled blankets. Provide clean blankets for her and the pups. You should also wipe down the mother with a warm cloth, cleaning up any fluids on her. Be sure to gently dry her off afterwards by patting her with a towel. These tasks will help prevent the mother from developing an infection., Pay attention to signs of infection after birth. Infection can develop in either the uterus or the teats.You should also watch for signs of low calcium, as that's another issue that a nursing dog can develop after giving birth. You should visit the vet if you notice symptoms of these conditions.Infection in the teats is characterized by increased pain, swelling, irritation, and redness. Also, if the milk turns green, yellow, or red and thickens, that's a sign of infection, as well.
While your dog will have some drainage from the uterus, it's usually green, red, black, brown. If it changes to a pale or gray color, that indicates infection. Also, it should not be thick, and it shouldn't have much of a smell.
Low calcium will result in disorientation, loss of interest in her puppies, a fever, pain, whining, and stomach problems, as well as muscle tremors. If your dog develops this condition, she may lay on the floor with her legs sticking straight out.

Place toys in the box.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Avoid forcing your dog in the box.",How to Accustom Your Pregnant Dog to the Whelping Box3," Another way to help your dog become comfortable with the whelping box is to put some of her favorite toys in there. You may also want to put her favorite blanket in there. This will help the dog feel at home and safe in the box.Putting her toys in there will help the box smell familiar and also give her something to do while she is in the box.

, One way to help your dog get accustomed to the box is to create a positive association for the dog. To do this, you can pet and stroke her while she is near or in the whelping box. Talk to her softly and lovingly, giving her a lot of praise when she gets in or near the box.You can also use treats to get her in the box, or give her treats when she gets in the whelping box.

, It may take a few days to a week to get your dog accustomed to the whelping box. However, if you continue to lead her to the box and make it feel comfortable and safe, she will warm up to it. The thing to remember is never force her into the box or punish her for not going into it.You don’t want to form negative associations with the whelping box. She will only have her puppies there if she feels safe and secure in the box.

Do not expect drastic changes.,
Expect appetite changes.,
Watch for nesting.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Pregnant2," All dogs react individually to pregnancy. Some may be quieter and more tired early on, but a dog who is unwell may also be quiet, so this sign is an unreliable predictor of pregnancy. The average female dog behaves largely the same as usual until the last third of the gestation.


In the final third of pregnancy, the dog’s size makes it more difficult for her to move around, and she may want to sleep more.

, Towards the end of pregnancy, the dog’s will womb grow larger and take up more space in her belly. She won't be able to accommodate large meals, so she'll start wanting to snack, eating a little at a time more frequently. , When it is nearly time for her to deliver the pups, the dog may start to nest. She will gather blankets or clothing in a secluded place as she prepares a suitable safe warm environment for her imminent new arrivals.


The exact timing of nesting varies from 2-3 weeks to 2 - 3 days prior to giving birth.

Visit a veterinarian.,
Get a physical examination.,
Check for heartbeats.,
Perform a blood test.,
Have an ultrasound.,
Ask about getting an x-ray.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Pregnant3," If you suspect that your dog is pregnant, it is worthwhile to visit the vet to confirm your suspicion. There are various methods a vet can use to definitively confirm pregnancy.

, The vet will examine the dog and pay special attention to gently feeling her tummy. By palpation (feeling from the outside of her belly) the vet can sometime feel the womb and the outline of a puppy inside. However, this is much more difficult than it sounds because it is easy to mistake a puppy for feces in the bowel, and vice versa.


The ideal time to feel a pregnancy is between day 28 - 35 after conception. Before this, there is not enough difference to feel to tell the vet she is pregnant. After this, the puppies can be mistaken for other things such as food in the gut. , In late pregnancy (week 6 onwards), the vet can sometimes hear fetal heartbeats by holding a stethoscope to the dog’s belly. However, this is much more difficult than for human babies because of the rustling of the dog's fur coat and the fact that dogs have round, not flat, tummies. , The gold standard to test for pregnancy is for your vet to run a blood test that looks for the presence of a pregnancy hormone called Relaxin. The hormone is only reliably present after day 28 of the pregnancy. If the test is run before this date it is possible to get falsely negative results, where you believe the bitch isn't pregnant when she is. A positive result at any point, even before day 28, does confirm pregnancy. , The method that can confirm pregnancy the earliest is an ultrasound. A skilled ultrasound operator can pick up puppies on the scanner from around day 16 onward. In a docile bitch the scan can be done without sedation.
The operator will need to clip fur on the tummy of very furry dogs so that the probe can make good contact with her skin. , With the widespread use of ultrasound, the need for x-rays in pregnancy has decreased. The main reason to x-ray a pregnant bitch is in late pregnancy, to count how many puppies are present in the womb.


This information is useful so that the owner knows when all puppies have been safely born. It can alert an owner that the bitch's labor has stopped but she still has a puppy inside.

Be patient.,
Notice any mood changes.,
Watch for other signs of illness.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Pregnant4," A dog may not show any signs of pregnancy in the first 2-3 weeks (which is the first third of the pregnancy). Her appetite should remain normal.


Pregnant female dogs absolutely do suffer from morning sickness like people do, however not until approximately day 21 after being mated. It usually lasts 1-2 weeks. Also on day 21, you can look at your female's gums. If the mating took, her gums will be white instead of the normal pink. This is because the fetus' are attaching in her uterus and the blood in her body is gathering there, so for a day or two, her gums will appear white. There is nothing to worry about. If it continues after 2 days, call your vet.

, Some people first suspect their bitch might be pregnant because she is a bit quieter than usual, but this is more anecdotal observation than proven fact. Pregnancy causes changing hormone levels and this affects each dog differently.


Some dogs may become quieter than usual, others may become more affectionate and clingy, and still others could withdraw and want to be left alone. , Whilst a change in a dog’s apparent mood or behavior can indicate pregnancy, this is a vague sign that could also indicate that she is unwell. Therefore, you should monitor her closely for any symptoms of ill health such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, or vaginal discharge.


If your dog has been mated but subsequently goes off her food in the next few days or weeks, this is unlikely to be related to pregnancy and she should be checked by a veterinarian. This is also the case if you see a vaginal discharge (not normal during pregnancy) or if she is vomiting regularly. "

Think about your dog’s personality.,
Think about your older dog’s health.,
Think about how much space you have.,
Consider your schedule.,
Take your finances into account.,
Don’t worry too much.",How to Determine if Your Old Dog Can Handle a New Puppy1," If you’ve introduced your older dog to new puppies before, you should reflect on that experience to determine if you should do so again. If your older dog has demonstrated disinterest in or hostility towards other dogs, especially puppies, you should think twice about introducing a new puppy to your household. On the other hand, if your old dog enjoys company and easily cultivates new friendships, they can probably handle a new puppy.If your older dog has an “alpha”-type personality (i.e., dominant, protective, territorial) introducing a new puppy into the mix is probably not a good idea.;
, Older dogs are often frail and have mobility problems. Other health concerns include vision or hearing loss, chronic pain, or stiffness in their joints. These health concerns can lead to anxiety and even depression, and any disruption in your older dog’s routine can lead to undue stress for them. Dogs with minimal mobility are also less able to escape an abusive or irritating puppy.If your dog does have poor health, consider introducing another elderly dog or a cat to your household instead of a new puppy.

, Dogs need space to run and jump. Neither the new puppy nor the older dog will be happy if you’re all tripping over each other. If you’re already cramped for space, you won’t be able to accommodate another dog.Even if you have a large backyard or live near a park, sometimes the weather is bad and your dogs will need to work out their pent-up energy indoors.
If you want another pet but lack space, think about investing in a small fish instead.

, Adding a new puppy to your household won’t significantly increase the amount of time you spend on pet care in the long term. After all, if you’re hanging out with one doggie, you can hang out with the other at the same time. But in the short term, you might have to spend extra time taking your puppy out and training it to indicate when it needs to go out. It’s important that you pay your older dog an equal or greater amount of attention as your new puppy during this introductory period. If you don’t have this time, you should reconsider investing in a puppy.


If you’re pressed for time, you could hire a dog-sitter to watch your puppy and train it to go out when you’re unavailable.

, An extra dog means an extra mouth to feed. It also means extra visits to the vet or pet dentist. If you don’t have the funds to provide a decent quality of life for another animal, you should not invest in a new puppy. This is especially true when your older dog is likely to need increased medical attention as it ages.Remember, different dog breeds grow to different sizes. Find out from your vet how large your puppy will be when it is full-grown.

, Most dogs get along with each other and enjoy meeting new friends no matter their age or species. Typically, the most extreme measure a pet owner has to take is to basically keep the dogs separated until the puppy grows up a bit. If you believe your old dog is up to it, take a chance and introduce a new puppy to your family."

Keep food and water dishes within easy reach.,
Use raised bowls.,
Give your dog a helping hand.,
Cover slippery floors.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness in Senior Dogs1," If your dog is stiff in the morning, don’t force them to climb up or down stairs in order to get breakfast. Place the dishes on the same level of the house that the dog sleeps on. By the time doggie has had a bit to eat and walked around a bit, they should have worked a bit of their stiffness out., Larger dogs might develop stiffness in their necks as they get older. In order to help them during breakfast, place their food and water dishes on a low platform or step-stool. The raised dishes should be at the level of their mouth. This will save them the trouble of needing to crane their neck downwards to eat., If your dog needs help jumping up on furniture or on the bed in the morning because it is too stiff, help your dog up. Lift your dog gently by cupping it beneath its “armpits” – the spot where its front legs and body meet. You might also place a low stepping stool in front of couches or bed in order to enable your dog to climb onto them itself.Always be gentle with your dog and respond to any signals it gives that you’re pulling too hard. If your dog yelps or cries out, don’t insist on pulling your dog up onto furniture.

, Old dogs may have trouble walking steadily on laminate or linoleum floors. Provide non-slip runners for your dog to walk along.

"
Consider your dog’s age.,
Recognize that the sperm count can decrease as the dog ages.,
Check the conception rates.",How to Know when to Stop Breeding a Male Dog1," When deciding whether your dog should continue breeding, think about how old he is. Most male dogs can breed until they are senior dogs, but it is difficult for older dogs to get females pregnant. After your dog is around 10 years old, you may want to stop breeding him.Some believe that certain small breeds shouldn’t be bred after age seven, while other breeds can be bred up to age 12. Talk to your vet or consult your kennel club to see what’s recommended for your breed.
If you choose to breed after that age, you should understand that the odds of your dog getting a female pregnant is significantly lower, so pregnancy may not occur.;
, Most male dogs can breed until they die. However, sperm counts decrease as the dog gets older. The dog can still breed, but it may be difficult due to the lowered sperm count.If you are unsure about your dog’s sperm count, consult your veterinarian.

, Your male dog should have little trouble getting healthy females pregnant. This means that the female dog should get pregnant when she mates with your male dog. If the dogs are not getting pregnant during the matings, it may be time to stop breeding your male dog.If this is occurring with your dog, you should take them to the vet to get them checked out.
You can also stop breeding your dog completely.

Watch for signs of incontinence.,
Be on the lookout for licking.,
Determine if it’s a chronic condition.,
Consider your dog’s hygiene.,
Don’t diaper a dog if the issue is diarrhea.,
Consider the cost.,
Take account of the time commitment.,
Decide if it will improve the dog’s and your quality of living.",How to Determine Whether to Diaper a Senior Dog1," Senior dogs often have issues with controlling their urination and bowels. If they’re having frequent accidents indoors or dribbling urine around the house, it’s a cause for concern that needs to be addressed. Diapers might be part of the solution.Some dogs are only affected during their sleep. Check regularly to see if their bedding has been soiled since this can also be a sign of incontinence.;
, Even if your dog is not leaving puddles around the house, they could be dripping urine. Constant licking of their urethra area or skin irritation around it are also signs of incontinence.

, Not all incontinence is permanent; it may be a symptom of a temporary or treatable condition, like anxiety or a urinary tract infection. Or, it may be a sign of a more serious illness. Make an appointment with your vet to determine the cause of your dog’s incontinence and see if it’s likely to be a long-term issue., If your dog’s current incontinence is leaving a mess on their skin, it’s putting your pet at risk of infections and irritations. If that’s the case, using diapers is a good way to mitigate their risk of infection and keep them feeling clean and comfortable.This will also save you time since you won’t have to wash them several times a day.

, If your pet has diarrhea, diapers are not likely to be a good option for hygiene reasons. Diarrhea is messy and contains a lot of acid, which can burn your dog’s skin if you don’t clean it up immediately.

, Disposable diapers range from about $10 - $15 per 12-pack. Washable diapers can range anywhere from $7 - $30 per diaper. You are likely to need 2-5 diapers per day, which can be a considerable expense. If you can’t afford it, you may have to consider alternative options of dealing with your dog’s incontinence.In the long-run, washable diapers are more cost-effective. However, they’re also more labor-intensive since you’ll have to do a lot of laundry.
There are also other related accessories, like suspenders to keep diapers in place.

, If you use diapers on your dog, they will need to be changed often to prevent rashes, infections, and messes. If you or another carer are not going to be around to take care of your dog throughout the day, you may need to consider an alternative to diapers.If your dog defecates, someone should be on hand to change their diaper immediately.
If your dog is dealing with mainly urinary issues, you should still change your dog’s diaper and clean their genitals a few times a day.

, If incontinence is your dog’s only significant health issue, using diapers to make their old age more comfortable is probably a good idea. If diapers are the most convenient solution to your pet’s issues, then they’re also probably a good idea for you as a pet owner.On the other hand, if your dog consistently resists wearing diapers or doing so is significantly affecting their comfort and/or mobility, it’s probably not the best option for your pet.

Talk with your veterinarian.,
Try anti-anxiety medication.,
Change their diet.",How to Deal with Clinginess in Older Dogs1," If your dog begins to change their behaviour, then you should take them to the veterinarian. Do not assume that your dog’s new clinginess is simply related to aging. Instead, you should talk with your veterinarian to see if this behavioural change is a symptom of a larger medical problem. For example, your dog may be in pain and find comfort in your presence. Pain relieving medication may help alleviate this symptom. Your vet may be able to prescribe medicine to help comfort your dog.
Alternatively, the change in behaviour may not be treatable and is just a sign of aging.
Ask your vet ""How can I provide my dog with comfort in old age?"" or ""Should I pay more attention to my dog since it is being clingy?""
Some anti-anxiety medications can cause the urine to turn pink, dizziness, dry eyes and mouth, lethargy, loss of appetite, nausea.If any of these symptoms occur take your dog to the vet.;
, If your dog is suffering from extreme separation anxiety, you may want to talk with your vet about anti-anxiety medication. Anti-anxiety medication can reduce the level of anxiety in your dog and may help to decrease any destructive behaviour that happens as a result of the anxiety.For example, your dog may act out and eat something or go to the washroom in the house when you are out.

, Your dog may be clinging to you because they are uncomfortable. Once you have talked with your vet about their change in behaviour they may tell you to change your dog’s diet. There are a variety of specialty foods that can help dogs with different medical conditions.. For example, you can get special food for dogs suffering from kidney failure or other medical issues.


Talk with your vet to see if a change in diet would help alleviate your dog’s symptoms.

Make introductions in a neutral place.,
Give your dogs time to socialize.,
Expect some friction.",How to Determine if Your Old Dog Can Handle a New Puppy2," Your older dog and new puppy should first meet somewhere quiet and safe where both will feel comfortable, but which your older dog does not identify as its own space. For instance, you might want to introduce the dogs to each other at a public park or the home of a friend. Introducing your old dog and new puppy when your old dog is sleeping in its bed, on the other hand, could make it uncomfortable.Say to your older dog, “This is our new family member. Can you say hello?” in a gentle, reassuring tone.
After your dogs have had 10 or 15 minutes of sniffing and studying each other together, head home. Let your older dog walk into the house first so it feels it is the leader of the new pack.

, If you keep your dogs apart all the time, they will not have the opportunity to bond and get to know one another. Provide opportunities for your older dog and puppy to play and interact. For instance, put them in the same shared space – a living room or enclosed backyard is a good choice. Allow them to share experiences like going for walks or swimming in the lake. Through these social interactions, your dogs will become friends and learn to love each other.


Monitor your dogs closely for at least two weeks to ensure they don’t play too rough.
Giving your dogs the opportunity to socialize doesn’t necessarily mean they will do so. They might be slow to get to know one another, but it is important to let them socialize at their own pace. Don’t force your dogs to play or interact together.

, Your old dog and new puppy might roughhouse, nip at each other, or wrestle a bit when they are getting to know each other. This is normal and expected socializing behavior. It’s how doggies say, “Hi, who are you?” If your older dog and new puppy seem excited or agitated around each other for a week or so, don’t worry.


Don’t step in to intervene every time your puppy and your older dog start pawing each other.
While some friction is normal, be on the lookout for more serious conflict. If either dog demonstrates growling, bared teeth, or assumes an attack position (lowered head, ears pointed back, bent forelegs, hair raised slightly on back), separate your dogs immediately and play with them one-on-one. Allow them to see and interact with each other only through a baby gate for 24 hours after a serious conflict."

Provide separate food and water bowls.,
Get help.",How to Determine if Your Old Dog Can Handle a New Puppy3," Dogs, like humans, are susceptible to jealousy. Your older dog might act out if they feel they are being snubbed in favor of a new puppy. Be sure to share a bit more time with your older dog than with your new puppy. Dogs of all ages appreciate petting, verbal praise, and opportunities for play. Doing so with your senior dog will prevent them from feeling that the new puppy is muscling in on its turf., While your older dog should have slightly more time and attention than the puppy, both should feel they are loved. Pay attention to each dog individually by petting them, playing with them, and offering verbal praise. If each dog feels appreciated, the dogs are more likely to get along and less likely to resent each other., One of the primary causes for conflict between dogs is a lack of play toys. You can prevent this by ensuring there are enough for all your dogs. Don’t assume your new puppy will enjoy the same types of toys that your older dog does. Provide a generous variety of toys, including dog bones, chew toys, KONG toys, balls, and rolling toys.Ensure your puppy doesn’t steal the older dog’s toys. Puppies who are not socialized don’t understand boundaries and sharing the way older dogs do. Even if you’ve provided an adequate amount of toys for your dogs, your puppy might decide to take your older dog’s toys. When this happens, say “No” sternly to your puppy, then return the pilfered toy to the senior dog.

, Your new puppy will have a lot of energy, but your older dog will not. In order to prevent your new puppy from using its excess energy to harass your senior dog, give your puppy plenty of opportunities to run about. Let it out in the backyard on its own to frolic and play.Try to find opportunities to exercise your puppy without making your older dog feel like you’re neglecting them. Wait until your older dog is napping or curled up in front of the TV to take your puppy outside for a game of fetch or tug-of-war.

, Apart from toys, dogs will likely feel their space is being invaded if another dog is eating or drinking from “their” bowl. Ensure you provide both dogs with their own food and water dishes, and place them at least three meters apart to avoid food fights.It might help if you begin feeding your new puppy in a dog crate.

, If you really want your dogs to get along but they just aren’t, you might need to get professional help. Dog trainers can help dogs of any age improve their social skills and learn to tolerate others. Contact dog trainers in your area and explain your predicament.Ask your vet or friends who have dogs to recommend a good dog trainer, or try the Association of Professional Dog Trainers’ searchable database at https://apdt.com/trainer-search/.
Remember, dogs are like people, and they all have unique personalities. Some dogs will just never get along, no matter how long they’re together. If your dogs don't get along, don't take it as a personal failing on your part. Just try to minimize their conflict as best you can.

Keep your dog warm.,
Don’t let your dog sleep outside.,
Provide the right bed.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness in Senior Dogs2," Drops in temperature can affect the joints of older dogs more than younger dogs. Place an electric blanket or heating pad beneath your dog’s bed at night. Keep the setting as low as possible at first. Gradually increase the temperature until you see a reduction in your dog’s stiffness in the morning.If you notice your dog sleeping elsewhere, rather than its normal bed where the heating pad is under it, you probably have the electric blanket or pad turned up too high. Reduce the temperature to a comfortable level.
Likewise, if your dog is getting up in the middle of the night, or going back and forth between its bed with the heat source beneath it and another, cooler area of the house, you should turn the heat down.

, Some dogs love spending all their time in their doghouse. But as your dog ages, it might become more susceptible to dips in temperature that never bothered it when it was younger. Insist that your elderly dog sleeps inside in order to prevent the cold from leaving your doggie stiff in the morning.Provide a soft, warm bed so your dog doesn’t miss the doghouse.

, Memory foam beds are best for dogs that have problems with mobility. They provide extra support for sore joints and ensure your elderly dog gets the best night’s rest it possibly can. Memory foam dog beds are available online and in most pet stores."

Or you could head to your local park and give your dog a chance to encounter some new sights and smells.Proceed slowly at first, but don’t let your dog linger or walk lazily.
The more intense your dog’s walk, the better the benefits you will both reap.
Don’t push your elderly dog beyond what it is capable of. If your dog starts to slow down noticeably, reduce your pace and head for home.

, Games and play are great for keeping your elderly dog active. For instance, toss your dog’s favorite toy or ball across the room. Better yet, head outside to a space where your dog has lots of space to run about. After tossing the toy, encourage your dog to bring it back to you. Repeat several times until your dog is tired. This simple game will improve your dog’s circulation and flexibility, leading to less morning stiffness.Playing with your dog is good for its mental and emotional health.

, When your dog is swimming, the water’s buoyancy lifts and supports your dog, allowing it to move about more freely than it would otherwise. Take your doggie to the lake or a slow-moving stream or river for a fun summer outing that can improve your dog’s mobility., Let your dog know before heading out to play or go for a walk. For instance, say “Walk?” repeatedly to your dog in an excited voice before heading out for a walk. Pet your dog lovingly as you say it. Over time, your dog will come to associate this word and the subsequent walk with the good feelings it has due to being paid attention and petted.After your walk is finished, pet your dog several more times and say “Good boy/girl” affectionately.

, If your vet thinks it is appropriate, you might be able to improve your dog’s morning stiffness through surgery. Canine surgeons can provide added stability to joints and remove bits of bone that may have chipped off over time. Smaller dogs might benefit from having certain leg joints fused, or having the top portion of upper leg bones removed.Talk to your doctor to determine if your dog needs surgery.

, Dogs, like humans, can benefit tremendously from a good massage. Take your dog to a trained animal masseuse and explain that it experiences stiffness in the morning. Your dog might benefit from a good massage.Ask the masseuse for tips about how you might be able to provide a simple massage to your dog in the morning in order to reduce its stiffness.

Speak with your vet about potential cures or treatments for your dog that would make diapers unnecessary.If your dog is currently taking prescription drugs, inquire if any of their medicines might be causing incontinence as a side-effect. If that’s the case, an adjustment to their dosage might help address the problem.
Keep in mind that many of these treatments can be expensive, temporary, and/or have serious side-effects. Be sure to factor these considerations into your decision about whether or not to pursue them versus addressing the symptoms with diapers and other measures.

, Consider confining your dog to an area of your house that’s easy to clean.

Choose between washable and disposable diapers.,
Supplement diapers with incontinence pads for heavy leaks.,
Consider a belly band for male dogs.,
Get the sizing right.",How to Determine Whether to Diaper a Senior Dog3," If your dog is having short-term incontinence issues, getting a pack of disposable diapers is probably the best solution. If your dog will be dealing with incontinence in the long-term, washable diapers will be the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution.In spite of the cost implications, you may want to use disposable diapers because they’re more convenient. Washable diapers, after all, must be washed regularly.
The other pros of washable diapers include better fit and less noise from rustling plastic when your dog is moving around.

Walk your dog daily.,
Give your dog attention.",How to Deal with Clinginess in Older Dogs2," Older dogs like things to stay the same. They are often set in their ways, and find comfort in routine. For instance, try to keep their feeding schedule, exercise routine, and sleeping environment the same. This will allow them to have a stable and comfortable environment as they age. If their environment remains a source of comfort than they may not become as clingy.For example, if they normally sleep in your room, do not move them to a different place because they have started waking up in the middle of the night. They are likely just anxious and need comforting. Moving them to a new place may cause more anxiety and clinginess.

, Some dogs will become more clingy in their old age because they are losing their senses. For example, they may find it much harder to see and hear as they age. As a result, they want to be close to you so that they feel safe and comforted. If you notice signs of vision loss (bumping into walls and furniture), or hearing loss (lack of response when you call them), you should try the following tips:Do not move furniture.

Scent the rooms in your house differently, so that they determine where they are based on the small.

, Another way to keep your dog comfortable as they age is to continue providing them with daily exercise.

This can actually help them to delay some of the signs of aging. If your dog has become more clingy they will also enjoying engaging in activities with you.Do not strain your older dog by taking them on a long and strenuous walk. Instead, take them for a short walk up the street to stimulate them and give them a mild form of exercise.
If they have mobility issues, then you can engage in gentle play at home.

, If your dog is feeling disoriented as a result of vision or hearing loss and aging, you should provide them with some added attention and comfort. What may appear to be additional clinginess, could actually just be your dog trying to locate you in the house. For example, if your older dog is struggling with vision and hearing they may want to stay close to you so that they do not get lost and feel alone or abandoned.


Provide your dog with gentle contact so that they know you are close.
If you see that your dog is disoriented, you should slowly approach them and then touch them so that they can reorient themselves to you.

Observe repetitive behaviors.,
Watch how your senior dog responds to you.,
Schedule an appointment with your vet.,
Provide a detailed history of the behavioral dysfunction.,
Have your vet perform a physical exam.,

Let your vet perform a neurologic exam.,
Discuss whether to see an animal behaviorist.",How to Diagnose Behavioral Dysfunction in Senior Dogs," Cognitive dysfunction is another term for dementia. It occurs in senior dogs when the brain undergoes changes that cause it not to work very well. Cognitive dysfunction causes behavioral changes that may be mild at first, but worsen over time.If you see signs of cognitive dysfunction, take your dog to your vet:Disorientation: wandering aimlessly, getting lost when indoors, getting stuck in corners
Changes in social interaction: not seeking attention, not greeting people
House soiling: having bathroom accidents indoors, even in front of people
Altered sleep/wake cycle: waking up during the night, howling during the night;
, Senior dogs can become anxious when left alone. If your senior dog has separation anxiety, it may whine and howl, become destructive, and urinate and defecate in the house.Some dogs can become very aggressive when their owners are about to leave the house. Other dogs may pant or even hide.You may be tempted to crate your dog to prevent destruction or house soiling. However, if your dog isn’t used to being crated, this could create even more anxiety., Dogs can develop fears later in life because of cognitive dysfunction, as well as sensory losses (hearing, sight, touch). For example, your senior dog may become fearful of thunderstorms or become reluctant to step on different types of surfaces.It may also fear change to its environment (new pet, new family member).


If you notice your dog is afraid of something that it wasn’t afraid of before, write down what that fear is. Also, write down your dog’s reaction to that fear (hiding, whining, wanting to be closer to you).

, Senior dogs can begin performing repetitive behaviors. For example, a senior dog may repetitively lick certain parts of its body, repeatedly chase its tail, or suck on its flank for long periods of time.Anxiety is a common cause of repetitive behaviors in dogs., Just like with people, dogs can lose their hearing with age.If your senior dog can’t hear as well as it used to, it either won’t respond to you at all, or take longer to do so.


If you think your dog is losing its hearing, your vet can perform various tests to determine whether your dog has hearing loss.

, Dealing with your dog's behavioral dysfunction can be frustrating.Before you lose your patience with your senior dog, take it to the vet. Behavioral dysfunction in senior dogs is usually due to some underlying cause, such as decreasing brain function or chronic disease.


Examples of chronic diseases that can cause behavioral dysfunction are liver and kidney disease.
Do not delay in taking your dog to your vet. The sooner your vet can diagnose the behavioral dysfunction, the sooner you dog can receive treatment for the problem.

, A history of your senior dog’s behavioral dysfunction will help your vet diagnose the problem. During the appointment with your vet, tell them about any behavioral changes you’ve noticed in your dog. No matter how major or minor you think the problems are, it will be important for your vet to know what’s changed about your dog’s behavior.


When you give your vet the history, include when the behavioral problems started and if they have gotten worse over time.

, Because behavioral dysfunction can sometimes be caused by underlying diseases, your vet will need to determine whether your senior dog has other medical problems. To do this, they will first perform a physical exam.Your vet will examine the outside of your dog’s body and listen to its heart and lungs.


During the physical exam, your vet may also test your dog’s hearing and vision. Not being able to hear or see very well could affect your dog’s behavior.

, Urine and blood samples can indicate whether your dog has a medical problem. For example, kidney disease would cause abnormalities in the blood and urine. For liver disease, the blood sample would have abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes.

, A neurologic exam will allow your vet to see how your dog’s brain is functioning. It will also help your vet rule out other medical causes of the behavioral problems.Your vet will evaluate different things during the exam exam:Gait and posture: observing of how your dog walks and positions its body
Mental status: observing how your dog interacts with you and your vet during the exam (alertness vs disorientation)
Cranial nerve function: testing the nerves in your dog’s brain
Postural reactions: determining whether your dog knows where its limbs are when not looking at them
Spinal reflexes: testing the function of different nerves

, If your senior dog’s behavioral dysfunction is complex, your vet may refer you to an animal behaviorist for a more detailed behavioral examination. Based on the exam results, the behaviorist will recommend a treatment plan for your senior dog. The website http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/behavioral-help-your-pet can help you locate an animal behaviorist in your area."

Keep your dog in a smaller space.,
Let your dog out more often.,
Provide newspaper or a doggy litter box.,
Get someone to watch your dog.,
Give your dog its own space.,
Use sanitary products.",How to Deal with House Soiling in Older Dogs1," If you’re out all day and can’t get someone to monitor your dog, you should try to at least limit the damage in the event your dog can’t wait to void until you return. You can do this by putting your dog in a single room, preferably one with a vinyl or tile floor that is easily cleaned up. If you don’t want to give your dog the run of the whole room, you can limit its space even further by placing it in a smaller nook or in a hallway and placing a baby gate (or gates) in a strategic location to keep your dog confined to the smaller space.Rooms with carpets are not preferred since they are difficult to clean up if your dog soils them.;
, If your dog needs to go to the bathroom more often, the easiest thing to do is to put it out more often. Provide opportunities for your dog to go out when it wakes up and before it goes to sleep, especially. Come home doing your lunch break, if possible, to let your dog out.If it is not possible to let your dog out frequently during the middle of the day, ask a family member or trusted neighbor to let your dog out while you’re at work or school.

, You may want to give your dog an indoor option for the times when he can’t hold it. Some things you might try include:


Getting a doggy litter box. Set up a large litter box for your dog. If you notice that he is about to soil in the house, then take him to the litter box. Do this a few times and he may begin to understand that the litter box is an option for him if you are not there to let him out.
Placing puppy pads or newspaper around the house. You can also show your dog these options when he seems like he is about to soil in the house.

, Not only can a dog sitter let your dog out more frequently, but they can be there to relieve your dog’s anxiety due to being alone. Feelings of loneliness can contribute to an increase in your dog’s house soiling, especially in older dogs who might be more fearful due to a decline in their senses.If you have a family member who can be home with your older dog during the day, you should be able to reduce the number of house soiling incidents your dog has.
If you don’t have a family member who can help out, hire a pet sitter. You can find pet sitters both online through classifieds and through the recommendations of your friends who also have pets.
Sometimes you can get neighbors or their teens to pet-sit for you.
Ensure that your pet sitter, neighbor, or family member understands that your pet is older and needs special attention.

, If your older dog suddenly feels it does not have enough space, it might start house soiling in order to mark its territory. For example, if you recently had a baby, obtained another pet, or got married, your dog might now feel cramped for space. Provide your dog with a spacious crate and/or comfortable dog bed where it feels secure. Your dog can retreat there to self-soothe when it feels stressed and house-soiling incidents will (hopefully) decline., Doggie diapers are like regular diapers, wearable items designed to manage your older dog’s accidents. This should be the last thing you try and you should consult your dog’s veterinarian first. To use the doggie diapers, slip your dog’s rear legs through the diaper, lift it up and around its rear end, then seal the diaper using the built-in sealing mechanism.Doggie diapers are single-use and available at most pet stores.
Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to use your doggie diaper.

Groom your pal regularly.",How to Care for Your Older Dog," Some dogs' coats begin to gray, they don't jump up as quickly when they see you, they may not see you completely (cataracts, glaucoma, etc.), walking up stairs may take a bit longer, they may not respond when you call them, they seem to have forgotten most of their training - or they may seem to mope a little more each day or act grumpy.;
, Some ailments are a part of natural aging, however you never know when that frequent urination is because of a larger problem. When your dog is older, you can't overlook what may seem like a temporary problem.

, Just tone it down a bit within Old Yeller's comfort zone. Exercise keeps those old arthritic bones oiled.

, Many dogs gain or lose weight with age, so keep an eye on the diet. Your dog can benefit from the same nutrients as you, so try to choose whole foods with antioxidants, omega 3's, alpha linolenic acid (ALA)(to help reduce inflammation) - ProPlan and Nutro have holistic foods for seniors.

,, If she's disinterested in her old toys, try something new - softer, smaller, squishier.

Choose a bed with a large enough diameter for your dog.,
Make sure the bed is easy for your dog to get into.,
Find a good spot for the bed.,
Consult your vet about your dog’s medical conditions.,
Watch your dog while they sleep.,
Choose a high-quality material.,
Avoid poor-quality materials.,
Consult your vet for orthopedic bed distributors.,
Visit your local pet store.,
Shop online.",How to Buy an Orthopedic Dog Bed," Making sure the bed is of a large enough diameter will ensure that your dog does not have to curl up in uncomfortable positions in order to sleep. The larger the bed, the less pressure it will put on your dog’s joints and soft tissues.You can use the following general guidelines:


If your dog is 1 – 10 lbs, the bed should be about 18"" x 13""
If your dog is 11 – 25 lbs, the bed should be about 24"" x 18""
If your dog is 26 – 40 lbs, the bed should be about 30"" x 20""
If your dog is 41 – 70 lbs, the bed should be about 36"" x 23""
If your dog is 71 – 90 lbs, the bed should be about 42"" x 28""
If your dog is 91 – 110 lbs, the bed should be about 48"" x 30""
Bed sizes may vary by company, so consult a bed sizing chart for your dog in order to determine the appropriate size.;
, Choosing an orthopedic bed that is ground-level will allow your dog to comfortably enter and exit their bed without assistance. The less your dog has to lift their limbs to an uncomfortable height the more comfortable they will be.Stick to a 2 – 3 inch height for small dogs and a 6 – 8 inch height for large dogs., To increase your arthritic dog's comfort, find a warm place for the bed, away from cold and/or damp drafts.If the area is on hardwood, you may want to put down a rug so your dog doesn't slip when getting and out of their bed. You may also want to position it near a door to making going outside easier, or in a room where family members spend a lot of time, as your dog will probably want to be close to their people most of the time., Orthopedic beds have many uses including soothing medical conditions that your dog may have. Consult your vet to see if an orthopedic bed might relieve some of the symptoms that your dog has.


Orthopedic beds generally relieve joint problems, like arthritis; bone and soft tissue problems, like hip dysplasia, back problems, or dogs who develop sores on elbows and other bony points; and muscle loss associated with old age., Although there is not set rubric for dog sleeping styles, taking notice of how your dog often likes to sleep will help you purchase the right orthopedic bed for them. Look to see if your dog likes to hang their head off their bed or prop it up on a bolster, sleep on their back or curl up on their side. Noticing their sleeping style will help you choose a bed that can give them the most support.


Bolsters are long, narrow, stuffed cushions that surround the outside of a bed and are often the most common addition to orthopedic beds., Beds made from high-quality materials will not only last longer, but also provide as much support as possible for your dog. Look for beds made from quality materials like memory foam. Memory foam will form to your dog's body, which is especially helpful if they have muscle, joint, or bone issues as this will greatly relieve any stress.Look for orthopedic beds with high-quality fabric that can be removed and washed.
Memory foam is a popular orthopedic material and is graded by pounds. The lowest quality memory foam is 3 pound memory foam. The highest quality memory foam available on the market today is 5 pound memory foam. Choosing a higher quality memory foam will ensure your dog’s support and comfort.
Other good options are thick slabs of quilted poly fiberfill or a single, thick slab of orthopedic or high-denstiy foam (this is better than multiple, thin slabs glued together)., Orthopedic beds made from cheap or poor-quality materials will wear out quickly and will not provide your dog with the support and comfort they need. Some manufacturers choose other materials to make their products more cost-effective, which decreases the bed’s quality and longevity.


These materials are not memory foam and do not provide the orthopedic qualities of real slow recovery visco-elastic memory foam: high memory fiber fill, convoluted foam, egg crate foam, medical grade hospital foam, foam chips, shredded memory foam, recycled fiber, batting, cedar, or polyester fiber.Contact your vendor if you are unsure if the bed you are interested in purchasing contains slow recovery visco-elastic memory foam.

, Orthopedic beds can be considered specialty dogs beds, especially if they are designed to relieve a specific ailment. Your vet will most likely have information available to you regarding who to contact and what to look for.


Ask your vet at your dog’s next check up or call in to their office.

, Not all pet stores will stock orthopedic beds, but most will have the option of custom ordering or ordering online. Go into your local pet store to discuss orthopedic bed options with an employee. Going into the store will allow you to speak face to face with an employee, ask questions, and you may even bring your dog to try beds out!Talk to your local pet store employee about dog breed and size, and popular and best selling brands.

, Look around online for highly rated orthopedic beds and vendors. There are many review sites dedicated to reviewing pet products’ quality, durability, and cost. Many blogs or forums for dog owners have sections devoted entirely to orthopedic beds, user reviews, and vendor reviews. Try finding a website dedicated to reviewing dog’s beds to be able to check as many vendors, materials, and styles as possible. Even if you plan on ordering a bed through your local pet store or a vendor that your vet has recommended, shopping around online will help you get a feel for the users’ experience.

Ultimately, your vet will be able to evaluate your dog’s fitness level and make recommendations about steps you can take to strengthen your senior dog.

Ask your vet if there are any exercises they recommend for your senior dog. They may be able to give you some suggestions you had not thought of.
Make sure your dog is up to date on their annual or semiannual checkups.;
, This is especially beneficial to older dogs as they are more likely to have arthritis or low baseline levels of activity. The physiotherapist will suggest gentle massage routines and passive exercises to warm the dog's joints up prior to the actual exercise. They can suggest fun strategies to build muscular strength, such as wobble boards or stepping poles., After your vet clears your dog for exercise, you may want to consult a trainer about exercises you can do to help strengthen your dog. As specialists, trainers will have good — and safe — ideas for you to bolster your dog’s capabilities.

Contact a trainer in your community and set up a consultation. You may be able to learn a lot from just one meeting with a trainer.
If you’ve previously used a trainer for obedience school, feel free to give them a call and ask for advice. Chances are, they’ll be happy to help you., A good way to gain practical experience about how to strength train senior dogs is to ask your friends who also have older dogs. These people will be able to supply you with a wealth of knowledge that they gained overcoming the challenges that you are now faced with.

Contact friends who have senior dogs. Consider saying “Could you give me any advice about how you keep your dog strong and happy? Do you use a specific exercise routine?”
Take your dogs to dog parks and talk to people there. At dog parks, you’ll be able to access an entire community of dog parents.
Walk your dog around your neighborhood and try to interact with other dog owners. They may have some insights into exercises that strengthen senior dogs., Try to plan your dog's exercise so that they are getting a similar amount each day of the week. Concentrating all their exercise on just two or three days, such as on the weekends, means the dog will be extremely sore in the days following, since their body is not used to the extra exertion. Do your best to keep exercise consistent throughout the week., Before choosing an exercise routine for your senior dog, you need to make sure that they do not have any skeletal-muscular problems that may cause them pain or inhibit them from exercising the way you want them to.

Pay attention to whether your dog has back or hip problems. Many senior dogs have hip problems that will limit their ability to exercise.
Look to see if your dog ever drags its legs or has a limp tail. These problems could be indicative of nerve or muscle problems.
Rely on advice about your dog's skeletal-muscular health your vet has given you., Make sure your dog does not have any outstanding cardiovascular issues before you begin an exercise routine. Dogs with cardiovascular issues need to be monitored by a doctor and should not engage in heavy exercise.

Ask your doctor to measure your dog’s heart rate, blood pressure, and listen to their heart.
Dogs with heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat, should not engage in intense strength exercises., Your dog’s energy level is also important to consider when choosing exercises. Ultimately, their energy level will determine how much and how often they can exercise.

If your dog is low energy, you’ll have to reduce your expectations and work harder over a long period of time.
If your dog is high energy, you may be able to exercise longer and harder.
Read up on specific breeds and their energy level. A healthy dog’s energy level should correspond with general breed energy levels. For instance, senior Jack Russell terriers have much more energy and are more active than senior St. Bernards., The simplest way to strengthen your senior dog is to commit to a regular walking routine. By walking your dog often, you’ll slowly build up their strength. In the end, your dog will benefit from a stronger cardiovascular system.

Take your dog on several short walks every day.
Slowly increase the amount of time you walk. For instance, increase the time increments you spend walking by fifteen minutes every week or two.
Don’t rush your dog at first. Let them walk at their own pace.
If your dog ever seems tired or needs a rest, allow them to rest. If your dog doesn’t want to continue on, head home.
Locate an area with hills to provide more of a challenge to your dog., Off-leash time is one of the most important elements of helping your dog exercise. Not only will your dog be able to run around, but they’ll be able to do so in manner in which they’re comfortable. As a result, off-leash time is not only a beneficial exercise, but is important psychologically.

Allow your dog to play freely in the backyard. If you can, do so daily.
Locate a dog park near you. Allow your dog to have between a half an hour and an hour several times a week. Make sure that your dog is in an appropriate park for their size. Small dogs should never run freely with large dogs.
Try to run with your dog in your backyard or at a dog park. This way, you’ll be encouraging your senior dog to run and play with you. They’ll likely get more exercise this way than if you just let them roam around., An important thing to remember when trying to strengthen your senior dog is that older dogs just don’t have the abilities they once had. As a result, you need to avoid any activity that could hurt, injure, or over-exert your senior dog.

Don’t ever push your dog harder than you think they can handle.
Shy away from games like Frisbee.
Think twice before taking your dog jogging. While you may be training for a marathon, your dog is training for retirement., Swimming is an excellent way to improve your senior dog's strength. Not only is swimming a great exercise, but it puts very little stress on your senior dog's joints. If possible, start with a hydrotherapy pool, which will introduce your dog to the water in a safe and controlled manner. This way you can assess how they cope with the water and their endurance. Once you have established that your dog enjoys swimming and is fit enough, you can take them swimming in a pool or a safe pond or lake.

Your vet or a dog daycare or boarding facility may have a hydrotherapy pool.
Get into the water with your dog; this will allow you to monitor their swimming and to make sure they don't get hurt. This additional precaution is important, as your dog may not be the swimmer they used to be.Provide water ramps for your dog to get out of swimming pools.
Make sure to get a life vest for your dog. This will ensure they stay afloat if they suddenly tire out.
Avoid taking your senior dog swimming in rivers or other bodies of water that might have strong currents.

, Resistance vests are vests for your dog that have lead or other types of weights embedded in them. Because of this, resistance vests are a great way to maximize your dog’s strength training. They should be used on dogs that are already fairly fit.

Fit your dog with a resistance vest before you go walking.
Resistance vests are a great option if you live in an area with very flat terrain.
Look for resistance vests in which you can add more weight. This way, you can slowly strengthen your dog by adding a little more weight every couple of weeks.
Make sure your dog can handle the vest. Don’t overweight them right away. Try adding only 5% or 10% of their body weight and slowly increase by 5% over couple of weeks."

This way they will have your scent near by and it may help them feel comfortable while they are alone.

, If your aging dog is suffering from separation anxiety when you leave the house, try giving it a treat to preoccupy the dog when you leave. Puzzle-type toys filled with treats are the best because they require your dog to work in order to access the treat.For example, fill a KONG with peanut butter. This could take the dog 20-30 minutes to consume and will distract them as you leave.

, You could also try using anti-anxiety products in order to alleviate separation anxiety among older dogs. For instance, you can purchase collars and sprays made with natural dog pheromones that can help your dog to relax.

Indeed, there can be no stronger bond than the one forged working together through a war, depending on one another for survival.


There is nothing that a soldier wouldn't do for his K9 battle buddy.
There are currently almost 3,000 dogs deployed with American armed forces around the world. A soldier and his dog face the enemy together. These canines are not often mentioned but they play an active and important role in our armed forces.
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces view military working dogs as soldiers. The dogs and soldiers on the ground are working partners. There is absolutely nothing a dog handler will not do to protect their dogs. They have a very special bond with each other; they travel together, sleep together, live together, and fight together.
These dogs serve with valor and have saved countless lives.
Their duties may include sentry duty, basic patrol, tracking, tactical explosive detection, security at entry control points, maneuver and mobility support operations, search and rescue, main supply route security, helping to guard and patrol key installations, asset and personnel protection, and scouting to silently locate booby traps and concealed enemies such as snipers.
The dog's keen senses of smell and hearing make them far more effective at detecting these dangers than humans.

Military working dogs strengthen the operational abilities that their human companions must carry out in the field. They are highly capable of working in any type of combat environment.
Military Working Dogs begin their training soon after birth, while they’re still with their mother.
Military K9s are highly trained soldiers who did not volunteer for their jobs, but they have done their duty with everything they have.
These are honorable soldiers, that no matter what the task, the long hours, extreme heat or cold, danger, and combat conditions, could be counted on to do their duty.
They have always, without exception, met the demands of their handlers and of their units.

,


The K9 MWDs serve side by side with Special Ops and Navy SEAL Teams. They enthusiastically jump out of planes and parachute down into enemy territory along with their human counterparts.
They are an integral part of these highly skilled military teams and perform all the duties that go along with the job.
Like their human counterparts, the K9 SEALs are highly trained, highly skilled, highly motivated special ops experts, able to perform extraordinary military missions by Sea, Air and Land (thus the acronym). The dogs carry out a wide range of specialized duties for the military teams to which they are attached.
SEAL team dogs are the most elite of the of the elite military working dogs.

This elite K9 military veteran has been shot at.
He has served courageously to find and alert troops to bombs and explosives.
He walks out in front of soldiers to detect, alert, and clear the way when crossing mine fields.
These noble dogs place themselves in harms way to protect their fellow human soldiers. They have been shot at, are sometimes badly wounded, and can lose life and limb in service of their country. Some make the ultimate sacrifice along with their heroic handlers.
These K9 soldiers help in the disposal of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and are victims of enemy ambush maneuvers, land mines, and sniper attacks. The strength and trust of the soldier to K9 partnership is the key factor to the success of their mission.
The K9 MWD veteran has been in battle; he has seen his human battle buddies wounded, blown up, and even killed in the line of duty.

, These dogs have been in the front of military operations. They have experienced highly dangerous combat operations and have served with valor during their deployments.
These hero dogs may have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and become extremely anxious at the sound of slamming doors, fireworks, thunder storms, gunshots, and sudden loud noises. This is not something you can easily train out of him.

, Do whatever you can to help your soldier adapt and become comfortable with, and eventually confidant in situations that make him uneasy.


While you can lessen his fear and trepidation, this is not something that you can ever completely train out of him.

, These dogs have always enjoyed a special bond with their human. He needs this bond. They travel together, live together, eat together, sleep together, and fight together. You need to forge this strong relationship of trust with your dog.


Travel Together. When you go out take your dog with you whenever you can.
Live Together. Let your dog live in the house with you and enjoy the full rights and privileges of any member of your family. Don’t keep him off furniture or beds. He has spent his entire career sleeping with his brave human soldiers. Don’t make him stay outside separated from his family. He has spent his life counting on the close interspecies trust necessary for his survival.
Eat Together. Let the dog eat when you eat. Your K9 soldier has spent his career in service eating with his human soldier; don’t force a change on him. Your K9 MWD is a special dog with special needs.

, All military working dogs of the U.S. Department of Defense have undergone rigorous training. After the dogs have completed their time in service, around the age of 10, they are rehabilitated and put up for adoption.


The United States Congress honors courageous dogs, bestows rank upon them, and promises to provide for a lifetime of medical care. Indeed, the K9 soldier always outranks his handler, ensuring that, without exception, his handler will ""obey"" the MWD when he alerts to a threat.
These elite dogs have earned their rights, respect, honor, an exceptionally honorable retirement, a loving home, and the very best lifelong care.
Each year around 300 of these highly skilled combat dogs are retired from military service and are put up for adoption.This can cost as much as $2,000 to pay for his expenses.
Although Congress has committed to providing lifetime medical care for these dogs, in practice, our government has turned a blind eye to these K9 soldiers, as they have with their human battle buddies. You will be responsible for his medical care and, depending on the dog, these expenses can be quite high; more so than your ordinary dog.
If you’d like to be considered for the honor of adopting a veteran MWD be prepared to undergo a rigorous screening process; these are no ordinary dogs.
Sometimes the dogs are retired with their handlers.
If their handler is KIA they may be placed with the soldier’s family.
Some go on to careers in civilian police agencies.
Still others are adopted out ordinary families.
There is usually a 9-15 month wait to adopt one of these heroic canines. If you are selected you should fully commit to meeting your dog’s needs and be acutely aware that his special needs are different from any other dog.

, If after learning all about retired military K9s, you feel you are not equipped to provide a perfect home, one worthy of an elite hero with special needs, there are still ways you can help.

Determine if your dog is a “senior.” Most dogs can be categorized as senior when they reach between 5-10 years of age.,
Pay attention to the size and weight of your dog.,
Compare dog bed prices.,
Check out reviews.,
Get a warranty.",How to Choose a Dog Bed for a Senior Dog1," Size is a determining factor in how quickly dogs age. You can apply the seven dog years to one human year measurement to small or medium dogs (between 20-40 pounds), but large ones have a tendency to age faster. It is also a good idea to consult a vet for guidance.You can also look for physical signs of aging such as slowness of movement. This will help you to determine if a “young” dog needs senior care. The label “geriatric” is different from senior and refers to older animals with noticeable health concerns.;
, A bed should fit your dog comfortably without being too snug or restricting movement. It is a good rule to measure your dog’s length from rump to nose and then add one foot (30.5 cm) to come up with a bed size. Pay attention to a bed’s weight limits as well, as oversize dogs (over 150 lbs.; 68 kg.) may require a specialty purchase.Also, purchase a bed with an appropriate height as well, if raised. After all, a very small dog may have a great deal of difficulty climbing onto a high raised bed. This can be especially dangerous with a senior dog who may be more prone to falling injuries.

, Caring for a senior dog can get expensive and you’ll want to factor in the cost of a new bed. You generally get what you pay for with dog beds, so you can spend under $10 for a floor cushion model to over $500 for a memory foam luxury raised style. It is a good idea to comparison shop online once you have an idea as to the style that you prefer. Look for specials and member deals at pet stores.If you end up purchasing a cheaper model you might want to add some blankets underneath to make it softer for your dog. Just be careful to set up the bed so as to avoid your dog slipping., Look online for reviews by searching “senior dog beds” and “reviews.” Many sites will show you rankings, price points, photos of the product, and pros/cons lists. Keeping your budget and size parameters in mind, sort through this information to narrow down your bed options even more.Pay particular attention to any reviews describing cleaning or quality issues. With a senior pet the bed will need to be able to withstand a bit of abuse without falling apart., Some online pet companies and brick-and-mortar pet stores will offer extended warranties or guarantees on their dog beds. This is especially the case with beds that are more expensive. Memory foam beds, for example, often come with guarantees and assurances against flattening or lumpiness.Some companies have more gimmicky sounding warranties that are valid nonetheless. For example, one pet bed manufacturer guarantees that your dog bed will last 19 years or more."

Search online.,
Ask your vet.,
Talk to people in your community.,

Try out the kennel during the day.",How to Choose a Boarding Kennel for a Senior Dog," Before allowing a kennel to care for your senior dog, you should conduct a substantial internet search to get an idea of the kennel’s overall character and reputation. An internet search may reveal reviews by current or former clients at the kennel. Ultimately, you’ll probably be able to gather considerable information about people’s experiences with the kennel.


Do a search for the name of the kennel in question. See what websites and reviews come up. Spend time going through these reviews. Watch for keywords like “mean” or “annoyed” when reviewers describe a kennel.
Visit popular sites like Yelp to see if anyone has submitted reviews about the kennel in question.
Try to scan through as many reviews as you can so you get a complete vision of the kennel’s online reputation. Don’t just stop after a couple good or bad reviews.
Focus on recent reviews, as they're best representative of the kennel's current practices.;
, Make sure to ask your veterinarian if they know of any good kennels in your area. As your dog’s primary medical provider, your vet should have some very good ideas about what local kennels can provide quality housing for your senior dog.


Many veterinarians also offer a kennel service, but this is often more expensive than kennels that focus just on boarding. Ultimately, if your dog has a serious medical condition, you may just want to board with the veterinarian. However, if you want to save money, your vet may be able to recommend another kennel.
Find out if your vet has a list of kennels. This is important, as some kennels may book up at certain times of the year.
Ask your vet if there is anything you should look for at a kennel when evaluating it., You should also think about asking people in your community about their experience with local kennels. By relying on this huge wealth of experience, you may be able to find a good kennel for your senior dog.


Ask pet care professionals, like managers of local pet stores.
Take recommendations from your friends, colleagues, and neighbors.
If you call one kennel and they’re booked, they may be able to recommend another kennel in the area if you ask them.

, On your first visit to the kennel, you should pay attention to the general cleanliness of the facilities. This is important, since senior dogs that have outstanding medical conditions may be more susceptible to bacterial or viral infections.


If possible, ask the kennel employees to allow you to visit many parts of their facilities. This way, you’ll have a better idea of their overall cleanliness or if they just keep a section clean for visitors.
Inquire about what sort of cleaning solution the kennel uses. For instance, say something like “I’m wondering what cleaners you use to disinfect kennels and other areas.” This is important because you want to make sure they use something effective, but also that your senior dog won’t be poisoned by whatever the kennel uses.
Look at water bowls and food bowls to see if they are clean and if the dogs have clean water.
Ask them how often they clean the runs and other areas of the kennel -- they should be cleaned daily., Worker attentiveness is especially important for senior dogs that have outstanding medical problems.


Listen to how the workers to talk to the other dogs at the kennel. Do they shower the dogs with compliments and affection, or do they seem annoyed and hateful toward the dogs in their care? Positive words like “good dog” or “pretty dog” are a good sign. Also consider their tone. If should sound like they enjoy their job and value the dogs in their care.
Find out if they provide pillows or blankets., This is especially important for senior dogs that may not be able to hold their bladders for long periods of time.


If your dog has special needs, inquire as to whether your dog can be allowed to go outside more frequently.
Inquire as to whether your dog will be walked on a leash or allowed to run freely in a fenced area.
If your dog needs to be walked on a leash, find out if that is a service they offer., You also need to look for potential hazards at the kennel. These hazards could potentially be everywhere and may even be innocuous at first glance. Look for:


Sharp corners on fences or gates. This especially important to avoid for senior dogs that may not see that good.
Angular protrusions of any sort that may hurt your senior dog.
Gates that don’t close properly. Senior dogs may not fare well in a dog fight. Make sure the kennel has gates and fences that are properly secure., One of the first things you need to ask the kennel is whether they have a veterinarian on call. This is especially important for senior dogs that may have medical conditions that could rapidly deteriorate.


The kennel will ask you to sign paperwork giving them authorization to allow a veterinarian to treat your dog.
Find out the name or names of vets that the kennel has on call.
If the kennel does not have an on call vet, ask if they will contact your regular vet.
Ask if the kennel will defer to your regular vet, if you prefer., Since senior dogs may be on regular medicine to regulate health problems, you should inquire how kennel employees administer it.


Make sure they label your pet’s medicine. In addition, make sure your pet’s run or room is clearly labeled so that employees do not confuse your dog with another and accidentally administer the wrong medicine.
Ask them about how they store their medicine. This is especially important if your dog takes insulin or other medications that need to be refrigerated.
Inquire as to whether they have experience administering injectable medicines, if this impacts you., Make sure to inquire about their feeding policies, as your senior dog may have a particular diet that needs to be regulated. If the kennel has unclear feeding policies, it is possible that your dog’s dietary needs may not be taken care of.


Question them about the food they serve the dogs in their care. This food may or may not be acceptable for your dog’s diet.
Inquire as to whether you can provide specific food for your dog and if the kennel will make sure that your dog is served that food.
Find out whether your dog can be fed at several times during the day. For purposes of medication, diet, or other needs, your dog may need to be fed three or four times during the day. It is important that the kennel provides this service., A great way to evaluate a kennel is to try it out on a very limited basis. By doing this, you'll be able to experience the kennel as a regular customer, but your dog won't be there for too long if the kennel turns out to offer substandard services.


Inquire as to whether the kennel offers daycare services.
Inspect your dog before you drop them off to the kennel. Make sure you're aware of any bruises, scraps, and their smell.
Inspect your dog again after you've picked them up. See if they're injured at all or if they smell a lot worse than when you dropped them off.
Observe practices, attentiveness, and the demeanor of employees when you drop your dog off and pick them up.

Let people bring outside food.",How to Open a Dog Friendly Restaurant," Think about who you want to cater to, and how you intend to serve them. Of course pet owners are part of your clientele, but that can cover a variety of people. You also want to think about the atmosphere of your restaurant. This includes the kind of service your customers will get. Will you have a wait staff to take orders, or will customers place an order to pick up when the food is ready?For example, “empty nesters,” people in their 50s and early 60s whose children have moved out, may have dogs, but when they dine out they are usually looking for a more upscale restaurant. They probably won’t enjoy a place where you pick up food from a window, which may be a necessary step to keep your servers from touching the dogs.;
, All restaurants must follow health and safety codes, which may include statements about allowing dogs. In most cases, you must keep dogs away from areas where food is prepared. Check that the code passed by your state and municipality allows for dogs, if they must be kept outdoors, and any other restrictions there may be.The federal government does not issue health codes, only recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The only federal law that deals with dogs in restaurants is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that service and guide dogs are allowed. There are no federal laws banning dogs from restaurants, and your restaurant cannot be punished by the federal government for allowing them.
Even if you are not allowed to let dogs at your restaurant, you can apply for a variance which will allow you an exception. To get a variance, you will need to demonstrate that you are taking steps to prevent whatever violations would otherwise happen if you allowed dogs. For example, you may require that your servers wash their hands after touching or petting any furry visitors before handling someone’s food.

, Any restaurant needs to be licensed by state and local governments before it opens. These usually involve health licenses, which require a visit from the health inspector, music licenses if you intend to play music, and a liquor license if you would like to sell alcohol. When you go to the local office for a permit, check if there are any licenses required to be dog friendly. You will need to fill out these licenses and wait for approval before opening your restaurant.


A permit for a dog patio in Maricopa County, Arizona, for example, will require you to document and prove how dogs will access the patio, any signage for patrons, how you will prepare food and prevent cross-contamination, your procedures for cleaning the area, and what dog friendly chemicals you will be using for cooking and cleaning., Location matters when choosing the spot for your restaurant, and you’ll need to be accessible to dog owners. You will probably keep customers and pets in outdoor seating areas, which means you’ll need tables and chairs for outside use. People will need to be able to access this area without going through the main dining area.If you live in an area that gets cold for part of the year, consider heaters and fire pits to keep the area warm and comfortable. You probably won’t be able to enclose the space, even temporarily.If you have the space, you can also create an outdoor play area for visiting dogs. This can be an open space near your restaurant for dogs and their owners to play and run around. More expansive restaurants can have toys, dog runs, or other fun activities for canines., Like with any significant investment, you’ll want to purchase insurance coverage to make sure you are protected from risks from accidents, injuries, or other disasters. In many states, you will be required to purchase certain kinds of insurance as part of running your business, especially if you have employees, such as workers’ compensation, unemployment, and disability insurance.In the case of a dog friendly restaurant, insurance coverage can protect you from issues that may arise from having dogs in the restaurant. These could be staff or customers tripping over dog leashes, or getting hurt by a dog, or someone injuring themselves after being startled by a dog’s bark. Depending on where you are, you may be liable if a dog gets loose, and injures other dogs or pedestrians outside the restaurant., A restaurant is a pretty labor-intensive undertaking, and you’ll need lots of people there to help you keep things running smoothly. Staff positions can include chef or cook, waiters, and janitors. Make sure these people will be comfortable working around dogs, and aren’t allergic.


You’ll need some guidelines to make sure your employees carefully follow health code regulations around the dogs. Make sure employees limit their physical contact with the dogs, especially if they are handling food. You should probably require that they wash their hands if there is any contact.Make sure your employees’ taxes are sorted out as well. Your workers need to fill out both the I-9 Form (for employment eligibility) and W-4 Form (for taxation). Keep all your employees' tax forms filed for easy reference., When you are marketing your restaurant to the community, make sure people know that they can bring their dogs. Your advertisements should encourage people to bring dogs. Post notices in areas with dog lovers like pet stores, kennels, obedience schools, and dog parks.


Consider have specials and deals involving people who bring their dogs. You can designate “Dog Days,” specific days or times where you offer deals only for people who do bring dogs, or donate gift certificates to animal shelters for people who adopt pets. Just make sure any giveaway identifies your business name, location, times you are open, and if there are any restrictions.You should also make sure people know that you are dog friendly in case they would rather not eat there. Some people are allergic, or maybe don’t want to deal with having dogs nearby when eating. Making that clear before people come in can avoid difficult situations., Many dog friendly restaurants will provide food or treats for dogs that visit. A bowl of treats can be a nice addition to give furry patrons another thing to enjoy while at your restaurant.If you really want to encourage people to bring dogs, consider providing meals, even beyond a bowl of kibble. Just make sure you are providing food that is safe for dogs to eat. Meats like shrimp, eggs, turkey, pork, and tuna are good choices, along with things like corn, yogurt, honey, and peanuts. Avoid foods and flavorings like chocolate, cinnamon, garlic, ice cream, almonds, or macadamia nuts., In addition to being toxic, dog waste also smells, which won’t help in attracting customers. Many state and local governments require that dog waste is cleaned up from public places.Make sure you have a space for visiting dogs to do their business, and a place to get rid of it properly.


To help keep your space clean, and prevent your staff from having to do the extra work, encourage your customers to clean up after their dogs. Make sure you have a supply of bags and separate trash bins for people to use.

, There are many dog breeds out there. Depending on your surroundings, you may want to be careful about how many and what kinds of dogs you allow at your restaurant. You may only allow a certain number of dogs to be at your restaurant, or avoid certain breeds due to concerns about behavior.Another rule to consider is requiring that customers remain with their dogs, or at least keep them on a leash. Some states may even require it in their licensing requirements, so make sure you are clear on that point.
Whatever rules you come up with for your visitors, make sure those are clearly listed somewhere so everyone can see them. While you hope that people will pay attention, you should be prepared to remove people and their pets if they have a problem following the rules.

, In some cases, you can allow dogs inside as long as you don’t serve any food beyond pre-packaged snacks, like pretzels or potato chips. Depending on your location, your patrons will be able to bring dogs inside since there is no food to prepare. Just make sure you know how much and what type of food qualifies you as a “restaurant” according to local regulations., Another way to get around restaurant regulations is to open a private club where members are allowed to bring their dogs. People can join the club and pay dues, annually or monthly, for access to the restaurant and whatever other amenities you choose to offer. Rules will vary depending on where you are, but by restricting your business only to members and their guests (and not the general public), you may be outside the jurisdiction of some health codes.Make sure you know what makes you legally a private club. In North Carolina for example, only members and their guests are allowed to patronize the club. Employees or “the House” (that's you as the proprietor) cannot admit patrons who are not members., You can create a location where people can gather to eat and enjoy meals that they get from other places. You can allow people to bring food from elsewhere, or even provide take-out or delivery menus from other nearby places that can be delivered to your location. Consider setting up some music or TVs for additional entertainment, and encourage patrons other than dog owners."

It is also necessary and beneficial to have knowledge about socialization techniques for dogs as well as how to read canine body posture in order to have the most success.Greyhounds, for example, are known for their mild, sweet temperament while Siberian Huskies can be very challenging and independent due to their high level of intelligence.;
, Expose yourself to multiple breeds to discover if there are any that you aren’t comfortable around. Also consider trying out related services such as dog sitting, grooming, and feeding. Use what you learn from these experiences to decide which breeds and services to include in or exclude from your business., As a professional dog walker, you’ll be expected to have excellent interpersonal communication skills, be active and fit, and also be extremely comfortable with walking all types of dogs. Volunteer to walk dogs being temporarily kept at a kennel or rescue shelter so that over time, practice will make perfect., Change up where you walk a friend’s dog or your own dog. Get to know your area better so that you can figure out the best locations and times to run your business.

If you live in a city, for example, consider driving the dogs a couple miles away from downtown where there is more nature and fewer people.
If you live somewhere hot, such as Arizona, you may need to adjust your hours in the summertime for the safety of the dogs., As you walk your own dog or a friend’s dog, do your best to prepare for and prevent dangerous situations. When another walker walks by with a dog, place yourself between the two dogs so that they don’t get too close. Carry a can of citronella spray whenever you’re walking a dog so that you can deter any aggressive dogs or even wild animals that suddenly approach the dog you’re walking.

If the dog you’re walking has aggressive tendencies with other dogs, avoid taking the dog to a dog park., You can either go the simple, straightforward route and create a name like “Sally’s Dog Walking” or go with something cute and catchy, like “Sir Barks-A-Lot Dog Walking.” If you think you may want to expand in the future to add on other pet care services, don't end your business name in ""dog walking"".

, Make final decisions about what services you’d like to include in your business, and also come up with prices for each service so you can give prospective customers straightforward, consistent information.

On average, dog walkers charge somewhere between $15 and $30 an hour. For the sake of getting your business going, it’s a good idea to start with low prices and move up as you acquire customers.Research other dog walkers in your area to come up with fair, competitive prices.

, There are many different ways that you can run your dog business. It might be your natural instinct to run it as a sole proprietor, but also consider choosing a different kind of organization, such as a limited liability company (LLC) or a corporation. These may be a little more expensive, but they’ll offer you much more protection.

If you make your business a corporation or LLC, your personal and business assets will be kept separate, which protects you financially if any dogs cause damage or harm, or if harm is done to them., Dog walkers rarely have to get a license specifically for dog walking, but they usually do have to get a general business license for having their own business. To find out which license you need to get (if any), search online to find out what your state requires., There are many different laws that exist that may conflict with your dog walking plans or habits. You’ll want to learn these early on to avoid getting fined. Contact the local authorities via phone or email or look online to find out what laws exist in your area.

Many areas have strict dog sanitation regulations that require you to pick up dog waste immediately.
Many areas have leashing laws, which allow dogs to be off leash in specified spaces and require that they’re leashed in others., While dog walking seems like harmless fun, there are risks that come with physical activity and the handling of live animals. Your insurance will vary based on how big your business is, but no matter the business’s size, you can acquire insurance specifically for caring for animals.


Even if you’re very careful, there’s always a chance that a dog you’re walking can hurt someone, cause damage to personal property, get detached from the leash, get attacked by another dog, etc., Write up a contract and make sure to require that every customer signs it before you walk their dog(s). Even if you clarify your services and prices verbally, a miscommunication could cause damage to your reputation or even result in a threat or lawsuit. By having a clear, detailed contract, you’ll keep any customers from claiming that you did something differently than you said you would. Some things you should include in your contract are:


Where you walk dogs
How long you walk dogs for
How you handle billing and payment
Whether there are certain breeds you don’t handle
How many dogs you walk at once
Statements regarding liability if your dog gets aggressive or out of control, Creating an informative, attractive, professional website is probably the best way you can market your business. When people need something, the first thing they’re usually going to do is search for it online. Use a website builder like Squarespace, Weebly, or Wix to make a website that will spread the word.Share your business’s website on social media to spread the word even more.

, Design a business card online with a company like Vistaprint, that makes customizing and ordering business cards easy and inexpensive. Resist handing your card out to anyone and everyone. Instead, stick to veterinary clinics, pet supply stores, as well as family and friends who are likely to pass the word along.


Your business card should be attractive and include at least your business name, website, and contact information (phone number and email address)., One of the best ways to market your business is by going above and beyond for the customers that you do have. Satisfied customers will likely recommend you to their dog owning friends, which will increase your number of clients.Consider giving a referral discount to clients who bring in new clients. By sharing that you’ll give anyone who gets you a new client 2 free 30 minute walks, for example, you’ll give them an extra incentive to spread the word.

Don’t view the soiling problem in isolation.,
Look for anxiety or fear.,
Look for aggression and irritability.,
Keep an eye out for depression.,
Check for signs of arthritis.,
Get your dog regular checkups.",How to Deal with House Soiling in Older Dogs3," Older dogs often have a host of related issues pertaining to both emotional and physical health that could be linked to their house-soiling behavior. Just because your dog is getting old, it doesn’t mean that you cannot do anything to help them. Confronting your dog’s other health issues may help you better deal with their house-soiling., If you notice your dog is startled by sounds that used to cause only curiosity (or elicit no reaction), or is cowering behind furniture when another person comes over, your dog might be experiencing a decline in confidence. There are a number of specific conditions that can cause anxiety or fear in an older dog, including Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (similar to Alzheimer’s) or a decline in your dog’s sense of smell, sight, or hearing.Be gentle with your older dog if it demonstrates that it is becoming fearful or anxious.
Approach your dog from the front so it can see you if you notice a decline in its sense of sight or sound.
This change in behavior might also be due to pain or physical discomfort. Take your older dog see the vet if it becomes fearful where it previously was not.
If your dog’s sight is failing, try to keep your furniture in its usual place so your dog can easily locate it and navigate the house.

, Some dogs, like some people, become grouchy in their old age. Your older dog might become combative with other dogs, especially younger puppies. If your dog starts barking, quarreling with other dogs, or growling at other dogs or people, take it to a vet.Additionally, try to reduce the number of irritating stimuli in your dog’s environment. For instance, limit your dog’s contact with other dogs and puppies, or whatever it is that sets your dog on edge.
Your dog’s irritability might be due to pain, Canine Cognitive Dysfunction, or loss of its sight, smell, or hearing. Your vet will be able to offer more advice.

, Depression is not uncommon in older dogs. Unfortunately, dogs cannot talk about their feelings. But they will communicate that something is wrong through their actions. If your dog doesn’t eat as much as it usually does, spends more time sleeping, and seems nervous for no particular reason (evidenced by walking back and forth along a stretch of the house or whimpering for no particular reason), it might be depressed.To combat your dog’s depression, provide more opportunities for play, and take your dog for daily walks.
Your dog also picks up on emotional cues from you, so if you’re feeling blue, your dog might too. Both of you could benefit from walking about or meeting a friend (especially if that friend has a dog your older dog could meet).

, Many signs of arthritis could be confused for depression. For instance, if your dog no longer enjoys playing the games it used to, this might be a sign of depression, but it might also just be age-related arthritis and pain in the dog’s legs. Likewise, an arthritic dog might sleep more than a healthy older dog. But arthritis might also lead your dog to become irritable or aggressive. Finally, an arthritic dog might not want to climb stairs or jump on the sofa or bed, or might limp slightly when walking.Talk to your vet if you believe your dog has arthritis. Your vet can recommend lifestyle and dietary changes that could help. Your vet might recommend medication for your dog, too.
Never give your dog arthritis medication designed for humans.

, As your dog ages, it is increasingly important to be proactive in managing your dog’s health so as to catch illness or medical conditions before they become serious. Chances of heart disease, kidney disease, cancer, and other illnesses are all common in older dogs. That way, your dog will have a healthy and happy life, and be able to enjoy its old age.Make the most of your time with the vet. If you have questions about caring for your older dog, don’t be shy - ask away!
Contact your vet whenever you have a question about your dog’s health.

Know your style options.,
Consider a raised design.,
Think about adding bolsters.,
Look into memory foam.",How to Choose a Dog Bed for a Senior Dog2," Not all dog beds are the same. There are pod beds for small dogs. Pillow beds that resemble a bean bag. Mattress beds that are totally flat. Travel beds that fold up for quick carrying. For a senior dog, an orthopedic or foam bed is generally the best option as it provides the most support and ease of access. So, any time that you see orthopedic in the bed’s description, take another look., A raised bed literally keeps your dog from laying on the floor by positioning the bed above the ground via four legs. Senior dogs prefer these beds as they maintain a warmer temperature, which is soothing for pained joints. They are also often easier to get into as they do not require stooping down low.Raised beds can also minimize the growth of bacteria by allowing air to flow under the bed area. This will reduce foul smells as well.
It is better to choose a bed with galvanized metal or aluminum legs. PVC tubing beds don’t hold up to chewing very well and can lead to choking if pieces break off.
To prevent joint strain, it is best to choose a bed that is no more than 10 inches (25 cm) off of the ground.

, Bolsters are a medium-firm raised ridge that can extend along part of the upper area of your dog bed. These provide a soft area for your dog to rest its head. It can also lessen anxiety in older dogs who may be worried about having their back exposed when laying down.Younger dogs may prefer beds with all-around bolsters, but these can provide access issues for older dogs who can’t step over them easily. Instead, go with a partially bolstered bed., This is a thick type of polyurethane cushion that is noted for providing firm and consistent support to both dogs and humans alike. Look for a foam that has a 3+ density measurement for the best quality. With this density even a memory foam pad that looks rather thick can actually provide a great deal of comfort for a senior dog’s aching joints.The best quality memory foam beds are made from one single slab. However, if you are looking for a cheaper version you can find beds that are made from multiple slabs stuck together.
If memory foam is not an option you can always look into egg-crate foam as an alternative or even the traditional poly-fill pillow style beds.

Be aware of possible allergens.,
Purchase extra padding.,
Pay attention to the accessory options.,
Get a washable bed.,
Consider a heated model.,
Make a bed on your own.",How to Choose a Dog Bed for a Senior Dog3," Foam beds are generally hypoallergenic; however, be careful when purchasing ‘combination-material’ beds. These are beds that may have a foam base supplemented with a feather topper. The feathers can trigger an allergic reaction in older dogs, especially if they are already suffering from respiratory issues., If you own a large dog you may need to add supplemental padding to whichever bed you choose. This is because the weight and size of your dog may compress the regular padding down to almost nothing, leaving little support for joints. When purchasing the bed see if the manufacturer sells additional padding. If not, you may want to simply put a slab of memory foam underneath the entire bed. Again, try to keep slipping issues in mind., Try to purchase a bed that comes with a wide variety of accessory options that will allow you to customize everything to your dog’s particular needs. You may be able to purchase an additional cover to help with cleaning. Or, perhaps a hair-repellant cover if your older dog sheds heavily., Cleanliness should be a determining factor in your dog bed purchase. You’ll need to clean the bed at least twice monthly and more so in the event of any accidents. Cleaning helps to prevent any skin or smell issues while also removing potential parasites. Look for a bed that is fully machine washable or one that allows for heavy spot cleaning.Buying a waterproof under cover or sheet is also a good idea. This is a plastic-like cover that can go underneath the soft top cover.If your mattress starts to accumulate odors, try spot cleaning it with a vinegar and water mixture. Sun can also help to sanitize the bed, but it can also cause damage to foam., Cold is often a senior dog's nemesis. Look for a dog bed that comes with a built-in body heat retention option or a space for a heating blanket attachment. Some beds even come with separate microwaveable heating pads. This is especially comforting for dogs suffering from arthritis., If nothing on the market suits your tastes or parameters you might try to make your senior dog’s bed yourself. There are various guides online to help you design a bed that combines both form and function. Just keep your dog’s safety and comfort in mind.You can make a bed by weaving nylon fabric strips through a raised frame. Another option is to convert a piece of furniture, such as an old open-front TV stand.

Play hide and seek.,
Teach your chihuahua to help clean up.,
Have a tug-o-war with your chihuahua.,
Get your chihuahua to play fetch.",How to Play with a Chihuahua1," You can play hide and seek with multiple people and multiple dogs if you want, or you can play it alone with just your chihuahua. First, tell your chihuahua to stay in one place (he’ll need to know this command) and then go hide somewhere in your house. Once you’re hiding, call your chihuahua’s name so he’ll come find you.You may need to say your chihuahua’s name a couple of times if he isn’t use to the game yet.
If your chihuahua doesn’t know the stay command, or isn’t good at it, you might need another person to hold him in one spot while you hide. Once your hidden, that person can let him go and he’ll come find you.
Make sure you only hide in place where your chihuahua can get to or is allowed.;
, If your chihuahua has a lot of toys, chances are they end up all over the house throughout the day. A great game to play with your chihuahua at the end of each day is to have him fetch his toys and put them away in the toy box.Such a game will require some training in order for your chihuahua to learn certain commands.
For example, you may want to use the command “clean-up” to indicate your chihuahua needs to find all the toys and bring them to you.
Another example is to teach your chihuahua a command, like “in the basket” to tell your chihuahua he needs to place each toy in the toy box.

, Either using a rope (there are rope toys of all sizes specifically made for dogs) or another favourite toy, play tug-o-war with your chihuahua. Basically you want to grab the toy at the same time as your chihuahua and not let go. Your chihuahua will then tug on the toy to try to get it away from you.If you have more than one chihuahua, you might even be able to teach them to play tug-o-war with each other. Or they might just figure it out themselves when they both want to play with the same toy at the same time!

, Fetch is a game that comes naturally to some dogs due to their instincts; chihuahuas are one of those breeds. When you throw a toy for your chihuahua, he may instinctively go get that toy and bring it back to you. If he does this, use the word “fetch” while he’s bringing the toy back so he begins to associate the command with the action he’s performing. Eventually he’ll understand that when you throw a toy and say “fetch,” he’s suppose to bring the toy to you.While in training, your chihuahua may not always bring the toy back to you when you throw it. If he doesn’t bring it back to you, and instead you have to go get it, remember not to say the command “fetch.""

Teach your dog tricks.,
Take your dog to a dog park.",How to Make Your Dog More Playful1," Dogs like to chase and retrieve items, including bones and balls. If you can, try to train your dog to come to you before you throw the item and then bring it back to you once they retrieve it.Say “come” and get your dog to approach you. Get your dog to sit by putting the ball on their forehead and stating “sit”
When you throw the ball, tell your dog to “get it”. After they retrieve it, tell them “bring it here” to have them take it back to you to throw again.;
, Show off the toy to your dog, but don’t play with it immediately. Try tug toys or braided rope toys that you can play back and forth with them. You can also try teething or training toys that can strengthen your dog’s teeth.Talk excitedly to your dog about the toy by saying things like “Where is it?” in reference to the dog toy. If your dog wants to play, they should begin wagging their tale and get excited.
When you take out the dog toy, play with it first before you start playing with the dog. Use the toy to play with the dog for a brief amount of time before they get tired with it. This will help build their excitement for the next time you break out the dog toys.

, Dogs like finding people and objects that are hidden. These types of games can stimulate your dog’s mind and their senses.While your dog is in the other room, hide in another room. Call them to come and find you. When they do, give them treats and dog toys to reward them.
You can also hide doggie treats somewhere in the yard or in a room. When your dog comes into the room, they should sniff around in search of the treat. Give them encouragement when they get closer or farther away from finding the treat.

, Your dog might get happy when he's around other dogs. For many dogs, having some friendly play with their fellow canines can be engaging and exciting.


Your dog may like to roughhouse, but make sure things do not get out of hand. When they are play fighting, dogs will often avoid really biting the other dog and roll over often.If your dog is growling when playing with other dogs, their play fighting may have escalated into real fighting. You can also tell if they begin baring their teeth while wrestling with the other dog., Dog tricks can be fun, but also very useful. While there are many different tricks you can teach your dog, a few essential tricks can really show off your dog’s ability and make them more playful.Rollover is one easy trick to teach your dog. When your dog is lying down, move a food lure across its muzzle, neck, and shoulders. Use the command “Roll over” while doing so to get them to associate your command with the action.
Stay can also be a very useful command. Ask your dog to sit in front of you while holding a treat and maintaining eye contact. If they are able to stay still, reward them with the treat and add the command “Stay” so they know what to do when you state the command.
A “Go to” command can be useful in directing your dog. With a treat, walk to a whichever place you want them to go and place the treat there. Eventually, they will associate the place with the treat and with your specific “Go to” command.

, Dog parks can a fun place for your dog to play with other dogs. It’s important for your dog to be able to play well with other dogs, so they don’t get into any fights with other dogs.After you’ve walked around the park with the dog to make sure it’s safe, you can take off their leash so they can run around. You’ll want to know where your dog is at all times, but not having a leash gives them greater freedom to roam around the park.
If you have a small dog, try to bring them specifically to a section of the park with other small dogs. Otherwise, they may get overwhelmed.

If your dog is nervous, shy, aggressive, or has any other qualities that cause him to behave in standoffish or threatening ways around people, then he would not be a good fit for therapy work. A therapy dog needs to be calm and comfortable when:He is approached by or surrounded by many people (children or adults).
He is roughly touched or hugged by someone.
He hears a loud noise or is in a loud environment.
He is around medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, hydraulic lifts, and beeping machines.;
, Even if your dog seems calm in various environments, he may be stressed and this is not good for him. Start paying attention to your dog’s body language to determine if he enjoys being around various types of people, or if he merely tolerates it. Some signs that your dog may be uncomfortable include:A stiff posture.
Shaking or trembling.
Looking down or away from people.
Wrinkling his brow.
Growling or baring his teeth.
Not approaching people and remaining by your side or somewhere isolated.

, If you believe that your dog has the demeanor for therapy work, then try meeting with a representative from a local animal therapy organization in your area. They can help you to further evaluate whether or not therapy work would be a good match for your dog., A volunteer dog should be fully housetrained. You cannot bring collection devices with you. It is a hazard for your dog to use the bathroom around those who are ill., Your dog will need to be able to respond reliably to commands like “sit,” “down,” “stay,” “come,” and “leave.” These will be important to control your dog in an unfamiliar environment., When on a leash, your dog should not try to rush ahead and pull you. It should be trained to walk politely by your side.


When training your dog for loose leash walking, you must discourage it whenever it runs ahead of you. If it begins to run out ahead and pull on the leash, stop. It will slowly learn that there is nothing to be gained by this sort of behavior.
If this technique does not work, you can even turn around and begin walking in the opposite direction when your dog runs out ahead. Use commands to get your dog to stop and come toward you., Your dog should enjoy interacting with new people and should never grow angry or aggressive in the company of others. Any history of attacking other dogs or people will automatically disqualify your dog from volunteering.The best way to socialize your dog is to expose it to new experiences and people on a regular basis. Take your dog out to the park, to friends’ homes, and on car trips.
Your dog will get tired if it has been out too long. Bad experiences can make your dog less social. Instead of keeping your dog out all day, try to go out for frequent, but short, trips.

, Formal programs often provide excellent training and even certification. Passing the A.K.C Canine Good Citizenship training program, in particular, will tell Pet Partner’s that your dog is ready to volunteer.You can find local clubs that offer the A.K.C course through the organization’s website.
The price of an exam varies from location to location, but is usually very affordable, costing as little as $10., Some organizations do not permit dogs on a raw meat diet to participate in their programs. Feeding your dog raw food can result in illness. This can subject surrounding humans to the risk of infection, making it a liability for patients., Particularly, you will be required to vaccinate your dog against rabies. A dog infected with rabies can be a threat to the patients., Your dog is more likely to get sick if it left out in the elements, exposed to environmental threats. While you can keep your dog outside, there are steps you should make to keep it safe while outside.Provide a dog house. Some sort of shelter will help keep your dog dry and warm in bad weather.
Build a fence. Without a fence, strangers and others animals will be more likely to enter your dog’s territory and, possibly, spread disease to it.
If your dog is in a kennel, clean it regularly to prevent the development of disease.

, Dirty water encourages infections that can be spread to humans, especially patients with a compromised immune system. Replace your dog’s water daily., Your dog is liable to get sicker if sent to a therapy visit and might pass diseases on to patients with compromised immune systems. If your dog is currently on medication for an illness, wait until it has finished its program before registering.


Your dog will be asked to wait before volunteering if it is currently on antibiotics, antifungals, or immunosuppressant., Volunteer organizations want to work with owners who will protect their dogs. When controlling your dog, do not raise your voice or jerk on the leash. You should not need to reward your dog with food or toys to obtain obedience., You should be able to tell when your dog is uncomfortable and be prepared to remove it from threatening situations. You should always advocate for your dog’s safety and comfort.


If your dog is uncomfortable interacting with a patient it could strike out. Thus, it is important to recognize when your dog is uncomfortable and put its needs first., You should be able to talk to patients while controlling your dog. You should be friendly with them but you should also be willing to politely correct them if they are upsetting your dog.The patients will probably be more interested in your dog than you. But you should be ready for small talk. Ask “how are you doing?”
Some patients might not want to talk about their conditions. Unless they mention it, discuss subjects that will distract them. Ask what type of pets they like or if they have a favorite breed of dog. What is their favorite television show? What do they like to do in their free time?
If your dog looks uncomfortable, say something politely like “I think you are petting him too hard” or “It takes a second for him to warm up to new people. Give him a little bit of time to rest and he should come to you.”

, You can’t volunteer a dog that you just met, because you can’t vouch for its training. You need to have owned your dog for at least 6 months before volunteering it. The dog must be at least a one year old., Go online and search for local volunteering options. Consider calling local retirement homes or hospitals to see if they work with any established organizations.


Established organizations are the best way to find volunteering opportunities. Pet Partners’ website has a list of local events and programs. Do a zip code search to verify that there are programs in your area for which you can volunteer your dog. You will need to go the Volunteer Center and create an account to register., Any organization that allows you to volunteer your pet will require that you perform training. Some training programs might include supervised visits. Other times you might even be able to take an online course., You will need to prove that your dog is healthy enough to participate. Most organizations will give a form that you can pass along to your veterinarian. Take the form to a veterinarian who will check your dog’s health and sign off on the form, saying that your dog meets the health requirements for the program., After you have finished these steps you can schedule an evaluation with a licensed professional. The evaluation will be a mock patient visit. You will need to demonstrate that you can perform all the previously mentioned skills, including handling your dog and interacting positively with a patient.


You will need to be able to politely command your dog.
Your dog will need to be controlled and friendly.
You will need to prove that you are attentive to your dog’s needs.

, Most volunteering organizations rely upon their members to support them financially. After you have been accepted into the program, you will likely need to pay a fee. The fee might be as much as $100. "

Make time to play with your chihuahua every day.,
Walk your chihuahua every day.,
Allow your chihuahua a large area to run around.,
Ensure your chihuahua’s toys are small enough for his mouth.,
Use a harness on your chihuahua instead of a collar.,
Consider getting your chihuahua a friend.",How to Play with a Chihuahua2," Chihuahuas, in general, are energetic. If they do not have structured play time, they’ll usually attempt to entertain themselves in a way that may be distractive or frustrating to you as a human. In order to make sure your chihuahua has some play time to work off some of his excess energy, and to make sure you have time to interact with him, schedule time to play with him every day.It is best to make this play time the same time every day. Your chihuahua will learn what time is play time and will come to expect it.
This play time should be dedicated to your dog, which means you don’t get distracted by other activities you may also need to do.
This might also be a great time every day to take your chihuahua outside, maybe into your backyard, where you can chase him or have him play fetch with plenty of room.

, Think of your daily walk with your chihuahua as both good for you and for him. It gives you a 30 minute walk outside every day, and it gives him a chance to work off some energy. To make things interesting, don’t walk the same route every day, change it up.A 30 minute walk is likely long enough for your chihuahua. Unlike larger dogs, your chihuahua will not be able to go jogging or hiking with you.You can, however, carry your chihuahua with you in a dog carrier that’s also a backpack or even a stroller.

, Because the inside of your house or apartment may be too small, and may have a lot of breakable items, you will probably want to keep the energy level of play inside at a much lower level than outside. Every now and again, take your chihuahua outside to a place where you can take off his leash and allow him to run around all he wants. In an ideal situation, this could be your backyard. But if you don’t have a large enough yard, or you don’t have a yard at all, you might want to consider a dog park or fenced area where you know it’s safe.Be careful where you let your chihuahua off his leash. Some cities and municipalities may have bylaws regarding where dogs can be allowed off-leash. Not to mention some open areas or even dog parks may have large, aggressive dogs also off-leash that may harass or injure your chihuahua.
You may also want to consider doggy day care for your chihuahua. Doggy day cares are great in that they keep your dog entertained all day while you’re at work. That means you dog isn’t getting into trouble in an empty house and he’s burning off energy before you get home. Some doggy day cares have large indoor and outdoor play areas where the dogs can run around and play with each other.

, Chihuahuas are small and so are their mouths. As such, most regular-sized dog toys are too big for them to hold onto with their mouths. This means you may have to be careful about the size of toys you buy your chihuahua. One great option is to get him stuffed toys rather than plastic or hard toys. Stuffed toys are easy for your chihuahua to crush and put in his mouth, and they’re quite light for him to carry around.These toys are great for him to use when you aren’t able to play with him. The toys can keep him entertained so he hopefully doesn’t play with breakable household items instead!

, While you may still want to get your chihuahua a collar to put tags on, don’t use his collar for his leash. Instead, buy your chihuahua a small harness to use with his leash. Harnesses go around his chest and mid-section rather than his neck. Being as chihuahuas are so small, it can be easy to accidentally pull too hard on the leash and hurt his neck if his leash is only attached to a collar.It might take a couple tries for your chihuahua to get use to wearing a harness. If required, leave the harness on your chihuahua for slightly longer periods of time each day until he’s use to it.
It’s also good to be careful about the size and weight of the leash you use with your chihuahua. Buy the lightest leash you can as the extra weight of a heavy leash can also cause your chihuahua trouble when you’re taking him for a walk.

, Chihuahuas don’t often get along with other dogs or animals, unless it’s another chihuahua. If you don’t have enough time to keep your chihuahua entertained, or you don’t like leaving him alone while you’re at work, one option is to get another chihuahua. Two or more chihuahuas will keep each other company and will play with each other when you aren’t able to.Getting a second chihuahua isn’t an excuse for ignoring your dogs. You still need to make time in your schedule to play and walk both dogs on a regular basis.

Show physical affection to your dog.,
Spend one-on-one time with your dog every day.,
Do focused activities with your dog.,
Give praise to your dog.,
Start obedience training.,
Take your dog to a training or activity class.",How to Make Your Dog More Playful2," Dogs like physical affection, and it can bond them closer to their owners. Spend time petting or grooming your dog nearly every day.


Dogs can be sensitive to touch at first. Touching them each day can build up their sensitivity and get them to crave your touch.You can also groom them on a regular basis. Just something as simple as brushing their coat with a brush can show your dog physical affection.

, Even if you're at work all day, it's good to have some time alone with your dog. Taking your dog for a walk every day can be a good way to reaffirm your bond with your dog.If you go on a walk with your dog, make it an engaging activity for your dog. Instead of walking aimlessly, try to give your dog specific goals and landmarks to walk or run to that you can do together.
Talk to your dog or teach them a trick. If you try a new trick every few weeks, this will bond you and your dog together and keep them focused on doing well for you.

, Dogs like to have structure, since it gives them a clear sense of purpose. When you play with your dog, try to make them task-oriented.


Give them directions on where to run, jump, and play. Playing catch is a good example of directed play.
Dogs also like to please their owners. Focused activities can tell your dog that they have fulfilled your expectations and you're happy with them., When you are training your dog, it’s especially good to give positive reinforcement. Additionally, praising your dog can make you grow closer together.While treats may be the most common type of positive reinforcement, it’s also important to speak to your dog positively. They will associate your tone of voice with your mood and feel happy as well.
If your dog does not respond to treats, a toy may also be a good way to praise your dog. They may also like physical affection from you, such as being petted, as a method of praise.

, Dogs like to be trained, since they like structure. You can either have your dog join a class or do it just with you. In either case, you should be heavily involved in any training with your dog.If you are training your dog, always use positive reinforcement. Dogs like treats and voice training (like ""Good boy"") that tell them they are doing well.
Pay attention to your dog's mood. They need to be in the right mood for training. Otherwise, it will not be an effective training session and will be frustrated with you and your dog., If you're working a specific skill or behavior, a training or activity class can be fun for you to do with your dog. These classes can be good for you and your dog to use to bond over a shared activity.Activity classes can work from puppies to adult dogs. For puppies, these activity classes may be especially useful to teach them discipline and some general training.
If you have a new dog that's not a puppy, it may be a good idea to bring them to a training class. Even if they are trained, you and your dog could use the class to learn how to work together.

Know your dog's likes and dislikes.,
Read your dog's body language.,
Put yourself in a calm state of mind.",How to Make Your Dog More Playful3," Since not all dogs are the same, every dog has different things they like and don't like. Paying attention to things like their favorite and least favorite things let them know you care.Your dog likely has favorite foods, toys, and games. Give them these things, so they will affiliated their favorites with you.
Stay away from things you know your dog dislikes. Some things that all dogs dislikes are head pats, hugging, floral smells, and loud noises.

, Your dog gives you plenty of clues how they feel. Watch your dog during activities and you should be able to tell if they are enjoying them or not.


When your dog is playful, they are performing a ""play bow"". In the play bow, their rear end is up and their front end is down.Dogs that are whining, pacing, or doing anything unusual are usually stressed or fearful. These activities show you that your dog is not ready to play and likely needs to calm down.
Tail wagging can mean many things. While a loose wag means your dog is open and comfortable, a tight wag can mean they are agitated.

, Very often, your dog's mood will reflect your mood. If you are happy and playful, your dog is more likely to also be happy and playful.Dogs try to read your intention. If you seem uncertain about your intention, they may try to guess; often, they may guess incorrectly.
Be clear even when you are calm. Dogs like directions, so it's good to tell them what you want and when.

Spend some quiet time with your chihuahua.,
Get an exercise pen for your chihuahua.,
Buy your chihuahua a sweater or two.,
Consider getting your chihuahua a set of doggy stairs.,
Make sure your chihuahua has his own bed.",How to Play with a Chihuahua3," Playing and running around is great for you and your chihuahua, but it’s also a great idea to have quiet time with him on a regular basis. This quiet time can be spent simply cuddling on the couch, or you can use it to brush or groom him as needed. Quiet time is great to have just before you plan to go to bed. Not only will it help you relax and unwind, it will help get your chihuahua into a relaxed and sleepy state so everyone can go to bed without any disruptions., You can find all sorts of exercise pens for dogs and other small animals at pets stores and online. They come in different sizes and are made of different materials. One great option is to get an exercise pen that is just fencing with no bottom. This type of pen can be easily folded up and stored, but can also be easily placed inside or outside your house. Depending on what you and your chihuahua are doing, you can put your dog inside the pen to give him limited space to play, to give him a safe place to play, or even to give him a way to be close to you if you don’t want him underfoot., Chihuahuas may be energetic dogs, but they are very small and can get cold very easily. You, as a human, may feel fine at a certain temperature, but that same temperature may be making your dog shiver. In order to make him more comfortable and warm, especially when he’s outside with you, you may want to consider buying your chihuahua a sweater or coat.If your chihuahua doesn’t like his sweater at first, only keep it on him for a short period of time. Over a few days or weeks, increase the amount of time he wears the sweater until he gets used to it.

, Doggy stairs are small staircases that help your dog go from the floor to either the bed or the couch without jumping. In some cases, your chihuahua may not be capable of jumping the distance and this will be the only way for him to get up on the couch or bed. In other cases, this might help save your furniture from scratches if he uses his claws to pull himself up.Dogs stairs come in all types, including set stairs that are carpeted and plastic stairs that fold up.
You can even make your own stairs using wood or other materials, or just place boxes or bins in increasing height so he can use them to climb.

, Chihuahuas love sleeping in the softest and most comfortable place they can find. As such, getting your chihuahua his own doggy bed is a great idea. You can even get your chihuahua more than one bed — one for your bedroom and another for your living room (or wherever you spend time during the day). When you’re in those particular rooms, your chihuahua will have a nice comfy place to curl up and sleep while keeping you company.Doggy beds, in general, are also good because they can usually be cleaned a lot easier than your couch. Chihuahuas, even though they’re small, shed a lot.

Introduce the two dogs.,
Watch the animals’ body language.,
Walk the dogs together.,
Keep the visiting dog comfortable and happy.",How to Dog‐Sit when You Have a Small Pet1," If you’re going to be pet-sitting a friend’s or neighbor’s dog, first you’ll need to make sure that the dogs get along, especially if your small dog is dwarfed by the animal you’re pet sitting. Hold your dog on a leash, and have the other dog’s owner hold theirs as well. Let the two dogs approach and sniff each other. Walk the two dogs side-by-side, about five feet apart, before letting them meet face to face.Check with the dog’s owner ahead of time, to make sure that their dog is friendly towards other dogs. Specify that your dog is small, and make sure that the other dog does not have behavioral issues towards small dogs.
Sometimes large dogs will behave amiably towards other dogs their own size, but will treat small dogs with hostility.;
, Even in small dogs, specific behaviors can indicate hostility or fear. If either dog has a tense, strained body, bares its teeth, or growls and snarls, pull the dogs apart from one another. On the other hand, if the dogs start pawing at or playing with one another, they will get along well.If you’re introducing a small puppy to a larger adult dog, follow this same procedure. Be careful that the larger dog doesn’t bully or pursue the puppy, even if it’s only an attempt to play. Supervise the dogs when they’re interacting together, and intervene if the larger dog doesn’t respond to your puppy’s signals to stop.

, Dogs are social animals, and walks provide an important form of exercise and socialization. Unless either dog has an overriding health concern, walk the dogs together daily.This will allow the dogs to fall into a “pack” mentality, which will prevent later acts of aggression.


If the dog you’re pet-sitting is larger than your own, it may assume the role of the alpha. This is fine—it’s natural for dogs to assume these social roles, and it’s a sign that the dogs are getting along well.
Before walking the new dog with your small dog, ascertain from the dog’s owner how frequently, and for how long, it’s usually walked. You may need to find a compromise between the dog’s typical walk schedule, and your own small dog’s schedule.

, The dog that you’re pet sitting will be more calm and in a better mood, and consequently less likely to bother or antagonize your own small dog, if it’s kept comfortable. You can keep the dog in a good mood by spending time with it; pet the dog and play catch (or another game) daily.


Make sure to put out multiple food and water bowls, as well as beds and toys, for both your small dog and the dog you’re pet-sitting. This way, both dogs can make themselves comfortable without feeling like they must compete with the other dog for resources or a place to sleep.Also check with the dog’s owner—they may be able to drop off the dog’s favorite toy, bed, or blanket, or give you a recommendation as to what food or type of treats the dog most enjoys eating.

Remember a few things when playing naturally with your dog.,
Do not scold your dog.,
Play Wolf Tag

Wolves play a game like tag in which they take turns chasing each other around their territory barking excitedly.,
Play Wrestling .,
Play Adventure

Take your dog on a long walk or to a place where you have never been together.,
Play Hide Toys

Hide your dogs favorite toy around the garage, house, or pen.,
Play Sing

Everybody knows that wolves howl.,
Play Go to a Dog park

Wolves, although sometimes aggressive, will often enjoy the site of a new wolf.",How to Play Naturally with Dogs," Your dog might not at first realize that you are going to play naturally with them if they are not used to it and may study you. They may not be sure if they should join in or not. Also remember that your dog may get a bit carried away and nip you during this.
, This is how wolves naturally play with each by playful bites. Simply stop playing to show your dog that the play bite signals the end of the fun instead of the start of it. And of course, have fun!!

, How you can do this is chase your dog around your 'territory' AKA the yard.
Speak excitedly to him and grab his tail every once in a while. If your dog wants, let him chase you, just remember the bit about nipping above.







,

This is the game where you must watch out for nipping. Most dogs do not nip but some might get carried away during wrestling. wolves in nature wrestle playfully with each to show their love and pack-man-ship with each other.
When wrestling with your dog, began gently. (Gently) slap your dogs sides and face and talk in low but happy voice. You may even pick up your dog and roll it onto its back to flick its stomach. (Caution: Dogs may jump on you or nip you during this)
Let your dog gently chew on your hand, don't instantly pull away or else wrestling won't be fun for him. Only pull away when it begins to get too tight. Stop the wrestling during this time.







, In nature, wolves will take walks with each other to enjoy each others company and explore new parts of the woods. You don't need to say anything just let your dog know that you are there.
See if your dog likes this game by looking at him. If his tail is up or even gently wagging from side to side he is content and happy. Same if his ears are loose or if his tongue is hanging limply out of his mouth. If he is not happy, his tail will be down, ears back and tongue arched upwards.







, Run around by him and shout excitedly for him to find it.
When he does, praise him. wolves will try to find their hidden bones, sticks, etc.. all the time, and they often take a favorite pack member to help out.







, They sing with their pack for hunts, joy, war cries, and just for the heck of singing.
Try to sing with your dog. Make your song as high pitched and with drawn as able. Its ok if your dog doesn't do this. He might even look at you strangely. Not all dogs are singers, but some love to!







, They will smell each other, maybe play one of the other games for a bit, then carry on.
Take your dog to a dog park. Here he can meet some new dogs and react as a natural wolf would.
Stay by your dog at the park and pet the new dogs. This will make your dog feel as if though 'the pack's' confronting the other dogs, not just himself. (Caution: Some dogs will act aggressive towards other dogs just as wolves do. This is completely normal. This just means dog parks are not for your dog.)

Sign your dog up for basic obedience training.,
Teach your dog hand signals.,
Complete the AKC Canine Good Citizen program.,
Book an ""animal acting"" class.",How to Get Your Dog Into a Commercial1," Before your dog can be considered for a commercial, it is crucial that it attends obedience classes. These introductory courses teach dogs basic compliance to commands telling them to sit, stand, down, stay in position, and come when called. Make sure to choose a trainer approved by the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT), listed on the council's website at http://www.ccpdt.org.;
, Hand signals can be useful for a dog to follow on-set, when verbal cues may not be possible. To teach your dog basic hand signals, use cues (with the influence of treats) that will then become the hand signals. For instance, teach a dog the ""down"" hand command by holding a treat in front of its nose and drawing it down towards the ground, having the dog follow it. After repetition of this exercise (varying between dogs), the motion itself will serve as the command and it will be clearly understood by your pet. Other hand signals to try include:""Sit""
""Stand""
""Heel""
""Spin""
""Go to your crate""

, The American Kennel Club’s Canine Good Citizen Program is a two-part course aimed at rewarding dogs with solid obedience training and good manners, both at home and in their community. This certification is a good foundation for the training your dog will require to get into show business, and is available to all dogs, regardless of breed or age (provided that they are fully vaccinated). Visit the AKC website at https://www.apps.akc.org//apps/clubs/ to find clubs and training programs near you providing CGC training., To really solidify your dog's training, consider signing it up for an acting class to learn entertainment industry tricks like finding a mark on the set floor, cocking its head, and waving its paw. Classes are offered by some dog training venues and pet agencies, and can be a costly investment in your dog's acting career. Look online for courses available in your area.For instance, the Hollywood Paws agency in Los Angeles, California offers introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses in animal acting. Each level costs $995.00 and is comprised on 6 courses (totalling 7.5 hours)."

Take them both outside.,
Walk towards each other.,
Drop their leashes.,
Reward them both for good behavior.,
Watch for signs of aggression.,
Separate them with baby gates.,
Supervise them carefully.,
Move the food bowls.,
Give the dogs equal attention.,
Break up any fights.,
Ask the owner for instructions.,
Create a schedule for both dogs.,
Wash your hands before petting your dog.,
Ask a family member to look after your dog.",How to Dog‐Sit when You Have Your Own Dog," The dogs should be introduced on neutral territory. The best place to do this is outside. Have the other dog’s owner hold them on a leash while you hold your own dog. It is important that they are both leashed so that you can separate them if they don’t get along., You should both start at a distance from one another. Slowly walk towards each other. The dogs may or may not notice each other. If they let you, bring them together. They may start to sniff one another at this point.If they growl or their hair lifts, you may pause. Pet your dog and talk to them to soothe them. When they have calmed down, continue walking towards the other dog., If the dogs do well on their leashes, you should bring them to an enclosed location, such as a fenced yard. Drop their leashes, and see how they react towards one another. If they start to play or if they ignore each other, it is a good sign that they will get along.Dogs will often bow with their front legs pressed down and their hind quarters lifted. Although it can be mistaken for aggression, it actually a sign of play. Other signs of play include bouncing and exposing their stomachs. They should also take turns when playing chase., If the dogs are friendly with one another or if they play nicely, you should reward both of them with a small treat. This will teach them to associate the other dog with positive reactions, and they may be more motivated to keep up the good work., Dogs can express fear or aggression in many ways, but you do not want it to get to the point where they are biting or fighting with the other dog. If you notice any signs of aggression, separate the dogs. Wait until they calm down, and try again. If the dogs do not get along with one another, you may not be able to watch both dogs together. Some signs of aggression include:


Becoming very still, rigid, or tense
Lunging
Growling or snarling
Pulling back the lips to show teeth
Snapping or bitingHair standing up on their back, When you first bring the other dog into your home, you should not let them run free right away. Even if your dog was friendly outside, they may not be comfortable with a new dog in their territory. Separate them from each other using baby gates. The dogs may sniff one another through the gate. Watch them closely. If they bark, growl, or snap at each other, you may need to keep them separated for the entire stay., If the dogs seem fine with each other’s presence through the baby gates, you might consider letting them out to play with one another. During these sessions, you should be present to watch the dogs. Keep an eye out for aggressive or territorial behavior.Your dog may not like that the visiting dog is playing with their toys or sleeping in their bed. Even if you think that the dogs are best friends, you should keep watch them in case an argument occurs.
When you leave the home, you may want to separate and confine the dogs. This will prevent a fight while you're gone.

, Many dogs are territorial over their food bowls. When the other dog comes into your home, you should move your dog’s bowl to a place where the other one cannot reach it. Feed the dogs in separate confined rooms to prevent conflict. Remove the food bowls when they are finished eating.Dogs can also fight over treats, bones, or high-value toys, such as Kong toys.Either give both dogs a treat at the same time or avoid giving them treats altogether.

, Dogs can become jealous and protective over a human. If you pay attention to one dog more than the other, it could cause problems. You do not want to ignore your dog in favor of your canine guest, but you still need to make sure that the other dog receives enough attention, exercise, play, and treats. Divide your time equally between the two., If the dogs do get into a fight, you will need to stop it. It can be dangerous to interfere with a dog fight, so practice caution when doing so. Always grab the dogs from behind. Do not step between them or else you might be injured as well.


Grab your dog by the rear and pull them away. Put them in a separate, closed-off area.
Use a deterrent spray such as citronella spray, Direct Stop, or Spray Shield.
If your dog is the aggressor, you may be able to use a simple command such as “Stop” or “come here” to distract them.
Never break up a fight by grabbing the dog’s face, neck, or collar, as you might be accidentally bitten., The owner should leave behind some instructions for caring for their dog. This can tell you when the other dog needs to be fed, exercised, or medicated. Read over these instructions carefully, and consider how they fit into your normal routine.


If the dog needs to be walked at the same time that you usually walk your own dog, you should consider which dog needs to be walked first. For example, an older dog may not be able to wait to go outside like a younger dog.
Make sure you ask the owner where the dog’s food, bowls, and medication are located so that you can feed them efficiently before returning to your own dog.
If there is an emergency with the other dog, you should have their vet’s number handy. Think about who you can call to care for your dog while you take the other dog to the vet.

, To make sure that both dogs get an equal amount of attention, you should create a schedule that will last for the entire duration of your dog sit. This should list how you plan to split your time between two households and two dogs. Remember that the dog you are pet sitting for will need plenty of exercise during the day, and they will also need to be let outside to eliminate. That said, do not neglect your own dog during this time.


Visit the other dog at least three times a day: once in the morning, once in the late afternoon, and once in the later evening. Make sure to let the dog outside, walk them, play with them for a little while, and feed them.At least one of these visits should be an extended visit, when you play and talk to the dog for a longer period of time. This will keep the other dog from becoming bored and destructive.

, There are many diseases that can pass between dogs, and some of these can survive on your hands.Before petting your dog when you get home, wash your hands to make sure that you do not spread any illnesses from the other dog.


Just because the other dog doesn’t look sick doesn’t mean that they are not carrying germs.
Washing your hands can also help reduce the scent of the other dog on you. Your dog can probably smell the other dog, and this may cause them anxiety or discomfort.

, If you have multiple people in your household, you can ask someone else to take over dog duty while you dog sit. This will ensure that your dog has plenty of attention and care while you are looking after someone else’s dog.

Establish a consistent exercise routine.,
Go for a hike together.,
Socialize together at the dog park.,
Figure out your dog's favorite activity.",How to Plan Activities with Your Dog1," Many of the activities that you and your dog can enjoy together require little to no equipment, and you can do them in your own neighborhood. For instance, you can take your dog for a walk or jog, play fetch in the nearest park, or bring them to the nearest watering hole for a swim. The most important factor, especially from your dog’s perspective, is keeping a regular schedule.Physical activity is extremely important to your dog’s health and happiness, not to mention your own. At the very least, take them for a ten to twenty minute jog or brisk walk twice a day.;
, On days where you have more freedom, take the dog somewhere new. Opt for large parks and nature preserves with trails away from any roads. While large, popular parks sometimes do not allow dogs, many parks do.


There are even websites that can help you plan hiking trips ahead of time, with information regarding where dogs are or are not allowed., Of the many sorts of public outdoor areas that allow dogs, there are some parks that are specifically designed to welcome canine visitors. While the phrase “dog park” is used to describe many different areas, it is generally safe to assume that you and your dog will both be welcome, and will likely meet other four-legged friends as well.One of the specific benefits of many dog parks is that it will likely be okay to allow your dog to run off of their leash. This can offer a safe area to train your dog to “come,” among other learning opportunities.
Similarly, many large parks, especially those in urban areas where outdoor space is more limited, allow dogs in certain parts of the park. Always obey posted signage.

, For many dogs - not to mention many people - it really is the simple things that are the most enjoyable. Experiment with all the classic dog activities, even if you're not sure they'll appeal to your dog. For instance, it's a rare dog that can help itself from fetching a thrown ball.


If your arm isn't what it used to be, there are simple, cheap plastic tennis ball launchers available online or in pet supplies stores.
Try throwing a frisbee. This may be more fun for you and your dog, as frisbees can be enjoyable to throw, and your dog may enjoy jumping into the air to catch them.
Make sure to work a bit of activity into rainy days indoors as well. Order a laser pointer online or grab one from your local pet store. Chances are, both you and Voldemutt will wind up entertained for hours with a marathon session of catch-the-mysterious-red-dot."

Familiarize the animals with each other’s scent.,
Introduce the animals.,
Desensitize the dog to your cat.,
Give your cat its own space.",How to Dog‐Sit when You Have a Small Pet2," Before releasing the dog into the house with your cat, you should give the animals time to acclimate to each other’s smells. This will make them calmer and more tolerant when they finally meet. Bring some of your cat’s bedding out into the house and let the dog smell the blankets or bed.Then, bring one of the dog’s blankets to the cat, and let the cat smell the dog’s scent.


If you plan ahead, you and the dog’s owner can even switch the pets’ bedding, so they have more time to acclimate to one another’s scents. Give the dog owner your cat’s bedding, and take the dog’s bed from them.

, Once the animals have become used to smelling one another, you can slowly introduce them face-to-face. Keep the dog on a leash, and bring it into the room where the cat is. Let the animals smell and walk around one another—but if the dog becomes hostile or the cat fearful, separate the animals.Protecting your cat is the priority here. If the dog barks or lunges at your cat, or begins to play with it too roughly, remove the cat.In this scenario, you may need to desensitize the dog before you bring the animals together again.

, In order to ensure that the dog you’re pet-sitting does not attempt to attach or chase your cat, you can slowly increase the dog’s exposure to the cat, thereby lowering the dog’s novelty and excitement towards the cat. Temporarily shut your cat in a bedroom, using a plastic gate. Then walk the dog up to the gate on a leash, so it can see and smell the cat. Keep the dog there briefly, then walk it back away from the cat. Repeat this process several times—the dog should become less and less excited at seeing the cat with every repetition.When the dog is calm when being exposed to the cat, praise the dog and give it a treat. Once the dog can be near the cat without barking or showing much excitement, remove the gate and let the animals meet face-to-face.
Desensitization is a good introductory method if the dog too much energy—whether friendly or hostile—when first seeing the cat.

, Even if the dog and your cat get along—or at least tolerate one another—you’ll still need to provide a space for your cat to retreat to. Dogs often have more playful energy than cats, and your cat will need an area where it can rest, sleep, eat, and receive human attention without being bothered by the dog.Move your cat’s food bowl, water bowl, and a couple of favorite toys to a location that the dog cannot access.

"
"
Consider the breed of dog.,
Keep the small animal in its cage.,
Introduce the dog to your small pet.,
Exercise the dog often.",How to Dog‐Sit when You Have a Small Pet3," Before you agree to pet sit a dog, ask the owner about its breed and typical behavior. Any sporting breeds of dog, including retrievers and terriers, may perceive your small bird, hamster, or rabbit as a prey animal, and attempt to chase or kill your pet.If the dog displays aggressive behavior, you may need to reconsider your offer to pet sit.


Also ask the owner about the dog’s training. In instances where the dog is chasing or trying to attack your small pet, you may be able to shout “leave it!” (or a similar command), and scare the dog away from your pet.

, For any small, caged animal—such as a bird, hamster, gerbil, or rabbit—this process should be easy, and will provide minimal disruption to the routine of your small pet. Let your small pet remain in its cage, and feed and water the pet as usual. If you’re accustomed to pulling your pet out and playing with it periodically, you may need to shut yourself and a pet in a room to which the dog does not have access.Alternately, block the dog from accessing the small pet when you let it out of the cage to play with it.
During play time, avoid letting the dog see the small bird, hamster, or rabbit running. This could easily trigger the dog’s prey instinct, and send the dog chasing after your pet., If your small pet is in a cage that cannot be easily moved—for example, a large bird cage in your living room, or an elaborate hamster cage in a bedroom—you should make sure that the dog is aware of your small pet and will not try to attack or bark at the cage. Keep the dog on a leash, and slowly walk it up to your pet’s cage. Let it smell the cage and the rabbit, hamster, or bird within.


If the dog acts calmly around the pet in its cage, reward the dog with treats and praise.Once the dog learns that it will be given treats and praise for its calm behavior around the small pet, the dog will be less likely to chase or bark at the pet.

, A bored dog which has not received sufficient exercise is more likely to act out, exhibit hyperactive behavior, or try to (aggressively) play with a small pet. Take the dog for a long walk daily in order to keep it in good health and in a calm mood.The more exercise that the dog receives—including playing and running in a backyard or park—the less energy it’ll have to chase or bark at your small pet.


Check with the owner to see how and when the dog is usually exercised, and stick as closely to this schedule as possible. You may even want to lengthen the duration of typical walks, to tire out the dog and remove any anxiety: if the owner usually takes the dog for two 30-minute walks a day, try extending each of these walks to 45 minutes.

Bring your dog to the groomer's.,
Bring your dog to crowded, busy venues.,
Introduce your dog to new people.",How to Get Your Dog Into a Commercial2," Get your dog looking its best by bringing it to the groomer's for a wash, hair dematting, haircut, nail trim, scissoring of feet, and pad shaving. If your dog is not familiar or comfortable with the experience, bring it to the groomer's for a quick visit where it does not receive any actual treatments to get it used to the sounds, tools, and overall environment of the establishment. When you return, be sure to bring treats to reward it for good behaviour., In order for your dog to be ready to star in a commercial, it must be steady around distractions that might be an issue on set. These distractions could include big bright lights, noise, and harried people milling around. Get your dog used to this type of atmosphere by bringing it to equally distracting places when permitted, such as:Dog-friendly cafes or restaurants
Pet stores (like Petsmart or Petco)
Hardware stores (like Home Depot or Lowes)Evening softball or soccer games at a local park

, In preparation for the potential experience of filming a commercial, have your dog meet and interact with new people as much as possible. Socialization may ease its trepidation around strangers, and this comfort will make your dog more composed and comfortable on a commercial shoot. Be sure to assess the comfort level of individuals with your dog before prompting it to be friendly to them.It is your job as your dog's owner to protect it in social situations. If someone gets too close or behaves inappropriately to your dog (e.g. aggressive teasing), correct the human and ask them to back away from your pet. This will show your dog that it's being protected, and doesn't need to protect itself or you by getting aggressive.

Look into pet agencies.,
Make a cute viral video.,
Respond to online casting call advertisements.",How to Get Your Dog Into a Commercial3," Hiring an agent is a good way to get your dog noticed by big time casting agents. While having an agent is not necessary to get your dog into a commercial, it can help to facilitate connections between dog owners and producers, as well as other entertainment industry professionals. Look online for pet agencies near you, or for an agency that you'd be willing to travel to.Le Paws pet agency in Southern California, for example, hires dogs for commercial work, TV and movies, and print ads, including some out-of-state applicants., Cute videos of animals are a staple of social media and can go viral incredibly quickly. Record a fun or impressive trick done by your pet, or compile a series of endearing moments into a montage video and post it online (via YouTube, Facebook, or another social media site). Ask friends to share the video on their own social media accounts and watch the video spread.Be sure to adjust your privacy settings to public when posting this video so that it can be easily shared and spotted by people looking for canine talent.

, For a direct approach, look for online ads for TV commercial casting calls near you and respond by email, adding a few pictures of your dog if possible. For instance, visit http://www.auditionsfree.com/tag/dog-auditions/ for auditions being held in your area that might apply to your dog. Sites like Craiglist might also offer opportunities for your dog to act in a commercial, albeit a smaller, lower budget one (e.g. an ad for a small, local business).

Host a dog party.,
Include your dog when you host human visitors.,
Bring your dog to others' social functions.,
Take your dog out on the town.",How to Plan Activities with Your Dog2," You know what they say: there ain’t no party like a dog party. And as much fun as it will be for you, hosting your dog-owning friends and their own four-legged family members will absolutely make your dog’s day. Be sure to remove anything fragile or potentially dangerous to your dog from the areas where visitors will be allowed, and plan to accommodate hungry, thirsty, and socially excited canines.

, It’s not always possible to host a bunch of your human friends’ dogs. However, your dog can still enjoy the company of your friends with you. To make sure your dog feels comfortable, provide it with a safe zone where only it will be allowed to go during the party.


Don't host large gatherings before your dog is trained to behave around other people,
Further, be sure to tell guests that a dog will be present and make sure they will comfortable as well.

, When the context is appropriate, bring your dog along when you visit a friend’s home. The important factor here is always ensuring that the host is aware that a dog is coming and gives their approval. Ask a host ahead of time before bringing your dog to another’s home, even if you know you’ll be hanging out in their yard.While you may be excited to introduce Sir Woofsalot to your buddy’s miniature poodle, the poodle may not be fond of canine visitors. Similarly, very young children may be attendance, and their parents may not feel comfortable with dogs around quite yet.

, You probably already know it, but bringing your dog to the bar is just about the easiest way to get a conversation going there is. Fortunately, many restaurants and bars with outdoor seating do allow dogs to sit on the patio or deck. Call ahead to make sure your canine will be welcome, or be willing to change you plans when establishments won't allow your furry companion in.Never allow your dog off of their leash in public bars or dining areas. Even if your dog is incredibly well behaved, it’s important to ensure that other patrons know that your dog is safely under your control.

Be prepared.,
Bring dog treats with you.,
Bring along the doggy do bag.,
Show gratitude and appreciation for the opportunity to walk your dog.,
Make friends.,
Find easy ways to expend Fido's energy without exhausting yourself.,
Take new roads, streets and pathways each time.,
Find a favorite cafe that lets you tie the dog up as you sit at an outdoor table.",How to Make Walking the Dog Enjoyable," Wear suitable clothing for the weather. If it's raining, wear a rain jacket and boots; if it's blowing a gale, wear a windproof jacket. By keeping comfortable, you'll enjoy the experience a whole lot more.;
, If something happens and you need to either get your dog to come to you quickly, or you would like to reinforce good behavior, treats can make a difficult situation much less stressful. For example, if your dog hates walking near major roads, a treat can be used to reward the good behavior and the effort that the dog makes.

, This can be a part of walking that seems most unpleasant but it's essential for ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable urban environment and for ensuring that nobody, including you, treads in stinky do-do. Clean it up and avoid the glares, and the pleasant reactions from other people will bring more joy to your walk.

, This is a special time to bond with your dog and it's also a chance for you to keep healthy through the exercise. Appreciate watching your dog and seeing its happiness as it runs around having fun.


View walking the dog as free time and me-time. If you lead a busy life, it can be hard to get away from everything and everyone, and a dog offers a ready-made excuse to escape it all and still be doing something beneficial.

, Dog walks provide the perfect way to make new friends. The next time your dog is running around with another dog, try approaching the owner and start chatting. You already have a topic in common––dogs. Just take it from there.


Dog walks are also perfect times to catch up with existing friends, so consider inviting them along and catching up on all the latest gossip.
If you have been meaning to call a family member or a friend, but your busy life keeps getting in the way, ring them while your walking; it's a great way to fill time and if the conversation gets tiring or awkward, use needing to cross the road or catch the dog as an excuse to end the call quickly.

, If the dog's got too much energy for you, find a bench, sit on it, and through a load of balls. Doing this uses up a lot much of your dog's energy, without depleting yours, so it's easily sorted!

, Change the walks so that you get to know the wider neighborhood, rather than trudging down the same old path each day or night. This is a great way to keep fit, explore new places and walk the dog all at the same time.


Bring your smartphone with its map app, in case you get lost.

, Have a coffee and read the newspaper for a short break. Be sure to give Fido a bowl of water too.

Bring along some comfort items.,
Get a location-specific dog friendly travel guide.,
Visit a dog camp.",How to Plan Activities with Your Dog3," Traveling with your dog does require a bit of planning, but it is fully possible to do so. Accommodations are especially important to plan, as many hotels and rental facilities do not allow dogs. Always ask about pet policies before booking a stay when traveling with your dog., Even if you bring a crate along, do not assume it is safe or appropriate to leave your dog in a hotel room or rented space. Leaving them somewhere they aren’t comfortable will likely lead to some barking, howling, or worse.When you’re in a hotel room together, turn the TV or radio on low. Select a station with calm, familiar sounds. This will help cover the sounds of other guests, and help reduce the likelihood that Jim Har-Paw will be tempted to bark.

, When traveling with your dog, it’s important to ensure they are as comfortable as possible. Outside of keeping as much of a routine as you can, the best way to do so is by bringing along their favorite toys, blankets, and food., Many popular travel destinations provide information on places you can stay with your pet, as well as activities you can enjoy together. This include both specific destinations, such as cities or national parks, as well as general destinations.Often, local, state, or national governments will make this information available online. For instance, if you live in or are visiting a particular U.S. state, visit the state’s tourism website to find or ask about a pet-friendly travel guide.
Aside from hotels, information is available regarding pet-friendly vacation rentals, beaches, airports, shopping malls, and more.

, There are various types of dog “camps.” Some revolve around a particular event or activity, such as a sport or skills competition. Others are more social and are designed to host you, your dog, and other campers in a place that can accommodate both bipeds and canines. Make sure to opt for the sort of camp that hosts both you and your dog."

These activities can range from playing games to outdoor exercises.Spending time with your dog is a great way to keep yourself physically fit while at the same time allowing your dog to enjoy the active lifestyle that she is naturally inclined towards.;
, Try to take your dog for a jog or walk at least once a day. This will keep both of you fit and will allow your dog the physical activity that she craves while at the same time exploring the outdoors. The ASPCA encourages taking a variety of routes and visiting new places ‘so that your dog can experience novel smells and sights.’, Traveling with your dog is another great way to keep your dog from being bored while spending time together. Depending on how much time you have, this could be as short as a car ride (which dogs love) to the supermarket or even an extended vacation.


Before going on an extended holiday with your dog, bring her to the vet and ensure that all her vaccinations are up to date. Keep her shot records with you and remember that you require a health certificate for airline travel.Buy a crate for your dog. Crates keep dogs safe during travel by automobile and are required for travel by plane.Make sure your dog has proper identification in case she gets lost from you during a vacation.If traveling by car, be sure to keep your dog safe and healthy. This means you should avoid car sickness by letting her travel on an empty stomach. In addition, keep your dog safe by not let your dog ride with her head out of the car window. Make frequent rest stops, and do not leave your dog unattended in a closed vehicle, especially in the summer, as temperatures in a closed vehicle can get extremely high. Check with your airline, cruise carrier, train line, or bus service as to their rules on canine travel because not all of them allow it and each may have particular rules that apply to such travel.

, Playing games together will keep both you and your dog active and, therefore, healthy. Doing so will also have a positive impact on your relationship with your dog.

, Play tug-of-war with your dog. This game is useful because it allows your dog ‘an outlet for her natural canine urges to grab and pull on things with her mouth.’A helpful guide from the ASPCA on how to teach your dog to play this game is available here.

, Play fetch with your dog. This game is good if you do not wish to exert yourself a great deal while at the same time wish to give your dog a good workout.A useful guide on how to teach your dog to play fetch is available here.

, Play hide-and-seek with your dog. This game will exercise your dog’s mind because it will encourage her to look for you. This game also offers your dog the chance to exercise her sense of smell.A helpful guide on how to teach your dog to play hide-and-seek is available here.

, Play find-it with your dog. This game is similar to hide-and-seek except your dog in this game will be looking for items that you hide from her for the purposes of this game. Hide treats for your dog in your choice of hiding spots (e.g. behind furniture legs) and instruct your dog to find these hidden treats. This game also encourages your dog to use her powerful sense of smell. The ASPCA notes that offering your dog the opportunity to use her sense of smell ‘can really wear her out!’, Play chase with your dog by tying one of her favorite toys to a rope and allowing her to chase the toy as you twirl it in the air or drag it along the ground. You can also purchase toys from your nearest pet store designed specifically for playing chase with your dog."

Assign your dog healthy activities to do by herself.,
Buy food puzzle toys.,
Hide your dog’s food to simulate a hunting environment.,
Provide chew time.",How to Keep Your Dog from Being Bored2," One of the best ways of ensuring that your dog will not engage in destructive or otherwise poor behavior when she is by herself is to assign her appropriate tasks to do while you are away. Doing so will ensure that your dog is fulfilling her natural desire to remain active while at the same time engaging in healthy, non-destructive activities., A great way to simulate an environment in which your dog can hunt for food is by making use of food puzzle toys. These are containers that hold food and treats but do not provide your dog easy access to their food. Working for her food in this manner will fulfill her innate desire to hunt for food, simulating an environment similar to what wild dogs experience when scavenging for food.Food puzzle toys make your dog work for food in ways that are healthy for your dog because of the skills (e.g. pawing, nibbling, rolling) required to access the food. In addition, these toys also have a calming effect on your dog by encouraging her to engage in chewing and licking.Allow your dog time to learn to play with food puzzle toys. Gradually increase the amount of effort required to access the food from her food puzzle toys. If your dog is used to being served food in a bowl, she will take some time to learn to enjoy playing with food puzzle toys. Be patient with her as she learns this skill and do not force her to do too much too soon.For detailed instructions on how to stuff a particular brand of food puzzle toy known as a KONG food puzzle, visit this website.

, Make your dog hunt for her meals around the house by hiding treats and food puzzle toys around the house. The ASPCA suggests that you can hide 'one of your dog's meals right before you leave her home alone, and she'll have great fun hunting her chow while you're away.'You can vary this activity by doing the same in your yard so that your dog can hunt for food both inside the house and outside in the yard. Most dogs love playing the game of looking for pieces of kibble in the grass., All dogs have an innate need to chew. The ASPCA observes that chewing helps dogs keep their jaws strong and teeth clean and that both wild and domestic dogs spend hours chewing.Providing your dog chew time with acceptable items to chew on will not only help her in maintaining a strong jaw and keeping her teeth clean but will also prevent her from chewing on items around the house that you do not want your dog to chew.

Create opportunities for your dog to engage with other dogs.,
Get a companion animal for your dog.,
Arrange activities with friends and family who have dogs.,
Take your dog to a park or daycare.",How to Keep Your Dog from Being Bored3," Dogs, like humans, are social animals who enjoy spending time with others within their species. Allow your dog to play with other dogs by creating opportunities for such social interaction., A companion animal (e.g. a trained dog) for your dog can provide an array of benefits, which include encouraging exercise and physical activity, relieving loneliness, and providing affection and companionship to your dog.

, A good way to create opportunities for your dog to enjoy time with other dogs is to arrange play dates with friends or family with dogs.Doing so will allow your dog an opportunity to socialize with other dogs and will also allow you to catch up with friends and family at the same time.

, You can also take your dog to a dog park or dog daycare to allow her time to socialize with other dogs. You may not have the time or the financial means to take her to daycare everyday but try doing so at least a few times a week if possible. For more information on dog parks and daycares, visit this website. Be sure that her vaccinations are up to date before going to social gatherings of this nature.

Gather all the toys and treats you’ll need.,
Create an indoor obstacle course.,
Run up and down the stairs.,
Play fetch.,
Hide treats around the house.,
Play hide and go seek.,
Play tag with your dog.,
Teach your dog new skills.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Indoors1," Many of the games you’ll play with your dog will require toys, like ropes, chew toys, or balls. Make sure you are prepared with a variety of toys your dog likes to play with. In addition, you will want to have treats available to reward your dog for good behavior, especially if you’re engaging your dog in training activities.;
, Making an obstacle course for your dog indoors is a good way to work both its brain and body. Your dog will love maneuvering through the course and you’ll likely have a lot of fun setting it up and helping your dog through it. Try some of the following ideas to create an indoor obstacle course for your dog:


Arrange four or five chairs in a zigzag pattern that your dog must navigate. You can also line your chairs up in two straight lines and place a blanket over them to make a tunnel for your dog to run through.
You can create jumps for your dog by placing a broomstick over a couple buckets or by simply holding up a hula hoop for it to jump through.You can also use couch cushions to create tunnels or mazes for your dog to navigate., Getting your dog to run up and down the stairs is also a fun activity that will allow it to get lots of exercise on a rainy day. You can motivate your dog to run up and down the stairs by doing so yourself—your dog will likely follow you. You can also throw a toy up and down the stairs and encourage your dog to go after it., Though your space might be limited, you can probably still find enough space to play fetch with your dog indoors. If you have a hallway in your house, this is a great place to play. You can also move the furniture in your living room aside to create an open runway space where you and your pet can play fetch.


If there is another person in the house, have them sit at the opposite end of the hallway or room and play keep away with the toy when it is thrown to them. This will make the game all the more entertaining and enjoyable for your dog.
Use a soft toy, like a stuffed animal or plush ball, when playing fetch in the house. This will help keep you and your dog from breaking things if you accidentally hit them with the toy.
Also, pay attention to where you are throwing the toy. Try to keep it in an open area, away from tables, sculptures, TV stands, and anything else that could be knocked over or broken., Setting up ways for your dog to scavenge is also a fun indoor activity. To do so, hide some treats all over the house. You can hide them behind doors and underneath tables and rugs. Encourage your dog to sniff them out.You can also vary this game by hiding a treat under an opaque box or container. Set up three or four of these containers and place a treat or toy under only one. Encourage your dog to sniff each container. When your dog stops at the one with the prize, lift it up and enthusiastically praise your dog for finding the right one, then allow your dog to eat the treat or play with the toy as a reward., If your dog knows the command “find it,” this can be a great game for indoors. To play, show your dog an object (usually one of its toys), then put your dog somewhere it can’t see you, like a bathroom, and go hide the toy. When you let your dog out, tell it to “find it.” Your dog will love using its skills to search for the hidden toy.


If your dog is having trouble locating the toy, use verbal clues to let it know when it is on the right track. For example, say “Good!” when your dog is getting close to the hiding spot. You can say something like “Uh-oh!” when it is heading in the wrong direction.
You can also give your dog physical clues if it is having trouble. Try pointing it in the right direction or walking in the direction the toy is hidden.
Get creative with your hiding spots because dogs will often check places they’ve found toys hidden previously.
When your dog finds the hidden toy, praise it enthusiastically, making a very big deal that it has located the item., Playing this game with your dog requires two people and is great for both exercising your dog and working on its mental recall. To play, each person needs a pocket full of treats. Start the game with both people in the same room, a good distance away from each other. One of you should call the dog, giving it a treat when it comes to that person. Next, the other person calls the dog, giving it a treat when it comes. Continue doing this, but keep moving further away from each other. You can even increase the difficulty and move to separate rooms when your dog becomes really good at this game.


Once your dog gets the hang of the game and is excited about it, give it a treat only every other time or every third time it comes to you. You can reward it with praise, a belly rub, or a quick game of tug of war instead.
Increase the excitement in this game by adding in a chase. When your dog comes to you, start running away and make your dog catch you for its reward., You can also use indoor time to teach your dog new skills, like spinning, rolling over, heeling, staying on command, and various other tricks and commands. You may think this sounds more like work than fun, but learning new skills can be fun for your dog. As long as you present it to your dog in an excited and positive manner, your dog will think it’s a fun activity."

Choose a suitable room.,
Check that the area is safe.,
Set up the large items first.,
Add toys for the playroom.,
Add other items that might be useful.,
Add food and water bowls in one area.,
Turn the room into a dog playroom as the puppy matures.",How to Make a Puppy Playroom," It must be a place where you can feel okay about the puppy making a mess, chewing and possibly occasionally urinating or defecating. This means ensuring that the floor is easy-to-clean and fast to dry. For example, industrial/commercial strength carpet, removable carpet squares, tiles (perhaps with washable rugs on top), wooden floorboards which are varnished, etc. Foam jigsaw floor tiles can be used, provided you replace them readily if chewed.


An enclosed porch space can work well. Use trellis fencing or baby fences/gates to enclose it in and lay down easy-to-clean carpet squares.;
, Before adding anything to the playroom, go around and check it with a puppy's eye view. This means looking for anything that might snag the puppy as it runs around and hurls itself against the sides of the room, etc., such as nails, hooks or sharp edges. Fix any such items if found. Also look for anything hanging, such as blind or curtain cords, light cords, and similar, and ensure that these are put well out of the way.


Remove any indoor plants that are not safe for the puppy.

, Choose furniture options and put into the playroom; you may need to rearrange things a bit until they're in the best position for allowing the puppy to get around the room with ease. Some ideas include:


A small stand with slide runs that allow the puppy to run up and down the slides.
Large and small tunnels (cardboard rolls or tent tunnels)
Small stools or child's chair for you to sit on when in the room with the puppy
Steps up to a stand
A small boardwalk
A little den or house to hide inside
A small exercise trampoline
A large litter tray.

, Puppies need toys that allow them to chew, chase, throw, carry and cherish. As such, include a variety of different textures and types of toys, trying to meet this wide range of needs. Some of the things that the puppy can play with include:


A boot tray with lots of small balls in it.
Balls, chew toys, tug toys, Kongs, etc.
Children's toys suitable for dogs
A cuddly toy.

, A few soft furnishings are a nice addition, such as a soft puppy bed or blankets folded inside a box. A pillow or two can be another thing for the puppy to rest on or bounce over.

, Keep this area constant, so that the puppy knows where to feed and get water. The same goes for keeping the litter tray area constant too.

, As your puppy grows, change the items in the room to match the puppy's changes in size and maturity. This might include higher or more challenging exercising items, new and more complex toys and rearrangements in the shape or style of the room.


It's a good idea to introduce new toys regularly, to keep your puppy interested and curious. Discard of broken or dirty toys as needed.

Establish non-violent dominance.,
Train your dog.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Exercise with your dog.,
Play with your dog.,
Be affectionate.,
Feed your dog healthy food.,
Groom your dog.,
Visit the vet regularly.,
Stay calm and positive.",How to Have a Good Relationship With Your Dog," It is important to assert your leadership over your dog early on in your relationship without using physical force. Dogs need structure and consistent discipline to feel secure and comfortable in your home. Without this discipline, a dog's behavior can become unruly and unpredictable (e.g. aggressiveness, hyperactivity). Some ways to establish dominance in a non-violent way are:Make you dog earn treats instead of spoiling it with them
Eat your own meals before feeding your dog
Walk through doorways and enter rooms before allowing your dog to follow
Take charge on walks by setting the pace and controlling the direction you go in;
, Training your dog to respond to commands is a great way to bond with it and ensure smoother communication with it. Teach these commands by using the (non-violent) correction and reward method- correction should involve speaking firmly, but no anger or physical force. To begin, make sure that your dog grasps the five basic commands:""Sit”,""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here.” For details and instructional videos, visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/.

, As a means of encouraging your dog's good behavior, strongly reward it to create positive associations with being obedient. Rewards should include praise, petting, toys, and treats. Avoid harsh punishments for bad behaviour; reprimanding your dog will be effective if you catch it in the act of doing something bad.If you do catch your dog in the act of doing something bad (e.g. chewing on a shoe), simply say ""No!"" in a clear, firm way. Overreacting and scaring your dog will make it lose trust in you and harm your relationship with it.

, Exercise improves mental and physical health for both dogs and owners and promotes better sleep, digestion, and behavior. How much exercise a dog requires depends on its breed but as a general rule, your dog should be getting at least 30-60 minutes of exercise a day. In addition to daily walks, try jogging with your dog or playing fetch outdoors., Playing games with your dog is an excellent way to have fun and maintain a good relationship with it. While fetch and tug-of-war are simple options for games that dogs play almost instinctively, try to branch out to keep things fun and varied. For instance, play hide and seek with your dog, which plays on its bond with you, recognition of your voice, and desire to find you. Other options could include:Setting up an obstacle course for your dog to run through (e.g. with hurdles made out of rolled up blankets)
Playing Simon Says, which can play off of your dog's understanding of basic commands

Playing frisbee, which requires focus and agility from your dog

, Petting your dog regularly can enhance your bond with it and reduce stress for the both of you. Being pet has been shown to reduce heart rate and cortisol levels in shelter dogs. Use praise and petting as often as possible to reinforce your dog's good behavior and improve its confidence., Food intolerances are common in dogs, particularly to commercial dog food high in preservatives and additives. In addition to physical signs (e.g. digestive upsets, skin irritations), food allergies or nutritional deficiencies can have behavioral effects (like aggression or hyperactivity) which can compromise your relationship with your dog. Purchase dog food with natural ingredients, and consult your vet if you have any concerns about your dog's digestive health., Grooming your dog is an excellent bonding opportunity and can contribute to a healthy relationship between you. Most breeds of dog benefit from a weekly brushing, which improves the health of your dog's skin and coat, while breeds with thicker coats may require more through brushing and clipping. While a professional groomer can take care of more demanding grooming tasks such as clipping your dog's nails or cleaning your dog's ears, you can try brushing your dog's teeth, which should be done on a regular basis to maintain your dog's dental health., As your dog's caretaker, it is your job to ensure its health and happiness. Bring your pet to the vet for regular check ups- once a year for dogs 1-7 years old, and twice a year for puppies and dogs older than 7 years old. Ask your vet to ensure that your dog is up to date on all vaccinations and tested for heartworms and intestinal parasites., Dogs are very responsive to human emotion and often reflect it back in their own behavior. For instance, a dog who is around excited people at a party may become overexcited by association. Be conscious of your emotions and try to be as calm as possible in all situations, whether in response to positive or negative behavior from your pet."

Find a place with open space.,
Get away from the road.,
Go to places with lots of stimulants.,
Build a fence around your yard at home.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Outdoors1," Finding a place where your dog has lots of room to run is important when you’re playing outside. Look for a place with a lot of open space, like a dog park or the beach.


If you’re having trouble finding a place, ask other dog owners where their favorite spots to play are.;
, Neither you nor your dog will have much fun if you are worried about it running out in front of a car while you’re trying to play. Find a spot that is far away from any roads or that is fenced in to prevent your dog from accidentally running into danger.

, While a big open field might be a great place for your dog to run free, it will probably get boring pretty fast for you and your dog. Look for places that have trees, bushes, and even a pond or lake. Finding a place with a variety of vegetation and different stimulants will give your dog plenty of things to explore.

, If you have a backyard at your home, make sure you build a secure fence around it if you plan to let your dog play in it. Putting up a fence will give you the peace of mind that your dog will stay safe while it is running and playing with you.

Take a long, brisk walk first thing in the morning.,
Make a busy bucket for your dog.,
Try a self-fetching toy.,
Hire a dog walker.,
Send your dog to daycare.",How to Keep Your Dog Entertained1," Before you leave for work, enjoy some time with your canine friend, and expel some of their energy by taking a walk together. You will both enjoy the exercise, and your dog will be able to have some time outside before they are cooped up inside the house all day.


A 20-minute walk daily is recommended for most breeds of dogs. Working dogs may need two 20-minute walks a day.;
, Find a sturdy aluminum or plastic container and fill it with toys and treats for your dog to discover during the workday. Layer the treats and toys with old hand towels, so that your dog has to dig through to find treasures. To keep them entertained with the bucket from day to day, add new toys that your dog has never seen before every now and then., Technology has not only made our lives easier, it has helped make entertaining our pets easier too. Try iFetch, an automatic ball launcher which will allow your dog to play catch by themselves for hours! There are different sizes that launch full-size tennis balls or smaller balls to accommodate all sizes of dogs and living spaces., If you have tried everything, and your home is still being turned upside-down by your bored dog, consider hiring a dog walker. That way, your dog can get the exercise and stimulation they need without being cooped up all day indoors. Ask for recommendations from friends and other dog owners, and make sure that you find someone who your dog gets along with well.Before hiring someone to walk your dog, ask the person to go on a test walk with you and your dog. You can see if the person is a good fit for your dog’s personality.
Keep in mind that your dog walker will also require access to your house, so make sure to hire someone who you trust in your home.

, Dog daycare provides socialization, exercise, and plenty of stimulation for your dog. If you can afford to, consider sending your dog to daycare at least once or twice a week.Keep in mind that dog daycare is only a good option if your dog gets along well with other dogs and doesn’t have separation anxiety.

Take your dog to the pet store.,
Take your dog to the vet’s office.,
Visit pet-friendly restaurants and shops.,
Schedule doggy play dates.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Indoors2," Having fun with your dog indoors doesn’t mean you can’t leave the house. You and your dog can enjoy going on socialization outings when you can’t be outside. For instance, take your dog to the pet store to pick out a new toy or just meet the other dogs there., You can also take your dog for a visit to the vet’s office, just for fun. Your dog will probably enjoy getting attention from the employees there and it will also make it feel more at ease when going to the vet’s office for health checks, since it won’t associate this place with only pain or uncomfortable procedures., If there are any coffee shops or restaurants in your area that are pet friendly, take your dog to these places every once in a while. Your dog will love getting to meet new people and getting tons of attention from patrons and employees.

, If you have friends with dogs, set up play dates with them for when you have to be indoors. Your dog will enjoy getting to play with another dog and you can enjoy hanging out with your friend.


You can also take your dog to doggy day care, where it will have the chance to socialize and play with a number of other dogs."

Give your dog bathroom breaks when needed.,
Place pee pads around the house.,
Pick an appropriate place to play.,
Move breakable items to a safe place.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Indoors3," Taking your dog outside to go to the bathroom in inclement weather is not fun, but it’s necessary to have a fun day indoors with your dog. Once you’ve had your dog for a while, you’ll learn to identify the signs your dog gives you that it needs to go outside. If you’re not sure how to tell when your dog needs to go, look for the following signals:


Turning in circles while sniffing the floor is one signal. Circling in dogs is a natural indication that they are going to poop and sniffing may indicate they are looking for an area to go to the bathroom.
Standing, scratching, or barking at the door is another indication your dog needs to use the bathroom. Housebroken dogs will usually do one of these things when they need to go out.
If your dog is whining while doing the things above, it is usually a good indication it needs to go to the bathroom. Whining by itself can mean any number or things, but when it is combined with sniffing, circling, and standing, scratching, or barking at the door, you can safely assume your dog needs to go outside., To keep from having to go outside in inclement weather, you can also place pee pads around the house so that your dog can urinate without going outside. Bathrooms and laundry rooms are good spots to place these pee pads.

, Depending what kind of games you’ll be playing with your dog, you might want to play in a room with few breakable items, like TVs, vases, and picture frames. You might also need a room with a lot of space if you’re playing fetch or making obstacle courses for your dog. Once you’ve decided what type of games you will be playing, choose a room that gives you the right amount of space and doesn’t set your dog up for trouble by having too many things it can break accidentally.

, No matter where you play in your house, playing with your dog indoors can get rowdy, so make sure you move anything valuable that might get knocked over or broken to a safe place. For example, move breakable vases or picture frames up high or to a safe room.

Play fetch.,
Throw a Frisbee.,
Play with water.,
Play hide and seek.,
Get your dog to chase you.,
Blow bubbles for your dog.,
Work on scent tracking.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Outdoors2," One of the most classic games you can play with your dog outside is fetch. Traditionally, you’d throw a ball or a stick you found outside for your dog to retrieve and bring back to you. You can, however, vary how you play fetch to keep it interesting for your dog. For instance, try brining some other toys with you, like a toy bone or stuffed animal, and throw these for your dog to retrieve.


Also, vary the height, direction, and length at which you throw while you’re playing fetch with your dog. This will help keep it interested in the game.While you are playing, work on your dog’s obedience training. Focus on training your dog to learn commands like “come,” “drop it,” “lie down,” and “release.”, Playing Frisbee with your dog is a bit different than playing fetch. The Frisbee hangs in the air after you throw it, giving your dog an extra challenge in trying to catch it before it hits the ground. Once it catches the Frisbee, have your dog return it to you so you can throw it again.


You can buy Frisbees in varying degrees of toughness, depending how aggressive your dog is when playing this game. If your dog is rather gently with the Frisbee, a soft Frisbee will be fine, but if your dog is tough on Frisbees, get one that is more durable., Generally, dogs love water and yours will probably enjoy playing or swimming in it while it is outside. Try setting up sprinklers for your dog to run through in your back yard or taking it to the beach or lake for a swim.Make sure you have a towel handy to dry your dog off before it comes inside the house or gets into your car.

, Hide and seek is a fun game for your dog, as well as one that will allow it to practice its tracking skills. To start, show an item, like a toy or ball, to your dog and allow it to sniff and study the item. Then take the item and hide it. If you have another person with you, you can have them hold the dog while you do this. Or, depending how well your dog is trained, tell your dog to “stay” while you hide the item. When you come back, tell your dog to “find it” and allow it to go hunt the item.You can give your dog verbal clues if it is having trouble locating the item. For example, say “Good!” if it is getting close and “Uh-oh” if it is heading in the wrong direction.
You can also help your dog by pointing in the direction of the toy or moving in the direction where it is hidden.
Praise your dog enthusiastically when it locates the item. You can also give it a treat after finding the hidden toy.

, Another way to have fun with your dog outdoors is to get it to chase you. To do this, mimic another dog and bend down in front of your dog, putting your hands on the ground. Then take off in one direction. Your dog will likely catch on and chase you. Vary the patterns in which you move, making it more challenging for your dog to catch you., Kids aren’t the only ones who love playing with bubbles—your dog will too. Blow some bubbles around your dog and allow them to chase after them, snapping at them with its mouth and bursting them with its nose or paws.


Make sure you get pet-safe bubbles that will not be toxic to your dog if they are ingested or irritating to your dog’s eyes or skin., Tie a string around one of your dog’s favorite toys—preferably one it has just been chewing on—and drag this toy along the ground in some type of pattern (like an “L” or “S” shape, for example). Hide the toy at the end of the trail under a big leaf, some sticks, or a pile of grass. Bring your dog to the beginning of the track and tell it to “find it.” Your dog will love using its scent-tracking skills to locate the toy.


If your dog is having trouble, try pointing to the ground or dragging your finger along the scent trail."

Gather up interactive treats.,
Make an honest assessment of your dog’s smarts, creativity, and stubbornness.,
Fill up the interactive toy.,
Do a test run.,
Check the toy after your dog has finished with it.,
Arrange a series of toys stuffed with food and treats throughout your dog’s living area.",How to Keep Your Dog Entertained2," You might want to start with purchasing a Kong (or two) from your local pet store, a hard rubber toy that can be filled with dog food and stuffing (such as peanut butter or Kong stuffing, small dog biscuits or milk bones). Your dog will have to work at getting the treats out of the cavity of the toy, and this can keep them entertained for hours., Interactive food toys can be stuffed in a way that makes it easy or hard to get the rewards out. As a general rule, the smarter the dog, the more challenging you can make it. If it’s too hard, then the dog’s motivation disappears.

, You can use a mixture of dog food, dog treats, and additional flavorings (peanut butter, Kong stuffing).


Optional – place the toy in the freezer. This makes it take longer to get the insides out but is not necessary. You can use frozen treats, such as Frosty Paws dog ice cream, if you are going to freeze the toy.

, At a scheduled mealtime, call your dog, tell them to “sit”, and offer them the toy.


Supervise your dog while they work on getting the goods out of the toy. Note whether they move around a lot or settles in on one spot. Some toys require movement – such as the Buster Ball – so make sure that whatever falls out is safe for your floor and furniture (Frosty Paws ice cream, for example, is not the perfect add on to your new suede sofa.)

, Pick it up and check to see if they got everything. If they did, then you can try to make it even more challenging next time. If they did not, check to see what the problem was. Milk bones can cross at the gap and prevent items from falling out, stuffing can stick, and other random things can happen. Adjust accordingly by placing fewer or smaller milk bones in the toy, only having the stuffing at the edges, etc.

, Space them apart so that they do not settle in first thing and get them all right away. For example, you may want to place the Kong toy in the kitchen and a Buster Ball in a back bedroom (if your dog is free to roam in the house). If they stay in a crate, provide a couple of toys that don’t require a lot of movement to get the treats out. Make it as hard as your dog can handle to get the treats so that it takes time.


Alternate the toys and treats that are given to your dog so that each day brings a challenge.

Ensure your dog is wearing a collar.,
Pack a bag for your dog.,
Practice basic commands.",How to Have Fun with Your Dog Outdoors3," You should make sure your dog is wearing its collar all the time, but especially when you take it outdoors. Even well-trained dogs can run off after another animal or car and become lost. Making sure your dog is wearing a collar with your contact information on it can help ensure sure your dog is returned to you if this happens., If you’re planning to spend a good amount of time outside with your dog, make sure it has everything it needs to be comfortable. Pack a bag that has essentials like water, a water bowl, food, bug spray, a canine first-aid kit, and poop bags. Preparing for your dog’s needs ahead of time will allow you both to enjoy your day., You should start practicing basic commands with your dog when it is a puppy so that you can keep control of it when it becomes larger. This is especially important if you and your dog are playing outside without a leash.Focus on basic commands like sit, stay, heel, come, and lay down to start.

Tug a rope.,
Toss soft toys.,
Put food in puzzle toys.,
Give them chew toys.",How to Keep an Indoor Dog Active1," Find a soft rope dog toy, and shake it in front of the dog. When they grab on to it, hold onto the rope to play tug-of-war. Do not let go easily. Let the dog tug for a few minutes before one of you wins. The dog may bring the rope back to you to play again., You can play fetch indoors with your dog, as long as you use soft toys instead of hard or bouncy balls. Find a toy like a stuffed animal, squeaky toy, or felt ball. Toss it a few feet away. Say “fetch” or ""go get it"" as you throw. The dog should pick the toy up and bring it back to you. Toss it again until either you or the dog is tired.Even with a soft toy, you should not aim it towards anything breakable or valuable.

, Puzzle toys keep your dog mentally and physically engaged. Put a treat or some kibble inside. Watch as your dog tries to get it out. For an extra challenge, hide the food puzzles around the house. Your dog will be able to smell the treats inside, and they’ll hunt around to find them.Many puzzle toys are plastic containers with buttons and a compartment for a treat. Your dog will paw and press the buttons until the compartment opens.
Some puzzle toys are balls that your dog must roll and turn to free the treat.
You can fill a KONG toy with peanut butter. Your dog will spend a long time trying to lick it out.

, Chew toys relieve your dog’s urge to chew. If your dog is left home alone, a chew toy can keep them engaged while they are alone. Good chew toys include:Chew ropes

Schedule training session appropriately.,
Decide whether your dog would rather go in or out.,
Get some treats with a strong scent.,
Stand on the opposite side of the door as your dog.,
Lift the flap all the way up.,
Call your dog.,
Reward them.,
Go to the other side of the door.,
Hold the flap a bit lower.,
Lower the flap more and more.,
Have the dog use the flap without calling.",How to Train Your Dog to Use a Dog Door1," It is important to limit your dog’s training to short spans of time when you can give your dog your undivided attention. Choose a time of day where you won’t be distracted by other tasks, and when your dog is alert and active.Make sure to have your dog’s favorite treats easily accessible as you will want to be able to give them the treat immediately after performing the correct behavior.
Limit training sessions to ten minutes at a time. This will help both you and your dog avoid becoming frustrated. You can do more than one session in a day, but be sure to have several hours “rest” in between each session, and don’t push your dog’s attention by going over ten minutes of training.;
, Does your dog love to be lazy and lay inside on the couch, or would they rather be outside running around in the yard? When training your dog, you’ll want them to have as much incentive as possible to go through the door. If your dog loves being outside do your training sessions so that the dog is inside and you are outside.Practice with your dog going both in and out of the door, but if your dog is not using the door at all, start with getting your dog to go the place they enjoy being most.

, Choose a treat that has a strong enough smell so that they will be able to smell the treats from a few feet away. Put a few of the treats in your hand and close your fist tightly. Let the dog smell and lick your hand so that they know you have them.You will use these treats as a reward for going all the way through the dog door. It is important to reward your dog for any progress, though. In the case that your dog comes to or part way through the door, use lots of verbal encouragement, but don’t give the dog the treat.

, Let your dog see you going through the door. This doesn’t mean you need to crawl through the dog door yourself, but your dog should be fully aware that you are on the other side of the door.For example, if your dog door is installed in the door, then let your dog see you exit through that door (the human door). If your dog’s door is installed in a normal wall, make sure your dog sees you leaving.

, If your dog door is the type that requires a chip, you will have to disable it for training. Lift the flap as far open as it will go.In the initial training stage it is important that the flap doesn’t hit your dog on their way in or out. For some dogs this can be traumatic and will make them afraid of the door.

, Make sure you use a very happy and enthusiastic voice. Act as though you have never been more excited to see your dog, and that you really want them to come to you.Using an enthusiastic voice will excite your dog and make them want to come to you.

, It is important to reward the dog with lots of verbal encouragement as they come toward and through the door, even if they don’t go all the way through. If your dog does make it all the way through you should celebrate with them as though it’s the best thing that ever happened, and be sure to give them a treat.Offer them lots of affection and use a very happy tone of voice. This will show them that they did the right thing, and that going through the dog door is not off-limits.
If your dog is skittish you should use a happy voice and lots of affection, but don’t yell as this may scare them. Try to adapt the reward to your dog’s personality. If your dog is easily frightened then keep a happy, but soft voice.

, Now you can repeat the process, but this time with you on the opposite side from where you started. This way, your dog will get used to going both ways.If your dog is still pretty frightened of the door you can stay on the same side as you started, which means that your dog is coming through the door to their favorite place (inside or outside) and to their favorite person (you).

, Once your dog seems comfortable with going through the dog door with the flap completely open, have them do the same thing; but this time, hold the flap so it is only halfway open. This will mean that the flap touches your dog.This may be a bit more frightening for your dog so remember to use lots and lots of encouragement, even if they don’t make it all the way through.
Remember not to push your dog too hard. If you try lowering the flap, but your dog is too scared to come through, end the session and begin again in a few hours (or the next day) but with the flap a bit more open.

, As the training continues and your dog becomes more comfortable with the flap touching them, you can lower it a little more each time. Keep the training positive and upbeat. Eventually your dog will go through the flap without you holding it at all.Take it slow, though. It is important to understand that training may take weeks or months for some dogs. If you notice that your dog is becoming fearful at any point, stop the training and start again with the flap a bit higher (or all the way up). It may take patience, but eventually they will learn that the door is a good thing.

, Throughout the training, you have been using your calls as a signal to come through the door. Once your dog seems completely comfortable with going through the flap unassisted, you can teach them that it is OK to go through the flap without you.To do this, put your dog on one side of the door and go to the other side without calling them. Do something that you know your dog enjoys. Go outside and play (with kids if you have them). Run around the yard and make happy noises that will signal to the dog that they are missing out on something fun. If they come out the door on their own, celebrate with them. Give them lots of affection and play with their favorite toy with them.

Plan ahead to keep your dog entertained when traveling.",How to Keep Your Dog Entertained3," If your dog enjoys riding in the car, take them with you as you run your weekend errands. Some dogs enjoy going through the car wash, for instance, as they like to watch the sights and sounds of the brushes cleaning the car. Some home improvement stores allow leashed dogs inside, so you can take your furry friend along with you as you go pick up paint or yard supplies.


Seeing new places and experiencing new things is always exciting and stimulating for dogs; your dog will probably have fun no matter where you go, and they’ll fall asleep exhausted and happy when you arrive home.Never leave your dog alone in a car, especially on a hot day.

, Most cities have off-leash dog parks that are open to the public.

Swimming is great exercise for dogs, and the experience of being in the water engages their senses.


For dogs, one minute of swimming is the equivalent of four minutes of running! The resistance of the water makes them work harder to swim than they have to work to run on land, and this improves their overall muscle tone., If your weekend plans include meeting up with friends for a meal or a drink, don’t leave your canine friend behind! Dog-friendly patios at restaurants are becoming more and more common, and many even offer your pup a bowl of water or a treat.

, Dogs (especially puppies) are very social creatures, and need plenty of time to interact with their own species. Make sure that you find a play companion for your pup who is around the same size and temperament as your dog, so that both dogs stay safe, and enjoy their time together.Introduce your dog to new buddies on neutral territory (while on a walk or at a park), so that the dogs don’t feel like they need to defend their home turf from stranger dogs.

, All you need to keep your dog entertained for hours at the park is a tennis ball or Frisbee. Throw the ball across a field, and tell them to “go fetch” it, or teach them to catch the Frisbee in their mouth.


Your dog may also enjoy a game of tug-of-war. It’s a fun and easy way to wear your dog out and burn off any excess energy., Just like humans, dogs get tired of being in a car for too long. If you take your dog along on a weekend getaway or a longer vacation, then you may need to find ways to keep him entertained.


Stop at rest stops for walks and bathroom breaks. Most rest areas along highways offer places to walk dogs, and some even have fenced-in areas to allow your canine friend a safe place to run around.
Bring along some new toys as well. Before you venture out on a trip with your dog, buy some new toys and mix them in with some old familiar favorites. A chew toy is a good option.

Then, leave the dog inside or have a friend distract it while you hide the toy or treat. Then, let your dog look for it.


You may need to train your dog to fetch their favorite toy by name. Say something like, “Get the ball,” each time you throw or hide their favorite ball. That way, when you take the dog outside to find the hidden object, you can use this command to get started.
Hide toys or treats in obvious spots at first. Then, place them in increasingly difficult locations as your pup gets better at finding them.
Don't hide the treat underground, this could promote digging holes in your garden., Dogs enjoy running and jumping, so by playing chase, you give your dog something to run from and remain a part of their play.

Watch your dog carefully.",How to Go Boating With Your Dog," Begin by bringing your dog out on the boat when you are at dock. Next time, try bringing him out to the dock, but turn the motor on to get him accustomed to the sound. Then, take him on a short boat ride and then progressively longer rides.


This is important for getting your dog comfortable with the boat.
It is also an opportunity to train your dog to be safe on the boat, teaching it commands and how to get on and off the boat.
Short trips will also be a good opportunity to determine whether or not your dog gets sea sick. If so, you will need to buy medications that make your dog more comfortable.;
, It is good to see if your dog is fine swimming in water at the dock before venturing into the deep. You should recognize, however, that there are additional dangers in open waters. Typically it is better to be safe than sorry and keep your dog on the boat.


You need to consider whether your dog can handle the current or tide. The water quality might also be bad and there could be threats lurking underneath.
If you do play catch in the deep, keep two balls on hand. That way, if your dog begins to swim too far away, you can throw the second to lure him back., It is particularly imperative that your dog should know “sit” and “stay.” You should also teach it the command “on boat” and off boat,” so that it will follow you when you are ready to get on and off boat.


It is important to teach your dog “sit” and “stay.” That way, you can stop your dog when it is trying to jump into or drink the water, either of which can be dangerous., Your dog might be reticent to use the restroom without any green space, or, alternatively, might go places you'd rather it not. You should try to place a piece of AstroTurf, puppy pads, or sod for the dog to go on. When you first take your dog out, begin to train it go in this space.


If you have taught your dog the command “do your business,” it will be easier to train your dog to go to the bathroom on the boat.If this is impossible, keep doggie waste bags, paper towels, and odor neutralizer on hand. This is good sanitary policy, but it also has safety implications. You don’t want to slip on your doggy’s business.Consider training your dog to use the facilities on the back swim platform, where you can wash it off with the transom wash down. You only want to wash off the dog’s urine and not solids. Solids will need to be bagged until you get back to shore and disposed of properly.

, You should have a plan for getting your dog back on board if it falls off. While at dock, teach it to come to a ladder or swimming platform where it will be easier to help it back on board. For small dogs, consider keeping a fishing net on board, that you can use to sweep it back on board., Life jackets for dogs can be purchased at most pet stores and boating stores. Bring your dog with you to the store to try a life vest on. Make sure that it fits well before you buy it. If you have trouble figuring out to use the straps to secure the vest on your dog, ask for assistance at the store before venturing out.These will typically cost anywhere from $20 to $80.

, Leashes that go around the neck can be very dangerous on a boat, because the waves can toss around your dog, putting a lot of pressure on your dog’s neck. Use a harness that goes around its torso and legs so that pressure will be more evenly distributed.

, Put a tag on your dog that includes your cell phone number, your marina location, and your slip number. Consider having an ID microchip implanted in your dog., Bring any medications that your dog is on and antibiotic ointments in case it scratches itself.Full pet first aid kits can be purchased at most pet stores.


A human first aid kit can also work, but you should keep some pet specific items on board: contact information for your vet, copies of important medical information including rabies vaccination, self-cling bandage, and a muzzle., If you are not sure if your dog is susceptible to seasickness, you should keep the medication on board. Talk to a veterinarian about what medications are appropriate for your dog. Generally some human seasickness medications will work, specifically Benadryl and Dramamine. , There are no national regulations pertaining to the way that dogs are handled on board a ship. However, some states might have laws, as do some foreign nations. Research the laws in any of the political units that you will be venturing into on your trip.Pennsylvania, for example, limits the number of dogs that you can have on Fish and Boat Commission lakes to two, but lifts the rule that dogs must be on a leash, once the dog is on board a boat., Find a shady location or air conditioned cabin that you can keep your dog in for part of the trip. Be sure that there is plenty of cool water for it to cool off with and that the water is well secured.To limit the amount of water that gets spilled, bring a large water bowl and fill it up half way. Spilt water can cause accidents.

, Dogs can get burned if exposed to the sun for too long. An SPF 15 spray is optimal. Try to find an unscented spray so that your dog does not get agitated., Bathroom throw rugs and outdoor carpet will serve multiple purposes for your dog. It will prevent your dog from slipping on the deck. It will also protect your pet’s feet. Dogs absorb heat through the pads on their feet and boat surfaces can get very hot in the sun.


Alternatively, you can put shoes on your dog to protect its feet.

, Keep your dog on short tether so that it can’t venture too far away and never leave it unattended. Tell your dog to stop or sit if it seems like it is about to drink water outside of the boat. Lake, river, and ocean water can be polluted and dangerous for your dog.


Keeping sufficient water on board and providing cool spaces will discourage your dog from drinking untreated water.

Get the proper diapers for your dog.,
Clean up the dog's hind quarters with baby wipes to ensure they are clean until their next use.,
Slip the diaper's hole through the top of the tail.Dog diapers come with holes for the tail to stick out which is nice.,
Open each diaper tape on both sides of the diaper.,
Grab the front of the dog diaper and slip through the dog's legs until it stops moving.,
Grab one side of the diaper tapes with your free hand, and place these tapes up on the diaper's back cover which should be riding on your dog's back.

,
Work on adjusting the tapes to the other side, as soon as they other side's tapes have been fully secured.

",How to Put a Disposable Dog Diaper on Your Dog," Do not use baby diapers for your dog, but do use diapers designed to fit a dog. You can purchase dog diapers at a pet store or Walmart.;
, Baby wipes are the only safe item that can have a dual usage for humans as well as dogs and can be used in a variety of situations.

, If your dog has a cropped tail so much that the tail is almost unnoticeable, cover the hole up with tape before applying the diaper on the dog to prevent leakage.

, Much like a human disposable diaper, dog disposable diapers have tapes on them that will help secure to the dog for a comfortable fit and help hold the diaper to the dog (However, unlike a human diaper that has it's tapes designed for securing in front, dog diapers have just the opposite due to the format of the dog's posterior end and the ease of use of the product for a more natural fit.)

Repeat this process a few times.,
Hold your dog in front of the door.,
Call the dog back through the door.",How to Train Your Dog to Use a Dog Door2," This method should only be used by dogs who aren’t afraid of the door, but simply haven’t figured out how to use the door. If you try this method and your dog exhibits any fear, then try a different method.This method probably won’t work well for a large dog that you can’t easily pick up and place through the door using two hands.

, When training your dog, choose a time where your dog is active and alert and where you won’t be distracted or disturbed by other things going on in the house.Limit the training session to ten minutes at a time to avoid frustration. If you train for too long both you and your dog might become frustrated, which will cause the dog to associate the door with negative feelings. By limiting sessions to ten minutes at a time, you improve your chances for success.
You can train more than once a day if you like, but be sure to have several hours “rest” in between each session.

, Using a soft, soothing voice pick your dog up using both hands. You don’t want your dog to get the idea that something bad is going to happen or that they have done something wrong. Make sure that it is clear that everything is alright.Hold your hands gently but firmly around your dog’s ribcage so that they feel secure.

, To do this, you will need to press your dog’s face gently up against the door and push him through. Do this gently and slowly so that your dog won’t become frightened.Do this gently. Don’t jam your dog through the door as you will probably scare them, and you might even injure them.

, Once your dog is through the door, get excited. Show the dog that you are happy that they went through the door, and give them lots of affection and a treat (if you want).If your dog seemed fearful or agitated by the door, stop the training and try another method.

, As long as your dog seems comfortable, you can continue this type of training over the course of a few days. Each time you place your dog through the door, be sure to celebrate the event with lots of attention.You can put the dog through the door more than once in a training session, but remember to limit the session to 10 minutes.

, Once you have put your dog through the door several times, try holding the dog around the ribcage a few inches from the door. The dog should use his own nose to push his way through the door.If the dog doesn’t seem to understand, keep placing the dog through on your own. Eventually, they will get the hang of it.
Don’t forget to give your dog lots of praise when they push themselves through the door.

, Once your dog has learned how to push their way through the door, stand on the other side and call your dog. If they come through on their own, give them lots of praise and a treat.


If they don’t come back through, pick them up and hold them in front of the door again so they can push their way through."

Make sure the door is big enough that your dog can fit easily.,
Consider the possibility of intruders.,
Make sure that your yard is a safe place for your dog.,
Reinforce your fence, if necessary.,
Check for poisonous plants and chemicals in your yard.,
Pick up any small rocks, toys, or other debris that your dog could swallow.,
Make sure the yard will be a fun place for your dog.,
Teach children that the dog door is not for them.",How to Train Your Dog to Use a Dog Door3," The door should be at least 2 inches (5.5 cm) above the top of your dogs shoulders to be tall enough for them. Additionally, the door must be at least 2 inches (5.5 cm) wider than the widest part of your dogs body (usually the shoulders or hips).When installing your dog’s door, be sure to consider that they may gain weight as they age. Though you want to ensure that your dog stays at a healthy weight, if they are on the thin side at the moment, consider that they may get a bit wider in old age.
If your dog is a puppy when you install the door, be sure to think about the fact that they will grow. In the case of some breeds, your puppy will grow significantly. When installing the door, find out how big the dog could possibly get and install a door that will be big enough for a full-grown dog of that size.

, This doesn’t necessarily refer to people, though if your dog door is big enough, burglars could potentially enter through an unsecured dog door. You should also think about potential animals in your area that might enter through the dog’s door. For example, if you live in an area where there are many raccoons, they could sneak in through the door.


If you are worried about this issue, consider installing a plastic door that comes with a lock. This will allow you to manually lock and unlock the door when you need to. You could also consider an electronic door. These doors come with a chip that goes on your dogs collar, and will only open for an animal wearing the chip. Some doors even work with your pet’s microchip, and will open for your dog when he comes close to it.

, Dog doors should open to an area that will be safe for your dog. Usually, this will be your fenced-in yard. Before training your dog to use the door, take time to make sure that your yard will be safe for your dog.For example, make sure that your fence is high enough so that your dog cannot jump out. Some dogs can jump higher than you might think, so do some research into your dog’s breed to see how high they might be able to jump.

, If a dog can’t jump out, they may dig themselves out more easily. You can prevent this by lining your fence with large stones or by having your fence extend into the ground so that your dog would have to dig very deep in order to get out.


Before letting your dog in the yard unsupervised, be sure to spend time watching their behavior in the yard to help identify any areas in the fence where your dog might consider as a good play to jump over or dig under.

, Some plants are toxic to dogs; for example, a weed known as foxtail grass can make your dog very sick if it get’s in their eyes or mouth. Other plants such as ferns, Aloe Vera, and Alocasia are all toxic to dogs. You can find a more complete lists of all plants toxic to dogs here


Put away any pesticides or chemicals that are laying around. If you notice any bottles of weed killer, chemicals, or any substance that can be potentially harmful to your dog, find a safe place to store it. Don’t leave it laying around or your dog may get bored and play with it.
If you have treated your lawn with any pesticides or chemicals, check the label to see what it says about pets. If it doesn’t say anything, keep your dog off of the lawn for at least 24 hours after application and contact your veterinarian to see what they say.

, Dogs sometimes swallow rocks on accident, and these stones can get caught in their intestines. The same goes for any small items your dog could fit in his mouth, which they could swallow or choke on. Limit the things lying in your yard to toys that are safe for your dog.

, While you want your yard to be safe for your dog, you also want it to be fun so the dog doesn’t get bored and look for ways to escape. Make sure your dog has access to fresh water, shade to get out of a hot sun, and plenty of dog-friendly toys to play with.


For example, toys that are made of rubber and are free from strings or other pieces that might be chewed off and ingested are a good choice. Make sure that the toy is large enough so that your dog can chew on it or play with it, but can’t be swallowed.If you want to give your dog something soft to give them comfort while you are gone during the day, try wearing around a soft, old sweater for a few days. Then give this to your dog to have. It will provide them with something to carry around in their mouth, and will be comforting to them because it smells like you.

, If you have young children, it is important that you teach them that the dog door is only for the dog. A small child trying to squeeze through a dog door could get stuck and suffer from injuries. It could even prove fatal if the child gets stuck in the door and cannot breathe.Installing a dog door that can only be opened with a microchip or a chip on the dog’s collar may also help prevent this.

Catch up on some sleep.,
Hide a toy or treat inside the house.,
Teach your dog new tricks.,
Start a tug-of-war game.",How to Have a Fun Day with Your Dog2," Nothing can be more relaxing than having a lazy day at the house with your dog. Take a nap, lounge around, and catch up on your rest. This is especially good if you and your dog are typically very active. It’s important to maintain an adequate amount of quality sleep time, and snuggling up with your dog for a nap or a few extra hours of sleep in the morning is a great bonding opportunity., Just like outside, this is a fun way to keep your pet busy without having to overly exert yourself. Show the dog a treat or toy. Then, keep the dog in another area until you’ve hidden it, and tell your dog to find the toy. If it can't find the hidden object after a while, give it a clue or show your dog where it is. Your dog will get better at this with practice.


If you have a dog that stays inside during the day, hide some treats or toys around the house. This will keep the dog occupied while it is not being directly observed., Training is a great way to spend time with your pet. Dogs like to learn and make their owners happy. Take time to teach your dog tricks that are just for fun like shaking hands and rolling over, but devote the bulk of your training time to helping your dog learn how to ask for your help or get your attention.


Reinforce with treats, but remember the goal of training for your pet shouldn’t be getting food. It should be discovering how to get positive responses from you, so a simple, “Good job!” and a pat on the head are just as important.
For instance, dogs who jump on people when they come to the door can be trained to stay calm. Go outside and wait a few moments. Knock on the door. Let yourself in. If the dog jumps, stand there until it returns to the ground, pet your dog, and tell it good job., This is another game that’s easy to play inside because it doesn’t involve a lot of movement that could potentially break or damage your furniture or other items in the home. You can buy special tug of war ropes and toys for your pet, or tie a knot in an old gym sock. As you hold one end, let your pup pull the other. After a few seconds, give the toy to your dog, and tell it, “Good job!”"

Get some doggy chew toys.,
Make fun toys for your pet.,
Purchase puzzle toys.,
Choose healthy treats.",How to Have a Fun Day with Your Dog3," Dogs need strong, healthy teeth to thrive. Chew toys are a great way to keep their teeth healthy. Some chew toys are made of durable plastics, rubber, and other materials that will last your pup a long time. Others, like bones or rawhide, are edible., If you don’t have a lot of money to buy new toys for your pet, get creative. Your house is probably full of dog toys. Gym socks are a great toy option. You can fill the toes of old socks with treats that your pup will have to dig out, or tie a knot in the socks and play tug of war. Use an old tennis ball as a puzzle toy. Cut a small incision in the ball along the white lines. Pull back the flap, fill with treats, push the flap inside of the tennis ball, and give it to your pup. Your dog will have a blast getting the treats out.


Do something different to clothes and other home-made items, so your pup knows which socks or clothes belong to it. For instance, tie a knot in socks or attach old clothes around a plastic bottle. Otherwise, don’t give your pet old shoes, cushions, clothes, or other household items you’ve taught it not to chew. This will undo its training., Challenging your dog to use its brain, teeth, and paws to get a reward is a great way to help it pass the time. There are numerous varieties of puzzle toys available for dogs of all sizes. Some of these toys are made to hide treats. There are also puzzle toys that your dog will need to pull apart. You can then put the toys back together, allowing your pup to start the fun all over again., When purchasing foods or making them in the home, make sure to keep in mind your dog’s health and weight. If you have a dog that is overweight or has other health concerns, look for treats that are lower in calories or that include health supplements. Remember a word of encouragement or petting your pup can be just as effective.


Ask your vet for recommendations, or talk to a representative at your local pet store.
Cheese, beef jerky, and lunch meats are all relatively affordable and healthy treats for your dog.
Check the label on store bought snacks looking for high calorie counts, ingredients that you don’t recognize, and other tell-tale signs the treats are less than healthy."

It also strengthens your bond with your dog and its trust in you. Make the most of your weekend with your pet by taking a leisurely and scenic walk through a local park., Playing fetch and frisbee with your dog are great ways to bond with it. These games will allow your dog to burn off extra energy. If your dog does not take to this simple game easily, take the time to teach it how to fetch by guiding it through the process step by step (e.g. teaching it the ""Drop it"" command using correction and reward).


Some breeds are instinctively more inclined to chase and retrieve things than others (e.g. retrievers and spaniels), but all breeds can be shown how to fetch with the right prompting and encouragement.

, Socialization with other dogs is very important for your pet to acclimatize it to interactions with other animals, and to prevent aggression due to fear or lack of experience. Take advantage of free time on weekends to visit a dog park and let your dog play freely with other pets, whose owners you can socialize with in the meantime. Visit http://www.dogpark.com/ to search for a dog park or dog run in your city.Monitor your dog while it is in the dog park. If you notice it exhibiting signs of distress or aggression, remove it immediately.

This activity may be pursued for fun or competitively.For more information, visit the American Kennel Club website at https://webapps.akc.org/club-search/#/agility to search for an agility club near you, where your dog can get agility training and practice.

, If you have a breed of dog that is well suited for vigorous exercise (e.g. a Husky or Rhodesian Ridgeback), consider bringing them for a backpacking trip on a nearby trail. Check with local authorities to make sure that dogs are allowed on the trail, and inquire about whether permits are necessary. Prepare your dog for the exercise prior to this adventure by talking it on long walks or short hikes, and read up on basic first aid to treat your dog in the event of illness or injury.Be sure to bring water for both you and your dog, as well as a first aid kit.

Buy pre-made fence panels.",How to Install Wire Fencing for Dogs," There are two different types of wire fences that people typically use to restrain dogs. Both will keep dogs in your yard, but they differ in durability and price.


Chain link fence: These tend to be more expensive than other forms of wire fencing, but they are strong and durable. They will last a long time, and they are compliant with many housing associations' guidelines. That said, the large holes in the chain link can make it easy for strangers to stick in hands or objects to taunt your dog.

Farm fence: These are cheap fences made from wire mesh stretched out over fence posts. They will not obstruct views in your yard, but they can corrode and may need frequent maintenance.;
, If you choose to use wooden posts for your fence, the first step to building a wire fence for your dog is to dig holes for your corner posts. Since corner posts have more tension on them than line posts (the posts in between your corner posts), the holes dug for them need to be deeper. The holes for your corner posts should be about 2 ½ to 3 feet (.76 to .91 meters) deep.


You can use a hand-held clamshell post digger for most jobs. However, if you have a lot of posts or the ground is rocky and tough to dig, an auger, or drill-like tool, might be helpful.If the ground where you are placing your posts is wet or made of clay, you will need deeper holes for your posts., Corner posts need to be sturdier than your line posts. Generally, your corner posts should be about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) in diameter and about 7 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 meters) long. Place these posts in your corner holes and fill in the hole with just enough soil to keep them from moving around.


Hold a level vertically to the side of the post to make sure it is straight., You should install a brace post for every fence line leading to your corner post. The brace post helps take some tension off the corner post and keeps it from falling down or becoming loose. Dig holes for these posts that are 2 ½ to 3 feet (.76 to .91 meters) deep, like you did for your corner posts. The brace post should be approximately 8 feet away from the corner post, along the fence line., As you did with the corner posts, place your brace posts in the holes you’ve dug and fill in a bit of the soil to keep them in place. Hold a level vertically along the side of the post to make sure it is straight before filling it in., Once you have your corner and brace posts in place and level, fill in the holes with dirt, clay, or sand to keep the posts in place. You must pack the dirt, clay, or sand down as you go to make sure the post is solid. Add a little dirt at a time, making sure you pack it down well after each bit you add.


You can use a long board, hoe, a pipe with a curved end, or similar items to pack down the dirt. This will help you pack the dirt tightly and keep you from scraping your knuckles against the wooden posts in the process.For fences that need to be extra secure, you can pour concrete into the post hole and secure it in the ground this way., Once you have your corner and brace posts secured in the ground, install a brace wire between the two to stabilize the posts. This brace wire will run diagonally from the bottom of your corner post to the top of your brace post. To secure the wire, start a fence staple at both the bottom of your corner post and the top of your brace post. Start the wire through the staple on your corner post and run it up through the staple at the top of your brace post, around the top of the brace post, and back down and around your corner post. Once you have the wire in place, drive the staples in tightly. Staple any loose wire to the post as well.


Brace wire is sold at most supply stores. It is usually 9-gague and flexible. It is not the same as fence wire., Once your brace wire is in place, add a wooden crosspiece in between the top of your corner post and brace post. The crosspiece should be long enough to fit snuggly between the two posts (about 8 feet or 2.5 meters long). Make a notch on the inside of each post that you can slip the crosspiece into and secure it in place using nails.


You can also use pipe, old steel fence posts, or even bed rails as your crosspiece., You’ll need to apply tension to the brace wire to make your corner and brace posts even more sturdy. To do so, cut a piece of wood, pipe, rod, or a similar sturdy material to about 16 inches (41 centimeters) long. Place one end of this lever at the top corner of your brace post, in between the two brace wires you just secured. Twist the lever until the wires are as tight as possible. Once you have them taut, rest the other end of the lever against the crosspiece. It will stay here on its own as long as there is enough tension., Stretch a wire or cord between your corner and brace assemblies to determine where to place your line posts. Line posts should be placed about 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) apart. You can use spray paint to mark where to dig the holes for these posts. Using the clamshell post digger or auger, dig holes to a depth of 2 to 2 ½ feet (.61 to .76 meters)., Once you’ve dug the holes for your line posts, place your wooden posts in them and fill them in, adding a bit of dirt, clay, or sand at a time and packing it down well., Woven wire fencing can be tough to stretch, but constructing a fence stretcher can make it much easier. To make a fence stretcher, take two 2x4s, each of which is a little longer than the height of the woven fence you’re using. Drill three holes in each 2x4 at even intervals along the board. Place bolts in these holes. You will hook your woven fence over the bolts in order to stretch it by pulling on the board.


Use one 2x4 at each end of the section of woven fence you’re stretching., To attach the end of the post, remove a few of the vertical wires from your woven fence. Wrap these wires around the post and then weave them back into the fencing. Using a staple gun, secure the wires to the fence post.When you’re buying wire, remember that the higher the wire’s gauge, the smaller the wire’s diameter. For instance, 12-gauge wire is heavier than 14-gauge wire.Generally, you’ll want to use galvanized staples that are at least an inch and a half long. However, if you are using a harder wood for your posts, you may need a shorter staple., Once you have one end of the wire attached to you first corner post, stand the woven wire on its end and unroll it along the outside of your fence line to the next corner post. Using your fence stretcher, stretch the fence slowly, applying pressure evenly to all your corner, brace, and line posts. Stretch the wire until the tension curves in the wire are about a third of the way straight., Starting at the end closest to the corner post you’ve already attached your wire to, secure the woven wire to your brace and line posts using a staple gun. Attach the wire at the top of the fence post first and work your way down the post, making sure to keep the wire pulled taut the whole time.When you’re stapling your wire to your fence posts, drive the staples in slightly angled to the vertical axis of the post. This will help keep the wood from splitting., For a quicker or temporary solution, you can use metal posts instead of wood. You will follow all the same guidelines for lining up the corner posts with the line posts, however, you need only to pound the metal post into the ground with a sledge hammer or post driver, cutting out the time and effort needed to dig holes for your posts. You can still create brace assemblies for your corner posts using the same method as you would for wood posts.Metal posts come with wire clips on them that are used to secure the wire to the post. Use these to secure your wire instead of staples., You can also purchase a pre-fabricated fencing kit to erect a safe, secure fence quickly. These kits come in a variety of heights and lengths so you can select the one that is right for your situation. These kits will come with specific instructions on how to install them. In general, however, you’ll pound the included stakes into the ground along your fence line and run a tension wire between the posts to keep them in place. You’ll then attach the wire fencing to the posts using cable wires or the wire clips on your fence posts.


Most of these fencing systems are designed to use your house (or another building) as one side of the fence. However, if you prefer to build a fence that is not connected to your house, you can purchase gates as part of these kits as well., Another option is to purchase pre-made fence panels. These panels do not require you to set up fence posts. Instead, you place the panels in the formation you desire and pound them into the ground using a sledge hammer or post driver. To secure the panels together, attach them to the adjacent panel using cable ties or a strong wire."

The bottom liner needs to be removed as well. It is usually removed by sliding it out a small opening at the bottom of the crate where it was inserted in the first place.;
, If the crate is a bit dirty scrub it with a non-toxic cleaner. This is a great time to get it sparkly clean. If the other items are dirty this makes a great opportunity to clean them as well. Blankets and pads can be laundered and dried along with any plush or cloth toys. Food and water bowls can be washed just like any other dishes in the sink or dishwasher. Other toys can be cleaned with plain soap and water and rinsed.

, This includes the front door and any side or top doors or openings. Make sure they are latched fully using the provided latches.


The crate will not close properly without the door closed and latched securely.

, Since the process of collapsing a crate may be different for some models and manufacturers, it is best to consult the directions that came with yours. If you no longer have the instructions, or your crate did not come with instructions, you can contact the manufacturer to try and get a copy of them.

, Find the tabs that hold the short side panels to the top of the crate. Press down on the wire of the top panel to release these tabs., This is done by detaching the latches that connect the short side panels (at the front and the back of the crate) to the long panels. Push in on the short side panel while simultaneously pulling out on the long panel. This should unhook the connecting latches, releasing the panels from each other.


Do this on both the front and back short panels.

, Allow it to rest on the floor of the crate. Do the same with the other short side.

, This will cause the crate to collapse onto itself. The top will be lying to one side and needs to be folded on to the top of the collapsed crate.

, Use the latches attached to the crate.These will make sure that the crate does not come unfolded while you transport it.

Consult a sizing chart.",How to Dress Your Dog1," Use a soft tape measure to measure the circumference of your dog’s neck. Remove your dog’s collar and measure the area where your dog’s collar would normally sit. Once you have the measurement, write it down in inches.You’ll likely need inches if you are purchasing goods sold in the U.S. You may need to use metric measurements if you are purchasing outside the U.S.;
, Start measuring, with a soft tape measure, where your dog’s collar rests at the base of their neck and continue all the way until you reach the base of their tail. Subtract 2 inches from the measurement and make a note of their length in inches.Length measurements will vary across vendors and brands. You will only truly need a length measurement if you are buying a custom made piece of clothing or accessory.

, Place a soft tape measure just behind your dog’s front legs and pull it up around their sides until the tape measure meets at their back. You won’t need any other girth measurement as this spot is often the largest in circumference and is the only place most clothes will be fastened. Keep a note of their girth in inches.The girth, or chest, measurement is the most important measurement. Chest measurements will likely transfer across products and brands.

, Many online vendors and pet stores have sizing charts that will correspond with your dog’s measurements. Make sure you have your dog’s measurements in inches and look to find a size that matches. If you cannot find a size that identically matches, opt for a size that is a little larger to ensure your dog’s comfort."

, It is a good idea to routinely wash your dog’s bedding or blankets, especially if there has been an accident.Use warm or cold water and a mild detergent.


If you want to remove odors, you can add a box of baking soda to the washing machine.If the bedding cannot go in the washing machine, you may need to hand wash it in the sink. Use cold water. Spot treat the bedding with mild detergent.

, Washing a crate can be messy. The best place to wash the crate is outside. That said, if you are unable to go outside, choose a room with tiled floors, such as a kitchen or bathroom. It should be well-ventilated so that the cage can dry without mildewing. Make sure that the dog is nowhere near the crate as you clean it. Keep him in a separate room., Dogs can handle most types of bleach or cleaning solution, as long as the crate is dry once they use it again. Ammonia, however, smells like urine to dogs, and it may encourage them to pee in their crate.You can also make your own cleaning solution from products around the house. In a bucket, combine the ingredients and stir. After mixing your solution, put it in a spray bottle to make cleaning easier. There are a few different solutions you can try:


Half a cup of bleach to a gallon of water.One part dish detergent to ten parts water.
Half a cup white vinegar to one gallon water., If your dog had an accident, you will need to remove any solid clumps of feces before you can clean the rest of the crate. Place the feces in a plastic bag, and throw the bag away immediately. If your dog sheds, you may find large clumps of fur in the crate. Make sure that you have either swept, dusted, or vacuumed the crate.

Locate the widest part of your dog’s neck.,
Determine your dog’s length.",How to Fit a Dog Backpack1," While most dogs can use a backpack with no problems, some dogs with pre-existing health issues or skeletal problems should avoid using one. Talk with your veterinarian to see whether your dog is a candidate for wearing a backpack.Dogs that are not yet fully grown should not wear backpacks, because they can develop stressed joints or arthritis.;
, Use a soft, pliable tailor’s measuring tape to measure your dog around the widest part of its chest (the “girth” measurement). Measure your dog while it is standing, since that’s how it will carry the pack.


The girth measurement is the most important one when you are trying to find the proper size for your dog’s backpack, so record this measurement carefully., Examine your dog and find where its neck joins its body; this will be the widest point. This is the measurement you will need when determining backpack sizing.This is different from when you measure for a collar, which sits higher on a dog’s neck.

, Measure your dog from the base of its neck to the base of its tail.


You want the bulk of the weight your dog will carry to be near its shoulders, rather than lower on its back. Use the length measurement to ensure this is the case when comparing packs.

Consider your dog’s temperament.,
Make sure the apparel is free of choking hazards.,
Try an anxiety vest if your dog has behavioral issues.",How to Dress Your Dog3," Some dogs are too active or have too much energy to sit still and be dressed in apparel. If your dog has a lot of energy and has trouble sitting still then try to keep them in their clothing or costume for as little time as possible. You can also purchase cheaper apparel that you don’t mind being turned into a chew toy!Look to see if your dog is displaying other behavioral signs that might indicate fear or anxiety, like quivering, furrowed ears, or their tail tucked between their legs. Be sure to remove the apparel if your dog is fearful or anxious.Try using other accessories, like collar or leash accessories, if your dog is too energetic for apparel or costumes.
Don’t force your dog into a costume. Not only will this make them uncomfortable, but they may react in a way that could cause injury.

, Choking hazards are anything that your dog can get ahold of and put in their mouth. Try to make sure that the apparel or costume your dog is wearing is free of zippers, hooks, buttons, or tags before you dress your dog. Some costumes will come with additional accessories, like reindeer antlers or belts. If your dog’s costume does come with potential choking hazards, be sure that they are made of fabric in order to reduce the risk of choking.Clothing items with choking hazards on them, regardless of their material, should be removed once the dog is left alone or is not under constant supervision., Anxiety vests are vests that apply a constant and consistent pressure similar to swaddling a baby in a cloth. Many dogs with anxiety benefit from wearing anxiety vests. However, anxiety vests, although apparel, are generally considered a more functional object that can aid behavioral issues.Consult your vet to see if an anxiety vest might be best for your dog. Ask them questions, like “My dog is often anxious, can you recommend something that will help?” or “Would an anxiety vest help with my dog’s behavioral issues?”

Start early and simple.,
Be patient.,
Give them rewards.",How to Dress Your Dog4," The earlier you start clothing your dog the better they will adjust to wearing apparel. Whether you’d like them to get used to wearing costumes or being short-haired and needing warm clothing in a cold environment, starting when they are a puppy will help them acclimate. Be sure to start simply, especially if they are puppies, as you don’t want them to choke or harm themselves on elaborate costumes.Try starting with small collar modifications or a simple cape.

, Some dogs have a laid-back demeanor and will have no problem being dressed up while others might be scared or aggressive. Know that it may take time for your dog to warm up to the idea of getting dressed up, even if they need the apparel to stay warm or go on a long hike. Instead of trying to force your dog into clothing right away, start by placing the item near them on the ground and let them sniff it to become familiar. Be patient and don't force your dog into any apparel they are resistant to wear.


The more exposure your dog has to their apparel the more likely they will be to warm to it.

, Treat your dog anytime they make progress with approaching or wearing apparel, no matter the type. A small dog treat will help retrain them, even if your dog is displaying anxious behavior when you place clothing down on the floor. Giving your dog treats can also be an effective way of distracting your dog when you need to remove their apparel."

Consult online vendors.,
Visit your local pet store.,
Ask other dog owners.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Dress Your Dog5," There are many online vendors that sell mass produced and custom made clothing, apparel, and accessories for dogs. Online vendors will often have customer reviews available for you to read so that you can gauge how well made and affordable their products are. There are blogs specifically devoted to purchasing apparel and accessories for dogs that can offer advice and recommendations.


Try looking at blogs, like pupstyle, for apparel and costume reviews and recommendations., Many pet stores will offer some apparel and accessories for dogs. Most pet stores can also provide you with information regarding how popular the products are and if they can provide custom orders. Although not the most comprehensive vendor, pet stores can show what generic dog apparel looks like and which materials are most often used.


Go to your local pet store and ask questions like “I’m looking for some apparel for my dog, what do you recommend?” “Are there any popular dog costume brands?” or “What would you recommend my dog wear during cold weather?”

, Asking other dog owners where they have purchased their dog’s apparel is a great way to get specific feedback and recommendations. Most dog owners who have purchased apparel or accessories for their dog will be able to provide you with information regarding where to find vendors and what to look out for.


Ask questions like “I love your dog’s vest, where did you get it?” or “Where did your purchase your dog’s costume?”

, Ask your vet for recommendations on purchasing apparel for your dog. Although your vet may not have extensive knowledge of dog apparel or costume vendors, they will be able to provide you with information about what materials to avoid or what might be best for your dog specifically. Your vet will also know which accessories may potentially be harmful or cause anxiety.


Ask your vet questions, like “I’d like to purchase a costume for my dog, are there any materials I should avoid?” or “How should I go about avoiding choking hazards when dressing my dog?”

Pull out the removable tray at the bottom.,
Get rid of fluids and stains.,
Rinse with a garden hose.,
Spray the crate down with the cleaning solution.,
Dry the crate.",How to Clean a Dog Crate2," Wire crates tend to have plastic trays on the bottom. Slide it out, and clean it separately from the rest of the crate. Removing the tray will help make cleaning easier.


Some crate designs do not have a removable tray. If yours does not, you will have to bend or crawl inside the crate to make sure that it is fully cleaned.

, Fold several paper towels together, and press them down on the wet spot to absorb any loose fluids, such as urine or diarrhea. Let them rest for a minute. Throw away the towels. Repeat if necessary with clean paper towels.If your dog had an accident, you may need to scrub to get rid of any marks. Soak a rag in bleach solution, and wring out the excess water. Scrub the stain with the rag, making sure to rinse the cloth every few minutes.

, If you have access to a hose, you can also blast off stains and fluids with a hose. Direct the hose both inside and outside of the crate. Focus the water on encrusted or stained material. After you have rinsed it out, wipe it down with a dry cloth. Make sure to dump out any excess water from the tray or the inside of the shell.


If you do not have a hose, you can fill a bucket with water and rinse off the cage by pouring small amounts of water over the soap. You can also use a wet rag to wipe away soap suds.

, Make sure that you spray the tray, the walls, and the roof of the crate. Let it sit for ten to twenty minutes to kill off any bacteria. If you have removed the bottom tray, you should spray it separately off to the side.


If you have a wire crate, you may not be able to spray the sides efficiently. Dampen a rag with your cleaning solution, and wipe down the sides instead.

, Use a dry paper towel to remove any extra water and cleaning solution from the crate. This will quicken the drying process and prevent wire crates from rusting. Leave the crate outside to dry.


If you are worried about chemicals from the cleaning solution, you can wipe down the crate with a damp paper towel before wiping it down again with a dry one.
If you are unable to put it outside, keep it in a well-ventilated room. Do not let your dog inside until it is completely dry.

Remove stains with club soda.,
Hand-wash in a sink or with a hose.,
Put in the washing machine.,
Air-dry the crate.,
Sprinkle with baking soda to deodorize.",How to Clean a Dog Crate3," Club soda is effective on acidic stains, like urine. Use the soda cap to measure a small amount of club soda. Pour it directly on the stain, and let it soak for a few minutes. Once it has soaked, you can blot it with paper towels and let it dry. Do not rub or scrub; this will only drive the stain deeper into the fabric., Using warm water, dilute a dish detergent with water before scouring the fabric with a rag or paper towel. You can scrub difficult stains with a sponge or bristle brush.


Crates for smaller breeds can be washed in the sink.
Medium and large-breed crates will need to be washed outside with a low-powered hose.

, Check with the manufacturer to see if the crate can be machine washed. You can look on the manufacturer’s website, on the crate’s tag, or on the crate’s packaging. If you can, collapse the crate so that it fits into your machine. Use cold water and your normal detergent. You can add a box of baking soda to remove odors., No matter if you hand-washed or machine washed your fabric crate, you should allow it to dry in a ventilated room or outside. Do not place it in a dryer. Make sure that the crate is completely dry inside and out before allowing your dog to use it again.


If the inside is taking too long to dry, you can use a hair dryer to speed the process.

, Baking soda is a dog-friendly substance that can remove unpleasant smells from fabric. Sprinkle a handful of powder inside the crate, and let it sit for fifteen to twenty minutes. Vacuum it up when you are done. Baking soda can be used after you’re finished cleaning or between cleaning sessions to keep the crate smelling fresh."

Make a vinegar mixture.,
Soak the dog ID tag.,
Rinse the tag.",How to Clean Your Dog's ID Tag2," In a sturdy glass bowl, mix 1 cup of regular white vinegar with one tablespoon of salt. Heat the mixture in a microwave until it is very warm, but not too hot to use. Stir the mixture.Only use this mixture for brass dog tags – over time, exposure to salt and vinegar mixes can damage stainless steel., Place the brass ID tag in the mixture and leave it to soak. Check the tag every 10 minutes or so. Remove it once it looks clean.Given the strong smell of the vinegar, opt to place the bowl outside while the tag soaks if possible.

, Rinse the tag thoroughly, making sure to remove all traces of vinegar. Using a soft cloth or paper towel, pat the tag dry. Be sure to dry it completely as brass develops water spots very easily.

Prepare a cleaning cloth.,
Wipe down the tag.,
Dry the tag.",How to Clean Your Dog's ID Tag3," Pour a tablespoon of rubbing alcohol onto a clean, soft cloth. Alternatively, use a soft sponge or paper towel. Be sure to stay away from heat and open flames as rubbing alcohol is quite flammable., Gently wipe the dog tag with the cloth, staying with the grain of the metal. Be sure to remove all oil, grime, and fingerprints from the surface. Continue wiping until all the lettering on the tag is clearly visible.For a more thorough cleaning, soak the tag in a cup of rubbing alcohol for 5-10 minutes.

, Pat the tag dry with a paper towel. If desired, leave the tag to air dry for several minutes. Repeat this process once a week or whenever the tag looks dirty.

Choose what polish to use.,
Apply the polish.,
Clean off the tag.",How to Clean Your Dog's ID Tag4," There are many ingredients to choose from to polish your dog ID tag with. For a simple option, purchase stainless steel or brass polish (available in most department stores). Otherwise, opt for natural ingredients:


Use ketchup to polish brass tags.Use olive oil to polish stainless steel tags.Use a paste of lemon juice and baking soda for both brass and stainless steel., Put 2-3 drops or dabs of your chosen polish onto a soft, damp cloth. Gently rub the cloth over the surface of the dog tag. Continue until the tag is shiny., One the tag is shiny, wipe it clean. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe off any residual polish on the tag. Wipe dry with a paper towel.

Look for a snug fit.,
Avoid packs that are too tight.,
Make sure the backpack is comfortable for your dog.,
Select a pack with adjustable straps.,
Consider additional features.",How to Fit a Dog Backpack2," Once you have taken your measurements, you will have some idea of what sizes to try on your dog. A properly fitting backpack will fit snugly, but you should still be able to place a few fingers between the straps and your dog.


If the pack is too loose, it can affect the dog’s balance and cause them to walk improperly.A backpack that is too loose will move around too much while the dog walks, causing chafing or sores.
A manufacturer’s sizing guide can be helpful in narrowing down the sizes you should try for your dog.

, Just as a loose pack can cause problems for your pup, a tight one can cause injury as well. A pack that is too tight can cause muscle strain to the shoulder and back muscles, as well as impede lung function., A good pack will have enough padding to protect your dog from the extra weight. There should also be plenty of ground clearance for the backpack once it is on your dog, and your dog should be able to lay down when wearing it.Your dog’s legs should move freely and unimpeded when wearing the pack.
Shorter dogs will need shallow saddle bags that do not go further than 1 inch down the elbow of the dog., You want the pack to be secure on your dog’s back instead of sliding down or off. Strong, adjustable chest straps will also ensure that the weight load is on the correct part of your dog’s back (near the shoulders rather than the loin).Y-shaped chest straps help stabilize the packs and reduce neck strain.

, A pack that is water-resistant and has removable saddlebags is useful if you’re planning to hike through creeks or near water with your dog. A bright color and reflective panels will make your dog easier to find if it gets away from you while hiking.


The weight of the pack is an additional consideration. Look for one that is lightweight, weighing one pound or less."
"
Be patient.,
Instead, familiarize your dog with the pack.,
Start with an empty pack.,
Avoid overloading your dog.,
Distribute the weight evenly.,
Give your dog time to adjust.",How to Fit a Dog Backpack3," Your dog may initially resist wearing a pack and try to avoid letting you put it on. You risk traumatizing your dog by forcing the pack on the first time your dog sees it - it can cause stress for your dog., Allow your dog to smell and walk around the backpack at first.Wait a few days after introducing it before trying to put the backpack on your dog.

, The first time you successfully get your dog in the pack, don’t add any additional weight. Rather, once the pack is on, reward your dog with treats and go for a fun walk or hike. Your dog will soon associate wearing the pack with treats and fun times together., Once your dog is ready to carry some items in the pack, it is important to remember not to load it down too much. Dogs should never carry more than 25 percent of their body weight in a backpack.Stronger healthier dogs with a high energy level may be able to carry a bit heavier load, and smaller weaker dogs may not be able to carry more than 10 percent of their body weight.
Too much weight in a backpack can lead to curvature of the spine, so always weigh your pack before placing it on your dog., You want to be sure that one side of the pack is not heavier than another. Make sure the weight is evenly distributed on each side so that your dog does not lose its balance., Your dog will need to build its muscles to handle the extra weight in a pack. A 15-minute walk with a weighted pack is equivalent to a 30-minute walk without, for example.So, slowly increase the amount of weight or gear your dog will carry in the pack."

Orthodontic rubber bands are small bands usually used for braces, but you can find similarly small rubber bands online, at craft stores, or at office supply stores.;
, You need about 5 inches (12.7 cm) of 2-inch (5 cm) wide ribbon and 4 inches (10.16 cm) of 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide ribbon.

, Create a loop, where about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the ribbon overlaps. Put a small dot of glue in between the overlapping ends to help hold the loop in place.

, This ribbon should also be folded into a loop with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap. Glue the overlap in place.

, Center the smaller folded ribbon in front of the larger folded ribbon, and keep the overlapping edges of both ribbons centered in the back. If desired, you can use a small dot of glue to help hold the ribbons together.

, Center the overlapping edges over the crochet hook. The rubber band should be visible and slightly below the ribbons.

, Stretch the top front of the rubber band out and up until it passes over the ribbon and reaches the end of the pen. Loop this end of the rubber band over the tip of the end so that the rubber band now loops around the pen in two places and holds the bow on the pen.

, Stretch the bottom back of the rubber band back and up, passing it behind the ribbon and over the top of the pen. The rubber band should be released from the pen at this point so that there is only one loop around the pen. This should also create a loop around the bow, holding it together.

, You may need to readjust the ribbon so that the rubber band is centered.

, The rubber band should still be attached to the bow.

, Hot glue may work best. The rhinestone adds a touch of bling to the bow, and it also helps hold the rubber band on.

Help your dog unpack the stocking.",How to Fill a Dog's Stocking for Christmas," Many pet supply stores sell these during the holidays, and they can be a great option. However, they should be opened for your pet as most of these stockings are made of clear plastic so the buyer can see inside. Make sure the stocking stuffers are appropriate for your dog’s size. If you want to get a dog stocking for a pet owner, the prefilled variety is likely your best option., Choose a variety of treats for your pet, and try to find some that will take your dog a while to enjoy. Rawhide chew toys, bones, and other items are a great way to keep your pet busy during all the holiday fun. Make sure to select treats that are appropriate for your specific pet. Most treats have size and weight recommendations on the packaging., Again, make sure you select items that are appropriately sized for your dog. Try to include toys that will help keep your pet entertained. Toys that hide treats or have to be taken apart a specific way provide hours of fun for your dog while you enjoy all your new holiday gifts!, These are great for tug of war, and dogs love playing with them all year long. Select rope toys that are large enough for your dog. Small dog rope toys can be swallowed by larger breeds, and this can damage their digestive system.

, Tennis balls, rubber balls crafted specifically for pets, or other dog-friendly balls you can use to play fetch are great way to entertain your pup at the holidays. Throw a few in the stocking for your dog to enjoy.


Choose balls made with a dog-friendly material.

, Choose Christmas sweaters, booties, a fun Christmas collar, and other items your pet can wear for the holiday. Include your dog in family photos wearing all of its fun new pup clothes.

, Avoid stockings made from felt, plastic, and other materials that will be easily torn up and possibly ingested by your dog. Instead look for a stocking made from burlap, canvas, and other hardy materials that will be difficult for your dog to take apart. This is more important for large dogs, in most cases, but it’s always best to find products and materials that are safe for pets., Before your start filling the stocking, take any tags, plastic, or other packaging off of all the materials you include. That way, your pup is protected even if it decides to rip into the stocking before you can help. This can also make giving the stocking more fun, since you can just let your dog dig in and play with all his new toys and treats. Digging all the fun stuff out of the stocking can be a fun game for your dog as well., You don’t want to crush treats or toys with heavy items. Fill in the bottom of the stocking with the heaviest items, and use squishy toys, holiday sweaters, and other soft items to cushion easily crumbled treats like milk bones., As a finishing touch, put several different fun snacks in the top of the stocking to entice your dog. Once you give them the stocking, these treats will tell your pup the stocking is theirs, so consider using treats that your pet receives on a regular basis. The recognizable scent should signal your pet that the stocking is theirs, and encourage them to keep digging for more treats., Make sure that the stocking can’t be reached, even if your dog stands up on its hind legs. You can also wait to add treats until the very end. The familiar scent of treats will attract your dog to the stocking, but without it, they are much more likely to ignore another stocking.If you don’t have a fire place or other stockings hanging, you may choose to keep your dog’s stocking put away, until you’re ready to give the stocking to your pet.

, Distract your dog by letting them try to get all of their treats and toys out of the stocking. This is great for dogs who have a bad habit of “helping” you or your loved ones unwrap their gifts. Make sure you’ve removed all packaging, and that the stocking is made from canvas or other hardy and dog-friendly materials that your dog is unlikely to tear up or eat.


Let your pup explore its stocking looking for treats.
Each time your dog finds a new treat or toy, clap, pet it, and encourage it.
Take a few moments to play fetch or tug of war, when they find toys.
Take pictures and video., Unpack a treat from the stocking daily leading up to Christmas, especially if it is a tradition in your family to open presents before Christmas. The goal of the stocking should be to make your dog feel included in the family festivities, so any time you give gifts as a family, make sure your pup is included., If you purchase a prepackaged stocking, you’ll need to take it apart for your pet. Remove all the packaging and give your pet the treats and toys inside. If you notice your dog is struggling to extract all its toys and treats from the stocking, you should give them a hand. In most cases, older dogs will need your help.Watch your pet as they try to unpack their stocking, and step in to help them when they need your assistance.

Identify your dog’s needs.,
Take the dog to your veterinarian.,
Weigh the dog.,
Measure the dog's waist.,
Decide between cloth or disposable dog diapers.,
Choose your diaper type.,
Deal with fecal incontinence.,
Determine how many diapers you will need to purchase.,
Look for dog diapers online or in-store.,
Check each brand's dog diaper size chart.,
Look for dog diapers with soft linings.",How to Buy Dog Diapers," Dog owners may use dog diapers for a number of reasons. They can be used to deal with incontinence, during house training, or if a female dog is in heat.


Urinary incontinence is typically associated with senior dogs who have lost the ability to control their bladders as a result of muscle weakness or a decrease in hormones that influence bladder control.Female dogs that have not been spayed will have an estrus cycle. A dog diaper can help to minimize the mess associated with a female dog in heat.
Most dog trainers will recommend against using dog diapers during house training but they can be used if you have to leave the dog alone for a significant amount of time to minimize accidents.;
, Your pet may be suffering from a medical condition that is causing their incontinence. The veterinarian will confirm a diagnosis and try to determine the cause. The veterinarian may be able to treat the condition, which might stop the dog’s incontinence.


There are a number of medical conditions that are associated with urinary incontinence. These include: a spinal injury or degeneration, urinary tract infections, protruding intervertebral discs, prostate disorders, or some type of congenital abnormalities.If the veterinarian prescribes a treatment, you may still want to purchase dog diapers to use during the course of treatment.

, Dog diapers come in different sizes that correspond to the weight and waist size of the pet. You will need an accurate weight measurement to determine the correct size of dog diaper for your pet.


Take large dogs to the veterinarian to get weight measurements. Most veterinary offices will have a walk-on scale designed for animals.
Weigh smaller dogs at home. Step on a scale and record your weight. Pick up the dog and weigh yourself again. Subtract the combined weight of you and the dog from your weight. This number is the dog's weight.

, Dog diapers need to fit snuggly at the waist to ensure they will not slip off or allow urine to leak from the front.


Make sure the dog is standing. Ask a friend to help keep the dog in the proper position if necessary.
Wrap a cloth measuring tape around the dog's waist. Make sure to measure far enough towards a male dog's torso to cover the end of his penis. If you measure too close to the hindquarters, the diaper may not cover the urethral opening making the diaper useless.

, When shopping for dog diapers, you have the choice of cloth diapers that are reusable or single use disposable diapers.


Cloth diapers are an eco-friendly option that you can clean and reuse. They do require the owner to clean the diaper, which some owners would prefer not to do. If your dog will need to wear diapers consistently for a long time, cloth diapers will be less expensive than disposable diapers in the long run.Disposable diapers are convenient and easy to use. There is less clean up and they can be more easily adjusted than many cloth diapers. Disposable diapers are good for short-term use and tend to be less expensive than cloth diapers.

, There are three primary types of dog diapers: a male wrap band, a full diaper, and a diaper that uses harnesses to stay in place.


A male wrap band is essentially a band that goes around your dog’s middle. These can be used on male dogs who are marking or spraying in your home.
A full diaper is a diaper that looks very similar to a human diaper, but has a hole cut for a tail and fits dogs.
A harness diaper is a full diaper that uses harnesses, that resemble suspenders, that go around the dog’s shoulders to hold the diaper in place.

, Dog diapers are primarily designed to help with urinary incontinence. If your dog is suffering from fecal incontinence, you can purchase a dog diaper that is specifically designed for fecal incontinence.


Check the packaging of the diapers. If they can be used for fecal matter, this will be written somewhere on the package.
If your pet is suffering from fecal incontinence, be sure to check your dog's diaper often and be prepared to clean the area with gloves and disinfecting wipes.

, This number will vary from dog to dog. Disposable dog diapers are typically sold in packs of 12 or 24 diapers. Cloth diapers may be sold in single packages or in packages that contain 3 or 4 diapers.


Note how many times per day the dog typically urinates.
If you are purchasing diapers for your female dog’s estrus cycle, you should anticipate changing the diaper at least twice a day for up to 2 weeks.
Buy a large enough package of disposable dog diapers so that you can use a new diaper every time the dog urinates. It is unhealthy for a dog to wear wet diapers for long periods of time and can lead to diaper rash.
Purchase 2 cloth diapers with disposable liners to begin with. If you find that you need more than 2 cloth diapers, purchase additional diapers.
Keep in mind that disposable diapers will be more economical for temporary use, but cloth dog diapers are more cost effective for long term use since you can reuse them.

, You can purchase dog diapers from most large retailers, at pet stores, or online. You will probably find more options to chose from in a larger pet store.

, Using the weight and waist size measurements that you took earlier, find the size that best corresponds to your dog’s measurements.


The number of sizes that a brand will have available is dependent upon the manufacturer. There are typically fewer sizes in cloth diapers.
Consider buying the next size up if you have a male dog. Especially when you use disposable dog diapers, you may find that the size that corresponds to your dog's measurements doesn't adequately cover the dog's genital area. Male dogs need the diaper to fit higher on their waists to prevent leakage., Continued use of dog diapers can cause broken or irritated skin. Dog diapers with soft, absorbent linings can help keep the dog from developing diaper rash.


Treat diaper rash and discomfort. Your pet’s skin can become red, chafed, and sore from extended diaper use. You can avoid diaper rash by changing the dog’s diaper each time it urinates, so it does not experience extended contact with the urine.Unscented baby wipes are a convenient way to clean your dog and to soothe irritated skin. You can also use hypoallergenic baby powder to dry the area.

Obtain identification tags.",How to Get Supplies for Your New Dog1," Find food and water bowls that are appropriately sized and will not hold bacteria. Generally, stainless steel bowls will be a little better than plastic, since plastic bowls can be chewed up and then hold onto bacteria.Ceramic bowls can be fine but are less durable than either plastic or steel.Plastic bowls contain chemicals that, if eaten, could influence your dog’s hormonal balance. Stay away from plastic bowls.If you decide to go for a ceramic bowl, make sure the glaze is lead-free.Stainless steel is durable, easy to clean and carry. It is the best material for a dog bowl.;
, Find a dog food that is appropriate for your new dog’s age and breed. You may want to consult with the breeder or your veterinarian about an appropriate food for your new dog. Since dogs can have some difficulty switching between different foods, try to be consistent in the food you feed them.If your new dog is a puppy, look for a dog food that has a modest amount of carbohydrates, a good ratio of fat to protein, and lots of meat-based protein. You should find a food that does not have chemical preservatives, artificial coloring, or generic animal fats.If your new dog is an old dog, you should look for a low-calorie dog food., You should get some treats so that you can reward your new dog when they show good behavior.When purchasing treats, read the list of ingredients on the dog treat package to figure out whether it is healthy or not. Look for whole food ingredients that are grown in close proximity to the producer. Avoid ingredients that you cannot recognize. Look for natural sweeteners. Above all else, avoid the following ingredients: artificial preservatives, artificial colors and chemical humectants., You will need a dog crate for your new dog to get some rest. Although some new dog owners do not like the look of dog crates, dogs actually love to have a place to call their own. You should get a crate that is an appropriate size for your dog. Your dog should be able to stand up and turn around comfortably in the crate. However, it should not be so big that they are able to have multiple rooms in one crate. You can find dog crates online or at your local pet store.Dogs like the feeling of a cave environment, so it can help if you put a blanket overtop of the crate.Dog crates come in a range of sizes.
Crates cost in the range of $15 to $150., Find a bed that will allow your new dog to sleep comfortably. When your new dog is introduced into your home, the bed will make them feel more at home.If your new dog is a puppy, you will want to find a bed that fits inside the crate. For the first period of puppy training, your new dog will sleep in the crate. When they get older, you can get a larger bed that goes outside the crate.If your new dog is a puppy, keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t chew the new bed. They could get sick by ingesting the contents of the bed. If you see them chewing the bed, replace it with a blanket.
If your new dog is an adult, you should find an appropriate bed for their size. Find one that allows them to curl up in a comfortable sleeping position., Your city or municipality may send you a numbered dog tag after you register your dog. In addition, you should purchase a dog tag that includes their name, phone number and address. If your new dog gets lost, this will make it easier to find it.


You should also consider microchipping your new dog. Ask your veterinarian about microchipping, which involves the insertion of a microchip in your dog’s back. The chip can be scanned to identify their personal information. If your dog gets lost, a shelter can scan your dog and hopefully get it back to you."

, Sew it away from the buckle of the collar so that it does not interfere with how you put the collar on your dog.

, Sew the snap onto the base of the flower. If the flower has a plastic base, however, you may need to sew the snap onto a fabric petal near the base.

, The snap should be the same size and type as the snap used on the collar and the first flower. Use the socket end of the snap for each flower so that each snap can fit over the post end on the collar.

, You can snap and unsnap the different flowers onto your dog's collar as you please. This is especially useful if you have a dog that also wears doggy clothing, since you can change out the flowers to match the clothes.

Like other small dogs, Chihuahuas are at risk of developing heart and kidney problems if they are fed a diet high in salt. Look a dog food that is low in salt to help avoid this issue.Chihuahua puppies need more protein and calories than adults so look for a nutrient dense food.Canned puppy food may be easier for your puppy to eat at first since it is easier to chew but dry kibble typically provides better nutrition.;
, Chihuahua puppies have very small stomachs but very fast metabolisms. They need to be fed multiple times a day to maintain their energy, maintain their blood sugar levels, and to help them grow. How many times they need to eat a day will usually depend on their age:


For the first six months you should feed your Chihuahua four times a day.
From six months to one year of age they should be fed three times a day.
After one year they will reach maturity and can be fed twice a day.Feeding on a schedule is very important during housetraining since you can predict that your dog will need to relieve themselves about half an hour after eating.

, Chihuahua puppies can become easily dehydrated since they expend a lot of energy throughout the day. Always leave out fresh clean water for them in a bowl that is shallow enough for them to reach into and won’t tip over.


Puppies may try to climb into water bowls if they are too difficult for them to drink from and can drown., There are a number of foods that are toxic for dogs to eat. Even very small amounts of these foods can be very dangerous for Chihuahua puppies because of their small size.You should also avoid feeding them table scraps. Human food is often very calorically dense and can cause weight gain, which is very common in Chihuahuas and is dangerous for their health.


Alcohol, caffeine, avocado, chocolate, grapes, dried fruits (like raisins), dairy, onions, garlic, and salt are all dangerous for your dog.
Feeding your puppy table scraps also encourages negative behaviors like begging and can easily account for one-third of their daily food intake needs., Arriving at a new home can be an overwhelming experience for your new Chihuahua. They need time to become comfortable with you as their new owner, other pets, and in their new homes. It is very important to love and be affectionate with them during their first few days so they can feel comfortable.If you have other pets at home, you will need to introduce them to your new puppy.Supervise your puppy as they explore their new home, as this is the best way to keep them out of trouble.
The length of the adjustment period will depend upon your pet’s personalities, but you should be prepared for the dogs to need some time to become fully comfortable around the other.
An older dog that is used to being the only pet in the household may adjust more slowly to a new and energetic puppy, while other dogs are happy to have a new friend. Supervise these first interactions and be on the lookout for any aggressive behaviors from either pet.

, Your Chihuahua needs to be taught the appropriate ways to interact with new people, animals, and environments. Exposing your puppy to new situations and people early on helps to establish future habits.


There is a critical socialization period for puppies (usually the first sixteen weeks) that is crucial in shaping your dog’s future temperament and behaviors.Ask friends and family members with friendly dogs to come to your home to meet your new puppy. This is a controlled environment where you will know that the other dogs are vaccinated and you can step in if any aggressive behaviors are shown.

, Chihuahuas often form strong bonds with their owners and you want to encourage a strong and healthy relationship with your puppy early on.Be physically affectionate with your puppy by rubbing their belly, patting their head, and petting them.
Give them praise when they follow your commands and respond to their training. This is a good way to reinforce good behavior and helps your puppy associate you with pleasant feelings.
Spend time with your puppy. Chihuahuas want to spend time with their owners and want their love and attention. Make sure you can spend some time every day, even if it is only in short increments, giving your puppy your undivided attention

, Chihuahua puppies have very high energy levels and need to be exercised daily to expend this energy or they will become hyper or destructive. A well exercised puppy is a happy puppy!Your puppy should go on two short walks for about 15 to 20 minutes each day.
Over-exercise can be detrimental to growing puppies so encourage them to play and exercise as much as they want to but not beyond their energy level.
Play games with your puppy to provide mental stimulation. Take a toy and hide it in an easy to find spot. Encourage your puppy to find the toy and reward them with praise when they find it. You may need to lead your puppy to the area a few times until they understand the game. Chihuahuas enjoy playing fetch but make sure you use a toy that is small enough for your puppy to hold on to.

, Once your puppy has received their full set of puppy vaccinations, you can begin to take them on walks in public. Since walking is an easy way for them to get exercise, they should be taught to walk on a leash early.


Use a harness while going on walks since collars can be easily slipped off of their small necks. A 6 foot leash is typically a good length to use on walks.
Teach them to heel and match your gait by stopping whenever your puppy walks too far ahead of you. Wait until the leash is fully extended and the puppy can’t go any further before you call their name and encourage them to come back to you. Eventually, they will learn that the walk won’t continue until they stay by your side.

, Housetraining requires owners and puppies to work together and follow a consistent schedule. Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviors and be aware that accidents will happen.Schedule their trips to their designated bathroom areas based on their age. Generally, you should expect to increase the time between trips for each month. So a two month old puppy should go out every two hours while a five month old puppy can wait every five hours.
Plan ahead when you know you won’t be home for several hours. When you know that you won’t be able to take your puppy out for several hours, keep them in a gated area with floors that are easy to clean. You can also provide puppy pads during times like these.

, Chihuahuas have big personalities and will try to assert themselves as the leader of the pack if you let them. Establish yourself as the leader by training your dog to follow commands like sit, stay, and come.


Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviors but do not reward bad behaviors.
It is easier to establish good behaviors early on rather than to break behavioral problems later on.Be consistent and firm during your training and practice basic commands with your puppy at least fifteen minutes every day.

, Crate training uses your puppy’s natural instinct to find a safe space to sleep in. If you decide to crate train, gradually increase the amount of time they stay in the crate until they can spend the entire night there comfortably.Do not force your puppy into the crate. Use treats and toys to help them associate the crate as a happy and pleasant environment.

, Chihuahua puppies are naturally curious but can be destructive and get into trouble since they tend to enjoy with their mouths. To keep them safe, you will need to secure any hazardous items in your home.


Lock away toxic items like medicine, cleaning products, and chemicals.
Pick up loose items from the floor, especially if they are breakable or fragile.
Purchase baby or puppy gates to keep your puppy confined to a certain area in your home. It will be helpful during housetraining to keep your puppy in a room with easy to clean floors, like tile or hardwood. , In many states and towns, you will need to register your dog with the municipal government in order to receive identification tags and a dog license.There may be a small fee associated with registration. Check with your local government to determine whether there is a fee and how much it will be.
Attach your puppy’s new identification tags to their collar immediately after you receive them.

, Regardless of whether you purchased your new Chihuahua from a breeder or adopted them from a shelter, you will need to take them to the veterinarian so they can receive vaccinations. You should also microchip and spay or neuter your puppy.Your veterinarian may recommend additional vaccinations based on the area that you live in. For example, if you live in an area where are a lot of ticks, your vet may recommend a Lyme disease vaccination yearly. Do not let your puppy go out in public or interact with unfamiliar dogs until they have been fully vaccinated.
The microchip contains your contact information and is extremely helpful if your puppy is ever lost or stolen. It will usually be implanted in the scruff of your puppy’s neck or above their shoulder where they cannot reach it during a routine visit.Chihuahua puppies can be spayed between 8 weeks old and 3 months. Chihuahuas should be neutered between 8 weeks and 6 months. Many veterinarians recommend spaying or neutering your Chihuahua before they reach puberty (typically between 4 to 7 months).Spaying and neutering can decrease aggression, increase their attention span, and decrease their chances of developing some medical conditions like prostate conditions and womb infections.

, Chihuahuas often suffer from serious blood sugar problems and need to be fed in small amounts throughout the day to keep their blood sugar from falling or spiking. Young puppies under the age of four months old are the most susceptible to this.Regular feeding throughout the day can help to prevent hypoglycemia, which is a dip in blood sugar levels.
You can stabilize a puppy with dangerously low blood sugars by rubbing honey on their gums. Once they are stabilized, you should take them to your nearest veterinarian or pet hospital.

, Like other small breeds, Chihuahuas are at risk of accidentally injuring themselves by jumping or falling off of furniture. While many owners let their Chihuahuas on furniture, it is generally a good idea to keep them on the ground.


They have more fragile bones than larger dogs so they are at higher risks of suffering from fractures, internal injuries, and concussions.
Chihuahuas are at a high risk of suffering from luxating patellas, which is essentially a displaced kneecap, by jumping or overexerting themselves.Keep Chihuahua puppies away from small children who can easily hurt them unintentionally.

, Chihuahuas typically have one or two coat types: long or short. Chihuahuas do shed their coats but typically in very manageable amounts due to their size. Use a rubber grooming glove or a soft bristle brush each week to remove the dead hair and keep their coat healthy.A long coat is a recessive gene and appears much less frequently than a short coat. Chihuahuas with long coats will shed seasonally and need to be brushed once or twice a week.

, Chihuahua puppies have very small nails that need to be trimmed frequently to avoid breakage and overgrowth.Be very careful when trimming their nails because their small size can make the quick difficult to identify.
Chihuahuas have delicate paws and keeping their nails at appropriate lengths can prevent unnecessary stress.

, Chihuahuas have very small mouths and may need to have teeth pulled when there is no room for the teeth to grow. Proper dental care is very important for this breed and their teeth should be brushed two to three times each week, if not daily.


While most milk teeth (your puppy’s first set of teeth) will fall out during weaning, you may find that your puppy is still teething and is biting items to relieve discomfort.Hard bones and toys can help strengthen their gums and prevent tartar buildup., Chihuahua puppies do not need to be bathed unless they are very dirty, muddy, or sticky. They can be bathed up to every other month since puppies have very sensitive skin and over-bathing can lead to skin dryness, rashes, and irritation.It can be easier to bathe your Chihuahua in a deep sink rather than a bathtub when they are very small.
Use a gentle shampoo that is designed for puppies.

, Chihuahua puppies have thin coats and are very susceptible to extreme temperatures, especially the cold. They were bred for the Mexican heat and often do not do well in the cold. If you do live in a cold area, you will need to make sure your puppy is kept warm when you’re outside.Many owners will purchase small coats and sweaters for their dogs to wear.
Dog booties can help protect their paws from the cold ground.

, Chihuahua puppies have large ears that are prone to wax buildup and dryness that need to be cleaned weekly. If you smell or see any wax buildup in their ears you may need to clean the ears more frequently.


Use a soft piece of gauze with an ear cleaning solution designed for dogs to wipe their ears down. Gently wipe the inside of their ears and apply a small amount of baby lotion or coconut oil to any dry skin.Do not use a cotton tipped swab to clean their ears since it can damage the inner ear and push wax into the ear rather than remove it.

Measure your dog.,

Choose a ramp for your bed.,
Pick a ramp for a couch.,
Select a ramp for recliners or chairs.,
Locate a furniture ramp online.,
Buy a ramp at a local store.,
Build a furniture ramp.",How to Choose Furniture Ramps for Dogs," Your first step is to measure your dog so you can choose a ramp that will accommodate your dog’s overall size. After all, without appropriate measurements you won’t be able to choose a ramp that will suit your needs.


Consider your dog’s legs. Dogs with very short legs, like corgis, may need ramps without steps and with a gradual incline.
Measure the length of your dog. You’ll need this in order to figure out the incline of your ramp.;
, Another element you need to consider before choosing a furniture ramp is your dog’s weight. This is extremely important as the ramp you pick will need to be one that can accommodate your dog safely.


If your dog is a puppy, consider what their full grown height will be.
Add 10% or 20% to the weight of your dog to ensure that if your dog gains weight, the ramp will still accommodate them., You also need to consider if your dog has any special needs. This is important, as most ramps are designed for dogs without major medical problems. Consider if:


Your dog has sight issues. If so, you may need a ramp with rails or sides.
Whether your dog has arthritis or other skeletal-muscular problems. If so, you may need a ramp with a very gradual incline., Perhaps the most popular type of furniture ramp for dogs are bed ramps. Ramps for beds allow dogs to easily access human beds. Ultimately, without a bed ramp, your dog won’t be able to join you for sleep or snuggle time.


Measure the height of your bed.
Consider the amount of space you have for your ramp. Depending on the size and incline of the ramp, you may or may not be able to accommodate it in your bedroom.
Take note of the floor around your bed. Carpeted areas work well. If you have hardwood or tile, you may need to purchase a rug or use an adhesive aid to prevent the ramp from slipping when your dog walks up it., Couch ramps are an increasingly popular way for dogs, especially senior dogs, to access couches. Couch ramps make it easier for dogs to get on and off couches without jumping or struggling.


Make sure to take a measurement of your couch.
Consider the material the couch is made of. You may need to drape a blanket over the part of the couch the ramp connects with in order to prevent damage to the couch.If your couch is on hardwood or tile, you may need to purchase a rug or some sort of adhesive aid to prevent the ramp from moving as your dog walks up it.

, You may also consider a ramp for your dog’s favorite recliner or chair. Chair ramps are very often smaller than couch or bed ramps. Ultimately, they’re very important in making sure your dog doesn’t hurt themselves when getting on or off a chair.


Recliners or chairs may require smaller, custom made ramps.
Make sure to measure the height of the recliner or chair before purchasing a ramp.
Take note of the surface below the chair or recline, as you may need to take steps (such as providing a carpet or purchasing adhesive tape) to make sure the ramp does not slip., You should also put in a little time searching for your ramps online. This is a must do, since the variety of online pet retailers will ensure you a much larger selection than will be available in your region.


Consider websites of major stores like Pet Smart, PetCo, Pet Supermarket, and Amazon.
Consider specialty retailers like Jeffers.
Look on auction sites like eBay., If you want to solve your pet ramp problems very quickly, you should consider visiting a local store. While local stores won’t offer you the same selection as online retailers, they may have a few solid products that could meet your ramp needs in a pinch. Consider:


Small and/or local pet stores.
Large box specialty pet retailers like Pet Smart, PetCo, and Pet Supermarket.
Large general box stores like Walmart and Target., Depending on your circumstances, you may just need to build a ramp or have one custom built. After you’ve measured your dog and determined what furniture you need the ramp for, you’ll have the information you need to determine if you have to have the ramp built or not.


If you can’t find a suitable ramp online, you’ll likely have to have a ramp built.
Look for plans or designs online. If you can’t find a suitable one, spend a little time sketching the ramp you want to build.
Buy wood at a store like Home Depot. Try to have it precut, if possible, to the specifications of your design.
Assemble your ramp and cover it with inexpensive carpet to make it pet safe and comfortable."

Watch your dog sleep.,
Measure your dog while sleeping.,
Think about special needs.,
Choose the best material.",How to Select a Dog Bed1," Thinking about your dog’s sleeping style is an important part of selecting the right bed. Dogs that sleep stretched out completely need a big bed. If your dog likes to cuddle up on itself, however, it will need a smaller bed with sides to lean on. Similarly, look at your dog to see whether it tends to be cold or hot while sleeping. Different shapes and styles of beds can help your dog regulate temperature, and some beds come with heating or cooling pads.;
, You want to give your dog enough space to lay down comfortably at the end of a hard day. A good rule is to measure your dog from its nose to its tail while it is sleeping. Then, add between 8 and 12 inches to determine the length or diameter of the bed you choose.Keep in mind whether your dog is fully grown when measuring. If it isn’t, you may want to select a bigger bed than you need, so you won’t need to replace the bed as quickly.
If your dog is a puppy and you don’t want to buy a small bed now and a larger one later, you can add blankets or padding to a larger bed to help your puppy feel secure., Your dog’s age or health issues can play a role in the type of bed you select. Orthopedic beds cater to dogs with sore joints or arthritis, while those with cooling pads can be good for long-haired dogs.


Orthopedic beds made of high-density memory foam conform to your dog’s shape and offer comfort and support for easing your dog’s aches and pains.Memory foam tends to hold on to odor, so make sure you cover a memory foam bed with a waterproof, washable cover.For dogs in warmer climates or those with thick fur or long hair, beds that offer a chance to cool off are essential. Long-haired dogs or those with thick fur tend to overheat easily while sleeping. They do well with cots, since they are typically made of mesh, and air flows beneath the dog as it sleeps.
Beds with cooling pads are also available if your dog isn’t comfortable sleeping above ground., Dog beds are available in a variety of materials that can help you deal with issues such as incontinence, odors, or allergies.


Waterproof beds are ideal if your dog is older and incontinent. If your bed isn’t waterproof, such as a mattress-type bed, purchase a waterproof cover to place over it.Cedar-filled beds not only repel odors, but they also can transfer a pleasing scent to your smelly dog. The more your dog rolls around in its cedar bed, the better it will smell in the morning.Hypoallergenic dog covers that you stuff yourself are also a good option if your dog is sensitive. That way, you can try several different fillings to see which works best for your dog."

Remove any pins you've put in place before allowing your dog to use the bed.",How to Make a Free Dog Bed," One way to make a dog bed is to look for old pillows or comforters around your home. Sewing or stitching a few pillows together, and covering it with an old comforter, is a great way to make a dog bed for free.Make sure any materials you use are non-toxic to dogs. Read the labels of any old pillows and comforters you use to make sure they're free of formaldehyde, as this can be toxic to dogs. It's common in unwashed fabrics. Levels do drop with time, so as long as any pillows and comforters are old and have been washed previously they should be dog-safe. Just make sure to run them through the washer and dryer before use to be safe.Try to remember what types of household cleaners you've used on these supplies previously. Cleaning products that contain bleach, ammonia, chlorine, glycol ethers or formaldehyde can lead to kidney disease, cancer, and other ailments in dogs. Laundry detergent residue can therefore be particularly harmful to pets, especially if they chew on bedding. Try to wash old pillows and comforters with more organic, non-toxic detergent before repurposing them for a pet bed.;
, Old and broken furniture can be filled with old blankets and pillows to make a fun, free DIY dog bed. You can use old drawers, wood crates and milk crates, old TV consoles, and any other old piece of furniture that provide a box-like structure. Look in your basement and attic to see if you have any old furniture you can use for your dog's bed.As with bedding, a lot of wood furniture contains trace levels of formaldehyde. Make sure any wood furniture you use is formaldehyde free before using it for a dog bed., Old sweaters and other items of clothing can be scraped and turned into pillow covers or blankets for your dog's bed. This can help in a bind if you don't have any old pillows or comforters lying around.Just make sure to check product labels to watch for any potential toxins. As laundry residue can pose a problem, consider washing your clothes with organic, chemical-free laundry detergent before using it in your pet's bed., Old curtains are a great addition to a DIY dog bed. They can be folded and sewed over a pillow to make a comforter for your dog's new bed.Be careful with this method. You should always wash curtains with organic detergent once or twice before using them in your dog's bed. Old curtains are very prone to airborne household pollution from cleaners., Dumpster diving can be a great way to find old materials for your dog's bed. If you don't have anything laying around your home, you can find supplies in dumpsters around town. However, you should take certain precautions when dumpster diving. Hygiene is a major and the legality of dumpster diving varies by state, county, and town.


Keep track of when stores tend to discard old items. Take a walk around town and see when, for example, a local furniture store might toss old materials. When you do go diving, bring a flashlight to watch out for potentially hazardous materials. You should also wear rubber gloves.Make sure it's legal to dumpster dive in the area you've chosen. ""No Trespassing"" signs are a good indicator you should dumpster dive elsewhere. You should also check local regulations on dumpster diving. Some counties have standing bans on dumpster diving anywhere, even buildings without signs expressly forbidding it., You'll need a comforter for your dog's bed. You can easily make a comforter on your own with two old pillows and a curtain, old blanket, or old sheet as a cover.


Take two pillows and push the long sides together. Have about 4 to 6 inches of overlap between the pillows. Sew the pillows together along the overlap, either by hand or using a machine.Wrap an old sheet, old curtain, or old blanket around the pillows until it fits them like a pillow case. You may have to trim some of the excess fabric if there's too much. Use pins to pin the sides of the cover snuggly around the pillows. Then, sew up the sides with a machine or by hand. Remove all pins., Once you've made a comforter, look back over your materials. Choose a holder. You can use old drawers, wood crates, milk crates, TV consoles, and other box-like structures. Place the comforter inside the holder of your choice.

, If you want to give your dog a little extra bedding, add any of the other supplies you've found. You can add an old sweater for your dog to snuggle with and chew on. You can add small throw pillows so your dog has a pillow on his comforter. Use anything you think might enhance the comfort of the bed.

, Sewing is required for a lot of DIY dog bed projects. If you don't already know how to sew, it's fairly easy to learn with some practice.


If you're working a sewing machine, follow the specific instructions for your machine. Sewing machines very in stitch length and how to assemble them properly. Using a sewing machine can be somewhat confusing if you're unfamiliar, so consider asking a friend who's into crafting and sewing for assistance.
Sewing by hand is more time consuming but can work if you don't have access to a sewing machine. You'll need to learn how to thread a needle and do basic stitching. If you want to build a dog bed for free, there are many free sewing tutorials online. Websites like YouTube provide beginner's instructions on the basics of sewing and what kind of threads to use.

, Online, there are many free patterns and instructions on how to make a DIY dog bed. Based on the supplies you've found, look for assembly ideas that would work for you.Many websites have free sewing patterns you can download and use for a dog's bed.
As always, keep the above safety precautions in mind when working. Make sure any supplies you use are free of harmful chemicals. Wash things like curtains and bedsheets in organic detergent before using them in your dog's bed.

, Be creative. You may not have all the exact supplies for a given project but feel free to substitute. For example, one project might suggest you make a pillow cover out of old curtains. If you don't have any old curtains, you can use old blankets, clothing, or sheets instead. Making a dog bed for free requires a certain degree of flexibility on your part.

, Many DIY templates require you secure covers in place before sewing them together. Double check that all pins are removed before letting your dog use his new bed. You do not want him to get pricked and injured by a pin.

If the dog breed is small, such as a Yorkshire terrier, it is better for a puppy to live with her littermates or parents for the first 12 weeks so they can mature enough to live with other people and animals.If you find a breeder who is selling puppies younger than eight weeks old, ask the breeder why, since it is too young.;
, As you are looking for a puppy, you should look at how clean the puppy is. This is a good indicator of the puppy's health. When you meet a new puppy, look for clean:


Ears. Puppy ears that are dirty may cause ear infections or indicate ear mites. Avoid puppies with ear redness or foul odors.
Nose. There should be no discharge from the nose and the puppy should not sneeze profusely or cough. Don’t think discharge is just saliva, however, because the nose may be wet from licking.
Eyes. There should be no discharge around the puppy’s eyes. They should be bright and alert., When you are getting a new puppy, her fur should be fresh and clean. It should also be shiny and full. Avoid dogs with bald patches or skin issues. It may be a bit dusty or slightly dirty if the puppy is playing outside with other animals, but she should clean up easily.


When you play with her, part her fur and look at the skin. It should also be clean and smooth. Make sure there are no fleas and the puppy doesn’t itch., When you pick up the puppy, check the muscle definition of the legs and arms. All puppy bodies should be strong even if the dog is a tiny breed. Make sure he isn’t thin with a protruding belly.


This can be a sign of an untreated worm infestation or a serious health issues, such as a heart problem., If you have a chance, examine what the puppy’s stool looks like. It should be firm. Loose stools or a messy bottom may indicate diarrhea, which is a sign of larger health issues. You should also check where the other puppies in the litter go to the bathroom to make sure none of the other puppies are sick either. Also watch to see if the puppy licks her genital region a lot. This may be a sign of a urinary tract infection.

, In addition to the physical symptoms, you should evaluate the overall energy level of the puppy. Watch his interaction with other puppies and see how he interacts with you.


It may take a little time for the puppy to warm up to you and your family, but he eventually will. Sit with him and make time to play with him when you visit. Puppies who are healthy are curious and want to play if they are awake.

, If at all possible, ask the shelter or breeder to see the past vet records for your puppy. This will ensure that she has been vaccinated and will let you know if the puppy has been fixed or not.


If the breeder or seller won’t or can’t give you past vet records, seriously rethink getting that puppy. This is a warning sign that something could be wrong.

, Your puppy's health includes his mental health, and that means he should be properly socialized. Ask about what contact the puppy has had with other people and where the puppies are kept (home environment rather than an outside run). A puppy that is poorly socialized can lead to major behavioral problems down the road.

, It can be very difficult to adopt a puppy who becomes ill soon after you get her. Sickness, especially at a young age, can cause many lasting health problems for your puppy, such as stunted growth and diseases that can take continual care. This is not only hard on your puppy, it is hard on your family as well.


This can be very expensive for you if you don’t notice these health issues before you adopt the puppy. For example, the first year of a healthy puppy’s life can cost between $700 and $2,000 in veterinary costs. If your puppy is sick, this amount may double or triple., A great place to look for a puppy is a shelter. Check with your local Humane Society or animal rescue society to see what kinds of puppies they have available. These organizations take very good care of the animals they shelter, so the puppies you see from them will likely be in the best of health.


The puppies in these places undergo a full exam and are given their vaccinations by a veterinarian.These organizations will also not knowingly offer you a sick puppy, but it is always good to be on the lookout for sickly behavior.

, If you know you want a particular type of puppy, you may want to look into a breeder instead of a shelter. Before you adopt, plan a visit to the breeder’s facility to meet the breeder, the parents of the puppies, and the puppies.It is important to assess the kind of environment the breeder has. You will also want to play with the puppy and determine his general temperament as well as the temperament of the parents. This will help you determine if the puppy is a good fit for you and your family.
The Humane Society of the United States has a available online that you can use to assess the breeder. This checklist tells you what to look for, such as the number of dog types the breeder breeds and the state of the conditions where the dogs are kept. The breeder should also have a strong relationship to local veterinarians and should instruct you in how to take care of the puppy once you take him home.
When you go to meet the breeder, take the checklist with you so you can make sure you are buying a puppy from a reputable source. Feel free to ask as many questions as you want. Responsible breeders understand since they want to connect with responsible owners as well. You may still consider a shelter for a purebred animal. About 25% of animals in shelters are purebred animals., Puppy mills are businesses that breed large amounts of puppies and house them in kennels. These puppies are often sick and poorly socialized.When the dogs are housed in kennels they miss out on a critical socialization period that allows them to become mentally healthy dogs.Not only that, the puppies and their parents are often housed in unsanitary and crowded conditions, are not given proper veterinary care, and the dogs being bred may have behavioral or health problems.Reputable breeders do not sell to pet shops.Avoid buying a puppy online, as there is absolutely no regulation as to where the puppy has come from, and you will be unable to check the puppy or his parents before you buy.

, You should take your new puppy to the vet within 48 hours of adopting her. Most breeders, shelters, and rescues have a small window when they guarantee the health of the puppy, so it is best to get her checked during this time in case there is something wrong with her. Even if there are no guarantees, you should still get her checked within this time frame so you can catch any possible health problem as soon as possible.


Your vet will explain about the necessary vaccinations, feedings requirements, and any other health problems facing your puppy, such as worms and parasites.
Feel free to ask your vet any questions you have about owning the specific breed you have or about puppies in general., When you adopt your puppy, ask the breeder, shelter, or rescue what they were feeding your puppy while he lived there. This will help make the transition easier on your puppy. He will already be stressed because he is changing his environment and leaving his family, so making sure his food stays constant will help make any stomach issues he experiences better.


Try to at least start him on the food he was accustomed to before. If you want to change his food, do so gradually by weaning him off the other food and feeding him more of the food you want him to have. Just make sure you are feeding him puppy food, not adult dog food.
If he has diarrhea, don't worry. This is a common response to stress., There are some diseases that are common in puppies, such as parvo, distemper, kennel cough, and gastrointestinal issues. The more severe conditions, such as parvo and distemper, have vaccinations that fight against them. This means it is imperative that you get your puppy vaccinated as soon as possible.


Other issues can be combated with a healthy and balanced diet. This helps keep her immune system up, which helps her fight any possible disease that could attack her at a such a young age.
If you notice any change in behavior, any general listlessness, or excessive diarrhea or vomiting, take her to the vet immediately. The earlier you catch her illness, the better her chances are."

Look for a cage based on safety and sufficient size.,
Don’t use a crate that’s too big.,
Use a crate divider to adjust a crate’s size.",How to Buy a Dog Crate1," The dog crate you choose should allow your dog to lie down and turn around comfortably in the cage. When they sit or stand in the crate, they should have about three to four inches of extra head room. Since different breeds of dogs have different proportions, weight alone cannot allow you to determine an appropriately-sized cage.Measure your dog at its widest, tallest, and longest points, then add three inches to each of these dimensions to find the rough dimensions of the crate you’ll need.;
, If your dog can comfortably stand, turn around, and lie down, the crate is large enough. In fact, you don’t want it to be much larger than is necessary to allow these movements. Especially if you intend to use the crate for house training, a properly-sized crate is extremely important. If the crate is too large, your dog may go to the bathroom at one end and hang out at the other., If you have a puppy, you can intentionally buy a crate that you think will be large enough to hold your dog when they’re fully grown. Until then, you’ll need to accommodate the crate to the puppy’s size. Do so by using a crate divider to block off the excess crate space. Recall that they only need space that is sufficient to stand, sit, lie down, and turn around in.Depending on the type of crate you buy, you can purchase pre-made dividers that will come will easily attach.
You can also make your own divider by cutting a board to the appropriate size, sanding the edges, drilling holes near the edges, and attaching it in the appropriate location using zip ties or another material that cannot injure or snag your dog. This will be easiest with a wire cage, though you can drill small holes to help attach a custom divider to a plastic crate as well.
You can also potentially rent puppy-sized crates from your local animal shelter, and wait to buy a cage for your dog once it is fully grown.

Buy a mat for the easiest solution.,
Pick a pillow bed for a large dog.,
Select a donut bed if your dog likes to feel secure.,
Purchase a nest bed for cuddling comfort.,
Buy a bolster-type bed if your dog is a leaner.,
Look for a cave-style bed if your dog likes to burrow.,
Consider a hammock bed for ease of cleaning.",How to Select a Dog Bed2," Mats are a good choice if your dog is the type to sleep just about anywhere. They can be used to cover and protect upholstery if your dog sleeps on a couch, or they can offer a bit of warmth if your dog typically likes to sleep on the floor.


If your dog sleeps in a crate, you can get a dog-specific mat for inside it. Alternately, you can also use a bath mat inside the crate to offer softness and comfort.

, These oversized pillows featuring a loose filling are good for dogs that stretch or sprawl out while sleeping. Large dogs especially tend to stretch out as much as possible while sleeping, so the freedom offered by a rectangular pillow bed or large pad will suit your pup.


In less expensive models, the filling can clump or dissipate over time. Only buy the less expensive models if you can remove the cover to clean it, since washing the whole bed will decrease the lifespan of it.
If your dog tends to chew pillows, select a pillow bed made out of durable materials.A variation on the pillow bed is a bean bag-type bed, which is a bit overfilled to offer even more comfort for your dog.

, Shaped like its name would suggest, a donut bed is round or oval-shaped with raised sides. These are great for small dogs that like to sleep curled up.Donut beds can also help your small dog stay warm while sleeping.
Some dogs like to walk in circles a few times before laying down, and donut beds are a good option for these pups as well.

, Similar to donut beds, nest beds also feature high sides. They help retain heat well, so they’re good for dogs that need a little extra help staying warm at night.


Since the high foam sides of these beds usually prevent you from putting them in the washing machine, make sure they have a removable center pillow for ease of cleaning., These beds are like mini sofas, with a raised edge around it that your dog can rest its head on. Bolster beds are good for dogs that like big pillows and tend to startle when approached from behind, since the raised back provides a measure of security.Bolster beds can be expensive, since they tend to be very well made with durable stuffing.This style can also take up a lot of space, so make sure you have a good spot for it before shopping.

, These beds, with a cave-like arch, are also called tent beds. The semi-covered design is good for dogs that like to stay warm, covered, and cozy while sleeping. They can also be good for older dogs that have a hard time staying warm.Cave-style beds offer your dog a place to “hide away” if they get stressed out during the day, so they can be good for anxiety-prone dogs.
These beds are typically designed for smaller dogs, those weighing less than 20 pounds.

, Similar to human hammocks, these beds are elevated and made of a sturdy material affixed to a framework. They can be good if your dog is incontinent, since they clean easily and there is nowhere for the urine to settle in and cause odor.These beds do not offer much padding, so they are not ideal for all dogs.
Some dogs may feel uneasy being elevated above the floor while sleeping.

Get a wire crate in hot climates.,
Weigh the benefits of a plastic crate.,
Consider a soft-sided crate for small dogs.,
Shop for used crates online.",How to Buy a Dog Crate2," Crates made of metal wires have several benefits. If your dog has a heavy coat or you live in a hot climate, wire crates offer the best heat ventilation. Wire crates also make it especially easy to attach and adjust dividers, so the crate can grow as your dog’s size increases. Most wire crates are foldable, allowing for easier storage when not in use.Use a removable floor tray with a wire crate to keep your dog’s paws from getting caught or pinched, and to allow for easier cleaning.
Place a thick piece of cardboard between the floor tray and the wire bottom of the cage to reduce noises when your dog moves in its crate.

, If your dog likes cozier places, such as corners or the areas underneath tables, they may prefer a plastic crate. Plastic crates are often required while flying with your dog. Further, plastic crates are also the hardest to break out of. If you do use a plastic crate, make sure that your dog gets plenty of air circulation.Make sure that spending time in a plastic crate does not agitate your dog. Some dogs prefer to be able to see more clearly than plastic crates allow.

, Soft-sided crates are the lightest, most portable, and easiest to store. However, they are only usable with small dogs that won’t attempt to escape. If you have a small, well-trained dog, use a soft-sided crate to easily take them with you on short trips.Make sure that your dog doesn’t wise up and learn how to unzip a zippered soft-sided crate by positioning the zippers pulls where they cannot be reached.

, Look at craiglist.org, another local classifieds website, or eBay.com for a used crates. Since many dog-owners only use crates for training, you can likely find a crate in great shape for less than it costs to buy it new. Of course, if you do buy a used crate, make sure you clean and disinfect it before providing it to your dog."

Be patient and positive during crate training.,
Place the crate somewhere you spend a lot of time.,
Encourage your dog to go into the crate.,
Feed your dog in its crate.,
Start leaving your dog in the crate while you’re at home.,
Leave your dog in the crate for short times when you go out.",How to Buy a Dog Crate3," The most important point to remember is that you must make sure your dog associates your crate with positive sentiments. Start slow when introducing your dog to a crate. It may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to get your dog used to spending time in a crate.At first, leave the door to the crate open, so they can explore it whenever they feel comfortable doing so.

, The best place for your dog’s crate is somewhere they enjoy being, and somewhere they’ll be near you. Put something comforting in the crate, like a blanket. Your dog may simply start sleeping in the crate on its own., Bring your dog over to the crate and speak to them in a calm, happy voice. If they don’t want to go into it, drop some treats just inside the entrance to the crate. If they reach in and eat these, toss some further into the crate. It’s totally okay if they are hesitant to go in all the way. Don’t force them to do so.Try tossing its favorite toys into the crate as well. It may take up to a few days to convince them to go into the crate all the way.

, Once they’re willing to go into the crate to retrieve treats or toys, start feeding them its meals in the crate as well. This will cause your dog to feel positively about the crate. Once your dog is comfortable standing and eating in its crate, close the door while they’re eating. The first time you do this, open the door when they’re done eating.Next time you feed them and close the door while they’re eating, leave it closed for a few minutes after its meal. Increase the amount of time you leave them in the crate until they’re spending 10 minutes in the crate after meals.
If they begin to whine, do not let them out until they stop whining. Otherwise, this will teach them that whining gets them out of the crate.

, At first, do so only while you’re home. Choose a word to indicate that you want your dog to go in its crate, such as “crate.” Go to the crate, say the word, and offer your dog a treat. Praise them if they enter the crate, give them the treat, and close the door. Sit near them for a few minutes, then go elsewhere for a few minutes. Return and spend a few more minutes near them before letting them out. Gradually increase the period of time you’re out of your dog’s sight., Once you can leave your dog in its crate for 30 minutes without issues, you can crate them when you leave for short periods. Vary the length of time between putting them in the crate and actually leaving, between 5 and 20 minutes. Be relaxed when you put them in the crate before leaving. Avoid drawn-out “good-byes.” Simply praise the dog for obeying, give them a treat, and depart.Don’t act excited when you return home. This may increase the dog’s anxiety about when you’ll return when you leave the house.
Continue crating the dog for brief periods when you’re at home, or they’ll begin to associate the crate with you leaving.
Only crate the dog until they can be trusted not to destroy the house. After that, keep the crate as a place where the dog can go voluntarily.

"
"
Do not use the crate as punishment.,
Don’t leave your dog in the crate for extended periods.,
Never keep puppies in a crate too long.,
Do not crate your dog when they’re stressed.",How to Buy a Dog Crate4," Crating them after they’ve misbehaved will confuse them about the crate. This will likely make the dog feel trapped and frustrated. They will likely come to fear the crate and begin to refuse to enter it, even if they once loved it., The more time they spend locked in a crate, the less exercise and human interaction your dog will get. This may result in your dog not getting enough exercise and becoming depressed or anxious. Adjust your schedule, hire someone to care for your dog, or bring them to doggie daycare if you have been keeping them in the crate for more than a few hours per day.

, Aside from the other issues associated with long periods in a crate, puppies cannot control their bladders and bowels for more than a few hours. The same applies to older dogs that are being house-trained. Dogs need to learn to “hold it” – prior to training they simply don’t know they are supposed to!, If your dog is anxious, even if it’s about being crated, you should not force them to go into a crate. Further, do not crate them when they become upset about someone leaving, or because there is a storm outside. They should only ever enter the crate voluntarily once there are trained to do so."

Choose a bed that is easy to maintain.,
Find a bed that fits well in your home.,
Look for environmentally friendly features.,
Determine your budget before you shop.",How to Select a Dog Bed3," Perhaps the most important consideration when choosing a bed for your dog is to pick one that can be easily cleaned. Dog beds need to be cleaned often to control odors, fleas, and dirt. The outer cover should be washed every week or two., While you definitely want your dog to be comfortable in its new bed, you also don’t want this feature to dominate the room it is in. Dogs tend to prefer that their beds be situated in a quiet area of the house that doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic. That way, your pet will be able to escape for some alone time when necessary.Many beds come in different fabrics or designs, so you can look for one that coordinates with your other furnishings.
If space is a concern, you may be able to find a corner bed that you can tuck away in previously unused space.

, If you tend toward an earth-conscious lifestyle, you can purchase beds made of used materials like recycled plastic bottles. Similarly, many dog beds and covers are now offered in 100 percent organic materials, so you can keep your eyes out for those as well.


These types of beds and covers can be more expensive than other choices, but they are often highly durable so they last longer.
Natural rubber is a common option for filling earth-friendly beds.

, It is easy to go overboard when buying a bed for your dog, since you want your pup to have the best of everything. If you don’t have a price in mind before you start to shop, you could very well end up regretting your shopping spree at a later time. Prices can range from $15–$30 for elevated pet beds to $115–$190 for nest-type beds.


Look at big box retailers, small pet shops, and online stores to compare prices and features.
Don’t forget you may need to periodically replace your covers or even your mattresses if they become excessively soiled or worn. Keeping this in mind while shopping can help you make a sensible financial decision.

Purchase the product.",How to Buy Dog Care Products," Dog care products can refer to a wide variety of things. It can refer to everything from grooming supplies, toys, beds, leashes and medicine. If you are adopting or rescuing a new dog, you will need more items than you would if you have had this dog for years.Identify whether you need to purchase items in a specific category, like dog food or new toys, and limit your focus to this category. Since there are so many options available, it is helpful to limit your search to one category at a time.;
, Take stock of what you already own to avoid purchasing duplicate products or something that you don’t need.


Look in closets and storage areas to ensure that you have taken inventory of all the dog products you already have.
If you have friends and family that own pets, see if they have any gently used items that they would be willing to share with you, like collars or beds that their dog has outgrown. Make sure to wash and sanitize these items thoroughly before using them with your dog., If you are looking for products in categories where your dog can have likes or dislikes (such as dog food or toys), take the dog’s likes into consideration. If this does not apply, like if you are purchasing medicine for your pet, disregard this step.


Look at what toys your dog plays with the most. If you are looking to get your dog a new toy, it is helpful to know what type of toys they play with frequently. For example, some dogs prefer soft plush toys while others like durable toys they can chew.
Many owners find that their dogs have preferences in the type of dog food their dog prefers. Keep in mind that switching dog foods is a process that you can avoid if the food you already purchase works for your pet.

, If you are purchasing health products for your dog, like flea and tick medicine or a medicated shampoo for their coat, consult with your veterinarian.Your veterinarian may sell the product that you need in their office. They may sell medicated or prescription products that you could otherwise not find at pet retailers.
Ask your veterinarian for recommendations for products or brands that they trust.
Consider calling your veterinarian's office and asking, ""I'm looking for a medicine that I can apply at home to protect my dog against fleas and ticks. Is there are certain brand that you trust and could recommend for my situation?""

, Recommendations are a great way to find out about products and brands that you might not have heard of before. They are also a good way to identify products that others trust. Many people are more than willing to share information about products that they really like.


Ask your friends and family who have pets for recommendations. If you are looking for a product within a certain category, kindly ask them about to limit their recommendations to your relevant category. Consider asking something along the lines of, ""I'm looking for a new collar (or other product you're looking for) for my dog. I see that you use this brand, what do you think it? Have you had any problems with the collar? What do you think of its quality?""
Keep in mind that the product that works for this person might not work for you or your dog. Recommendations can be a good jumping off point to identify new items but you should always do your research to make sure it is the right product for you.

, You have a general idea of the type of product you intend to buy, like new dog food or a bowl for their water. Now you can begin to look at the different products that are available for purchase. When you find products that you like, make a list that includes the product's name, price, and a short description. Whether you want to buy these products online or in a store, this list is a helpful way to stay organized.


If you know of large retailers that sell pet items, whether they are specifically pet stores or not, you can look at their websites to see what products they sell.
You can also shop online to see what products are available from a wider variety of online retailers.
If you find a product that you like online, the retailer’s website may allow you to enter your zip code or address to see if the product is in stock at your nearest store.
Make a note if there are different versions of products that you’d be willing to buy. You may find that there are three or four different toys or collars that you are interested in. You can take this list to the store and see whether these products are in stock.

, It’s easy to get caught up in shopping and purchase more than you intended to. Identify how much you are willing to pay for a particular product or set a range. For example, you can say that you want to find a new brush for your dog’s coat that costs between $10 and $15.


Once you have set a budget, try to stick to it. Since you have researched the product before you buy it, you will have a general idea of how much the product should cost.If the dog care product is one that your dog will outgrow, like a puppy collar or puppy sized bed, you should take the fact that you will need to replace the item in a few months into consideration when setting your budget.
Consider the quality of the product when you set a budget. There are some products where quality is not as important, a dog will be just as happy with a cheap plush toy as it will with an expensive plush toy. Never sacrifice safety for price, though. If a cheap item is poorly constructed and poses a health risk to your dog, like a toy with small parts that are easily broken off and swallowed, pay more for a better constructed toy.

, Take the list of items that you may buy and search online for reviews of the product. You can search “product name reviews” and see what other consumers who have used the product have to say about its quality.


Take product reviews with a grain of salt. People who write reviews about products online tend to be either very happy with their purchase or very upset. Keep this in mind while you read reviews and use your best judgment in deciding what reviews you trust.
The product may be from a brand that you already know and trust, or it may not. If the product is from a brand or manufacturer that you are unfamiliar with, look at reviews for these as well.

, Now that you have identified the product that you would like to buy, you can look for retailers that sell this product. You may purchase your products in person or online. Some specialty products may be easier to find online, especially if you live in an area that doesn’t have a large pet store.


Large pet stores will generally carry more products than smaller pet stores. Smaller pet stores may have more specialty products and you can support small businesses by purchasing products there.
Many large pet stores have websites where you can order products that they carry. You can also purchase the product directly from the manufacturer or brand.

, Your price comparison strategy will be different whether you buy online or in store.


When you purchase an item from a store, like a large pet store, you are limited to comparing the prices at that specific store. You have the option of traveling to different stores to compare prices between them, but this is a time intensive process and may be unnecessary if you are only purchasing one or two small items.
Use a price comparison app to check prices between different stores. These apps scan the item's barcode and compare the prices from major retailers for you. These will not have information for small or locally owned stores.It is easy to compare prices online. You can have different websites open in your Internet browser that sell the same products. Prices may differ between the sites, but shipping costs are often the determining factor in online pricing. If you do not need the product immediately, you can select a slower shipping option that will cost less than if you need the product right away.

, Now that you have an idea of what you want to buy, how much you are willing to spend, and trust the product’s quality, you can purchase the product.


You can decide whether you would like to buy the product online or in a store. Keep in mind that products you buy online may take several days or weeks to ship. If you need this product as soon as possible, you may want to buy it in person.
Keep your receipt for the product so you can return it if you find that it is damaged or doesn’t work as intended.

Allow your dog to sleep in the room.,
Reward your dog for noticing the bed.,
Teach your dog to wait for an invitation before jumping on the bed.,
Reinforce the desired behavior with a command.,
Be patient if you have a cautious dog.",How to Encourage Your Dog to Sleep in Your Bed1," Do not invite your dog into the bed with you right away. For several reasons, this is a bad idea. You need to ease your dog into sleeping in your bed. Start by letting him in your room at night.


To start, move your dog's bed in your room. Coax him to bed with you when you go to sleep at night. Allow him to take some time getting used to your bedroom.
Dogs can become stressed by new routines. If your dog is used to sleeping in his own bed in the living room, sleeping in your bed is a whole new behavior. This can be stressful and your dog may be hesitant at first.Also, you need to make it clear that you're in charge. If your dog thinks the bed is his, he may become territorial about it. This could lead to him taking up too much space or whining when he can't get in the bedroom. These kinds of behaviors should not be encouraged or reinforced.;
, Start small. Some dogs will willingly hop on any comfortable bit of furniture. However, other dogs may be cautious about anything unfamiliar. If your dog is unsure of your bed, start with tiny rewards. If he glances at the bed, approaches it, or sniffs it, reward him.Dogs live in the immediate. Reward the action as soon as it happens. It might be helpful to keep a small bag of treats in the bedroom. This way, you'll be able to reward your dog as soon as the behavior occurs.There are many ways to reward a dog. Some people buy training clickers at a local pet store. When the dog behaves, they click and give him a small treat. The dog will learn that a clicking sound means he's done something right. However, if you don't want to go that route you can simply offer the dog praise when you see him noticing the bed and provide a small treat as well. Dogs tend to respond well to food as a reward., If you want your dog to sleep in your bed, train him to wait for an invitation first. Dogs need a certain amount of structure. If your dog hops on and off the bed at his own desire, he may become territorial about the bed. Make sure he knows it's your bed and he's allowed on when you say so.


Teach your dog to sit before the bed. If he starts trying to jump in the bed, say, ""No"" and then have him sit. Wait a few moments and then say something like, ""Go to bed!"" while patting the bed to signify that it's time to sleep.Do a few training sessions each day while you're still establishing the rules. You can use positive reinforcements, like praise or treats, when your dog completes the behavior successfully.Eventually, you'll want your dog to come sit by the bed and wait for an invitation before climbing in bed with you each night., It can be helpful to have a command that tells your dog it's time for bed. This can make bedtime smoother for both of you. For example, when you're ready to turn out the lights you could say something like, ""Go to bed."" This tells your dog it's time to hop in the bed and lie down. Each night, as you're winding down to rest, say, ""Go to bed"" right before you turn out the lights. You want your dog to associate this command with sleep time., Some dogs are more skittish than others. If your dog is nervous by nature, it may take awhile to get him used to your bed. Cautious dogs are generally slower to learn new behaviors. They may need more rewards as encouragement. If you have a cautious dog, go slowly and reward often. It may take a few months to get your dog sleeping in the bed with you if he's generally nervous."

Fluff and reassemble.",How to Clean a Dog Bed," Remove any large clumps of dirt or other pieces of debris by shaking out the dog bed. This is best done outdoors or in an area you don’t mind getting dirty, as it may result in dirt settling in the immediate area.


Loosen stubborn pieces of dirt by gently beating them with a broom or stick.;
, Next, take a handheld vacuum or use a crevice attachment with your standard vacuum and vacuum out the dog bed. Focus on seams and folds in the bed, as this is where dust, debris, and other problems such as insects may hide and accumulate.You may want to use a dusting attachment to sweep over the larger, flat parts of the dog bed, then switch to the crevice tool to clean out the stitching.

, If you find there are patches of dirt or dried on mud that are particularly difficult to remove, treat them by placing a damp washcloth or paper towel over the area. Allow the towel to sit on top of the spot for 10 to 20 minutes, then wipe away the softened dirt using the back side of the towel.A toothbrush may also be helpful in flaking away stubborn patches of dirt, especially if they do not wipe off after soaking.

, If you notice spots or staining on your pet's bed, treat them before you wash the liner. In general, it is not advisable to treat cosmetic staining on the cushions of the bed using chemical spot treatments. This is because the treatment may not rinse thoroughly out of the filling and the residue can be irritating to your dog's skin. Only treat if you believe a stain has the potential to be harmful, such as blood or vomit from another dog.


For cosmetic stains, simply rinse out the stain as best as possible using soap and water.
Use a non-bleach spot treatment product as much as possible. These can easily be found at local markets and pet shops. Follow the directions for pre-treatment according to the product bottle.
If you must use bleach, look for a chlorine-free bleaching agent, and remember to rinse thoroughly and completely before washing. Such bleaches can often be found at health food and natural food stores., If you have any concerns regarding pests or insects in your pet’s bed, treat immediately by soaking all parts of the bed in boiling water. Allow it to sit in the boiling bath for three to five minutes to fully kill any pests and their larvae.Watch your bed carefully as you boil it. Make sure it does not start breaking apart or disintegrating due to high temperatures.
Do not leave your bed in a boiling bath for extended periods of time, as this could cause the filling to melt.
Treat your dog for any infestation it might have before you allow it to use the bed again.

, Once your bed is completely treated, use a pet-friendly odor absorbing spray to treat for any residual odor and to help decrease new smells. Spray the bed lightly with the product, as heavy application may bother your dog’s sensitive nose.These products are readily available from your local pet store as well as your vet’s office.
Talk to your vet if your dog has any allergies or has sensitive skin.

, While both the inside and the outside of the dog bed need to be cleaned, the cover sees the most wear and tear from your dog. Remove the cover, if possible, and re-zip the cover without the cushion to prevent the zipper from snagging during cleaning.


If your dog bed does not have a removable cover, clean the entire bed the same way you would clean the inside cushion.

, Make sure your cover can be washed in a standard, household washing machine. If the cover says hand-wash only, remember to use a low, hand-wash setting on your washer, or otherwise manually wash the cover.


Look for any restrictions regarding water temperature or drying the cover before you wash it.

, Run your cover through the washing machine in accordance with the tag, using hot water and pet-friendly detergent. Look for a detergent that is environmentally-friendly and scent-free, or check with your local pet store to find products especially formulated for pets.If your pet has sensitive skin or is prone to allergies, ask your vet for recommendations for proper products.If the tag on the cover states that it should be washed in warm or cool water, soak the liner in boiling hot water for 2 minutes before washing to disinfect it. Disinfecting for short periods is necessary to kill the microbes on the bed before washing the bed for an extended period at a cooler temperature. Watch carefully to avoid damage to the cover.

, Dry the cover according to the laundry tag information. If possible, try to dry the cover on a normal or permanent press setting in your dryer. If the cover must be air-dried, hang it down from a rod or laundry line and pin it in place.Try not to fold an air-drying cover over onto itself, as this will increase drying time.

, If your dog bed cushion need washing, hand wash it with hot soapy water in your tub or a basin using a dog-friendly detergent. Begin by allowing it to soak in very hot water to disinfect it. Leave it in the basin until the water cools enough for you to comfortably work in it.


Look for a detergent that is formulated for hand-washing. These are often available at local grocery and home goods stores, and will have indicators on the box.

, Once you are done soaking the bed, use your hands to gently agitate it. Squeeze and wring the bed under water to loosen any dirt that may have settled in the cushion. Be sure to get all parts of the cushion.There is no set time for how long you should agitate the cushion, but you should not stop until you see the dirt moving from the surface of bed. Treat all parts of the bed before rinsing.

, Wring out the soap and rinse with fresh water. Run the bed under a faucet of warm, fresh water and continue to wring and squeeze the cushion until it stops sudsing and all the soap has been removed. Then, wring the fresh water from the bed as much as possible.You will likely not be able to remove all water from the bed manually. However, the cushion should be damp, rather than wet, and no longer dripping before you stop wringing it and allow it to dry.

, Set the cushion out on a flat surface that you don’t mind getting wet, or extend it fully across the top of a drying rack. Allow the cushion to air dry completely before re-covering it. This may take upwards of a full day.


Check to see if the bed is dry by pressing down firmly in an area where the filling is thickest. If it spills out water or still feels damp, allow the cushion to continue to dry.
If certain spots are drying slowly, use a hair dryer on a low setting to help dry them faster.

, Once both your cushion and your cover are dry, you can put the dog bed back together. Fluff the cushion by pulling gently at the filling with both hands in areas where it has become compact. Then, insert the cushion back in the liner, and the bed is ready for your pet to enjoy.


Ensure that you fully close any zippers on your liner to prevent the excess accumulation of dust and keep out insects and pests that could bother your pet.

Pick a covering fabric.,
Decide on a fluffy insert.",How to Make a Fluffy Dog Bed1," You can mix and match different prints, colors, and textures of fabric in order to create a comfortable bed that matches your home décor.


Make sure the fabric is easy to clean and/or able to be put in the washer.
Faux fur, fleece, terry cloth, and cotton are good choices. You can also use old curtains.;
, You can use pillows, old cotton clothes torn into strips, polyester stuffing, chopped foam, egg crate mattress toppers, or even scraps of different types of fabric you might have lying around the house.


Make sure to use non-toxic material that won't harm your dog if s/he chews up the bed.

Provide positive reinforcement.,
Create positive associations with the bed.,
Discourage unwanted behaviors.,
Respect your dog's comfort zone.",How to Encourage Your Dog to Sleep in Your Bed2," Dogs need a lot of positive reinforcement to behave. Once your dog is comfortable in your bed, provide positive reinforcement. Each night, when your dog gets in bed with you, give him praise or a treat to show him he's behaving properly.

, If your dog is a slow learner, it can help to create positive associations with the bed. Your dog will be more eager to join you in bed each night if he thinks of the bed as a place where happy, fun things happen.Try feeding your dog on or near the bed. You can lay down a towel over the bed to prevent a mess.
Put some things your dog likes in the bed with you. Allow him to have some of his toys and blankets in the bed.Spend some time just sitting in the bed with your dog. Watch TV or read a book and allow your dog to hop up on the bed with you. Periodically pet him or praise him.
Be careful, however, not to teach him to associate anything too disruptive with the bed. You want him to sleep through the night and not disturb you. Therefore, playing with your dog in the bed may be a bad idea.

, Dogs respond well to negative reinforcement as well. Some behaviors can be disruptive to sleep.


Dogs may not respond well to punishment or scolding. It's sometimes easier simply to ignore bad behaviors. If your dog sees he's not getting a response, he may stop. For example, if your dog is whining or barking at night, just ignore it. Yelling at him might make him feel like you're barking back, encouraging him to keep it up.If your dog is continuing to behave poorly, taking something away is also an effective means to discourage the behavior. Sometimes dogs act out to get your attention, good or bad, and yelling may only encourage bad behavior. Instead of scolding your dog when he's being disruptive at night, consider putting him on the floor. Do not let him back into the bed until he's calmed down. Eventually, your dog will realize certain behaviors result in him being removed from the bed. He'll stop engaging in those behaviors., It's great to have your dog sleep in the bed with you. However, it should be a positive experience for you and your dog. Many owners enjoy snuggling with their pets, but some dogs may dislike being handled, especially if they're trying to sleep. If your dog growls or fidgets in response to cuddling, refrain from the behavior. Allow your dog to sleep in his own space.

Exercise your dog around bedtime.,
Stick to a regular sleep schedule.,
Take your dog out right before bedtime.,
Leave ice cubes in your dog's bowl.",How to Encourage Your Dog to Sleep in Your Bed3," If you share a bed with your dog, it's important he sleeps through the night. This way, you'll both get a good nights sleep. One way to encourage your dog to sleep is to exercise him a few hours before bedtime. Take your dog for a walk in the late evening. Spend some time playing with him in the living room with his favorite toy. This way, your dog won't be wired when you turn off the lights., You are the highlight of your dog's life. He wants to be awake when you're awake and near you when you're sleeping. If you want to make sure your dog is getting enough sleep, stick to a regular sleep schedule. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each night, both you and your dog will have higher quality sleep. There will be less tossing and turning at night., Your dog may have difficulty sleeping if he needs to use the bathroom. Take your dog out right before you go to bed. If you go to bed late, you don't need to walk your dog around the block. Simply let him step out onto the sidewalk or backyard to have a quick pee. He'll be more comfortable when sleeping and more likely to fall asleep fast., Your dog may get thirsty during the night. However, drinking too much at night can put stress on his bladder. If he needs to go out, it'll be harder for him to sleep. You can put a few ice cubes in his dog bowl at night. If he gets thirsty, he can lick the ice cubes. This way, he's getting a little bit of water but not drinking enough to disrupt his sleep."

Make an easy fleece tie dog bed simply by adding stuffing to the inside of a fleece tie blanket.,
Start off with two rectangles of fleece material.,
Lay your first piece of fleece with the rougher side facing up and then lay the second yard of fleece on top, soft side facing up.,
Slide your self healing mat under the fleece and cut off the rough selvage edges of the fleece using scissors or a rotary cutter.,
Pin your four-inch by four-inch square template to any corner of your fleece and cut around it so that there is an outward facing right angle chunk cut out.,
Take your tape measure and lay it across the fleece from the top of one right angle to the other so that there is a four-inch strip of fleece below the tape measure.,
Keep the tape measure in place and use your scissors or rotary cutter to cut strips of fleece one-inch thick all along the four-inch section.,
Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece, making sure to pin the tape measure in place.,
Separate the top layer of fleece from the bottom layer of fleece just enough to stuff the blanket with stuffing of your choice.,
Stuff the blanket evenly with your stuffing, making sure that the stuffing reaches each corner of the blanket.

,
Match up the top and bottom fleece layers and begin to tie the fringes together in double knots.,
Make sure that each tie is securely tied, and you're finished!

",How to Make a Fluffy Dog Bed2," This is the fastest way to make a dog bed and does not require any sewing.

, The size will depend on the size of your dog. You will want to err on the side of extra fabric in order to leave enough room for the stuffing. For a small dog, two one-yard pieces of fabric will be enough. For a medium to big dog, two, two-yard pieces of fabric will do the trick.


Fleece tie blankets are extremely easy to make because they don't require any sewing and fleece is a relatively cheap material. You can buy yards of patterned or solid colored fleece at any craft store.
You can mix and match patterns and solids by using a single color on one side of the blanket and a patterned print on the other.

, In other words, the rougher sides of the fabric will be touching one another.

, Make sure to use the lines on your template for a straight cut. You do not need to cut the other edges unless they are uneven or you are using a rotary cutter with a patterned cut.

, Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece.

, It's helpful to pin the tape measure down so that it doesn't move.

, Only cut to just below the tape measure line.

, You should now have fringes along all sides of the fleece that are one-inch thick and four-inches long.

, For this style dog bed, a lightweight stuffing made of polyester or egg crate foam works best.

,, Continue to tie each fringe together until you have made your way around the entire bed.

Take two large pillows and overlap them about four to six inches lengthwise.,
Sew the pillows together along the overlap where the seam of the pillow meets the other pillow.,
Repeat along the second (and third, if necessary) seam.,
Choose a fabric and cut out two shapes large enough to cover the pillows.,
Cut out the fabric using scissors.,
Individually fold the edge of the each piece of fabric inward before sewing to create a soft, rounded outside edge.,
Sew three edges of the bed together using either a sewing machine or sewing by hand.,
Once three sides are sewn, stuff the pillows into the shell.,
Sew the remaining side of the bed together.",How to Make a Fluffy Dog Bed3," You may need to use a third pillow if you are making a bed for a large dog.

, You will probably need to sew by hand to avoid jamming the pillow into your sewing machine.

, Depending on the strength of your sewing, you may want to sew the pillows together on top where they meet in little valleys. This will help the pillows stay together and also create a more consistent shape.

, It helps to measure the pillows with a tape measure or yardstick and then transfer the necessary dimensions to a piece of fabric before cutting. Make sure to account for the height of the pillows by adding about four to six inches of extra fabric to each side of the cutout.


You can also lay the fabric over the pillows and mark where the fabric meets the pillow edges using a pen.
Alternately, you can use old curtains instead of purchasing new fabric to save money and recycle your old things.

, Drape one piece over the pillow and place the other piece underneath the pillow. Make sure that the edges of the fabric match up.

, You can either fold as you sew or pre-pin all four sides of the bed before sewing using safety pins or sewing pins.

, Make sure to leave one side open in order to stuff the pillows inside.

, Make sure that the bed is evenly stuffed corner to corner.

, Snip any loose threads.


If you are seasoned at sewing, consider attaching a zipper to the fourth side of the bed. This makes it easier to wash the covering without having to wash the pillows as well.
The bed can sit alone on the floor of your home, or you can place the bed in an adequately shaped box or basket for extra support and a more polished look.
If using a box or basket, you can also sew strips of fabric onto the side of the bed to act as ties. You can then tie the pieces of fabric to the box or basket to prevent the bed from sliding.

Decide on the diameter you want your dog bed to be.,
Plan out a circular pattern of fabric that will consist of square pieces of fabric.,
Use this formula to determine how many 3 1/4-inch by 5 1/2-inch rectangles you'll need to complete your circle: pet bed diameter in inches x 3.14 divided by 2.75 inches (7.0 cm).,
Once you've determined how many squares you need, begin to cut out the squares from your fabric.,
Assemble the pieces together into a large square using either a sewing machine or sewing by hand.

,
Next, assemble the pieces together for the second side of the bed using the same sewing technique.

,
Measure the desired diameter of your pet bed onto each of the two square fabric pieces that you created.,
Sew most of the two quilts together with a 1/2-inch seam allowance, using a sewing machine or sewing by hand.,
Stuff the dog bed with the stuffing of your choice into the remaining open section.,
Sew the rest of the two quilts together.",How to Make a Fluffy Dog Bed4," You can either cut your dog bed insert to the desired size if it is cuttable (like egg crate for instance), or simply draw up a template.


Add one inch to your plans for seam allowances.

, You will probably want to use cotton for this project.

, Round up to the nearest whole number to make computation easier.

, You can also cut out triangular-shaped hourglass blocks to create a varied pattern.


Use a combination of solid and print fabrics to spice up your quilted dog bed.
For a simpler variation, use an old quilt instead of fashioning a new one.

,,, Cut out each circle using scissors and lay the two quilts on top of one another with the rough sides touching.


If using a pre-made circular insert or an egg crate, place the insert between the two pieces of fabric before beginning to sew.

, Remember to fold each edge of the quilt inward in order to form a thicker, smoother edge. Make sure to leave a section of the edge open large enough to fit the stuffing through.

, Once again, you can use polyester stuffing, old clothes, pillows, etc. to stuff your dog bed.


Because the quilted covering is more sturdy than, say, a flannel tie covering, you can use heavier stuffing with this method.

, If you are advanced at sewing, you can incorporate a zipper along the sewn edge of the bed in order to remove the stuffing for washing if desired.

Wait until the mother will allow you to touch the puppy.,
Find an appropriate scale.,
Find a way to tell apart the puppies.,
Recognize proper birth weights.",How to Check the Weight of Newborn Puppies1," Before you can weigh a puppy, you need to wait until the mother dog will allow you to touch the puppies. For a period of time after the birth, the mother will not want anyone handling the puppies.You can try to pick up one of the puppies to see how the mother responds. However, if the mother acts aggressively or defensively, leave the puppies and try again later.;
, Digital scales are the easiest and most convenient scales to use for puppies. This will give you the most accurate reading, which is important when during your puppy’s first weeks. You may want to use an electronic kitchen food scale or postal scales.You can find these in most supercenters or online.

, Often, the puppies in a litter will look exactly the same. To help tell them apart as you chart their weights, purchase a non-toxic permanent marker. Use the marker to place small marks on the belly of the puppies.You can use different colors to help tell them apart.Take care when identifying them using colored ribbons or collars as these can easily get caught and the puppy may be strangulated.

, Birth weights for dogs will vary depending on the breed. The puppies should be roughly the same weight at birth and as they mature. However, the size of the breed can give you a good idea of what they should weigh at birth.Small breeds will generally weigh between 75 to 350 grams.
Medium breeds range from 200 to 300 grams.
Large breeds usually range from 400 to 850 grams.

Collect a suitable cardboard box.,
Reinforce your box.,
Cut an opening for your dog.,
Pad your box for comfort.",How to Make a Dog Bed1," The most important characteristic you want in a box used as a dog bed is sturdiness. You'll also need the box to be large enough to accommodate the size of your dog. If your dog has a tendency to sprawl or move around in its sleep, you may want to choose a box that's on the larger side.If you don't have any suitable boxes at home but still want to make a box bed, you can purchase a box relatively cheaply from a shipping store, the post office, or in some cases an office supply store.;
, Stress and strain will be put on your box by the simple act of your dog getting into and out of its bed. Over time, this can cause your box to break down or become less structurally sound. To prevent this, apply a durable tape along the edges and sides of the box to reinforce it.Duct tape works very well for the purposes of reinforcing your dog bed as it is very durable. However, you can also use packing tape or other kinds of tape, though these may not hold up as well to wear and tear.
You might also want to tape the flaps at the bottom of your box where the box folds together. This can help strengthen the shape of the box and hold its shape.

, Take a pair of scissors or a utility knife and cut a downward pointing U-shaped opening in the box for your dog. For some boxes or dogs, this may only involve you cutting off the top flaps of the box. In other cases, you may have to trim down the sides of the box to make it easier for your dog to enter and exit.You might also want to cut a semi-circular ""main entrance"" for your dog bed. Take your utility knife and cut a semi-circle in the front of your box. This lowered lip of the box will be easier for your dog to enter, making it the default entrance for your pet., Although this is not necessary, padding can provide comfort and warmth to your pet. For example, if you're making a bed for an outdoor dog, wood chips can help fight insect infestations while insulating the animal from the cold.Indoor pets may have a special blanket or pillow that they often use that can be put in the box bed for additional comfort.You might also use some leftover padding, rags, old clothing, and more to make your box bed more comfortable for your dog.

Clean the machine.",How to Clean Dog Bedding With Vinegar1," Remove the blankets or dog bed cover from your dog's sleeping spot. Note whether the bedding smells bad enough to warrant a more intense cleaning. Place items in the washing machine.If you notice stains on the bedding, treat them with a stain remover prior to washing.;
, Look for any care labels on the dog's bedding that might offer specific cleaning instructions. If no special directions are listed, choose a hot water wash cycle. Add a mild detergent, in the normal quantity recommended for a single load.

, Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of white vinegar to the softener dispenser of the machine. Start the wash cycle. If your machine does not have a softener dispenser, run the machine as usual and add the vinegar at the beginning of the final rinse cycle.If the smell on your dog's bedding is especially strong, add a full cup of vinegar to the final rinse cycle.

, If possible, hang your dog's bedding on a clothesline to dry - the outdoor air will help with neutralizing odors and freshen the bedding. If line drying is not an option, air dry the items indoors or use the clothes dryer. If you choose the latter option, be sure to clean out the lint trap carefully afterwards to remove all pet hair.Avoid using dryer sheets, which may irritate your dog's skin.

, After washing your dog's bedding in the washing machine, clean the machine to remove any lingering odors or pet hair. Add a 1/2 cup of chlorine bleach. Run a full hot water wash cycle."

Weigh the puppy.,
Log the puppy’s weight.,
Weigh the puppies once a day.,
Watch for healthy weight gains.,
Clean the scale after weighing each puppy.",How to Check the Weight of Newborn Puppies2," When you weigh the puppy, do it gently. Puppies are delicate, so you should always use care. A good way to do this is to place newborn puppies in a bucket wrapped in a blanket or something soft. You can also wrap the puppy in a blanket before putting them on the scale.Make sure if you weigh the puppy in a bucket or with a blanket, you subtract the weight of the extra material.
Try using the same material each time you weigh the puppy to help with accurate readings.

, Create a chart to weigh each puppy’s weight progression. The chart should record the date and the weight of the puppy. Each day, you should see an increase in the puppy’s weight.The litter should progress at relatively the same pace. Their weights should be very similar each day.

, After the puppies are born, you should weigh them at regular intervals. Once a day is often enough to get a good idea of how they are progressing. Make sure to weigh them at the same time every day.You should weigh the puppies once a day for the first two weeks. After that, weigh them once a week.

, After the first 24 hours, the puppies should increase in weight. By the time the puppy is around a week old, the weight should be doubled from their birth weight. Puppies should gain 5 to 10% of their weight each day.Most puppies lose weight during the first day, and then start gaining it each day.
Each breed is different with the way they will gain weight. Check each puppy’s weight against the other puppies in the litter and their daily weights.

, When you weigh the puppies, you may gently put them directly on the scale. If you don’t use anything between the puppy and the scale, you should clean the scale with a disinfectant after you remove them. This helps reduce the risk of transmitting any germs or bacteria from puppy to puppy."
"
Encourage smaller puppies to drink.,
Call the vet if there are any significant weight changes.,
Get the puppies checked by a vet.",How to Check the Weight of Newborn Puppies3," Sometimes, smaller puppies may not get the same nutrition because they do not get equal access to the mother’s milk. If one of your puppies has a lower weight, help them get the milk needed from their mother.The teats between the hind legs generally have the most milk. Help the puppies nurse from those.
You may want to watch the puppies to make sure larger puppies don’t push smaller ones away from the nipples.

, Weight gain in a puppy should be steady and along the same level as the rest of the litter. Weight loss is not normal in a puppy. This indicates a problem, and the puppy should be immediately by the vet.If you have tried to get a smaller puppy to nurse properly but their weight is not going up, you should call the vet.
Malnourishment in a puppy may point to a problem in the mother dog, like mastitis.

, You should get the puppies checked out by a vet during the first 48 hours. This ensures that the puppies are healthy and without any birth defects. At this visit, the vet can also check the puppy’s weight to make sure everything is normal.The vet can take this opportunity to give them any shots or medications that they need.

Choose your base.,
Create a makeshift base with a pillowcase, alternatively.,
Add fabric as you see fit.,
Arrange the fabric of the bed regularly.",How to Make a Dog Bed2," It's important to have a base to your fabric dog bed, otherwise it won't have clear boundaries and your pet might not understand the fabric bed is its place. Also, a regular base will provide a more comfortable resting place for your pet. Much like sleeping on a lumpy mattress can be uncomfortable for you, so too will it be for your pet.You might choose an old, over-sized cushion for the base of your dog bed. To prolong the life of the cushion, you may want to wrap it in a blanket, towel, curtain, and so on.
Pillows can also work well, especially for smaller dogs. Much like cushions, you can extend the life of your pet pillow/fabric bed by covering it in a blanket, towel, curtain, and so on.

Sewing together the fabric you are using for your dog bed can also help it maintain shape. You could also sew the cloth inside a larger piece of fabric, like a sheet., If you don't have any cushions or pillows to make the base of your fabric pet bed, you can always stuff a pillowcase with rags, old towels, and unwanted articles of clothing.


You might consider making a pet ""beanbag"" bed. Place a large quantity of unwanted cloth items (towels, rags, shirts, etc.) in the center of an old, unwanted sheet. Tie the edges of the sheet together so it forms a beanbag.To prevent your fabric stuffing from falling out, you may want to stitch closed the opening of your pillowcase or sheet.

, You may want to add several layers of cloth to create an especially soft place for your pet to rest, but in many cases, your base may be enough for your pet. You may want to watch your dog as it gets used to the bed. If you notice the animal seems uncomfortable, you may need to add some more fabric to the bed., The fabric of your bed can easily get wrinkled or uncomfortably wadded up over the course of a night. Remember, many dogs have dreams of running, which causes their paws to twitch. This can sometimes cause the fabric of the dog bed to bunch up uncomfortably for your pet.


You don't need to check your pet bed every day, especially if you've tucked the bed up tightly with a sheet/covering when making it. However, to keep the bed at the max comfort level for you dog, you may want to check it once a week, straightening and smoothing the fabric when necessary.

"
Purchase a basket or suitcase for your dog.,
Modify the basket or suitcase if necessary.,
Line your basket or suitcase for comfort.,
Add a cover to prolong the life of your padding.",How to Make a Dog Bed3," Baskets are generally smaller in size, and while this might suit smaller dogs, it's unlikely a medium to large sized dog will be able to fit in a basket. In this case, you might consider using an old, unwanted suitcase instead.


Baskets and suitcases both can be found for relatively little cost at garage sales, thrift stores, and secondhand stores.Remember to account for the sleeping style of your pet. If you notice that your dog moves a lot in its sleep, you may want to buy your basket/suitcase a size larger than necessary. This way, your pet has room to move around.

, Since most suitcases hinge at the middle and open into two hollow sections, you may want to use a utility knife, shears, or other tools to remove one side of the suitcase to create a single hollow spot for your dog bed. Baskets often have handles, and you may want to remove these to make it easier for your pet to get in and out of the bed.Sometimes, cutting free previously connected parts of your basket/suitcase can leave sharp edges behind. To prevent your pet from getting poked or cut, you may want to file these down.

, You can use old throw pillows, unwanted bed pillows, leftover padding, blankets, and so on to add to the comfort of this kind of dog bed. Layer your padding, whatever it may be, evenly and completely along the bottom of the suitcase.Padding materials, like throw pillows, can generally be found and bought for cheap at thrift stores and secondhand stores.

, Over time, the wear and tear of your dog sleeping in this bed will cause your padding material to break down. You can prolong the life of this padding by covering it in an unwanted sheet or towel and tucking the edges of the covering into the sides of the suitcase or basket.


This covering also provides a uniform outside for the bedding. This means that even when your pet jumps in or out of the bed, or even if it has dreams and runs in its sleep, it's less likely to push the padding around and cause it to bunch up.

Fill the tub.,
Submerge the bed.,
Rinse the bed.,
Dry the bed.",How to Clean Dog Bedding With Vinegar2," If your dog's bed does not have removable bedding, you will have to soak the entire bed (or cushion insert) to clean it. Fill the bathtub full of warm water. Add a capful of laundry detergent and a 1/4 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.To remove very strong odor, add a 1/2 cup of vinegar.

, Put your dog's foam bed (or the foam cushion insert of the bed) into the bathtub. Make sure it is completely submerged. Soak the bed for 10-15 minutes., Drain the bath completely. Rinse the dog bed or cushion under warm water. Squeeze the bed until all the soap is rinsed out.

, Remove the bed or cushion insert from the tub. If weather permits, place the bed outside to dry. If not, place near a heater to dry indoors."

Wash bedding regularly.,
Bathe your dog regularly.,
Use a vinegar-based deodorizing spray.",How to Clean Dog Bedding With Vinegar3," To keep your dog's bedding fresh, wash it every week, or every two weeks at most.Purchase a mild detergent without dyes or perfumes, which can cause skin irritation for your pet. Ideally, look for a specialty pet detergent online., The best way to keep your dog's bedding clean is to keep your dog clean. Bathe your dog weekly; in the interim, you can use baby wipes to wipe your dog's coat and freshen its fur. In addition, brush your dog regularly to remove dirt, debris, and allergens that contribute to odor., Fill a spray bottle with an equal mixture of water and white vinegar. Spray your dog's bedding on a daily basis to keep it smelling fresh. Avoid spraying before your dog's usual bedtime or nap times so the bedding has adequate time to dry."

Choose the bed's base.,
Choose the bed's cushioning.,
Assemble the bed.",How to Build a Dog Bed for Small Dogs1," Choose an old object to form the base of your small dog's bed. Make sure that the object is large enough to accommodate your small dog's size, but not too much larger- if your dog is too small for its bed, it can feel insecure. Be sure that the base doesn't have any rough edges, loose nails, splintered wood, or other potentially dangerous spots.Some ideas for perfect bed bases are:


an old dresser drawerthe bed of a small wagon (with axels and wheels removed)an old wine crate (sanded, if needed);
, Find an old pillow or cushion that fits the inside of the bed. If your dog is prone to chewing things, opt for something made of a thicker material (like denim or vinyl). Consider choosing a pillow or cushion with a removable cover to allow for frequent washes., Place the cushioning in the bed base and position the new bed where your dog likes to sleep. Place adhesive furniture pads on the bottom of the bed to avoid scratching the floor or damaging the carpet. Add some of your dog's toys or a favorite blanket to the bed as a finishing touch.Most dogs dislike anyone sneaking up behind them while they're sleeping, so try positioning your dog's bed against a wall to ensure their comfort.

Determine what size bed you need.,
Decide if you need a “bolster.” Some orthopedic dog beds will have a “bolster,” or narrow cushion that runs along the edge of the bed.,
Consider a “nesting” bed.,
Select a bed that is the right height.",How to Choose an Orthopedic Dog Bed1," The first factor to consider when selecting an orthopedic dog bed is size. A bed too small will not provide your dog enough space to spread out, while a bed too large can actually make your dog feel insecure. Consult the size charts of various beds to select the right size for your dog.Here is a guide:


dog’s weight = size of bed
1-10 lbs. = 18”L x 13”W
11-25 lbs. = 24”L x 18”W
26-30 lbs. = 30”L x 20”W
41-70 lbs. = 36”L x 23”W
71-90 lbs. = 42”L x 28”W
91-110 lbs. = 48”L x 30”W
1 lb. = .45 kg; 1 in. = 2.54 cm;
, Some beds will not. A bolster is perfect for dogs who like to elevate their heads. If your dog prefers to spread out with their head flat, or allow their head to hand off the edge of their bed, select a bed without a bolster., If you have small or hairless dogs, you can keep them warm inside a “nesting” or “tented” orthopedic bed. These dog beds have warm hoods that allow dogs to burrow into a cozy cave., Some dog beds will elevated off the floor more than others. A bed that’s too high (or too low) may not work for a dog with leg problems, joint problems, or other injuries. Consider the height of various orthopedic dog beds, and select one that is right for your dog.

Choose a box that is a comfortable size for your dog.,
Create a space for the puppies.,
Line the floor of the whelping box.,
Place a heat mat in the puppy area.,
Provide a covering for the box’s opening.,
Place the box in a quiet room inside.,
Provide food and water near the box.",How to Care for Newborn Puppies1," A whelping box is one in which the dog gives birth. It should also keep the puppies warm and protect them from being squashed if their mother lies on them.The box should have 4 sides and a base. Choose a length and width that allows the bitch to lie down with her head and legs extended. Add half her height again to the width of the box, which will be used to create a space for the puppies.
Make sure the sides are tall enough that puppies will stay in but the mother can jump out without difficulty.
You can buy a whelping box at most pet stores. You can also use a cardboard box, or you can make a box out of hardboard or plywood. Acquire 2 large, stiff boxes, such as television or appliance boxes. Cut one end out of each box and push them together to make one longer box.;
, The puppies will need a safe haven in the box where the mother can’t lie on them (which could suffocate them). Mark the additional width in the box, and install a sturdy wooden rail approximately raised 4-6 inches from the bottom of the box.A broom handle works well as a rail in the box.
This is especially important when the puppies are over 2 weeks old and are more mobile.

, Line the floor with plenty of newspaper and some thick towels. Alternately, use a vetbed, which is a polyester fleece that wicks dampness away from the bitch and puppies.

, After you’ve constructed the puppy area, place a heat mat underneath the paper in this area. After the puppies are born, you’ll turn this heat mat on to a low setting. This helps the puppies to keep warm while they are away from the mother.An alternative to a heat mat is a heat lamp, angled towards one corner of the box to provide a warm spot. However, a heat lamp provides dry heat, which can dry out the puppy’s skin. If you have to use a lamp, be sure to check the puppies regularly for flaky or red skin. Remove the lamp if this happens.Use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to provide temporary warmth.

, During the whelping, the dog may want to feel like she is in a den. This helps her feel secure, which also allows labor to continue more readily. Place a large towel or blanket over part of the box to give her some covering., The bitch shouldn’t be disturbed while she is giving birth, so choose a quiet room to place the whelping box.

, Make it easy for your dog to eat and drink by making sure food and water is available nearby. You can still keep food and water in your usual spot, but making sure your dog knows there is food and water near the whelping box will help make her feel more at ease here.

Remember, a dog wants to please his human.",How to Care for an 8 Week Old Puppy," Like a baby, your puppy can get into things he shouldn’t. It’s ineffective to reprimand him once he does. Manage his environment and give supervision.


Pay close attention to him when you take him out, he doesn't know about dangerous things. Make sure he doesn't eat plants, some of them are poisonous.;
, Even if he has a tag, it could get lost. Soon after micro-chipping take him to your local shelter to be scanned. Sometimes the chip can move or the shelter doesn't have the right scanner for your pups chip. If they don't have the right scanner, they will get one. Micro-chip companies provide these free of charge to shelters. Don't bring him inside, they prefer to scan outside because he's not fully vaccinated at his young age and there could be a sick dog inside.

, If you don’t want your full grown dog to do something, then don’t allow him to do it when he is a puppy. For example, don’t sit on furniture with your puppy if you don’t want him to do it when he's grown.


The puppy stage lasts about two years. He will be chewing, digging, and so on. His training may need to be practiced over and over again. Teaching a puppy requires patience while he learns new behaviors, some of which may go against his doggie nature.

, Puppies are naturally curious. New toys, new places, and new people are good. Going for a walk is great for this, when walking allow him to stop and explore if it’s safe but make sure he keeps good manners.


Puppies will jump up on people at this age. This is a normal behavior but it can turn into a problem as the puppy grows up. Begin teaching your puppy not to jump on people.

, Make sure your puppy has as many positive experiences with as many people of different ages, different places, new environments, and other things as possible.


A good breeder starts socializing puppies right after birth by handling, exposure to different smells, and toys. The first sense a newborn puppy develops is touch. At three to five weeks puppies can see and hear, so a good breeder will take the puppies to safe places to let them meet new people and expose them to new sights and sounds.

, Adult dogs do not hurt or attack puppies.


If the puppy goes too far, the adult may sometimes let out a small grr, a tiny nip, or a similar correction to let him know his behavior is unacceptable in doggie society. A small nip is NOT the same as a bite; an adult dog will never bite a puppy. This is normal dog behavior and is always acceptable. The puppy gets the message and learns. Learning dog behavior from an adult dog can actually benefit your pup when he’s older.
Between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks is a critical time for socialization. Everything your puppy experiences during this time will be forever imprinted in him. For example, if a man with a beard does something to frighten your puppy this is not a positive experience. You will need to expose him to bearded men who provide a positive experience so he doesn’t grow into a dog who is fearful of, or aggressive toward, men with beards.

, At 8 weeks your pup has been weaned and should be given solid food.


Active pups burn more calories and require a higher caloric food intake than adult dogs, based on weight. Different brands of food provide different nutrients, calories, and feeding recommendations.
There is no set amount when deciding how much to feed a puppy. Consider your pup's age, weight, and activity level when deciding how much to feed. As your puppy matures and his size increases, he will need more food.

, He should not beg or be overly excited.


If your puppy lies or sits without staring at you, he is being respectful. If your pup turns its back on you or walks away while you’re getting his food ready, this is the highest respect as he is giving you your turn to eat first, showing he knows you’re above him in the pack hierarchy.

,


If your pup is not behaving respectfully don’t give him his food, just put it on the counter until he calms down. This teaches your puppy how to behave properly.

, Your puppy should let you reach down and touch or move his food without getting upset.


If you try this and the puppy dog growls, snaps, or tries to push you away he is telling you to leave him alone while he’s eating because he’s the alpha. It’s a bad idea to allow your dog to believe he is the alpha, because an alpha dog may resort to biting to show his disapproval of your actions.

,


Puppies at 8 weeks still have their baby teeth. As they lose these and grow their adult teeth they’ll need to chew. Make sure your puppy always has plenty of simple toys and size appropriate rawhide bones. Have some in every room he’s allowed to be in.
If your puppy chews the wrong thing, pick up his toy or bone, go to him and take away what he has with a stern “No” and give him his toy or bone. When he starts chewing it, give him praise.
If you don’t give your puppy something to chew, he’ll find something on his own. Likely, you will not be happy with what he’s chewing, but he’s in pain and he needs to chew. If he has nothing of his own to chew, and takes it upon himself to find something, don’t scold him. This is your fault, not his.

, At eight weeks, your puppy is physically unable to hold his potty in for more than three hours.


If you wait longer than three hours, the puppy will have accidents but it won’t be his fault. Don’t scold him if he goes in the house because you waited too long to take him out. This will only confuse him, and make it harder to house train. If he does potty in the house, never let him see you clean it up. Put him in another room or outside. Don't teach him that it's your job to clean up his mess. His mom cleaned his mess, but you do not.

, When you bring your puppy home for the first time, before bringing him in the house, take him to the place where you want him to eliminate. Have water for him to speed this up, then praise him, take him in the house to meet everyone and have play time. He’ll quickly learn that eliminating outside gets him what he wants.

, Your puppy can learn at this age but like a small child, he will have a short attention span. Shorter training sessions a couple times a day work best.


Use positive reinforcement. In the beginning you will need small treats, then, as he learns, you can move on to alternating treats and praise. Keep the treats small so they don't interrupt the training session. You can cut up a hotdog, or cut up some leftover meat from last night's dinner.
Use consistent commands when training. If you’re teaching your puppy to come, don’t say “come” sometimes and “here boy” other times.

, At 8 weeks your puppy’s hair will be fine like a baby’s and he won’t shed. Although he won’t need grooming, you need to use this time to get your puppy used to brushing and bathing, always praising him as you do it. Touch the bottom of his paws so he's comfortable with getting his nails trimmed when he's older. Groom for short sessions and keep it positive. When he gets bored let the grooming session be over. Never hold your puppy down to be brushed if he doesn’t want it. Doing so will only make grooming more difficult when he's grown.

, At eight weeks most puppies are ""clumsy"". Your puppy just learned to walk at 3 weeks and then run at 5 weeks so all of this is new to him. He’s still developing his motor skills to run, play, and do other things. Puppies are also used to rough and tumble play with their litter-mates, so your pup will be enthusiastic when it comes to playing.


Teach your puppy not to bite hands when playing. When playing with his litter-mates this was acceptable, but even it it’s cute now, it won’t be cute with he grows up. If he bites, just let out a sharp yelp and pull your hand away. He’ll learn.

, He will love to explore, crawl under things, climb, jump, and run; all traits of a good agility dog, but it’s too soon to teach agility to your clumsy little puppy..

, An 8 week old puppy sleeps around 14 to 16 hours each day. He's a baby, try not to wake him when he’s sleeping.

, This is the first time he’s been alone. Most puppies will be scared and cry at night because they miss their mother and litter-mates.


It helps if you bring a small stuffed toy to your breeder when the puppy is young. When you bring him and his toy home, his toy will be familiar and carry the scents of his mom and litter-mates. This will comfort him.
Bring the puppy’s crate into the bedroom so he sleeps in it but he's not alone. This will teach him that the crate is a safe place and he needn’t be scared..

, An 8 week old puppy should have been given their first set of shots before you bring them home. Typically puppy vaccination protects against distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus (commonly abbreviated DHPP). Depending on environmental factors, a Lyme disease vaccination may be wise

, Good breeders begin vaccinations very early, before the pup is ready to come home with you. Ask your breeder for his puppy vaccination records so you can give it to your vet. Your puppy should have boosters every three to four weeks until your pup is 6 months old.

, Puppies are often born with worms and may need to be dewormed by your vet. A good breeder will have already done this, again, ask your breeder.

, Heartworm prevention is important to puppies and dogs of all ages and should be started when they are young; check with your vet. Dogs of any age can get heartworm from a mosquito bite, and heartworm kills.


Heartworm can be treated, but treatment is very expensive and the treatment itself kills the dog in about half the cases. A vet will typically have to poison your dog with arsenic while treating him for the poisoning. Killing the heart worm while keeping the dog alive requires a delicate balance and it is not easily managed. This requires a hospital stay as well, and you’ll pay for that too. Your dog will still be sick for a week or two when he comes home. Recovery from arsenic poisoning is a hard and long process for your dog. Prevent it so you never have to treat it.

, But humans can send mixed signals that confuse the dog. You need to avoid making those mistakes. Here are some common mistakes to avoid.


Your puppy begs for food when you’re eating, you give him a bit of food. You’ve just told him “good boy” for begging. And you just taught him it’s okay to eat from the table. Don’t be surprised if he steals the family dinner from the table when your back is turned. You have taught him that it’s okay to eat from the table, that he’s equal to you in the pack hierarchy, and he doesn't have to wait until you've finished eating before he gets his food.
Your puppy is barking when he shouldn’t be, you tell him “NO” but you’re also petting him to calm him down. You’re telling him “good puppy"" for barking.
Don’t correct your puppy after the deed is done and he’s already moved on to something else. Your puppy will think you’re correcting him for what he’s doing “Now” not what he did before. Consider this scenario: puppy gets into the trash, then goes into another room and starts chewing his toy. You yell at him, he thinks it’s because he’s chewing his toy. Later, the puppy gets into the bathroom and discovers how much fun it is to bite the toilet paper and run around the house. Then he goes in another room and chews his rawhide. You yell at him and he thinks it’s because he’s chewing his rawhide. You’ve taught your puppy that you don’t want him to chew his toys or rawhide, so he goes off and chews the corner of your couch, or one of your shoes. He’s doing what he thinks you want him to do, and he’s teething, so what choice did he have? This is your fault, not his.
Maybe you’re only correcting your puppy sometimes, but not consistently. Perhaps you don’t want him on the furniture, you tell him “No” but only follow through by making him get down sometimes. You have taught your dog that sometimes he’s allowed on the furniture.
Dogs have social signals. When correcting he’s likely to look down or turn his head. Don’t force your puppy to look at you, turning away is how a dog lets you know he doesn’t want to challenge you. In the doggie world making eye contact is taken as a challenge.
Maybe the puppy wanders too far off. You call him back and he comes. When he’s back at your side you yell at him and tell him not to go out of the yard. You’ve just told your dog he was bad for coming back.

Have one adult monitor the birth.,
Do not bring visitors to watch the birth.",How to Care for Newborn Puppies2," At least 2 weeks before the pups are due, let the dog explore her whelping box. Make sure it’s placed somewhere quiet. She will want to nest in a quiet place in the time leading up to the birth.

, To help your dog get used to the box, plant treats in it regularly. Then she will associate this box as a quiet place with good things., Don’t worry if the dog doesn’t choose to labor in the whelping box. She will choose a place where she feels safe. This might be behind a sofa or under a bed. As long as she is not in danger of hurting herself, leave her be.If you try to move her, she may become distressed. This can slow down or even stop labor.

, If the dog chooses to labor under a bed or behind a sofa, it can be helpful to have a flashlight. This way, you can visually check on her.

, Program your vet’s number into your phone or post it on your fridge. If an emergency arises, you want to have ready access to the number.


Consult with your vet about how to get a hold of them if your dog gives birth at night.

, A trusted person should stay with the dog to make sure things go smoothly during the birth. This person should be very familiar to the dog. Limit people entering and leaving the space where the dog is giving birth. This can distress and distract the dog, potentially postponing her labor., Your dog needs to concentrate on giving birth.

Make sure visitors don’t bring in harmful germs.,
Don’t bring non-family pets around.",How to Care for Newborn Puppies3," Cutting the placenta before the elastic walls of the blood vessels have contracted down can make hemorrhage from the puppy more likely. Leave the placenta intact. It will soon dry up, contract down and break off., It is not necessary to apply disinfectant to the puppy’s belly button and placental stump. If the whelping box is kept adequately clean, the belly button should remain healthy., It is important to keep the whelping box clean after the puppies are born, but you also need to take care with not disturbing the nursing bitch very much. When the mother goes to relieve herself, remove soiled towels and replace them with clean ones. Throw away soiled newspaper and replace it at the earliest opportunity., The first few days of the puppies’ lives are crucial for developing a bond with their mother. Try to leave the dogs alone as much as possible in the first few days.


Limit your handling of the puppies in the first few days. Only handle the puppies when you need to clean out the box, which should happen from day 3 onward.

, Use your hand to feel the puppy’s body. A chilled puppy will feel cool or cool to the touch. It might also be non-responsive and very quiet. An overheated puppy will have red ears and tongue. It may also be unusually squirmy, which is the puppy’s best effort at getting away from any heat source.


A newborn's body temperature should be between 94-99 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature will rise to 100 degrees Fahrenheit at 2 weeks of age. You don’t need to take the dog’s temperature with a thermometer, however. Check with your veterinarian if you have concerns or questions.
If you are using a heat lamp, be sure to check the puppies regularly for flaky or red skin. Remove the lamp if this happens., Newborn puppies are not able to regulate their own body temperature, and they are prone to getting chilled. With mom not there you need to provide a heat source.Adjust the room temperature so that you are comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt.
Provide additional heat in the puppy’s box by placing a heating pad under the bedding. Set the heat to “low” to avoid the risk of overheating. As a newborn, the puppy cannot move away if it gets too hot., Use a postal scale to weigh each puppy every day for the first 3 weeks. Keep a record of each puppy’s weight so as to ensure that the puppies are well and getting enough nutrition. Disinfect the pan on the scale before you weight each puppy. Use a household disinfectant to clean the pan and then dry it off.


Watch for steady weight gain each day. Don’t panic, however, if a puppy fails to gain one day or even loses an ounce or two. As long as the puppy is lively and feeding, wait and weigh him again the next day. Call your vet if the puppy still hasn’t gained weight., Visitors coming to see the new puppies are the most likely to introduce infection. Their shoes or hands may carry bacteria or viruses.


Ask visitors to remove outdoor shoes before entering the room where the nursing bitch is.
Request that visitors thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before touching or handling the puppies. There should be limited touching or handling of the puppies., Other animals can carry illnesses and bacteria that can be risky for newborn puppies. Even the new mother can be vulnerable to illnesses, which can also further expose the puppies. Keep away animals that are not your own family pets for the first couple of weeks after the puppies are born."

It wriggles around to find its mother’s nipple and nurse. Some puppies may need a little help in learning how to latch on.To help the puppy, first wash and dry your hands. Pick up the puppy and place her against a nipple. The puppy may make exploratory movements with her mouth, but if she is not finding the nipple, gently guide her head so that her lips rest on the nipple.
You might need to squeeze a drop of milk from the teat. The puppy will smell it and should latch on.
If the puppy still doesn’t latch, gently insert a finger into the corner of her mouth to open the jaw slightly. Then place her open mouth over the teat and release your finger. The puppy should start suckling., Make a mental note of which puppies feed on which nipples. The rear teats produce more milk than those further forward. A puppy who nurses on a front teat may be getting less milk than a puppy who nurses on a rear teat.


If a puppy is not gaining weight at the same rate as the others, try to get the puppy to nurse on a rear teat instead., When a mother nurses her puppy, her body will produce milk. When nursing is reduced, milk production also reduces. If there is less milk production, there is a risk that the mother’s body will stop producing enough milk to provide ample nutrition to her babies.Only try bottle feeding if it is absolutely essential. This might occur if the puppy does not have enough physical strength to compete with its littermates to nurse. Another reason might be if the mother has birthed a large litter and has more puppies than teats.

, The mother will be reluctant to leave her newborns, so make sure she has easy access to food and water. Some bitches will not even move from the box for the first 2-3 days. In this case, offer food and water inside the box.The puppies will be able to observe the mother eating her food.

, The puppies will rely solely on mother’s milk for their nutrition for 3-4 weeks. Towards the end of this time, they may start investigating their mother's food, which is part of the weaning process. At this age, they are no longer considered newborns."

Be ready to provide 24-hour care.,
Purchase a milk substitute.,
Feed newborn puppies every 2 hours.,
Watch for signs that the puppy is hungry.,
Use a bottle and teat designed for use with puppies.,
Let the puppy eat until he stops feeding.,
Wipe the puppy’s face after each feeding.,
Sterilize all feeding equipment.,
Wipe the puppy’s bottom before and after each feeding.,
Start spacing feedings apart at 3 weeks.,
Check to make sure the puppies are warm enough.,
Adjust the room temperature.",How to Care for Newborn Puppies5," If you have to hand rear a puppy, be prepared to provide hard work and commitment, especially in the first 2 weeks of the puppy’s life. They will require 24-hour care in the beginning.You will probably need to take time off work to care for the puppies, as they will require near-constant care for the first 2 weeks.
Take this into consideration before breeding your bitch. If you can't commit to caring for orphan pups then don't breed the mother.

, If your puppies are orphans, you’ll need to provide them with a suitable replacement milk. The ideal is replacement bitch's milk. This comes in a powdered form (Lactol) that is reconstituted with boiled water (very similar to the way baby's formula is made).The supplement is available from your veterinary clinic or major pet stores.
Do not use cow's milk, goat's milk, or human infant formula. These are not suitable formulas for puppies.
You can temporarily use a mix of evaporated milk and boiled water while you search for proper bitch replacement milk. Use 4 parts canned evaporated milk to 1 part boiled water for a feed.

, Puppies need to suckle every 2 hours, which means that you need to feed them 12 times in 24 hours.


Follow the directions on the packaging to make up the milk substitute (typically 30 grams of powder is mixed with 105 ml of boiled water).

, A hungry puppy is a noisy puppy. He will squeal and whine, which would ordinarily summon his mother for nursing. If the puppy is wriggly and whiny, and it hasn’t eaten in 2-3 hours, it may well be hungry and should be fed.


The shape of his belly may also give you a clue. Because puppies have little body fat, when his stomach is empty, his belly will be flat or caved in slightly. When his stomach is full, his stomach will resemble a barrel., Teats designed for puppies are softer than ones designed for humans. These can be purchased from vet clinics and major pet stores.


In an emergency, you can use an eyedropper to feed milk to the puppy. However, this option should be avoided since there is a risk of giving the puppy too much air with the milk. This can cause his tummy to swell painfully., Follow the guidelines on the milk substitute packaging to determine approximately how much to feed the puppy. A good rule of thumb, however, is to allow the puppy to feed until he is no longer hungry. He will stop eating when he is full.The puppy will likely fall asleep and then demand the next meal when he is hungry again, or in about 2-3 hours.

, When the puppy is done feeding, wipe its face with cotton wool soaked in warm water. This mimics the bitch cleaning the puppy and reduces the risk of skin infections., Wash all equipment that you use for feeding the puppies and sterilize all of it. Use a liquid disinfectant designed for baby equipment, or a steam sterilizer.Alternately, you can boil the equipment in water.

, Newborn puppies do not urinate or defecate spontaneously but need to be stimulated to do so. The bitch usually performs this function by licking the puppy's perianal region (under the tail where the dog's anus is). This usually occurs before and after the puppy feeds.


Wipe the puppy's rear end with a pad of cotton wool soaked in warm water, before and after each feed. This should stimulate the puppy to release feces and urine. Wipe away any feces or urine that comes out., As the newborn puppy grows older, the stomach will get bigger and can hold more food. By the third week, feed the puppy every 4 hours or so.

, Use your hand to feel the puppy’s body. A chilled puppy will feel cool or col to the touch. It might also be non-responsive and very quiet. An overheated puppy will have red ears and tongue. It may also be unusually squirmy, which is the puppy’s best effort at getting away from any heat source.


A newborn's body temperature should be between 94-99 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature will rise to 100 degrees Fahrenheit at 2 weeks of age. You don’t need to take the dog’s temperature with a thermometer, however. Check with your veterinarian if you have concerns or questions.
If you are using a heat lamp, be sure to check the puppies regularly for flaky or red skin. Remove the lamp if this happens., Newborn puppies are not able to regulate their own body temperature, and they are prone to getting chilled. With Mom not there you need to provide a heat source.Adjust the room temperature so that you are comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt.
Provide additional heat in the puppy’s box by placing a heating pad under the bedding. Set the heat to “low” to avoid the risk of overheating. As a newborn, the puppy cannot move away if it gets too hot."

Your puppy should have a full examination to alert you to any potential health problems, as well as receive his vaccinations in a timely manner., Your new miniature schnauzer puppy will start to explore the moment you bring him home. To make sure he doesn’t hurt himself, you need to remove anything that could possibly be harmful. Any plants, especially toxic ones, should be removed from within reach of your puppy, as well as any chemicals, medicines, or other potential hazards. Also be sure to move any food that he could easily access.Be sure no exposed electrical cords are accessible by your new miniature schnauzer.
Clutter is appealing to puppies, particularly for chewing. Pick up any shoes, books, or other items that could easily be reached by your puppy.

, A baby gate is useful for confining your puppy to certain areas of your home, at least initially. Crates are good for sleeping and keeping your puppy safe while you leave the home for brief periods.Pet owners commonly keep puppies in the kitchen at first and place gates there. Kitchen floors are usually easier to clean than other areas.

, You can either choose a pillow-type one that will accommodate your puppy while he is small, or you could choose a larger one that will fit him when fully grown as well (between 13 and 15 inches).Providing your miniature schnauzer puppy with his own bed will help you train him that this is his space for sleeping (instead of in your bed or on other furniture).
It will be reassuring to your puppy for him to have a space that is exclusively for him., You will need to accept the fact that your puppy will have accidents. Urine stain and odor remover, puppy wipes, poop pick-up bags, and housebreaking pee pads are some essential items to have in your home when you are with a new puppy., You want to be as prepared as possible when you bring your miniature schnauzer puppy home, so get all of the basics ahead of time. For grooming, you will need puppy shampoo, a toothbrush, a nail file and clippers, and a brush. You will also need to get food and food bowls or dishes. Finally, dog toys and chews are essential because they will keep your puppy occupied and give him less time to chew on your furniture or other items.Your food bowls or dishes should be shallow, since miniature schnauzer puppies won’t be able to reach the bottom of deep ones.
A variety of toys, like rope toys, squeakers, and teething chews, will keep your puppy busy.

, In many areas, it is required by law that your dog be leashed and collared while outside, so it is essential that you have these on hand when you bring your puppy home. Additionally, your collar gives you a place to affix an ID tag, so that your dog can be returned to you if you ever are separated.A harness collar can be useful for your miniature schnauzer puppy, since it will give you a bit more control over him while out and about, and flexible leashes are convenient as you both learn to walk together.


An adjustable collar will grow with your puppy.
If you plan to take a lot of walks in the evening, you may want a harness with reflectors or one that is illuminated., Miniature Schnauzers love to run and chase animals outside, so a strong fence is imperative for keeping them safe."

Place all shoes and chewable items out of reach, install locks on cabinets containing harmful household chemicals, and bundle up and remove any exposed cords which could look like tempting chew toys. Also, ask that everyone in the house keep closet and outer doors closed when your new dog arrives so that it can’t get into any mischief or accidentally escape your home.You might know to keep bags of dog kibble tucked into locked cabinets or bins, but don’t forget that dogs—and especially puppies—are attracted to people foods as well! Don’t leave half-eaten bags of chips or candy out, and make sure that all kitchen items are stored out of reach from your canine companion. Dried fruit, chocolate, and allium vegetables like onions and garlic are particularly harmful to dogs, so be especially careful with these items.;
, Your new puppy needs a crate for many reasons. First of all, it will present them with a warm, safe “den” which they can retreat to when feeling tired, overwhelmed, or anxious. Secondly, it will help you to potty-train a breed known for being somewhat difficult when it comes to housebreaking.Make the crate an appealing place before your puppy’s arrival by installing a comfortable bed, chew toys, and a few treats inside.


You should select a well-ventilated crate big enough to allow your dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down when it reaches full, adult size. For an average shih tzu, expect an adult height of eight to eleven inches to the shoulder and weight of 9-16 pounds.Never leave a puppy younger than six months old in the crate for more than three to four hours at a time, and don’t ever use the crate as punishment. If you do, the puppy will associate the crate with negative emotions and will no longer perceive it as a restful, secure space., You should have food and water available to your new puppy the minute it enters the home, so make sure you purchase a set of dog bowls ahead of time. While you can find any number of ceramic or stoneware bowls on the market, stainless steel is your best option. It's dishwasher-safe, durable, and untainted with any lead-based paints or glazes.When you first bring your puppy home, you might want to feed it the food its shelter or breeder was feeding in order to ease the transition.

, Shih tzu puppies can go through particularly rough teething periods, so you’ll want to make this temporary phase as painless and damage-free as possible. Provide plenty of hard rubber toys so that your dog won’t take its teething frustration out on furniture and household items, and purchase special freezable toys in order to alleviate the pain of swollen gums.Avoid chewables like rawhide and bones, as these can splinter and be swallowed by your hapless pup.

, Even at full size, your shih tzu won’t be powerful enough to break away from an average leash, but you should still make sure that your walking supplies are sturdy and safe. Measure your puppy’s neck and get a collar which can be adjusted as the dog grows.Avoid choke-chains and collars with rings or other details which could snag on your puppy’s teeth and present a choking hazard.

, Whether you’re adopting from a shelter or purchasing from a breeder or pet store, you should obtain the proper records verifying your dog’s health, history, and any other relevant documentation like spay/neuter certification. You should also ask a shelter or store employee for any behavioral issues or history of abuse which could impact how you bring the animal into your home.For example, if you find out from the shelter that your puppy had a bad experience in an abusive or otherwise volatile foster home, you should take special pains to make your puppy’s transition peaceful and low-key. Keep music and household traffic to a minimum, and make sure your puppy’s crate sits in a dark room removed from outside disruptions and noise.

, You probably can't wait to take your new puppy home and start playing, but make sure you go to your local veterinarian first in order to get a check-up and vaccinations. Rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and canine hepatitis vaccines are all non-negotiable, and you should ask your vet if they recommend any additional vaccines, such as those for kennel cough or Lyme diseases.The wellness exam is particularly important if you purchased your puppy from a breeder, as most breeder contracts include this initial visit in your purchase as long as you do it within the first three days of ownership., Many people think that health insurance is only something to think about for people, but, in fact, it’s wise to insure your pet just as you would any family member. After all, veterinary costs can pile up quickly, leaving you with a hefty bill for your pint-sized pup. And, while puppies tend to suffer from fewer health problems than older dogs, the costs of covering your shih tzu when it’s older will be higher than starting a policy now.Most plans such as that offered by the ASPCA will cover illness and injury, but you can purchase additional coverage which can address genetic disorders, routine health care, or behavioral problems., Shih tzus can be difficult to housebreak, so you should start teaching proper potty procedures as soon as you bring your puppy into your home. Do this by covering specific areas in newspaper or disposable “piddle-pads” and praising the puppy when it pees or poops in these prescribed areas. Also stay close when you go outside in order to praise the puppy when it does its business outdoors. When it’s time for bed or you need to leave the puppy unsupervised for a short amount of time, put the puppy in its crate.If your crate is too large, you’ll have a harder time crate training and housebreaking your puppy. A puppy is unlikely to soil its sleeping area, but, if it can get up and walk away from the bed, it won’t be so particular about making a mistake., Shih tzus don’t need much outdoor exercise a day, as they’re small enough to get most of their daily exercise quota running around the house and furniture. That being said, you should play fetch, tug-of-war, and other fun games with your puppy in order to keep them engaged and healthy.You should also take your puppy on at least one brief walk per day. This lets your puppy sniff around and see the exciting world outside of your apartment or home, as well as get them used to diverse sounds and smells to which they wouldn’t normally be exposed.

, Shih tzus can be stubborn and slow learners if you wait too long to start training and socializing them, so get them into doggy kindergarten classes by ten- to twelve-weeks old. Take them to dog parks as soon as they can walk comfortably on the leash so that they'll tolerate other canine and human company without displaying troublesome behaviors like barking, jumping, and nipping.Make sure you do this only after your puppy has received all the necessary vaccinations in order to avoid catching any bugs from other dogs.

, Once your puppy has become acclimated to its new home, you should select a premium brand of dog kibble with multiple sources of protein for its daily diet. Look for good ingredients like fresh chicken, duck, egg, pea flour, oats, and rice, and avoid problematic ones like cereals, propylene glycol, corn, and animal fat.Due to their household status as a family member and lapdog, Shih tzus are particularly prone to fussy eating habits. If you give your puppy even a little bit of food from the table, it will quickly become accustomed to this people food and reject its kibble. You can avoid these bad habits by never giving your puppy scraps and discouraging begging behaviors., Even if your puppy doesn’t seem to overeat or have a developing weight problem, you should feed at prescribed times during the day rather than leaving the food bowl down.This will help to establish a healthy routine as well as prevent fussy eating habits.


You can—and should!—give your puppy treats in order to reward good behavior, but make sure these treats are small. This way they won’t interfere with your puppy’s meals and feeding schedule. Consider using individual kernels of your dog’s ordinary kibble and your puppy will be less likely to develop problematic preferences., Brushing and cleaning a puppy will only take a few minutes, but it’s important not to skip as it gets them accustomed to the sensations and routine of grooming. Use a mixed bristle and nylon brush to thoroughly comb through its coat and a small pair of scissors to trim long outgrowths or facial fur that impedes vision. If you keep up with this brushing regimen, you can wait for intervals of four to six weeks between trips to the professional groomer.Unless you’re trying to raise a show dog, you’ll probably want to give your dog what’s called a puppy cut; that is, a short, all-over style that trims your dog’s coat to one to two inches.
You can choose to grow your shih tzu’s coat long like show dogs, but be prepared for more demanding grooming commitments."

Supervise interactions with other dogs.",How to Care for a Rottweiler Puppy," Since there are many differences between dog breeds, it's important to determine if a Rottweiler is right for you. As with any breed, Rottweilers have their own distinct personality traits and breed-specific characteristics. The better you understand Rottweilers, the more aware you will be about the potential challenges related to raising a Rottweiler and how to react appropriately. These puppies become large dogs (around 110 pounds as adults) that are fiercely loyal to their owners and initially wary of strangers.Rottweilers need firm guidance from someone who understand dog psychology and behavior, so it helps to be an experienced dog owner with a history of raising good-natured dogs. The potential owner needs to be honest about whether she possesses these skills. Because of a Rottweiler's physical size, a cross Rottweiler who won't get off the sofa when you ask, is a dangerous Rottweiler.
To learn more about Rottweilers, go to local dog shows and talk to breeders and other Rottweiler owners.Don't forget to check your homeowner's insurance policy. Some insurance policies are void if you get a Rottweiler or any other breed they have labeled as potentially dangerous, even if this labelling is erroneous.If you rent your home, you will need to contact your landlord before adopting a Rottweiler (or any other animal for that manner) to make sure he is welcome.;
, Since there are many Rottweiler breeders, you'll need to take your time to select a quality breeder. Never choose the first breeder you find. Instead, look for a breeder who does all the appropriate health-screenings like the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals screenings for hip, heart, and eye health. To be sure of what you're getting, check for both conformation (show lines) and working ability (Schutzhund or tracking for example) since these show that the puppies look and act like Rottweilers.Ask any potential breeder plenty of questions, especially about early socialization with the mother and litter mates. It is crucial that the puppy is well socialized and exposed to other people, places, and noises before coming home as these early experiences will help them to be confident well-adjusted adults. Be prepared for the breeder to ask you questions about what you're looking for.

, Give yourself plenty of time to make a decision about which puppy to take home. You should immediately make sure the puppies and mother are healthy. Then, spend time watching for individual personalities. You won't want to choose a Rottweiler that's timid (since he could become a fearful biter) nor overly aggressive. Look for a puppy that is friendly, approachable, and plays well with his litter mates., Before you bring your puppy home or expose him to other dogs, make sure he's up to date with his vaccinations and de-worming treatments. Distemper shots should start at 6 weeks old with a booster shot about 2 weeks later. After these initial life-saving vaccines are given, you can begin socializing your puppy outside the immediate household. Just remember to take your puppy to the vet for vaccine boosters every year.Rottweilers are more susceptible to the parvovirus, a potentially life-threatening illness that causes vomiting and diarrhea.
Check local laws to determine a rabies vaccine requirement. Most rabies vaccines are started at 12 weeks old and Lyme disease vaccines begin at 9 weeks followed by a booster 3 to 4 weeks later.

, Local humane societies or your veterinarian can insert a microchip below your Rottweiler's skin. This can help someone return your puppy to you or an animal shelter if he runs off. You should also put an identifying collar around your puppy's neck. It should include your contact information.Talk with your vet about spaying or neutering your puppy, which will prevent unwanted litters and which can offer health benefits.


Spaying female puppies can reduce stress and discomfort usually experienced when she's in heat, eliminate the risk of mammary and uterine cancer, and prevents unwanted litters.
Neutering male puppies can reduce the chances of roaming, fighting, and testicular cancer.

, Take your Rottweiler for at least two 30 minute walks every day. These large breed dogs need a lot of exercise to release energy and stay healthy.If your puppy is under six months old, make sure he has four or five play or exercise periods each day. As your puppy gets older, you can start going on longer walks or hikes.


Give your Rottweiler toys that stimulate him and keep his mind active. Preventing boredom can also keep your Rottweiler from getting into mischief. Try giving him toys that can be stuffed with food or treats.

, Luckily, Rottweilers have short hair that makes grooming simple. Brush your puppy once a week using a soft bristled brush. This will keep his coat healthy and sleek. At this time, you should also check his paws to make sure his nails are short and the pads aren't damaged. Check between each toe for raw or red spots and look over his skin for lumps or bumps. If you find anything out of the ordinary, talk to your vet.Keep bathing to a minimum. Washing with shampoo can break down the protective oil in your puppy's skin. When you do occasionally bathe your puppy, use a dog shampoo. It's not as drying as human shampoo or dish soap.

, Ask your vet to recommend a high-quality food for your Rottweiler. When choosing a commercial dog food, look for one that lists meat (not meat by-products) as one of the first ingredients listed. Meat by-products are fine to feed but they should be lower down the list. Choose a food especially formulated for large breed puppies. These have the proper ratio of nutrients to build the strong skeletal system these large dogs need.Take care to only feed your puppy after he's exercised. If you feed him before, your Rottweiler is at risk of gastric bloat and intestinal twisting.These are serious conditions that can kill your puppy. Instead, wait at least 60 minutes after exercising or four hours before exercising to feed your puppy.

, You may want to begin by crate training to prevent accidents in the house. Buy a crate that's sized for a large breed dog and place your puppy's blanket or bed inside the crate, along with a few treats. Leave the door open throughout the day so your puppy can explore it. Start feeding your puppy his food inside the crate and close the door when he is eating. When he is finished, he may whine or cry to get out but do not let him until he quiets down so that he begins to associate the crate with quiet time.Never leave your puppy in the crate for more than an hour or two. The crate shouldn't become seen as a punishment. Never leave an adult dog in the crate for more than four to six hours.

, Make a structured routine of times to take your puppy outside to potty. For example, you might take him outside to potty first thing in the morning, after meals or play time, and right before bedtime. Always praise your puppy so he will associate going potty outside and good behavior with pleasing you. You should also watch for signs that your puppy needs to potty and immediately take him outside. Puppies will often sniff, pace, pant, bark or run around the urge strikes.


Avoid punishing your puppy for accidents inside the house. Just ignore it, clean it up, and try again next time. Never rub your Rottweiler's nose in his mess. It's cruel and may cause your puppy to hide future accidents., Puppies benefit from early interaction with new life situations, other dogs, and humans.From birth until about 3 ½ weeks, your puppy needs to be around other puppies and his mother in order to learn normal dog socialization. From the age of three weeks to twelve weeks your puppy is accepting of new experiences so it's a good time to expose your puppy to as many new (but safe) situations as possible: car rides, the outdoors, other pets and animals, humans of various ages and sizes, etc.


If your puppy was taken away from his mother and littermates at birth and raised alone, he may adapt poorly and have a high chance of aggression towards other dogs., Watch your puppy to make sure he's comfortable with socializing. Certain experiences can overwhelm a puppy and make him frightened. If a situation causes a fearful reaction, gradually introduce him to this experience to give him time to adapt to it. Use your judgement and never force your puppy to remain in a situation or near someone that frightens him. Instead, immediately remove and distract him with a toy or treat.Once your puppy is 12 to 18 weeks old, he'll become more cautious in new situations. This is a normal development that helps your puppy learn to be cautious when on his own.

, One of the best ways for your puppy to interact with others is through puppy socialization class.At class, your puppy will be exposed to other puppies, people, dogs and a variety of sights, sounds, smells, and equipment. It will also give you a chance to learn training and socialization skills while giving you an opportunity to bond with your Rottweiler.


Ask your veterinarian to recommend classes or sign up with community education centers or large pet stores.
It's normal to feel overwhelmed by puppy parenthood which will take time, patience, and effort. Things will soon settle into a routine and it may be helpful to talk with others going through the same challenges.

, Since you never know how your puppy will react to other puppies or dogs, always monitor him in social situations. If it looks like your puppy is no longer playing, but is defensive, step in and stop the behavior before he starts fighting. For example, if one puppy is biting another, you should step inespecially if the biting puppy is shaking his head and pinning the other to the ground.Make sure both puppies are calm. Then, you can reward them and let them keep playing.


Be prepared to quickly step in and stop fighting. It may help to have toys to distract, keep your puppy on a leash, or blast an air horn.
Start basic training from an early age, but make it fun. It is crucial that your Rottweiler is properly trained.

Give the puppy a worming product after 2 weeks.,
Wait until the puppy is 6 weeks old before applying flea treatment.,
Start immunizing the puppies at 6 weeks.",How to Care for Newborn Puppies6," Dogs can carry worms and other parasites that can cause health problems, so it is recommended that you treat them with worming medicine as soon as the puppy is old enough. There are no worming products that are recommended for newborn puppies. However, fenbendazole (Panacur) is suitable from 2 weeks of age.


Panacur comes as a liquid wormer that can be gently syringed into the puppy's mouth after a meal of milk. For each 1 kilogram of body weight, the dose is 2 ml daily by mouth. Give the wormer once a day for 3 days.

, Flea treatments should never be applied to a newborn puppy. Most flea treatment products recommend a minimum weight and age for use, and there is currently no product that is suitable for newborns.


Puppies should be at least 6 weeks old before you can apply selamectin (Stronghold in the UK and Revolution in the US).
Puppies should be at least 8 weeks old and over 2 kilograms before you can apply fipronil (Frontline).

, Puppies acquire a certain level of immunity from their mother, but they need additional immunization to keep them healthy. Check with your veterinarian for an appropriate immunization schedule.

Exercise your puppy daily.",How to Care for a Miniature Schnauzer Puppy2," Your puppy will be happy to be offered the same type of food he is already accustomed to eating. You can slowly introduce a new type over a few weeks.Your veterinarian will be able to offer suggestions regarding appropriate food options for your puppy.

, Miniature schnauzer puppies need to consume approximately 400 calories each day. Check the packaging to see how much this would be of the kibble you are using and measure the appropriate amount. Additionally, keep a steady supply of fresh drinking water available for your puppy.Feed your puppy two or three times a day at the same time.
Let your puppy eat for about 10–15 minutes at a time, and then discard the uneaten portion. You don’t want to leave it out or your puppy can overeat.
Your veterinarian will be able to check your puppy’s growth at visits and let you know whether you are over- or underfeeding him.

, Miniature schnauzer puppies are high energy and can gain weight quickly if they are not exercised enough.They love walks and also enjoy agility courses. A 15 to 25 minute walk or a game of catch for the same amount of time is typically enough exercise for a miniature schnauzer puppy.Miniature schnauzers can develop behavior problems, such as barking or being temperamental, if they do not receive enough exercise.
Since miniature schnauzers are prone to developing diabetes, regular exercise is essential for their long-term health.

Think about the benefits of a dog bed.,
Consider a crate.,
Choose the right size.,
Think about where your dog will be sleeping.,
Consider cleanup.,
Don’t skimp on quality.",How to Choose a Place for Your Dog to Sleep1," Buying a bed for your dog to sleep in has multiple benefits. A bed provides much needed cushion and insulation for your pet. A dog bed also controls odors and hair, keeping both at bay by providing a centralized and personal space for your dog to rest. A dog bed can also discourage your dog from curling up on the couch or other off-limits furniture., While not everyone will choose to crate their dog, there are substantial benefits to providing your dog with a crate. A crate provides your dog with a safe place to sleep. It is a place your dog will feel comfortable, find solitude, and can rest safely. A crate is also a secure place for your dog to rest or sleep while you are out of the house or asleep., Whether your dog will sleep on a bed or in a crate, it is important that his bed, crate, or pad is the appropriate size. Your dog should be able to stretch out completely on their bed, as it is necessary that the bed support them while they are in any position. Try choosing a bed, crate, or pad that is at least 5 inches longer and wider than the dog itself., When you buy a bed or crate pad for your dog, you should consider exactly where the dog will be sleeping. For example, if your dog sleeps outside or in a basement, you should purchase a bed or pad that is resistant to mold, moisture, and fungus. These environmental hazards can cause health concerns for your dog if present on its bed., When choosing a bed or crate pad for your dog, you should think about how easy it will be to clean. Think about how difficult it will be to remove hair from the bed or pad, as well as how easy it will be to clean up accidents your dog might have. When possible, choose a bed or crate pad with a water-resistant cover that will make cleanup a breeze., It is important that you consider the quality of the bed or pad you purchase for your pooch. Cheaper quality beds and pads tend to not be as supportive as their higher quality counterparts. You should also consider your dog’s bed as a long-term investment.

Put up gates to areas your puppy should not go, pick up any chewable things that you do not want to be destroyed, and put away any delicate or fragile things that can be knocked over or stained.While you house train your puppy, consider keeping them in a room where it will be easy to clean up their messes. A room with tile, like a kitchen or bathroom, would be ideal.

, Different breeds of dogs have different behavioral traits and temperaments. Be sure to understand what kind of tendencies your puppy will exhibit. That way you know what to expect and can prepare accordingly. Frustrations will arise when your puppy’s bad behavior surprises you. Working with your dog’s natural tendencies, instead of against them, will make your life much easier.If your puppy is a more high-energy breed, expect it to be more rambunctious and destructive. You will likely want to exercise it frequently to help curb its energetic nature.
If you are unsure about your dog’s temperament, consult your veterinarian.

, While you are training your dog, you need to be consistent. For example, if you are trying to crate train your dog, they should only sleep in the crate. Do not allow them to sleep in your bed or anywhere else. The only way your dog will learn the correct behavior is through repetition and consistency. Being consistent will make training much easier and less stressful for you and the puppy., Because dogs are so sensitive to our tones, it is important that you try to stay upbeat and not get frustrated. An angry tone can erode your puppy’s confidence and make it timid and scared, which can cause training to be a chore.

This is the area where you keep the puppies bedding, food, and toys. Because puppies can get overwhelmed if given too much space, you should consider limiting your puppy to just a few roomsConsider keeping your puppy in a room, such as a kitchen or a bathroom, where it will be easy to clean up any messes.

The vet will inform you about any congenital conditions that your dog may have due to its breed. They will also run through what to expect during the pregnancy and tell you how you can help. Later on the in the pregnancy, you may want to have the veterinarian do an ultrasound to check on the puppies. This will also give you an idea of how many to expect.Do not vaccinate your dog during pregnancy, which can hurt the unborn puppies.

, It is important that you create a safe space for your dog to give birth. A whelping box will create a den-like atmosphere that will help your dog feel more secure and comfortable. You can construct the box out of most materials just as long as it is easy for your dog to access, big enough for your dog and in a quite location.You may want to cover the box with a blanket once your do has had her puppies. This may make the box feel more like a den.
Because the birth can be messy, consider keeping the whelping box in a the garage or other place that is easy to clean.

, Typically, your dog should be able to nurse the puppies once they are born. However, she may have issues providing enough milk. This will require that you hand feed the puppies.

Guide dogs assist individuals who are blind and visually impaired navigate in their daily lives. These dogs help their owners by leading them both outside and inside, communicating sources of danger, and following commands.
Service dogs assist individuals with disabilities that are physical and psychiatric. They can be trained to work with individuals who have mobility impairments, are in wheelchairs, have autism, have PTSD, have diabetes, and more.The most common breeds for guide and service dogs are Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds.;
, Many service and guide dog organizations use puppy raisers to raise dogs that will become service and guide animals. Depending on your country, there may be dozens of organizations to choose from.


Puppy raisers work as volunteers with a variety of organizations that provide assistance dogs to individuals with physical and psychiatric disabilities.
If there is a particular cause that you are interested in, such as helping individuals with visual impairments or veterans who suffer from PTSD, you can identify organizations that provide service animals to these individuals.
If you are willing to support different causes, you may find that there is a larger variety of organizations for you to choose from.

, In order to be accepted as a volunteer, you will need to meet the requirements of each specific organization.


You must be 18 years old to become a puppy raiser. If you are under the age of 18, you must have a parent or legal guardian co-sign the puppy raiser application.Many organizations prefer that you reside within a certain geographical area to volunteer for the organization. For example, Hero Dogs, which provides service dogs to veterans, requires that puppy raisers live in the greater Baltimore/Washington D.C. metropolitan area to qualify.Most organizations will prefer to see that you’ve raised dogs in the past. If you have never had a dog as a pet before, or have never raised and trained a dog before, puppy raising may not be right for you.

, Organizations that are accepting applications for puppy raising volunteers will ask you to provide background information about you, your familiarity with raising dogs, and your home life.


There may be a waitlist for volunteers who want to raise puppies for the organization. Raising and training a service animal is very expensive, some organizations estimate that it costs upwards of $30,000 USD, and the organization may not have full financing in place to complete training. The organization also works carefully with breeders, so there may not be a litter of puppies available yet.Some organizations will ask you to complete a self-assessment before submitting an application. This assessment will ask you to consider whether you are prepared to raise a puppy by asking questions about your finances, occupation, home life, family, training abilities, and familiarity with dogs.Most general volunteer applications will ask background questions about you, your ability to train dogs, and your expectations of the program.
Once you apply, you may have to complete in-home interviews with organization representatives.

, If you have applied and been accepted as a puppy raiser, you can begin to share the news with people that are close with you. If you are a parent who has kept this decision from your children, now is the time to tell them.


You may have made the decision to become a puppy raiser with your children. Some parents decide to wait so their children aren’t disappointed if their application isn’t accepted. This is a personal choice that should be made with your family in mind, but you will need to prepare your children for the arrival of the puppy if you are accepted.
Let your family and friends know that you are raising a puppy for an assistance dog organization. If they have raised dogs before, they may have invaluable advice to share, gently used items they can give you, or they may want to help financially support you in your decision.

, Puppy raising takes a tremendous commitment of your time, resources, and energy. If you don’t think that you can commit to being a full time puppy raiser there are other ways you can participate in the dog’s training with an organization.


You can volunteer as a puppy sitter. Puppy sitters interact with puppies in the organizations when their foster families are out of town or temporarily unable to care for the dog.
You can sponsor a puppy by providing resources to the family that is raising the puppy and support its training.
You can provide a scholarship to a puppy, which covers the cost of its official training.You can support the organization financially. You may not be able to interact with the dogs but you will know that your donation has a positive impact on the lives of others.

, The goal of the puppy raising program is to socialize, train, and ready a puppy to go through formal service dog training. You may have this puppy in your home for over a year, but you must give the puppy back to the organization.


You will form strong attachments to this puppy. It can be difficult to give the puppy back to the organization after having it in your home for so long.
Many organizations will ask you to sign a form stating that you will return the puppy before you receive the dog. This is to protect the organization and the investment that they have made in the puppy and its training.
Once you have been selected to raise a puppy, you will need to begin to prepare for the puppy’s arrival.

, Like small children, puppies are curious and can get into a lot of trouble if they are left free to roam. Pet proofing your home will keep the dog and your belongings safe.


Put child locks on low cabinets, especially those that contain food and medicine that can be harmful to your dog.Buy child gates that you can use to block off certain areas of your home. For example, it can be helpful to buy a gate that keeps the puppy on the lower floor of your home or in an area that does not have carpet.
Move electrical wires, clothing, children’s toys, shoes, and household plants out of reach. Puppies like to chew on whatever they can and by keeping commonly chewed items out of their reach, you can help to lessen the temptation to chew.

, Puppies are a financial investment and can become expensive, especially if you are already on a tight budget. Check with your organization to see if they provide financial support to volunteer puppy raisers.


Check to see whether your organization sponsors puppies and if they provide for medical expenses. They may or may not provide you with a stipend for the items the puppy needs like food and medicine.
Some organizations collect donations from individuals who want to participate in the dog’s training but are unable to care for the puppy. They may offer “scholarships” or “sponsorships” where individuals will give money to help raise the dog. If the organization does not provide you with a stipend during your time raising the puppy, you will need to budget accordingly to pay for the dog’s food, any items you need, veterinary expenses, and transportation costs to and from training.

, If you have another dog at home, you may not need to purchase as many items that you would if you have never had a dog before. The organization may provide you with some of these items, but you will most likely need to purchase them.


Purchase food, grooming items like shampoo and a brush for their coat, dog collar, a puppy crate, dog bed, toys, and bowls for their food and water.
Ask your friends and family that have dogs if they have any gently used dog items that you can borrow or have. Items like dog beds and toys can be cleaned and reused with a new puppy. This can lessen the financial impact of the new puppy.
Some items will need to be replaced as the puppy grows. For example, puppies will typically need a special puppy collar that is much smaller than a regular dog collar. As the dog grows, you will need to purchase a larger collar., Many service dog organizations will encourage you to take your puppy to work so that it can be socialized. You should let the homeowner know, if you do rent your home, that you will have a new pet living there.


If you are renting your home or apartment, you should let your landlord know that you are fostering a puppy. There may be a small increase in your rent that your landlord will use if there happens to be any damage caused to the rental by the puppy.
Share with your employer that you are fostering a puppy for a service dog organization. Your new puppy is not a service dog yet, so your employer has the right to deny your request to have the puppy accompany you to work. If they do allow you to bring the puppy to your workplace, you should consider bringing the dog a few times a week to socialize it.
Many service dog organizations will prefer that there is one individual in the household that works from home or is a stay at home parent. This is so the puppy is not left alone for significant amounts of time. If you are unable to accommodate this, you may be able to request a puppy sitter to come spend time with the puppy while you work.

, When your application to be a puppy raiser is accepted, the organization may not have a new litter of puppies available to give to puppy raisers. You may have to wait several weeks or months before your puppy arrives.


If you do have to wait, you have an opportunity to educate yourself on training practices, to purchase items, save money, and to puppy proof your home.
Service dog organizations work closely with breeders to get puppies that are the right breed and temperament for service work. They may have a litter of puppies available almost immediately, which will speed up the process.
Most organizations will give puppies to raisers when they are at 8 weeks old. The organization will ask you to raise the puppy for a certain length of time, usually around 14 months, before returning the dog. This timeline may be longer or shorter depending on how well you are able to train and socialize the dog., Your service dog organizations may or may not provide for veterinary care, but it is important to take the new puppy to the vet right away. This is to ensure that the puppy is healthy and is up to date on their vaccinations.


Establish a good relationship with your veterinarian. This individual will be an important contact for your and your puppy throughout the puppy raising process. If you are having trouble finding a vet in your area, ask the organization for any referrals or recommendations that they have.
Let them know that the puppy is part of a service dog training process. They may have recommendations for training classes in your area or know of other patients who are part of a similar program that you can connect with.

, Like all puppies, your new puppy will need to be taught to refrain from urinating and defecating in the house. House training can be a frustrating process, but it is essential to ensure that the puppy is house trained as soon as possible.


The American Kennel Club emphasizes that a regular feeding scheduling, regular trips outside, regular exercise, and positive reinforcement for good house trained behaviors are all helpful in house training.Regular feeding is important both for your puppy’s health but can also help you to schedule their bathroom trips outside. When you consistently feed your puppy at the same time each day, you will notice that the dog will need to defecate a few hours afterwards. This can help you plan when to take the dog outside.
Positive reinforcement is an important step in training to reinforce good behaviors. Praising the dog, giving them pets, and giving them treats are all good ways to encourage them to continue going to the bathroom outside.
Accidents will happen. It can take a few weeks, or longer, for a puppy to become fully house trained. Purchase cleaning products that will remove urine and feces from hardwood and carpet flooring. Clean the spot where the dog has an accident very well and try to prevent it from happening again.

, Obedience training is absolutely essential in potential service dogs. If your puppy fails to understand and respond to basic commands, it won’t pass any of the formal training that the organization requires. Set aside 15 minutes a few times a day to devote to formal training exercises.


Teaching a puppy to sit is a good first obedience command. Bend down on your puppy’s level and hold a small treat in your hand. Raise your hand with the treat in it. The puppy’s head will raise as their bottom lowers to the ground to follow the treat. Say the word “sit” so the behavior is paired with a verbal command. Give the dog the treat and continue to repeat the exercise over time until the dog is able to sit on command.Teaching the puppy to stay is another good command for them to master early on. Staying can be difficult for puppies and young dogs to follow so it may take more repeated practice than other commands. Have the dog sit down with you in front of them. Tell the dog to stay, and take a few steps backwards. Do not allow the dog to follow you forward and give them a small reward for staying put.
You will need to teach the puppy to master basic commands like sit, stay, down, and to walk on a leash before you can move on to more complicated training tasks.

, If you have less familiarity with training dogs, or feel that you would like more help in training this puppy, obedience classes can be a great way to reinforce your training.


The organization may require that you attend weekly training classes for the puppy. This is one reason that the organization may require that you live in a certain geographic area, so you will need to plan to take the puppy to these classes regularly.
Sign up for an obedience class through your local pet store or shelter. This can be a great way to supplement your training at home and to get the advice of a professional dog trainer. This is also a good way to get the puppy used to interacting with unfamiliar dogs and people.When the puppy has learned basic commands, it is helpful to practice these commands in environments that are louder and have more distractions present. Service dogs will need to obey commands consistently and reliably in environments that can be very distracting, so practicing these behaviors early on can be very helpful.

, The organization will have certain standards for the training of their puppies so it is important to follow the schedule or command checklist that they give you.


Assistance Dog International (ADI) is one of the largest and most reputable organizations that acts as a governing board for member organizations and advocates for the legal rights of individuals with assistance dogs. They set quality standards for the training of assistance dogs.According to the ADI, assistance dogs must follow the commands of their owners 90% of the time. You should expect to spend several hours each week training your puppy or taking them to training classes so they can begin to reach this standard.
Many organizations will require puppy raisers to attend monthly meetings with an organization representative to keep everyone engaged in the training process.

, Puppy raisers do not have the same legal access rights that service dogs do. This means that you cannot take the puppy everywhere that a service dog is allowed. Despite this, socializing the puppy is an important part of raising a service dog.


Take the puppy with you to areas where dogs are allowed. Let the dog interact with other dogs, children, and adults. Reinforce positive behavior when the dog acts appropriately with others and make sure to correct for negative behavior.
Spend as much time as possible with your dog. Future guide dogs must become used to spending nearly all of their time with people. The more comfortable they are with other people, the better chance the dog has of becoming a service dog.
Expose the puppy to new experiences so they become used to new people, new distractions, and new environments. Puppies are explorative and curious by nature, so your puppy will probably enjoy the socialization process.

, After a set amount of time, you will have to return the puppy to the organization so the dog can go through more formal training. This can be a challenging thing to do, but you will know that you have been an integral part of preparing this dog for a life as a service animal.


Not all puppies raised by volunteers will complete formal training. In fact, a significant percentage of dogs selected by the organization will not become formal service animals. This can be for a variety of reasons like lack of training, a health issue, or poor temperament.If the dog is not selected for guide dog service, you may be able to ask the organization if you can adopt the dog as your pet. This will depend upon the organization, and you should not go into the process assuming that you will be able to keep the dog.

Leave newborn puppies with their mother.,
Keep the area clean.,
Check in regularly.",How to Bathe a Newborn Puppy1," Mothers usually care for newborn puppies including keeping them very clean. If at all possible leave the bathing of a newborn puppy to its mother for the first four weeks.


Newborn puppies do not really need to be bathed at all, so resist the urge to try to bathe them.;
, Make sure to keep the space for the mother and puppies clean.Line the space with newspapers, cloth, or towels and change them regularly.
Use a material that does not contain dyes or chemicals.
The mother will take care of all the feeding and removing waste for the first month or so. Just give her a nice clean space.

Make the bathing area a positive space.Before giving your puppy his first bath, play with him in the bath or sink a few times without any water.,
Introduce water slowly.Once the puppy's familiar with the bathing area when it's dry, start getting him used to the idea of water.,
Buy a shampoo formulated for dogs.Dogs and humans have very different skin needs, so you can't use human shampoo for your pup.,
Prepare the bathing area.Place a clean, wet washcloth on the bottom of the sink/bath so the pup won't slip when it's filled with soapy water.,
Dress appropriately.You don't want to ruin an nice outfit with water, dog hair, and shampoo.,
Foresee potential distractions.,
Gather your supplies.,
Brush out the puppy's coat.Mats and tangles are easier to remove when the coat is dry, so do this before the bath.,
Make the puppy as comfortable as possible.,
Take a deep breath and relax.",How to Bathe a Puppy for the First Time1," Go slowly and convince your puppy that a bath is a good thing. He may not adjust to the water as quickly as you might've thought. Your pup might not enjoy the bath the first few 20 times, but don't give up! You can do this. Make your pup think of water as a game and not as it's enemy. Give him treats and lots of praise — make sure he thinks of it as a fun place. Give him free reign to sniff and investigate to his heart's content.


Take a few days to let him get used to the area. He should be completely comfortable in the bathing area before his first bath.
If the puppy is very small, choose the kitchen sink as a bathing location. It will be more comfortable for both of you.;
, Run the water while he's not in the tub or sink to get him acclimated to the sound. Splash a little water on him to show him it's nothing to fear. Once he's comfortable enough, fill the tub or sink with a little water and play with him in it. Use plenty of treats and praise, and never rush a puppy who seems hesitant or fearful.

, Using human shampoo will dry out his skin and leave him vulnerable to bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Buy a nice mild Oatmeal shampoo specially formulated for dogs at the pet store instead.

, You can also use a non-skid mat. A puppy who thinks he may fall will be fearful and uncooperative.

, Instead, dress in comfortable clothes that need to be washed anyway. Expect them to get wet and dirty, as there may be wet cuddles and frequent shakes from the puppy. Pull hair into a high bun or ponytail. Remove all makeup and chemicals from the face to make sure your cute puppy doesn't splash all the makeup onto the counter or even dirty the water and dye your pup's fresh coat.


Your bathroom may also get wet, so be prepared for that as well.

, You don't want to get pulled away by something that needs your attention in the middle of the bath. Make sure other pets or children are supervised, that nothing's cooking in the oven or stove, and you're not expecting an important call or visit.

, Before you bring the puppy into the bathing area, make sure you've lined up all your tools. You'll need your dog shampoo, a cup or jug to help with rinsing, and lots of towels. You should also keep treats on hand to help your puppy connect the bath with a positive experience. Also keep a hairdryer if your pooch needs an extra drying process because of it's thick coat. , Using a dog comb, gently tease out mats and tangles, making sure not to tug on his fur and cause pain. Be patient and remember to give lots of praise. Your puppy needs to get used to grooming!

, He should have recently gone to the bathroom, so he doesn’t feel bladder or bowel pressure. The temperature in the house should be warm enough to keep him from feeling too cold when soaked. The bathwater itself should be lukewarm — less than what you would find comfortable in your own bath.Test the water the way you would a baby bath, using your wrist or elbow. If it feels warm enough for your own bath, it's too hot for a puppy!
The water level should reach about half the dog's height to prevent any chance of drowning.

, The very idea of bathing an anxious, excitable puppy may stress you out. If you're stressed, your puppy will pick up on your emotions! The calmer you stay (as the puppy's ""pack leader""), the calmer he'll be. Put on some calming, quiet music to soothe yourself and lead by example. Make sure to use a happy, calm voice to reassure the puppy that you are there and all is well.


Waiting until any children are out of the house might be a good idea. Giggling and screeching may stress the puppy out.
At the very least, don't let anyone tease him during bath time, or he'll learn that bathing is something to be feared.

Commercial dog food formulated specifically for dogs with kidney disease are available.You could also prepare a homemade diet for your dog.


Feeding a homemade diet requires a large time commitment and careful attention to nutrient balance. If you would like to make a homemade diet, work with your vet or a veterinary nutritionist to develop the diet.Ask your vet questions about your dog’s new diet: What nutrients will my dog need? Will my dog need to eat less food? Which brands of dog food should I consider? Will this diet be the only food my dog can eat?;
, Restricting protein is key to feeding an older dog with kidney disease. Feeding less protein will keep the kidneys from working so hard.Look for diets that have a high-quality protein source, such as chicken.Kidney diets usually have about 1/3 to 1/2 less protein than normal dog diets.Low-protein diets tend to be less flavorful and more expensive than normal dog diets.Severe protein restriction can lead to other health complications, such as protein malnutrition, and make your dog feel worse.Your vet can advise you on how much protein your dog will need.
Low-protein commercial diets also contain other important nutrients, including fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins and minerals.

, Your dog, and its kidneys, will need time to adjust to the new diet. Transition your dog to the new diet over at least one to two weeks.Start by mixing in a small amount of the new diet with the old diet.


Every few days, increase the amount of new diet until your dog is eating only the new diet.

, Your dog may not be thrilled with the low-protein diet. However, your dog will need to eat the diet so it gets all the nutrients it needs. If your dog doesn’t like one low-protein diet, try feeding it a different one.You can also try a few other strategies to encourage eating:Serve several small meals a day, rather than two large meals.
Warm the food in the microwave to make the food smell better.
Add some tasty food, such as a small dollop of cottage cheese or yogurt, on top of the diet.
If nothing works, talk to your vet about giving your dog an appetite stimulant.

, If your dog stops eating, or starts eating less, contact your vet right away. Your vet may need to place a feeding tube in your dog, which will allow your dog to receive nutrients directly into its gastrointestinal (GI) tract.Kidney disease can cause digestive upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that will make a dog not feel like eating., When your dog eats a low-protein diet, your vet will need to keep a close watch on your dog’s blood protein levels.If your dog’s blood protein levels are too low, the protein restriction may be too severe. If they’re too high, you may need to feed your dog a diet containing even less protein.

, Certain minerals (phosphorus, sodium, potassium, calcium) need to be kept at proper levels to slow kidney disease progression in older dogs. Excess phosphorus can cause other health problems, so phosphorus restriction is important in a kidney disease diet. Phosphate binders ‘trap’ phosphorus in the GI tract, preventing absorption.Commercial kidney diets usually contain reduced amounts of phosphorus.Your vet will monitor your dog’s phosphorus levels and let you know if your dog needs a phosphate binder.

, Too much sodium can be bad for the kidneys, especially when they are already damaged. Commercial kidney diets are low in sodium.Sodium shouldn’t be restricted too much, though, since too little sodium can lead to dehydration, which can worsen your dog’s kidney disease.Do not feed your dog table scraps, because they can be high in sodium., Potassium levels are usually low in older dogs with kidney disease, in part because a lot of potassium is lost through the urine.If your dog’s potassium levels are too low, your vet will recommend giving your dog a potassium supplement.Low potassium is more common in cats with kidney disease than dogs with the disease., In older dogs with kidney disease, calcium levels can change in response to changes in phosphorus levels. Calcium levels can increase, decrease, or stay the same. Your vet will keep a close watch on your dog’s calcium levels and determine if you need to make any dietary adjustments for your dog.Calcitriol has been recommended as a calcium supplement for dogs with kidney disease. However, there is no consensus among veterinarians that calcitriol is beneficial for dogs with this disease., Because dogs with kidney disease urinate more often, they can lose a lot of vitamins B and C in their urine. Fortunately, commercial kidney diets contain extra amounts of these vitamins.However, if your dog is not eating very well, it may need vitamin supplements.Talk with your vet to determine if your dog needs vitamin supplements.

, As your dog’s kidney disease progresses, its nutritional needs will change.By monitoring your dog’s blood work over time, your vet will be able to determine if any nutrient levels are too high or too low and recommend necessary dietary changes.


Monitoring blood work is very important if you are feeding your dog a homemade diet.

, In addition to feeding your dog a good diet, you will also need to keep it well hydrated. Adequate hydration is essential to caring for an older dog with kidney disease. Give your dog a constant supply of fresh, clean water.As your dog's kidney disease progresses, your dog may be unable to drink enough water on its own to stay hydrated. At this point, you may need give your dog subcutaneous fluids, which are injected under the skin., Kidney disease can make a dog feel so sick that it doesn’t want to drink. However, dehydration can worsen kidney disease. To encourage your dog to drink, give it some flavored broth. Before doing this, talk with your vet so you can choose a broth that’s low in sodium and doesn’t contain ingredients that would be hard on your dog’s kidneys., Sometimes, a dog with kidney disease will stand in front of its water bowl, but not drink any water.If you notice your dog is drinking less water, or not drinking any water, contact your vet. Your vet will likely recommend giving your dog subcutaneous fluids.

Use a gentle washcloth.,
Use only water.,
Gently wipe the puppy.,
Dry the puppy.,
Return the puppy to its mother.",How to Bathe a Newborn Puppy2," Puppies less than four weeks old do not really need to be bathed. At most, bathe your puppy one time if it is very dirty and the mother cannot clean it herself.

, Holding the puppy close to your chest will keep it warm.Newborn puppies are very sensitive to temperature.Don't put the puppy into water because its body cannot regulate temperature well.

, Choose a cloth that is clean and soft because newborn puppies are very sensitive.


For very tiny puppies, you can even use a cotton ball or piece of gauze., Wet the clean washcloth in warm water and wring out most of the excess water until it is just damp.


Do not use soap or dog shampoo on a puppy under four weeks old, its skin is too sensitive and can dry out from shampoo.

, Use the warm, damp cloth to gently wipe the puppy's coat.


Start at the head and wipe softly toward the tail.

, It is very important to dry the puppy to remove any excess moisture. A wet puppy can become too cold very quickly because it has a hard time regulating its body temperature.

, After cleaning and drying the puppy, return it to its mother so she can keep it warm.If it is not possible to place the puppy with its mother, make sure it stays in a warm area without cold drafts.

Use a gentle washcloth and warm water.,
Use gentle shampoo.,
Gently wash the puppy.,
Dry the puppy off.,

Associate bathing with good things.",How to Bathe a Newborn Puppy3," Dogs of all ages do not really need to be bathed unless they have a skin condition or if they are very dirty. If your puppy is very dirty or smelly you can bathe it occasionally.


Try not to bathe a puppy more than once a month or so.
Most dogs only need to be bathed a couple times a year.,


Do not put puppies into a bathtub, sink, or tub full of water. It is hard for them to regulate their body temperature and they can become too cold when immersed in water.

, Brush your puppy to remove tangles or mats before you bathe it if it has a long or fluffy coat.


It is good to get longer coated and fluffy dogs used to being brushed while they are young.

, Choose a soft clean cloth and get it wet in water that is warm but not very hot. Wipe the puppy off with the cloth.


Start at the head and wipe gently back towards the tail.
Make sure to wipe the underside too.

, Use shampoo made for puppies or babies. Puppy skin can be sensitive even as they start to grow.


Just use a small amount of shampoo.
Dry shampoos can be used on older puppies that don't like water. These are rubbed onto the coat without water.Make sure not to get the suds in the puppy's eyes.

, Lather the shampoo like you would on your own hair. Wipe the suds away with the cloth, then rinse it in warm water and wipe again. Repeat until the puppy is clean.

, Dry the puppy right away with a clean dry towel. It is important to get the puppy dry so it does not get too cold.

, Puppies need a place to stay warm since it is hard for them to regulate their own temperature.Choose an area that is not drafty.

, Get your puppy used to bathing and make them associate a bath with nice things like toys and treats. Let your puppy have a nice treat after its bath."
"
Carry the puppy into the bathing area.,
Close off the bathing area.,
Place the puppy in the water.,
Apply the dog shampoo.,
Restrain the puppy gently if necessary.,
Rinse out the shampoo.,
Consider your options for washing the head.You don’t have to get the head wet at all in many cases, and this may be something to introduce slowly at another time.,
Dry your puppy off.,
Be very careful using a hairdryer.,
Keep the puppy in a warm room.,
Consider getting professional advice.",How to Bathe a Puppy for the First Time2," Don't ever call a dog to you when you're about to do something it might not like.It's very important that your call is always associated with positive experiences. That way, he'll always come when called instead of avoiding you or running off.


“Come” is a potentially life saving command, and you can ruin the puppy’s response to the command with one bad association.
Without chasing him down, pick up the puppy and take him calmly to the bathing area.
Talk happily and calmly to him the whole time. This isn't a race, so don't put pressure on yourself or the puppy.

, Once in the bathroom, close the door so that your puppy will be unable to escape. This may stress him out, so take some time to cuddle and play in the closed bathroom to relax him before the bath.

, Once he's calm and happy, lift the puppy up and place him gently in the water, hind legs first. Make sure his head stays above the water. The water should only reach about halfway up his body, so se your cup to gently and slowly pour water over the dry parts.


If you have a hand-held shower or faucet head, you can use that. Don't use it if it scares the puppy, though.
Talk soothingly, and give praise and treats.

, Pour a little bit of shampoo into a cupped hand and work it into the wet fur with your fingers. A little shampoo goes a long way, so don't overdo it. If you use too much shampoo, you'll be stuck rinsing your puppy's fur forever!


Don’t neglect the puppy’s tail, which also needs shampooing.

, If seems like he's going to try to leap out of the water, keep a soothing hand on his back. Make sure not to manhandle him, but to guide him into the best position. Talk to him soothingly the whole time, and always move slowly. Jerky, sudden movements might cause a scared reaction that could lead to injury in a slippery tub.


Praise and cuddle him to show him that being restrained isn’t a terrible thing., Once you've soaped up the puppy's body and worked the shampoo into the coat, it's time to rinse it out. Use the shower or faucet nozzle if it doesn't scare the puppy. If it does, use your cup or jug to pour the bath water over him. Either way, always avoid getting water on the head and ears, as it could cause an ear infection or frighten him.


Drain and replace soapy water if necessary. Bear in mind your puppy might get cold and start shivering, which you don't want.
It's important that all soap be removed from the coat because residue can cause itchiness.Take your time and be thorough.

, If you do wet the head, you don't want to just dump water over it, as it could frighten him or cause ear infection. Instead, consider one of the following methods:


Using your cup, gently pour warm water over the puppy's head from behind the skull and avoiding the face. Tip his nose up so the water runs down and over the body, away from his nose and eyes.
If this is too much for your puppy, use a very wet washcloth (no soap) to clean the face.
Another method for getting the face wet is to cover the ear holes with his ear flaps. Gently guide his nose down to the floor and pour water to flow over the back of the head. Your hand will cover the eyes while holding the earflaps down.
Be careful about protecting the ears with cotton balls. Remember to remove them after the bath, and don't use them at all if they distract the puppy and make him shake his head a lot.

, When you've thoroughly rinsed all the soap from the puppy's coat, it's time to dry him off. Remove him from the tub and wrap him in towel, leaving the his head exposed. After a gentle initial rubdown, leave the towel on him and put him on the ground. Let him shake to his heart's content — the towel will contain much of the water and cut down on mess. You may want to even give him a command while he does this so he knows it's ok to shake water off of himself.


Make a big fuss over what a good boy he is, and give lots of praise.
Towel dry his body as best you can. Be very gentle with his head and face.
Set aside an ugly old towel that you'll only use on the dog.

, Never use it on a high heat setting, as it's very easy to burn your puppy's skin. If you must use a hairdryer, set it to an ""air"" setting without heat.


This unusual sound and feeling might frighten the puppy. Introduce him to is slowly well before his first bath, like you did with the tub and water.
Use play, praise, and treats to make it fun.
Avoid directing air toward his eyes, as they'll dry out.

, Until he's completely dry, don't let him go anywhere he could get cold. You also don't want him getting his wet dog smell all over the house, so keep him out of bedrooms, kitchens, or anyplace else you don't want him to make a mess. There's a good chance he'll run around and shake water everywhere after a bath, but this is to be expected. It's easiest to embrace this as part of puppy life.

, If this all seems too much for you and your puppy, consider contacting a professional groomer. Ask about their process for bathing puppies for the first time. You may take him to a professional for his first bathing, but ask to observe and get tips.


If your puppy hasn't finished his vaccination series, you'll need to take special precautions before taking him to a groomer.
The puppy should be the only customer first thing in the morning to protect other dogs. The groomers will have to disinfect the tub, cage, and grooming table after he's gone.

Feed your puppy several small meals.,
Leave room for snacks and treats.",How to Feed a Yorkie Puppy," Depending how young your puppy is when you bring them home (eight weeks is usually the earliest breeders will allow), you may need to transition them from liquid to solid foods. Most of the time, this step will be done by the breeder when the puppy is between three to six weeks old. Ask your breeder if they’ve already made this transition. If not, add a quality canine milk replacer to their food to help them transition from a liquid diet to a solid one.If your puppy is not eating any solid food when you bring them home, start by mixing a 50/50 ratio of milk replacer to water. Dip their noses in this mixture two or three times a day until they are drinking it on their own. They will usually catch on within one to four days.If they have been eating some solid food, begin by adding enough milk replacer to make their food the consistency of soup. Crush the kibbles a bit or break up the canned food some to make it easier to digest. Over the next two to three weeks, gradually include less and less of the milk replacer every few days until they are eating only solid food.Use only a good quality canine milk replacer. Don’t use cow or goat milk, or any other type of liquid.;
, Gradually transition your Yorkie puppy from the food they were eating at the breeder’s to the new food you will be feeding them. This will help prevent digestive issues they might experience from abruptly switching from one food to another. If you also have to transition them from liquid to solid food, this can be done at the same time.


Feed them the same food they’ve been eating (find out from the breeder or pet store) for two weeks after you bring them home.
Once this two weeks is over, start mixing their food. Begin by mixing a 3:1 ratio of old food to new for five days.
Next, mix a 1:1 ratio for five days.
Finally, give them a 1:3 ratio of old food to new for another 5 days. Once this is complete, you are safe to feed them only their new food., The weaning age for puppies starts when they are between four and seven weeks old and goes up to three months. At this stage, puppies need to be free fed, meaning you should leave their food out all day long so they can eat whenever they need. This helps prevent hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and promotes growth., Most people choose to feed their puppy a manufactured food, in either a canned or kibble variety. Ingredients in manufactured dog foods must be listed in descending order on the nutrition label, so look for a brand in which meat is the first item listed.


Make sure the type of meat listed is a name you recognize, like chicken, lamb, or beef. Stay away from brands containing generic “meats” that don’t specify what kind is actually in the food.In addition, check the label to make sure at least one other type of meat is included in the first three to five ingredients. This can also include high-quality dairy products like eggs. Try to avoid brands in which the top five ingredients include mostly grains, like wheat meal and wheat middlings., Small dogs need a high-calorie diet because they expend a lot of energy throughout the day, and therefore burn more calories. Look for foods that are made specifically for toy breeds and small dogs. These foods will have a higher calorie content that those made for bigger dogs.Once your dog is older, you can look for a dry dog food specifically for Yorkies, like Royal Canin's Yorkshire Terrier Dry Dog Food or Eukanuba's Yorkshire Adult Dog Food. This breed-specific food provides a high protein content, is well-balanced in carbohydrates and fats, and includes omega-3 fatty acids to keep their coats looking and feeling silky. It also has an aroma that appeals to Yorkies, which are known for being picky eaters., Kibble is usually considered a better choice for Yorkies than wet canned food. Yorkies are known to develop dental problems and the dry, brittle texture of kibble will help clean their teeth. However, both are safe if they include quality ingredients. Much of your decision will depend upon which type of food your puppy prefers., If you choose a canned food, you can skip this step. However, if you are going with a kibble, be sure to pick one with small, bite-sized pieces. Doing so will make it easier for your Yorkie to digest their food.

, While most people choose a manufactured food for their Yorkie puppy, making your own food for them is also a good choice. Many argue it is a better choice since this eliminates the possibility that there are chemicals, fillers, and coloring in it. Your puppy’s food should be 1/3 protein and 2/3 vegetables and grains.If you choose to make your puppy’s food, ensure you include the following items:


Meat: You can use a variety of meats like lean chicken and ground beef, as well as turkey, lamb, veal, bison, and fish.
Vegetables: String beans, carrots, sweet peas, and spinach are all good choices.
Carbohydrates: These can include sweet potatoes or regular potatoes, white or brown rice, and pasta.
Fruits: Blueberries, raspberries, mangos, and bananas all work well.
Extras: For some additional variety, provide whole white yogurt, cottage cheese, and eggs., Growing puppies usually need 45 to 55 calories per pound of body weight per day. The type of food you decide to feed your puppy—manufactured or homemade—will impact the amount you need to give them.


If you’re feeding your puppy a manufactured food, check the label. Manufactured dog foods generally provide serving sizes according to your dog’s weight.
If you’re providing homemade food, you’ll likely need smaller portions because it is more calorie-dense than manufactured food., Once your puppy is weaned (usually around three months), you should start feeding them scheduled meals. Feed your puppy three to four small meals a day—morning, lunchtime, early evening (if you’re feeding them four meals), and evening. They should eat their last meal at least two hours before bedtime.


Continuing to free-feed at this age can make housebreaking much more difficult because you won’t know when your dog needs to go to the bathroom. Having a well-scheduled day also helps promote good behavior., Yorkies have very small stomachs so you must take into account how snacks and treats will affect their meals for the day. Generally, they should only be given as a reward for good behavior or when you are command training.


Stay away from brightly-colored treats, which often contain a lot of chemicals. Look for white or cream-colored treats instead.
Good homemade snacks include items like baby carrots or frozen blueberries."

Promote water consumption.,

Feed the pregnant dog puppy food.,
Increase the amount of food you are feeding the dog.A dog that is in the last trimester of pregnancy should be fed more than it would normally eat.,
Increase the frequency of feeding.,
Continue to feed the dog puppy food after whelping.",How to Feed a Pregnant Dog Shortly Before Labor," A dog that is going into active labor will probably avoid eating. The labor process can be very grueling and can cause stomach upset and vomiting, along with pacing and uneasiness.Thus, trying to force her to eat during this time is not productive.


If your dog does eat right before labor it may vomit the food up. This is relatively normal, as the dog's body is under extreme stress.;
, As your dog gets closer and closer to giving birth, it may be less interested in food. In order to get her to eat, feed her small meals of easily digestible food. They should usually consist of the puppy food that you should be feeding her in her last few weeks of pregnancy. This will allow the mother to absorb the nutrients in the food quickly and effectively.Offer her small meals every couple of hours or just leave food out for her to graze on. The key is to give her enough food but not so much that she will get stomach upset and vomit it up.
It is important that she continue to get enough nutrition to develop the puppies. This means an increase of fifteen to twenty five percent over the amount of food you are feeding the dog normally.If your pregnant dog refuses to eat even before labor then you can try to give her a treat instead of her regular food. Giving her high calorie treats can give her some much needed energy that she will need for labor but it will not take up as much space in her stomach as her regular food will.

, When your dog is getting ready to give birth it is normal for her to refuse food. However, you should try to get her to keep drinking water. She will need the water so that she doesn't become dehydrated during the birthing process.Additionally, staying hydrated is crucial to her milk coming in right after birthing. If she doesn't drink enough water she won't be able to produce enough milk for her puppies.

, As the pregnant dog gets closer to giving birth, you should keep her in a warm and comfortable area that is prepared for the birthing process. This area should be a place where she can be isolated from other dogs. You should place food and water in this area so that she has free access to eat and drink when she feels like it.Once active labor begins, remove the food temporarily. You do not want it to get knocked over and become a mess.

, In order to give the pregnant dog the nutrition that she needs, she should be fed puppy food for a couple weeks before she gives birth. Puppy food is high in fat and protein and can meet the high energy needs of a late term pregnancy.You should gradually change your dog's food. Switching food abruptly can cause stomach upset and general digestive issues.
Puppy food gives the pregnant dog the nutrients that she needs to support her own body functions, as well as those of the growing puppies. This type of food is specially formulated to support growth and development.

, Over the course of its pregnancy the amount of food you feed it should be increased by fifteen to twenty five percent.Talk to your veterinarian about what and how much you should be feeding your pregnant dog.

, Do not give your dog larger meals while it is pregnant. Instead, while you are increasing the amount of food she is eating, it should be divided into small, frequent meals.While a dog is pregnant, the amount of food she can ingest at one time will decrease. This is due to the space being taken up by the puppies. This is why it is important to feed the mother lots of small meals.

, The mother dog will need to eat even more after giving birth. This is due to the nutritional energy it takes for her to produce enough milk for her puppies. Keep her on puppy food until the puppies have stopped nursing.


About three weeks after giving birth, the mother will be at her highest caloric needs. This means that she should be eating twenty five percent more food per puppy she is feeding than what she normally eats. This means that if she is nursing four puppies, she should be eating twice as much as she did before pregnancy."

Mix wet food with dry food.,
Soften the food with water.,
Warm up the food.,
Add homemade food.,
Switch dog food brands.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Feed a Fussy Puppy1," Try mixing your puppy’s dry food with wet or canned food. Because canned food is moist, it is highly palatable. By increasing the palatability of your puppy’s food, you may be able to persuade your puppy to eat. Replace ¼ cup of your puppy’s quality dry puppy food with a 3 oz. can of quality puppy wet food.For example, if you feed your puppy one half cup of dry food per day, then feed your puppy a ¼ cup of dry food mixed with a 3 oz. can of wet food per day.;
, This tip is especially helpful if your puppy is teething. Puppies teethe between 12 to 20 weeks of age. Mixing dry food with water will soften your puppy’s food. Softening your puppy’s food will reduce any pain your puppy might feel when eating dry food. This will encourage your puppy to eat.Pour 1/4 or 1/3 cup of water over your puppy’s dry dog food. Let the dry food soak up the water for a minute before feeding your puppy.
Alternatively, you can soak your puppy’s food in plain chicken or beef broth. Make sure the broth is plain and not seasoned with onions, garlic, or high in sodium.

, Warming up your puppy’s food will enhance its aroma, which will improve its palatability. Warm up your puppy’s food in the oven or microwave. Afterwards, hold your hand about an inch above the food to test the warmth and also stir up the food to even out the temperature before serving it to your puppy.For dry food, place it in an oven on low heat for a few minutes before feeding your puppy.
For wet food, place the food in the microwave and heat it for six to 10 seconds. Do not overheat it. Overheating can zap the food’s nutrients.
Alternatively, pour warm water or broth over your puppy’s food before feeding it.

, Mixing in homemade food can greatly improve the palatability of your puppy’s food. Mix in homemade foods like scrambled eggs, cooked vegetables like carrots or peas, or a starch, like potatoes or rice. You can also add in small amounts of cooked meat, like shredded boneless chicken or ground beef.Make sure the food is thoroughly cooked before adding it to your puppy’s bowl.
Mixing in oregano, basil, or parsley can improve the palatability of your puppy’s food, as well. Mix in ¼ teaspoon of seasoning with its food.
Don’t put alcohol, avocado, chocolate, coffee, citrus, coconut, grapes, raisins, nuts, garlic, onion, chives, salt, salty snacks, dairy or uncooked meats in with your puppy’s food. These can all have negative effects on your dog’s health., Preservatives and other chemicals in commercial dog food brands can taint the smell and taste of your puppy's food. Therefore, you might need to switch to a more natural, high quality brand of dog food such as Orijen, Natural Balance, or Blue Buffalo.Additionally, make sure that the dog food is either specifically for puppies or for “all life stages.” When switching your puppy's dog food from one brand to another, you will need to do so gradually so that the drastic change doesn’t have a negative impact on digestion. It will generally take a week to completely switch from one brand to another. Switch your puppy's food by:Mixing in 25% of the new food with 75% of the old (current) food on the first day.
Mixing in 40% of the new food with 60% of the old food on the second day.
Mixing 50% of the new food with 50% of the old food on the third day.
Mixing 60% of the new food with 40% of the old food on the fourth day.
Mixing 75% of the new food with 25% of the old food on the fifth day.
Feeding it 90 to 100% of the new food on the sixth day.

, Before making any big dietary or feeding changes, always talk to your vet. Your vet will be able to tell you how and when to change your puppy's diet. They will also be able to tell you important information specific to your puppy's breed.

Provide smaller meals.,
Stay with your puppy.,
Consult your vet.",How to Feed a Fussy Puppy2," Some puppies might be intimidated by a big bowl of food that they know they cannot finish. To prevent this, try feeding your puppy smaller, but more frequent meals.For example, instead of feeding your puppy one cup of dry food in the morning or at night, try feeding it ¼ cup of dry food four times a day.

, When feeding your puppy, try staying with your puppy while it eats. This might encourage it to eat. Additionally, hand-feeding your puppy or petting in conjunction with vocal reassurance might further encourage it to eat.For example, when you place the food bowl down, stay with your puppy. Pet it and encourage it to eat by saying, ""You're a good girl (or boy). It's time to eat.""

, If you puppy is a good eater and has suddenly lost its appetite, consult your veterinarian immediately. Inappetence is a symptom of many diseases and illnesses that afflict puppies and dogs. Therefore, you need to consult your vet to rule out the possibility that your puppy is sick or becoming ill.If your puppy refuses to eat for more than 24 hours, then contact your vet immediately. There’s a chance that your puppy is refusing to eat because of pain it’s feeling as a result of parasites, disease, or illness."

Choose a mild detergent.,
Select a place to clean the food or water dish.,
Hand wash the food or water dish.,
Disinfect the food or water dish.,
Rinse and dry the food or water dish completely.,
Disinfect the sink.",How to Clean a Dog's Water or Food Dish1," If you prefer hand wash your dog’s food or water dish (rather than than put them in the dishwasher), choose a mild, non-toxic dishwashing detergent.If you are not sure which detergents are mild, check the product labels for indications that the product would be soft on your hands. If the detergent is mild enough for you, then it will be mild enough for your dog’s food or water dish.


Organic detergents, although more expensive, likely contain non-toxic ingredients.
Harsh detergents and bleach are toxic to dogs.Harsh detergents could also cause stainless steel dishes to rust.You can also make your own mild detergent by combining equal parts of baking soda, warm water, and table salt.;
, It is not recommended to wash your dog’s dishes in the bathtub or kitchen sink because of the risk of cross-contamination. Your dog’s food or water dish could have bacteria from his mouth and his food,and you would not want that bacteria contaminating the dishes you and your family use. Instead, use a bathroom sink or large utility sink.If you choose to use the kitchen sink, you will need to disinfect it after washing your dog’s food or water dish., To hand wash the dishes, use a dishcloth or sponge that you use only for your dog’s dishes.Make the water as hot as you can tolerate. Consider wearing gloves while handwashing to protect your hands from the hot water.Using a circular motion with the dishtowel or sponge,wash both the inside and outside of the dish.
Pay special attention to areas where the food has hardened.

, Using hot water and mild detergent is a very effective way to clean your dog’s food or water dishes. However, a slimy substance called biofilm can accumulate in your dog’s dishes. It contains a combination of bacteria, algae, and fungi that could make your dog sick if he ingests it. Scrubbing and disinfecting the dish are the best ways to get rid of the biofilm and its harmful microorganisms.Biofilm's slimy, gluey texture can make it challenging to remove.The baking soda in your homemade detergent is abrasive enough to remove the biofilm.
To disinfect the dish after scrubbing it, mix one gallon of water with one tablespoon of bleach. Add this mixture to the dish and let it sit for about two minutes before rinsing it out. Disinfect the outside of the bowl, too.To make your dog's food or dish extra clean, you can clean and disinfect it, rather than doing one or the other.

, Your dog could become sick if he ingests detergent residue in his dish,so it is very important for you to rinse his dish completely with water. You can either dry the dish off with some paper towels or let the dish air dry before refilling it with food or water.


If you have disinfected the dish, it is very important to rinse away any bleach residue.If you choose to dry off the dish with a dishtowel, make sure the dishtowel is used only for your dog’s dishes.

, If you have used the kitchen sink, get it ready for human use again by disinfecting it with diluted bleach (one tablespoon or bleach per one gallon of water). Put the stopper in place and fill the sink with the bleach. Let the mixture sit for about five minutes. Next, release the stopper to drain the sink. Finally, give the sink another quick rinse and let it air dry."

Talk to a veterinarian.,
Plan your budget for a whole food diet.,
Make a list of ""NEVER"" foods.",How to Feed a Dog Whole Foods1," Before feeding your dog whole foods, get more information about your dog's nutritional needs. Consult your veterinarian for advice on what your dog should be consuming on a day-to-day basis, and in what portions. In addition, ask for advice on how to monitor your dog's health after changing its diet (e.g. keeping an eye out for gastrointestinal upsets or skin irritations). Ask your vet if your dog should be given vitamins or supplements with their whole food diet; do not purchase such products without a specific recommendation.;
, Before embarking on a whole food diet for your pet, make sure that you can afford to feed your dog quality ingredients. Make a week-long sample menu for your dog (including treats and snacks) and calculate the approximate costs. Compare this amount to what you are currently spending on commercial dog food and treats, and ensure that you will have the extra money (if it works out to more) to keep up with a whole food diet.


Feeding your dog whole foods doesn’t not have to mean a complete overhaul of its diet - if a whole food diet seems too costly for you or your family to afford, consider adding small amounts of whole food to your dog’s diet to supplement its regular dog food.

, While feeding your dog whole foods can be very beneficial for its health, there are a number of foods that could be toxic to your pet if consumed. Inform yourself by speaking to your veterinarian or researching these foods on reliable websites like petMD. Write a clear list and post it on the fridge or wall for other members of your family to keep in mind. Some notable foods to keep away from your dog are:Chocolate (especially dark chocolate), which can cause vomiting, diarrhea and seizures.
Onions and garlic, which can cause the destruction of red blood cells and lead to anemia when consumed in large quantities, or over a long period of time
Alcohol, which can be life-threatening even in small amounts.
Yeast dough (notably the store bought kind that is used in making bread, rolls, and pizza), which can create alcohol in a dog's stomach and be potentially deadly.
Grapes and raisins, which can cause kidney failure.
Artificial sweeteners like xylitol, which can be incredibly toxic.

Ask when the restaurant is least crowded.",How to Dine Out with Your Dog1," Before you head out for a delicious dinner with your dog, make sure the restaurant allows pets to dine with their owners. Don’t rely solely on information from the Internet or tips from fellow travelers. Although these can be helpful in figuring out where you might want to take Terrance the terrier, it’s best to call before you go to avoid unexpected outcomes., Before you and Titan head out to that new sushi joint, make sure it truly is dog friendly. Questions to consider include: Can your dog sit comfortably while you dine? Are the tables large enough that your dog can sit quietly underneath? Is there ample space between tables, or will your pooch be snuggling up to the lady sitting next to you?

, Dining out with your dog can be a more pleasant experience if you visit the establishment when it’s not overflowing with guests, especially if Nancy the Norwegian Elkhound is a bit nervous around crowds. Call the restaurant and ask when the least busy times are for the meal you’re planning on eating there. This can help you plan a more pleasant experience for all, including Nervous Nancy."

Don’t let your dog beg or feed them scraps.",How to Create a Feeding Routine for Your Dog," This will make your dog feel safe and secure. Pick a spot that's easy to clean, like a kitchen floor or plastic mat in the corner of the room. Make sure that it's away from your dining table.


If your dog is new to you, consider starting by feeding them out of your hand so that they will directly recognize you as the provider of food.;
, It’s best not to let your dog “graze” by leaving food out for them to eat whenever they like. Having a set routine will help their metabolism since it will adjust to their feeding schedule. It will also help to establish your dog's expectations and trust in you if they can count on you providing food at the same time each day.How often you should feed your dog will depend on its age and nutritional requirements along with your schedule. Puppies can feed up to four times a day. Senior dogs who have lower activity levels and smaller portion sizes can be fed once a day.
If possible, most adult dogs should be fed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Spreading out their mealtimes into two equal portions separated by 8-12 hours helps full-grown canines properly digest their food and control their hunger.
To curb separation anxiety, avoid feeding your dog immediately upon your return. When they associate your appearance with the instant gratification of a meal, they will be more likely to be anxious about your return.
To curb the risks of indigestion and the dangerous stomach condition “bloat,” avoid feeding your dog immediately after or before you exercise them., Only give your dog access to their food for a set amount of time, so that they’ll learn to eat it as soon as it’s offered and not be picky about their food. Remove their bowl as soon as 15 or 20 minutes has elapsed, regardless of how much food is left in the dish.Doing so will help establish you as the provider and controller of food, which puts you in charge of your pet instead of vice versa. It will also help streamline other elements of their routine, like going out to do their business since you can let them out about a half hour after each mealtime.

, Domesticated dogs were bred from predators, and they still like to “work” for their meals. You can use mealtimes as an opportunity to bond with your dog and reinforce essential training by making them sit and wait for your command before they eat. Start by asking them to “sit” while you prepare their food and lower their dish.To establish this routine, have your dog sit. Lower their food bowl towards the ground, raising it back up each time they leave the sit position. Each time they allow you to go further towards the ground with the dish before leaving the sit position, reward them with a treat. Work your way gradually towards laying the dish on the ground without them leaving the sit position.Over time, your dog will know to sit and wait for their meal without you commanding them to do so.

, Once your dog is able to sit and wait for their food dish, the next step is getting them to wait to feed until they are released by you (provider of the food) to eat.Once their food dish is on the ground, tell them to “stay” as you stand up. Keep telling them to stay until they have redirected their attention away from the food to you. As soon as they do so, release them to eat with a command phrase such as, “go ahead,” “eat up,” or “chow down.”
When you’re first establishing this routine, take away their food dish if they go for it without asking for permission. After they learn to look at you and wait for your command, you can continue to increase the time they need to focus on you to hone their impulse control.
Teaching dogs to wait for their food shows them that demanding or food-aggressive behavior will not be rewarded. It also provides a general lesson in impulse control that can improve their training and good behavior across the board.

, Now that your dog has earned their meal, let them enjoy it in peace. Trying to touch your pooch or their food dish while they’re eating from it can encourage stress, anxiety, and/or aggressive behavior in your pet., Keep in mind that serving-size recommendations are based on averages. You will need to monitor your dog’s weight and activity level to be sure that the suggested portion and caloric intake is appropriate for their needs.


Make serving-size adjustments as necessary to maintain your dog’s ideal weight. If they’re gaining additional pounds, slowly decrease their daily portion. If they’re losing weight, gradually increase their serving.
Remember that you may also need to alter the quantity that you feed your dog in relation to changes in their environment (such as winter weather), age, health, or activity level.

, If you would like or need to switch any elements of your dog’s feeding routine, such as the amount of food or type of food, do so gradually. This will help their metabolism and digestive track adjust smoothly to the shifts.For instance, if you would like to start your dog on a new food, start by mixing it in with your dog’s old food. Slowly increase the proportion of the new food over the space of a week before serving it on its own.
It’s not necessary to change your dog’s food for the sake of variety. They are well pleased to eat the same food each day, so only make a change if their well-being or phase of life requires it. If your dog is thriving on a particular food (that is, they have good energy and body condition, a shiny coat and healthy digestive track), stick with it.

, It’s wonderful to reward your dog, but it’s best to limit treats to only about 5% of their overall food intake. Dog treats are not required to provide complete and balanced canine nutrition, so it’s best if they only make up a small part of your pet’s diet.Treats and snacks can provide a bit of controlled variation to your dog’s diet. However, feeding your dog many treats will make them more prone to overeating and less likely to eat their regular meals.
When you are doing lots of rewards-based training, you may want to temporarily introduce more treats to your dog’s diet. You can give your dog up to 20% treats in a day, but be sure to adjust their overall food intake accordingly. It’s still best to reserve treats for high-level rewards and use kibble (when they’re hungry) as their normal reward.

, Dry kibble that explicitly says it offers complete and balanced canine nutrition is best. Choose one that aligns with your dog’s age, weight, and activity level. Ask your vet for the ideal food type for your dog.


At least 10% of the diet of the average adult dog should be comprised of protein; at least 5.5% should be fats. Carbohydrates can account for up to half of your dog’s caloric intake.Wet dog food may be advisable for dogs with certain health conditions, such as urinary tract infections. However, most dogs do just as well or better on dry kibble, which is generally cheaper, more nutritionally dense, and better for canine dental health than canned alternatives., At mealtimes, serve your dog a controlled portion of a “complete and balanced” dry dog food that reflects their age, weight, and activity level. Consult with your vet about the suggested daily caloric intake for your dog. You can also use the guidelines printed on the dog food package as a starting point for determining the appropriate serving size.
While it may seem easier as a pet owner, free-choice feeding is not recommended. It can easily lead to weight problems for your pet since it’s harder to keep track of how much your dog is consuming when you let them feed “on demand.”

, Your dog will be far less motivated to eat their own food if you’re treating them to “human food.” Giving them table scraps can lead to nutritional imbalances and obesity while rewarding them for begging behaviors.Human food is often unhealthy and sometimes even poisonous for your dog. Even common, seemingly healthful food like raisins, grapes, onions, or mushrooms can be detrimental to canines; caffeine and chocolate can be lethal.Have your dog stay well away from the table in a designated place during your meal times to prevent begging. Feed them after or at least at a different time from you so that they know they have to wait their turn.

Avoid feeding your puppy table scraps.,
Change out the food bowl.,
Place its food bowl in a quiet area.",How to Feed a Fussy Puppy3," If you or your family members feed your puppy table scraps often, your puppy might be putting off eating in hopes of being fed table scraps. Feeding your puppy table scraps can also make it full, which can cause your puppy to skip its meals.Also, keep track of the amount of treats you feed your puppy. Too many treats can cause your puppy to be full and skip meals. Keep track of treats by placing a set amount in a jar. This way, you can see how many treats were given in a day or week.

, Sometimes the food bowl could be the cause. If your puppy’s food bowl is too big, moves, or makes noises while it eats, this might discourage your puppy from eating. Additionally, if you use a plastic bowl, the plastic smell of the bowl might taint the smell of the food. This will lower the palpability of your puppy’s food.Choose a stainless steel or ceramic bowl that does not slide as your puppy eats. Make sure to choose a bowl that is not too big, as well.

, If your puppy’s food bowls are placed in high-traffic areas, this could be a part of the reason why your puppy isn’t eating regularly. Instead, place your puppy’s bowls in a quiet corner in the kitchen or in the laundry room.Also, try feeding your puppy during quiet times of the day, like early in the morning or after dinner.

Place your dog’s food and water dishes in the dishwasher.,
Clean your dog’s dishes separately.,
Clean your dog’s dishes with your own dishes.",How to Clean a Dog's Water or Food Dish2," Washing your dog’s food and water dishes in the dishwasher is preferable, since the water gets hot enough (140 degrees F/60 degrees C) to remove and kill bacteria.In addition, cleaning the dishes in the dishwasher is a great alternative if you do not have much time for handwashing.


Even with a pair of cleaning gloves, your hands would probably not be able to tolerate water that is as hot as the water in your dishwasher.

, To prevent cross-contamination, it is preferable to wash your dog’s dishes by themselves in the dishwasher.If you decide to wash them separately, consider purchasing several dishes so you can fill and run the dishwasher every few days.It may not be practical for you to wash just one or two of your dog’s dishes in the dishwasher at a time.

, It may make you a little squeamish to put your dog’s food and water dishes in with your own bowls and plates. However, it may be okay to do so if you have a ‘sanitize’ setting on your dishwasher. This setting would effectively kill and remove all bacteria, thus preventing cross-contamination.If you are not comfortable combining the dishes, run separate dishwasher loads.
Whether you have a combined load or separate loads, select the hottest temperature setting on your dishwasher."
"
Clean your dog’s food or water dish every day.,
Inspect the food or water dish for scratches.,
Clean the area around your dog’s food and water dishes.",How to Clean a Dog's Water or Food Dish3," Daily cleanings of your dog’s food or water dish are an important step in keeping your dog healthy. Depending on what you feed him, you may have to clean his food dish multiple times a day. For example, if you feed him wet food only, a combination of wet and dry food, or raw food, clean his food dish after each meal.If you feed your dog only dry food, then cleaning the food dish once a day may be sufficient.If you have outdoor dogs, or use one water dish for multiple dogs, clean that dish several times a day.If your dog’s food and water dishes feel particularly slimy, consider cleaning the food dish after each meal and the water dish twice daily.Food and water dishes can also accumulate saliva, dust, and debris.In addition to possibly making your dog sick, he may not even want to eat or drink out of the dishes if they look too dirty.

, Not all food or water dishes can withstand frequent washing. Over time, less durable dishes can develop scratches in which bacteria could grow and make your dog sick. When you have cleaned the food or water dishes, look them over closely for scratches.Replace any scratched dishes.Stainless steel and porcelain dishes are very durable and can handle frequent cleaning.Ceramic and plastic dishes are not good choices because they are very porous and can harbor bacteria.In addition, plastic dishes get scratches very easily., It is not enough to keep your dog’s food and water dishes clean—the area around his eating area needs to be clean, too. To clean the floor in that area, mix together equal parts vinegar and water and mop the area every few days.Alternatively, you could place a rubber food mat under the dishes to collect excess food and water.Wipe down or hand wash the food mat each day to keep it clean and prevent bacterial growth."

Introduce whole foods slowly.,
Maintain an omnivorous diet.,
Be cautious about “raw food diets”.,
Give your dog fruits and vegetables as snacks.,
Make homemade dog treats.,
Monitor changes in your dog.",How to Feed a Dog Whole Foods2," Start introducing whole foods to your dog’s diet by adding portions to its regular kibble. Be sure to reduce the amount of dog food your portion out to accommodate the whole foods that you’re adding. To start, or as a regular addition to a regular kibble diet, new ingredients should make up about 25% of your dog’s meals, and can include:Eggs (raw or cooked), which provide high quality protein and fat
Canned fish (e.g. sardines or pink salmon), supplying omega-3 fatty acids that are good for your dog’s skin and coat, and which help regulate the immune system and reduce inflammation
Leafy greens, which can allow you to increase the amount you feed your dog without increasing their calorie intake significantly
Healthy leftovers (e.g. meat offcuts), preferably in small quantities to prevent weight gain

, While dogs’ teeth and digestive tracts show carnivorous traits, dogs also have the proven ability to digest carbohydrate-based foods. There is, however, a carnivorous bias that makes meat an integral part of the canine diet; whatever your personal choices may be, never force a vegan or vegetarian diet onto a pet that’s body is optimized to consume meat. Give your dog a balanced diet of meat, grain, and fruits and vegetables to provide optimal health without turning away from its ancestral diet., Raw food diets, or B.A.R.F. diets (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food diets), have grown in popularity and aim to mimic what dogs would eat in the wild (i.e. raw meats, grains, vegetables, and bones.) There is no definite evidence that this sort of diet is more beneficial for dogs than other diets, but there are a number of health risks associated with it, including exposure to dangerous bacteria and injury from bones. While dogs’ digestive tracts can process raw meat, the presence of bacteria can still pose the threat of gastrointestinal distress and illness for both a dog and its owners. If you pursue a raw food diet for your dog, play it safe by:Following the U.S. Department of Health guidelines for food preparation and safety (visit https://www.foodsafety.gov/)
Removing small or splintered bones from your dog’s food
Making sure that you and your family are all diligent about maintaining a clean food preparation space

, Outside of your dog’s regular meals, snacks can be a great way to add whole foods to its diet. Feed fruits and vegetables (raw or cooked) to your dog as snacks, keeping in mind those that fall onto the “never” foods list (e.g. grapes). Feel free to let your dog snack on:Green beans, as they contain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins A, C, and K, calcium, copper, fiber, folic acid, iron, niacin, manganese, potassium, riboflavin, thiamin, and beta carotene
Spinach, which is high in iron and helps fend off inflammatory and cardiovascular issues
Apples, which are high in vitamin C and antioxidants
Watermelon, a good source of vitamin A, B-6 and C, and thiamin
Pumpkin, a food high in fiber, vitamin A and anti-oxidants, which can also alleviate diarrhea and constipation

, Making your own dog treats is not only a healthy choice for your dog (free of preservatives and byproducts), it can also save you money. You also have the option of sneaking beneficial ingredients into your treats, such as fish oil to improve your dog’s coat; other healthy ingredients to include in treats may include peanut butter, oatmeal, honey, bananas, and berries. While most homemade dog treats will generally last about a week, you can also freeze them to keep on hand for your pet.For example, try making your own jerky treats as an alternative to store-bought raw hides – cut chicken or sweet potatoes into 1/8 inch strips and bake at 200 degrees F for 2 hours.

, During the initial period when you introduce whole foods into your dog’s diet, take note of the changes in its health and mood. For a detailed account of changes, keep a journal where you write down exactly what you are feeding your dog, and the notable differences in its health (for example, an increase in energy, or a shinier coat.) Tracking your dog’s diet on paper is a reliable way to identify possible food allergies; symptoms of food allergies may include:Recurrent ear problems
Itchy skin that doesn’t respond to steroid treatments
Skin problems that occur all year round, regardless of season or climate
Hair loss

, Before you take your dog to a restaurant, it is important that you make sure they have been fed. If you bring your hungry pooch to the diner, it is more likely she will beg for food and act out. Feed them a full meal before you leave the house., A dog that dines out should be under voice control. At a minimum, this means Fido should sit, stay, and “leave it” when instructed to do so.

If your dog has a tendency to act aggressively toward other people or animals, he has no place in a restaurant. Bringing an aggressive dog to dinner can be a recipe for disaster. Do your fellow diners a favor and leave Killer at home.

, Even if your dog is an angel, she still needs to be on a leash when you hit up a restaurant. You might be able to control your dog, but you will have no control over distractions, unexpected incidents, or other people’s pets. Make sure Susie-Q is properly collared and leashed before you enter the restaurant., It’s important that you keep your dog close to you while dining out. Don’t leash Fluffy to the table, as this will give him the opportunity to socialize with other diners or even trip your waitress! Instead, tie his leash to your chair. This will limit his range and give you direct control over his movements.Don’t attach the leash to a table! This can result in spilled drinks and destroyed dinners if Rufus decides to run.

, If possible, you should aim to keep your pooch under the table while you are dining out. It’s safe under there. Curly won’t get kicked, tripped, or trampled by passersby and he’ll feel more secure while you’re enjoying your escargot.

, While you might think it’s cute that Beethoven eats dinner on your lap, it’s likely that your fellow diners do not. Moreover, in many restaurants it is against regulation to have a pet on a table or chair. This prohibition includes a purse placed on the table with Beethoven inside it., If you are dining out with your dog and a conflict with another pet arises, exit the restaurant. Ask your server for a doggy bag and leave. The last thing you or your fellow diners want to witness is a dogfight or a dog bite.

Know what you can give your dogs.,
Check the meal sizes and proportions.,
Note that there are a lot of meal plans and ideas you could do for your dog now.,
Factor the cooking and preparation into your feeding routine.",How to Develop Healthy and Safe Homemade Meal Plans for Your Dog," You might think that dogs are living garbage cans, that they try to eat anything they can get their paws on. In reality, there are a lot of foods that can be potentially hazardous and dangerous to your dog that you will want to avoid at all costs while planning his/her meals. A few are:


Avocado (contains a substance called ""persin"" that can be toxic to your dog)
Alcohol (it affects a dogs liver and organs just like it affects a humans, just on a larger scale so it is very bad for your dog)
Onions and garlic in any form (destroys your dogs red blood cells)
Coffee, tea, and and kind of caffeine (large enough quantities can actually kill your dog, it's known as caffeine poisoning)
Grapes and raisins (can cause kidney failure in dogs)
Milk and dairy products (causes your dog diarrhoea and other digestive issues that can harm your dog in the long-run)
Macadamia nuts (fatal to dogs)
Candy and gum (this is an obvious no-no to feed your dog; there is a sweetener in candy and gum called xylitol that causes your dogs blood sugar to drop and liver failure)
Chocolate (again, the most popular food that dogs should be kept away from; the toxic agent in chocolate is known as theobromine, and just your dog getting a taste of chocolate can cause vomiting, diarrhea, extreme thirst, and all that can lead to tremors, seizures, abnormal heart breathing, and even death)
Peaches and plums (the main problem with this is the seeds or pits; they contain a substance dangerous to dogs that if eaten, can cause inflammation of intestines)
Raw eggs (you might have heard that feeding your dog raw egg is good for it, but actually there is a possibility your dog could get salmonella or food poisoning, and it can cause coat/fur problems if eaten too much)
Salt (eating too much salt can cause your dog excessive thirst and urinating, which then can lead to sodium ion poisoning)
Yeast dough (do not feed your dog dough that contains yeast because the dough is slowly rising because of the yeast, and if you fed it to your dog it would expand in your dog's stomach and cause extreme pain; also, when yeast ferments the dough it produces alcohol, then your dog would have alcohol poisoning)
Your medicine (do not give your dog your own medicine. Unless your vet specifically tells you a brand of medicine and that it is okay for your dog, never give him/her your medicine. Ingredients in medicine that are pain-relievers for humans like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are deadly to your dog).;
, Not all human food is bad for dogs. There is actually quite a bit that you can feed your dog that is quite healthy and can be a replacement for store-bought food. A list of some of those foods are:


Lean meats (meat like chicken that has been cooked thoroughly is safe to give your dog. Be sure all the skin and fat is removed from the meat before you give it to your dog, and do not add any seasonings, they could upset your dogs stomach or harm him/her)
Fresh fruits (fruits like apples, oranges, bananas, and watermelon are all safe to give your dog. Be sure there are no stems, seeds, or rinds attached to the fruit and be sure to cut up the fruit into small pieces before giving it to your dog)
Vegetables (the safe ones are carrots, green beans, cucumber slices, or zucchini slices. Even a plain baked potato is safe to give your dog. *Remember, do not feed your dog raw potatoes, as those can harm your dog)
Cooked white rice and pasta (plain cooked rice and pasta is a simple dish that if mixed with other foods can be very safe and enjoyable to your dog)

, This is important for your dog's health. You do not want to over-feed your dog (or underfeed him, either). Base how much you feed your dog on its weight, and how much your dog is exercised daily. And remember, if your dog isn't finishing off all of its food, you could be giving it too much, and if it eats its meal quite quickly and still seems hungry, give it a little more. A chart to go off to know how much food your dog should be fed per day (and note that this is daily portion sizes):


3-10 pounds should get 1/4 to 2/3 cup of food
10-20 pounds should get 2/3 to 1 cup of food
20-30 pounds should get 1 to 1 1/2 cups of food
30-40 pounds should get 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of food
40-60 pounds should get 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 cups of food
60-80 pounds should get 2 1/2 to 3 cups of food
80-100 pounds should get 3 to 3 1/2 cups of food
Over 100 pounds of dog, it should be 3 1/2 + 1/3 cup for each 10 pound over 100.

, When you start cooking your dog's meals, a whole new list of options and possibilities pop up. Some ideas include:


The chicken meal. Boil up some chicken, cook some plain white rice, and top it off with a handful of chopped-up carrots
The veggie meal. Cook some pasta, then chop up some potatoes and green beans (you may also add some meat if your dog isn't big on the rabbit-food idea)
The fruity meal. Make a fruit salad of chopped watermelon, apples, bananas, and some orange slices.

, It's true, buying and preparing your dog's meals can cost more money and be more time-consuming. Checking out farmer's markets for fresh produce and make sure that the meat you buy for your dog is clean and that the place you bought it from is not dirty or unsanitary. It is possible you could prepare your dogs meals in advance and keep them refrigerated. Just make sure they haven't gone bad or moldy when you give them to your dog.

Choose a high-value protein.,
Add fruits and vegetables.,
Use healthy carbohydrates.,
Mix in vitamin and mineral supplements.,
Cook ingredients thoroughly.",How to Choose All Natural Pet Food for Pomeranians1," When making homemade meals for your Pomeranian, 40 to 50 percent of your dog’s diet should be high-value proteins. When choosing proteins, try to choose lean meats, i.e., no more than 10% fat. Some ideal protein choices are poultry (ideally dark meat), beef, and organs, such as the liver and heart. Also, fish, such as salmon, trout, mackerel, and sardines, is a great source of protein.Eggs are a great addition to your dog’s diet, as well. Because Pomeranians are small, only feed it half an egg three times a week.;
, Fruits and vegetables are essential for a balanced diet and should make up 30% of your Pomeranian's meal. Choose non-starchy vegetables, like spinach, green peas, carrots, broccoli (but in small amounts), cucumbers, and celery.Fruits, such as bananas, apples, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, raspberries, mango, papaya, watermelon, pineapple, and peaches, are a great addition to your Pomeranian's diet, as well., Carbohydrates, including starchy vegetables, are an essential part of a healthy diet, but should only make up 20% of your Pomeranian's diet. Including starchy veggies, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and winter squashes, like pumpkin, in your Pomeranian's diet is a great way to meet its daily intake of carbohydrates.Grains, such as oatmeal, brown or white rice, barley, pasta, and quinoa, are good choices for healthy carbohydrates.

, Make sure to add vitamin and mineral supplements to your Pomeranian's homemade meals. These supplements ensure that your dog is getting its daily vitamin intake. All homemade meals must be supplemented with calcium, oils, such as fish oil, cod liver oil, or plant oil, and vitamins, such as E,D, and A.Give 800 to 1,000 mg of calcium per pound of food.Fish oil helps regulate the immune system and reduce inflammation. Give 300 mg EPA and DHA per 20 to 30 pounds of body weight on days when you do not feed your dog fish.If you do not feed your Pomeranian much poultry fat, i.e., dark meat, then you should supplement its diet with a plant oil, such as a walnut, hempseed, or vegetable oil. Add one teaspoon of oil for every pound of meat., Heat olive oil or coconut oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add in a cubed or ground meat, and cook until browned, i.e., three to five minutes. Then, stir in your desired vegetables and cook thoroughly. Mix in any cooked carbohydrates until heated through.Make sure to cook vegetables thoroughly.
Cut the meat into nickel-sized cubes.

Analyze the first three ingredients.,
Choose a brand with whole, unprocessed foods.,
Be aware of “natural” brands.,
Ask other Pomeranian owners.",How to Choose All Natural Pet Food for Pomeranians2," When purchasing dry food, the first two to three ingredients should be animal proteins. Meat contains a lot of water. Therefore, the first two ingredients listed need to be proteins to ensure that your dog gets its daily intake. The proteins should be either whole, fresh meats, or meat meal.For example, the first two ingredients on the list should be “chicken meal,” “beef meal,” or “lamb meal.” Not “poultry meal” or “meat meal.” Unspecified meats on the ingredient list signify low-quality meat.

, Choose a dog food that contains whole, unprocessed grains, vegetables, fruits, and other food products. Unprocessed foods are more likely to have their vitamins, enzymes, and antioxidants intact as opposed to processed foods.Some examples of great all-natural brands are Champion petfoods', Orijen, Diamond's Taste of the Wild, Merrick, Artemis, Bench and Field, Natura's California Natural, and Wellpet's Wellness. You can find these at specialty pet stores, as well as regular pet stores.In general, try to avoid big name, commercial brands such as Beneful, Iams, Pedigree, Purina, and the like.

, Similar to human products that claim to be “natural,” dog foods that claim to be “natural” can still contain unnatural ingredients and products. These are ingredients like animal by-products, chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners.


Make sure to always check the ingredient list before buying your dog food.
Avoid brands that list ""meat"" as their main ingredient. It should be as specific as possible, for example, ""lamb meal.""

, Another great way to find out how to provide your Pomeranian with a quality diet is to ask other owners for suggestions. Find out what kind of dry (or wet) dog food Pomeranian owners feed their dogs, and why. It is worth asking why because there is a degree of variability in every Pomeranian's diet. Therefore, what works for their Pomeranian might not work for yours.


You can ask, ""What kind of food do you feed your dog, and why?"" ""Do you ever cook homemade meals for your dog?"" ""Which brand of dog food do you use, and why?"" or, ""Which brand did not work well, and why?""

"
"
Avoid brands that contain meat by-products.,
Stay away from brands that contain chemicals and preservatives.,
Choose a brand that is free of artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners.,
Consult your vet.",How to Choose All Natural Pet Food for Pomeranians3," By-products, as well as meat and bone meal, come from the rendering process. They can contain animal remains, fats, grease, and other food waste from restaurants and stores.Dog food that contains by-products, i.e., feed-grade ingredients, can also contain toxins, such as mold-produced mycotoxins and pentobarbital, an anesthetic used to euthanize animals.

, Commercial dog food often contains harmful chemical and preservatives. Stay away from products that contain BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, and propylene glycol (PG).Instead, opt for foods with natural preservatives, such as Vitamin C or E.

, Artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners are ingredients that can cause diseases and illnesses in dogs. Food that contains artificial coloring, for example, Blue 2, Red 40, and Yellow 5 and 6, should be avoided. Additionally, all the flavoring in your dog’s food should come from healthy meat and fats, and not artificial flavors.Avoid food with sweeteners, such as sucrose, Xylitol, ammoniated glycyrrhizin, and corn syrup, as well.

, Veterinarians are knowledgable about the brands that offer the best ingredients, and where to find these brands. They can also list specific brands to avoid. Therefore, your veterinarian will be able to recommend brands, as well as a diet regimen, that caters specifically to your Pomeranian's needs.


Schedule a trip to your vet's office. Bring a pen and paper so you can write down your veterinarian's recommendations.

Provide your dog with chewable toys.,
Give your dog a rawhide bone or chew to help remove plaque buildup.,
Give your dog a dental chew treat.,
Exam your dog’s mouth and teeth.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,
Have your veterinarian routinely exam your dog’s teeth.,
Take your dog to have its teeth cleaned professionally.",How to Choose Tartar Control Dog Treats," Giving your dog a durable chew toy can mechanically remove plaque buildup on your dog’s teeth and massage your dog’s gums. As the dog chews, the friction between the teeth and the toy can remove plaque and stimulate saliva production and will help whisk away any plaque buildup.These toys will also help keep your dog entertained and will exercise the dog’s jaw.Nylon or hard rubber chew toys are safe options and are recommended for their durability. Visit your local pet store and ask an expert what toy would be appropriate for your dog.Be sure to select a safe chew toy for your dog. Avoid giving your dog a chew toy that is small enough for your dog to swallow. If your dog starts to destroy the toy, discard it so your dog does not swallow any small pieces it may have chewed off.A textured, nylon or rubber bone is a popular toy that can help remove and prevent plaque buildup. The soft nubs on the surface of the toy help to clean your dog’s teeth as it chews.;
, When your dog chews on a rawhide, the friction between the treat and your dog’s teeth helps to lift plaque and minimize tartar buildup. This creates a smooth, polished surface on the tooth, which prevent plaque from clinging to your dog’s teeth.Do not give your dog real animal bones. These can file down or break your dog’s teeth and cause injury.If your dog chews aggressively, do not give it small rawhide chips or sticks. Your dog may choke on these small treats. Give aggressive chewers a larger rawhide bone instead, and monitor your dog as they chew the treat., A dental chew can help keep your dog’s teeth clean and can be a tasty treat for your dog. These treats come in a variety of shapes, such as crosses and toothbrush shapes, that help remove plaque from your dog’s teeth. They often come in a range of tasty flavors such as bacon, beef, and chicken. Mint flavors are also available to help freshen your dog’s breath. Be on the lookout for the Veterinary Oral Health's Council seal when looking for a dental treat to ensure the treat’s quality and effectiveness.


Some dental treats contain fatty acids, antioxidants, or other vitamins and nutrients that support your dog’s overall health.Dental treats can contain added sugars. Be sure to read the label and discuss the sugar content with your veterinarian. This is particularly important if you dog suffers from obesity or diabetes., Looking for signs of gum disease or other dental issues is important for your dog’s overall dental health. A routine, at-home check-up can help you keep track of any developing problems. Share your findings with your veterinarian to help prevent more serious health issues from developing.


Make sure your dog is comfortable while examining its mouth. Be gentle, speak to your dog in a calming voice, and give him praise or a treat afterward. With time and patience, your dog will get used to this examination routine.
Check the symmetry of your dog’s face. Notice if there is any swelling, discharge, or growths.
Gently pull back your dog’s lips and check both sides of its teeth and gums.If your dog’s gums are red, swollen, bleeding, or are sensitive to touch, your dog may have gingivitis.
A yellow or brown discoloration around the gumline may be tartar buildup.
Make note of chipped teeth or any bumps or masses within your dog’s mouth and discuss them with your veterinarian., Weekly brushing is an important step in keeping your dog’s mouth free from plaque and tartar accumulation. Use toothpaste and a toothbrush that are specifically designed for dogs. Place the brush inside your dog’s mouth at a 45-degree angle to its gumline, and gently move the brush across the outside surface of the dog’s teeth.


The tongue often keeps the inner surface of the dog’s teeth free from plaque, so there is no need to brush this section.
Give your dog praise or a treat when you have finished brushing its teeth., A routine examination of your dog’s teeth can help stop plaque and tartar buildup. Your veterinarian will examine your dog’s teeth, gums, tongue, and tonsils, as well as the salivary glands and the lymph nodes.A routine examination can help identity the early signs of plaque or tartar buildup, periodontal disease, mouth tumors, and other mouth problems.


Talk to your veterinarian about any specific problems you have noticed with your dog’s dental health. “I have noticed that my dog’s gumline often bleeds when I exam its mouth. What can we do to address this?”
Ask your veterinarian if your dog may be prone to any particular dental issues, and ask “How should I monitor that?” He or she will be able to target the issue and offer guidance for improving your dog’s dental care.

, If your dog has tartar buildup, daily brushing at home will not remove it as it strongly adheres to the teeth. Although it is an expensive procedure, your veterinarian will need to remove the tartar and polish the dog’s teeth to ensure your dog’s overall health.


A blood test will determine if your dog is healthy enough for this procedure. Under anesthesia, your veterinarian will provide a full cleaning beneath the dog’s gumline, will scrape away the tartar buildup, and will finish by polishing your dog’s teeth. The final polish will help prevent future plaque and tartar accumulations."

Consider your dog’s health.,
Get a food made for your dog’s activity level.,
Be cautious if your dog has allergies.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Learn about different brands.,
Read labels.,
Weigh your options.,
Try to get ahold of samples.,
Provide plenty of protein.,
Include healthy fats for your dog.,
Choose complex carbohydrates.,
Understand what the added ingredients mean.",How to Choose a Dry Dog Food," Unless your veterinarian has told you otherwise, you probably don’t need to spend a lot of extra money on fancy dog food with added ingredients. If your dog is a normal, healthy dog, most regular dry dog food will be fine for your dog’s overall health needs.Make sure your dog's food contains the essentials. A well-balanced dog food should have between 30 – 70% of carbohydrates, 18 – 25% protein, 10 – 15% fats, though these percentages will vary based on the dog's age and health. Foods should also contain essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A and E, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, chloride, sulfur, and potassium. Your dog's food should also contain water, even if it is dry food.It's a mistake to think that a particular brand's Basic/Budget food is markedly inferior to its Premium and Super Premium foods. In many cases it just means that the Basic/Budget food only has the (essential) ingredients that a dog definitely needs, without the bonus additional items — for which your dog may not have the slightest need.;
, There are many different kinds of food that cater to different types of dogs. Think about your dog and their particular energy needs and choose the dry food option that is most closely related to your dog’s lifestyle and needs.There are dry food options that are specifically formulated for older dogs who have lower activity levels, but may need more nutrients and vitamins.
There are dry foods made specifically for puppies whose higher activity levels. Constant activity means they require more nutrients that will fuel their energy.

, If your dog has known allergies, it's probably more important to pay attention to whether a food is hypo-allergenic or contains certain ingredients. Even then, it's not wise to get too hung up on this question unless your dog actually shows real observable and measurable signs of a dietary intolerance. There isn't any value in trying to preempt a problem — just be guided by your vet if you notice your dog seems particularly sensitive to certain products or ingredients.Some ingredients that most often cause allergic reactions in dogs include beef, dairy, chicken, lamb, corn, wheat, yeast, and soy.
Signs of an allergic reaction include itchy skin (especially around the face, feet, ears, and forelegs); hair loss; excessive scratching; or skin infections.

, Be sure to talk to your vet about any specific recommendations they might have about what food you should feed your dog. If your dog has any special health considerations, your veterinarian will be able to tell you what kind of food will be the best for your pup.

This will give you an opportunity to ask your vet any questions you might have. There is a lot of information out there and so many different brands to choose from. Talking to your vet will help allay any fears you might have about choosing the wrong type of food for your dog.

, There is a wide variety of dog foods available from various brands. Spend some time researching a few of them so you can settle on one that you like. Try to pick a brand that has different product levels available (like a Basic/Budget food, a Premium food, and a Super Premium food) so that you can stick with the same brand if you need to switch food types for a particular nutrition need your dog may have.


Try to start with the Premium level food, if your budget allows, as it typically has better quality products than the Basic food. There usually isn’t much need for your dog to eat the Super Premium food unless it has a specific dietary need and your veterinarian has recommended a higher quality food.
Look for a brand that has a wide range. This means looking for a range of foods at different prices (i.e. Super Premium, Premium, and Basic). This will make your testing much easier.If none of your chosen brand's foods suit your dog, then move on to another non-commercial brand that offers foods in different price brackets, and go through exactly the same process.

, When deciding on what dry dog food to purchase, spend some time reading the labels of the various food types and brands. This will give you some insight into what kind of product it is and how it will affect the health of your dog. Dog foods sold in the US must have the following: product name, net weight of the product, name and address of the manufacturer, guaranteed analysis, list of ingredients, the words “dog or cat food” (intended animal species), statement of nutritional adequacy, and feeding guidelines.If this information is not in the packaging, then you should not purchase the food.


Guaranteed analysis ensures that the product contains the minimum amounts of protein, fat, water, and fiber.
The ingredient list will tell you what ingredients are contained in the food. They are listed in descending order of weight.
Note if you see the same ingredient listed again and again but in different forms (e.g. corn, flaked corn, ground corn, screened corn, kibbled corn). This may make it appear as though there is less filler (in this case, corn) in the food than there actually is.
The statement of nutritional adequacy tells you how the food was tested (feeding, laboratory analysis, or formulation). Look for the statement “complete and balanced,” which means contains at least the minimum amount of each nutrient recommended by The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).
Feeding guidelines will tell you how much food to feed your dog based on their age and/or weight.
Avoid foods with the following ingredients: meat by-products, a generic fat source (e.g. ""animal fat""), artificial colors, sweeteners, and artificial preservatives (e.g. BHA, BHT, or ethoxyquin), Be aware that there is no such thing as ""the best dry dog food."" Rather, the best dry food is the one that suits your dog's particular needs, both in terms of nutrients and what your dog enjoys eating. This means reading labels and doing some trial and error testing.It may take you several months to land on the dry dog food that is right for your dog.
You should typically give a new food a few weeks during its trial period before deciding to switch to something else. This is enough time to really see how it affects your pup. If it appears to be causing an adverse reaction in your dog, then it is ok to switch to something else right away.
Don't suddenly switch out your dog's food for another brand, as this can cause stomach upset. Rather, gradually switch to a new food by mixing it with the old food. Start out feeding your dog 25% new food, 75% old food. After a couple days, move to 50% of each, then 25% old food and 75% new food, and finally 100% new food. This can be done over a period of about seven days., See whether it's possible for the brands to send you samples rather than you having to spend ridiculous amounts of money on big bags of food.Some companies (like Petsmart) have policies that will allow you to return opened bags of food that your dog does not like and exchange it for another type of food.

, Dogs are carnivores by nature and they need a protein-rich diet to maintain a healthy life. Dog food provides this protein by including meat, eggs, and dairy products as major ingredients in the food.Protein gives your dog the real, usable energy it needs to stay healthy and active. Energy from these types of food are converted into energy more effectively than energy obtained by eating carbs.
A puppy typically needs 28% of its diet to be comprised of protein.A normal adult dog should get 18% of its diet from protein.
A highly active dog should have protein make up 25% of its diet.

, Fats are necessary for your dog's health, and should make up about 10 – 15% of their diet. Good sources of fat include omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oils (herring, salmon, etc.) and flaxseed and canola oils, as well as omega-6 fatty acids, found in pork fat, poultry fat, as well as oils (safflower, sunflower, corn and soybean).Tallow and lard are not quality sources of fat for dogs and should be avoided.
Fats from table scraps or excessive treats can lead to health issues for your dog. Avoid giving your dog too many calories and make sure they get exercise to put that protein and fat to use., Carbs can provide a quick source of energy for your dog as well as fiber, and complex carbs can help keep your dog feeling full until their next meal. Try to avoid foods that contain refined grains or simple carbs, which have reduced nutritional value and can cause your dog's blood glucose levels to spike.Technically, your dog does not need carbohydrates in their diet — they could get by on just protein and fats. This doesn't mean, however, that your dog's body can't utilize or benefit from cabs. They can be an acceptable form of energy and nutrients, and their inclusion makes dog food more affordable.
Carbohydrates should make up between 30 – 70% of the nutrients found in the dog food, but no more than that.

, In Premium and Super Premium dry dog foods, there are usually bonus ingredients that may or may not be beneficial for your dog. You'll notice that in comparison to a brand's Basic/Budget food, the Premium and Super Premium foods have some great sounding bonus additions like herbs (which add to the taste and are said to aid digestion) or Glucosamine, Condroitin, and MSM (which are believed to be beneficial to your dog's joints).You should talk to your dog's veterinarian to determine if your dog needs these additional ingredients.

There are other additional bonus ingredients to be found in the more expensive foods, but they're too numerous to mention. These nutrients typically aren’t necessary unless your dog has a specific dietary need, as recommended by your veterinarian.
Some of these ingredients are assumed to provide some added benefit for your dog’s health, but there is usually no conclusive evidence to prove this. A case in point here is that while many people truly believe that Glucosamine, Condroitin, and MSM are great for their dogs' mobility (and maybe they are in some cases), there's still no absolutely conclusive scientific evidence to back this up and their effectiveness seems to be different for every dog.
Be aware that more is not always better, even when it comes to vitamins and nutrients. Dogs will have different dietary requirements, and over-supplementation may lead to health issues in an otherwise healthy dog.

Find the brand information.,
Identify the affected product.,
Keep samples of the recalled food.",How to Check Dog Food Recalls2," You need to know the specific food or treat variety that has been recalled. When a company recalls a food item, they will give you a specific flavor, variety, or type. This helps you identify the correct recalled item. Pay attention to the recall notice to see which specific product is affected.The specific flavor will be noted for a recall. After the brand name, they will specify if it is beef, chicken, or another flavor from the brand.

, Often, recalls cover only specific batches of the dog food or treats. When this is the case, the company will release a statement that includes additional information so you can get rid of the affected product.The product may give information, such as a flavor, variety, and a ""best before” date to look for on the packaging. Additionally, the affected item will be stamped with a code. When looking to see if your product is affected, check the code on the side of the packaging. For example, the company may recall the beef flavored canned food stamped with a six digit code with a best before date of 01/01/2020.
If you are unable to find any information on the specific codes or varieties for the recalled item, get rid of any of the recalled food you have. This ensures you are not feeding your dog contaminated food.

, Before throwing out all of the food, keep a small sample of the contaminated food in an airtight container. The FDA or company may want samples of the food from customers. You should also keep the barcodes from the bag."

Clean all dog bowls.",How to Check Dog Food Recalls3," If you have been feeding your dog a brand of food or treats that have been recalled, stop feeding them those items immediately. No matter the reason for the recall, you should not continue feeding your dog the food or treats.Contact the manufacturer if you have questions about the recalled product.

, Many times, foods are recalled because they are contaminated and can harm your dog. This means you should take your dog to the vet if they have ingested any of the recalled products. Even if your dog seems fine, take them to the vet just to make sure.Your dog may have been poisoned by the contaminated food or treat and show no symptoms. It is better to get them checked out than to risk your dog getting sick or even dying.
Watch your dog closely until you are sure all of the recalled food is out of their system.

, If you recently bought a recalled item, return the dog food containers or treats to the store. Many stores will give you a full refund since the product has been recalled.If you do not want to return the food, throw it away in a secure container so no dog can get to it.

, After your dog’s food has been recalled, make sure to wash all of the dog bowls and other dishes the food may have come in contact with. Clean around the dog’s eating area and change out the water, too.Some recalls may be due to bacteria or other contaminants, like Salmonella, which can not only make your dog sick, but your family as well.
Wash with hot water, soap, and a bleach solution.

You can help your older dog stay healthy and at an ideal weight by giving them raw vegetables as treats. Make sure the vegetables are cut into small pieces and only give them one treat at a time. Baby carrots, green beans, and broccoli are all good treat options for your pup.These treats are ideal because they have hardly any calories and will help your dog stay healthy. Senior dogs can also have low fiber issues so raw vegetable treats can ensure they get enough fiber in their diets.;
, Raw fruit is another healthy treat option for your dog that can be prepared easily at home. Cut up bananas, watermelon, and apples. Then, use them as treats to reward your dog for good behavior, giving them one treat at a time. Make sure there are no seeds in the fruit before you give them to your dog.You can also try frozen fruits, such as frozen blueberries or strawberries. Some dogs prefer frozen treats. As a bonus, frozen fruits can also keep your pup hydrated.
Do not give your dog grapes, as they can be toxic to dogs.

, If your dog tends to enjoy treats that have a little crunch, you can give them air popped popcorn with no butter or salt. Make sure the popcorn is small and is not too hard or tough for your dog’s teeth. You may chew a little bit of the popcorn first to make sure it is soft enough for your pup.Plain rice cakes can also make good, low calorie dog treats.

If it does not leave a mark, it is too hard for your dog’s teeth.You should avoid giving your dog any food that contains caffeine, such as chocolate or coffee, as they can be toxic for your pup.
You should also avoid giving your dog raisins or onions.

, Start by reading the label of the treats to make sure it contains ingredients that are organic and from natural sources. If there are any preservatives in the treats, they should be natural preservatives. There should not be any ingredients listed that you cannot identify, such as any chemicals or preservatives that are not natural.Avoid treats that contain artificial preservatives, colors, or additives.
Treats that contain locally sourced ingredients are ideal, as this often means the ingredients in the treats will be fresher.

, Treats that are high in fat can upset your older dog’s sensitive stomach and lead to unhealthy weight gain. Instead, go for treats that are low in fat, especially commercial treats that contain meat or meat ingredients. Check the ingredients listed on the package to ensure it lists whole meats, not just meat fat or added fat.For example, stay away from treats that list “chicken or beef fat, but no chicken or beef.” Opt for treats that are whole meat and list meat as a major ingredient.

, You should also check the list of ingredients on the label for ingredients like coconut oil, sweet potato, and chia. These ingredients help keep your dog energized and healthy.Look for antioxidants on the ingredients list, such as cranberries, blueberries, or dark leafy greens. Ingredients like pumpkin and green beans are also good for senior dogs and may be added to healthy commercial treats.

, Before you buy dog treats for your senior dog, you should do a little research on the manufacturer of the treats. Make sure there is a contact number for the manufacturer on the label as well as a website or a mailing address. You may look on the manufacturer’s website to make sure they are legitimate.


You can also search the manufacturer online to see if there are have been any negative reviews of their products or any reports of adverse effects on dogs due to their products. Check to make sure the treats are considered safe and healthy for older dogs.
Ask other pet owners about the manufacturer of the treats to see if they have had positive experiences feeding the treats to their pet.

, If you have any questions or concerns about your older dog’s health and giving them treats, you should speak to your vet. Ask your vet for recommendations for treats for your pet that will keep them healthy and happy. You may ask your vet, “What types of human food should I give my dog?” and “What types of commercial treats would you recommend for my dog?”Your vet may be able to recommend a specific treat brand or manufacturer that will suit your dog’s health needs. They may also be able to tell you which types of human food will work well for your dog’s digestion and health needs.

, You can request an allergy test from your vet for your pup. Make sure your senior dog is not allergic to dairy, gluten, corn, or soy before you give them any treats. You do not want to feed your dog any products that could lead to an allergic reaction.You should also ask your vet if your dog has any other health issues that you need to take into consideration before giving them treats. If your dog has a sensitive stomach, for example, you may avoid treats that are high in fat or sugar and opt for treats high in fiber instead.

, Ensuring that your senior dog is at a healthy weight is a good way to keep him healthy. Check your dog's weight monthly with six monthly vet health checks. Many vet clinics either have scales in the waiting area or a vet tech can weigh your dog for you.

"
Gradually switch your dog's food.,
Watch your dog carefully for any signs of gastrointestinal upset.,
Call your veterinarian if your dog becomes extremely ill.,
Weigh the pros and cons of wet food.,
Weigh the pros and cons of dry food.,
Consider your dog’s health.,
Pick a quality food.",How to Change Dog Food," Most healthy dogs can have their food switched over a gradual seven day transition. Switching food gradually helps the dog’s body adjust to the new food. Follow this feeding schedule:Day 1: Feed 75% of the old food mixed with 25% of the new food in each serving.
Day 2: Feed 60% of the old food mixed with 40% of the new food in each serving.
Day 3: Feed 50% of the old food mixed with 50% of the new food in each serving.
Day 4: Feed 40% of the old food mixed with 60% of the new food in each serving.
Day 5: Feed 25% of the old food mixed with 75% of the new food in each serving.
Day 6: Feed 100% of the new food.;
, This may mean watching your dog go to the bathroom so you don’t miss any signs. These signs include vomiting, diarrhea, and gas.If you notice these signs, slow down the process of switching food and step back one day in the process. For example, if you are feeding a 50-50 mix of the food, back it down to 60% of old food to 40% of the new food and keep it at this ratio for an extra day before going on to the next step. Then extend the days held at each step to two or three before proceeding further. Some dogs need more time to adapt to the new food.
If your dog gets a moderate case of diarrhea try to treat the condition. Some experts suggest adding pureed pumpkin to your dog's food. Add about two teaspoons to a small dogs meal or two tablespoons to a large dog's meal.Most dogs will have no problem adjusting to the new food as long as the time is taken to gradually acclimate their bodies to the new food.

, There is a difference between a little gastrointestinal distress and a more extreme physical reaction to a food change. If at any time you notice these signs call your veterinarian for advice:


Vomiting more than three times or unremitting vomiting
Vomit or diarrhea with blood
Uncontrolled diarrhea (accidents in the house)
Lethargy or lack of energy
Painful abdomen (cries when belly touched, pacing, or stretching front legs out while rear end is up)

, There are two basic types of dog food: wet and dry. Each type of dog food has its good points and its bad points. For wet food these include:Pros include a higher water content (which is good for dogs that don’t drink enough water), a stronger smell (which is good for those dogs with poor appetites), and it is softer (which is good for dogs with mouth or teeth problems).
Negatives include that it is messier to feed, it is generally more expensive in the long run, it has a shorter shelf life once opened, and in dogs with dental problems soft food can make dental disease worse.

, Like wet food, dry food has good and bad aspects. These advantages and disadvantages include:Pros include that it is easy to store, good for teeth health (as the kibble can scrape off plaque), has a longer shelf life (as long as it is stored properly), doesn’t spoil as easily, and is generally less expensive to feed.
Cons include that is doesn't have as much moisture content as wet food, it is not as strong smelling (so for those dogs with poor appetites it won’t be as appealing), and it's harder to chew for dogs with sore teeth and gums.

, While most healthy dogs can handle a change in food as long as the change is done properly, you will not want to change the food of dogs with chronic health problems. Many times the main treatment for dogs with chronic illness is their food. These foods are usually called prescription type foods and generally have years of careful research behind them to make sure they provide all the nutrients a sick dog needs while helping to control the illness.Dogs with these illnesses should only have their food switched under the advice of a veterinarian:


Skin or other allergies
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Diabetes
Heart disease
Bladder disease: stones or crystals
Gastrointestinal illness

, Whether you have chosen dry or wet food, buy the best food you can for your dog. Look for meat as the top two or three ingredients on the dog food label.

Do not feed your dog near children.,
Create separate spaces for multiple dogs.,
Don’t feed your dog in the kitchen.,
Avoid feeding your dog outside.,
Designate a specific area for feeding.,
Consider the cleanup.,
Feed your dog in or near its crate.,
Consider the mudroom or laundry room.,
Consider your household’s needs and schedule.,
Try time limited feeding.,
Consider amount limited feeding.,
Avoid free feeding.",How to Choose a Place for Your Dog to Eat," Set up a space to feed your dog that is separate from where your children will be during feedings. Teach children to never go near a dog’s food or the dog while it is eating or drinking. It is common for children to suffer from dog bites because the dog is guarding its food and water., If you have more than one dog, you should feed them separately. Place the dogs’ bowls in separate places. If one or more of the dogs is aggressive, you should feed them in separate rooms.Maintain control over the food, and call each dog separately to its bowl.
Once the dogs have finished eating, remove the bowls from the feeding areas.

, If possible, you should avoid feeding your dog in the kitchen. Dry pet food, treats, and supplements can be prone to contamination with Salmonella, which can make both pets and people sick. Avoiding feeding your dog in the kitchen will lessen your chances of becoming ill from germs found in pet food., Feeding your dog outdoors can welcome unwanted animals, parasites, and rodents to set up shop in or near your pet’s food and feeding area. If your dog lives indoors, you should avoid feeding it outside for these reasons.


If your dog lives outside, make sure you remove your dog’s feeding dish and any remaining food after each feeding.

, Be consistent with there you feed your dog. You should feed your dog in the same place every day. Doing so maintains rhythm and routine in your dog’s life. Set up a space with a water bowl, space for a food bowl, and a mat for easy cleanup.

, When deciding on a place to feed your dog, you should think about how easy it will be to clean up food-related messes in the space you choose. Consider feeding your dog in a room with tile, laminate, wood, or linoleum floors instead of a carpeted area. These floor types will make cleaning up messes much easier than their carpeted counterparts.

, If you choose to crate your dog, you should consider feeding it inside or near the crate. Feeding your dog regular meals in or near its crate will help your dog adapt to the crate, and gain a sense of confidence and comfort. It also creates a centralized space for messes to be made, making cleanup easier for dog owners., Feeding your dog in the mudroom or laundry room can be a great choice for many individuals and families. These spaces usually have doors so that you can separate your pet from children or other dogs while it eats. Mud rooms and laundry rooms are also more likely to have floor types that are easy to clean, such as tile or linoleum., Before you choose a feeding method for your dog, you should think about the needs and makeup of the household. For example, if you have more than one dog, you should take this into consideration when choosing a method. You should also consider your availability to feed the dog.


For example, you should take account of when your dog will need to eat and whether you will be home for scheduled feeding times.

, Time limited-feeding involves setting out food for your dog, allowing the dog to eat, and then removing the food after a set amount of time, usually 10-20 minutes. This method permits the dog to eat until it's full, but prevents ongoing grazing.This method works well for households with more than one dog, as it can prevent scuffles over food that is left out beyond the immediate mealtime.

, Amount limited feeding consists of providing your dog with a set amount of food and allowing the dog to choose when it consumes the food. When you measure out food at a given meal time, you are giving your dog control over its pace of eating.This method works well for households that have only one dog but can cause conflict if you have multiple dogs who may try to consume their friend’s food.

, Free feeding refers to making food available to your dog at all times. This allows the dog to choose when and how much they eat. While this is an easy choice for pet owners, there are many pitfalls to this method. Free feeding can lead to obesity in dogs, and leaving food out can be an invitation for insects, rodents, and bacteria to thrive in your dog’s food."
"
Reward the dog when it behaves by giving the dog something it really likes.,
Try using other positive reinforcements instead of treats.,
Repeat training exercises and commands several times in a day.",How to Train a Stubborn Dog1," Are you using a high enough reward for your dog? It doesn't matter if we like the item; your dog has to love it.The most common reward is a treat. Try boiled chicken, string cheese, or chicken hot dogs. You could try a bone or dog treat. You want to reward the dog when it responds to your command and behaves. If the dog ignores or rejects your command, no treat.If treats are the preferred item, keep them handy so that you can practice throughout the day, such as anytime you get up for a drink/snack or bathroom break.
You could toss the treat on the ground so the dog has to get up. Then, wait again until the dog chooses to sit, without any encouragement from you. When the dog does, say, ""Yes!"" in a happy tone, and deliver a super yummy treat. Repeat this 5 or 6 times.;
, Sometimes a dog is not food driven, so consider whether they are into a ball or a tug toy. Other dogs just love attention. You have to figure out what makes your dog happiest, and then use that as their reward.Praise is simply a happy, excited voice and gentle touching. This is the cheapest and easiest reward to offer. You could also use a favorite toy as a reward.Touch is another great way to reward a dog. Some dogs respond to being petted or their tummies being rubbed. A brisk 10-minute walk can also be a reward if you are able.

, Be very consistent and repetitive. A solid training program takes a minimum of two years of consistent and organized training.


You will get as much out of your dog as you put into them. If we say our dogs are ""stubborn,"" we are basically making excuses for not learning how to teach our dogs to understand us.
Ensure everyone around the dog has the same rules and expectations. Everyone in the household should use the same commands for tricks and set out the same limitations. Don't feel sorry for the dog and violate your own rules at times. The dog will learn the wrong lesson.

"
"
Be assertive with the dog to establish control, but don’t use force.,
Train your dog while walking him or her.,
Start with the easiest commands.,
Be patient, and teach your dog patience.",How to Train a Stubborn Dog2," Convincing the dog that you are in control is vital. This shouldn't be done through cruelty, such as beating or hitting the dog.


It is done by simply stepping in front of the dog, and making it back up and allowing you to go through a doorway first. It is done by taking a bone/toy away from the dog when you want it. Don't play when your dog wants you to; play when you want to, and stop when you want to.
Use your voice, but understand that dogs respond to tone and emotion as much as words.Change the tone of your voice appropriately - for example, lighthearted and higher to say well done, and serious and deeper for commands and when the dog isn't doing as it should. A firm no or nope is as important as praising a puppy or dog for doing things properly.

, You can establish control with a dog while walking the dog with a leash. Don't let the dog take the lead or go off leash.Take the dog for long walks. Make sure you are either walking ahead of the dog or side-to-side. A stubborn dog always thinks he is the leader, and not you.
Whenever you train a dog, she or he is training you. People running after their dog on a long leash is an example of a well-trained human to a dog. It is a game of patience, and the more patient one wins, and the less patient one loses. A tired dog, though, might be easier to train at home when you get back.

, The easiest command to teach is ""sit."" Once they learn a command, the others will come a little easier. They will start to realize that will get praise and a treat if they can figure out what you are trying to tell them.


Use audible and visual commands. Say ""sit"" and make some sort of hand gesture. Make sure to do the same thing every time or you will confuse the dog and make the process longer.
In the beginning, reward the dog if it gets close to sitting. Eventually you can work your way to a full sit. However, once they execute a full sit, you should not reward them for a half-hearted sit.
Think of ways to break up a trick or command to make it easier for the dog to learn. Don't make the dog roll over for the first trick or it will be too complicated.

, Teach the dog to wait for the reward. Don't let them sit for a split-second, and then bounce around like a hooligan. The reward only occurs while they are calm and obeying.


Do not show emotion or frustration, as the dog will pick up on this, and it won’t help. Keep calm and remember your dog is doing their best. Show the dog love.Dogs will never obey an unstable person. If you are scared, your dog might get dominant towards you and, if you are excited, he or she will not take you seriously. If you are aggressive, he or she will be confused about what to do and won't follow this kind of energy.

"
"
Train the dog in a place with low distraction.,
Enroll the dog in obedience classes.,
Try to figure out why the dog is remaining stubborn.",How to Train a Stubborn Dog3," What is competing for your dog's attention? Is it a squirrel? Is it a vacuum cleaner? A particular tempting pile to roll in? When you are first introducing a behavior, start in a familiar, low distraction place, like your house.


Keep your lessons short (5 minutes or less). Your dog has a small brain and won’t be able to concentrate for very long.
Never train more than one dog at a time. Dogs are easily distracted, and another dog in the area doesn't help your efforts. Dogs always display different behavior when they are around other dogs (whether they are a familiar dog to them or not). They might end up playing with the other dog more than they are listening to you.

, Another option (if available) is enrolling the dog in “fun” classes, where dog training experts will help you with a stubborn dog.You could also hire a dog trainer to come to your home. Check with your local veterinarian for references.
Try using a clicker with the dog. You need to associate your clicker with a treat, so your dog knows that a reward is waiting when you use the clicker and say a command.

, Maybe the dog feels like he is being bullied and has shut himself away from any input (this is especially common in sensitive dogs, and dog breeds that are usually sensitive).


Maybe the dog is slower by nature (some dogs are just not as active as some other dogs; if you have a dog that usually moves slowly, don’t expect him to do fast tricks.)
Consider whether the dog is lazy or sick (dogs, like people, will be less motivated to do things on hot days, for example, or when they are not feeling well).
Be honest about whether the dog simply does not understand what the owner wants (some things, like sentences, can seem very clear to humans but are not understandable to a dog despite a dog's best intentions). Maybe there is nothing in it for the dog (dogs, like humans, do things because there is something to be gained from it; dogs expect less - a treat, ball or a pat is to them what a whole salary is to a human).

"
"
Decide between the types of treats.,
Consider your dog's health.,
Check the country of origin.,
Check for recalled treats.",How to Choose Dog Treats1," Just like with treats for humans, there are a variety of treat types that you can buy for your dog. The kind you buy will depend on what your dog likes and the benefits of each type of treat. These treats include:


Dried kibble type treats, which are biscuit type treats that come in a variety of flavors.
Dental treats, which have ingredients and textures that help clean your dog's teeth and require more chewing
Jerky and chewy treats, which are typically made of pressed, dried strips of beef, chicken, or pork
Natural treats, which are made from all natural ingredients
Rawhide, which are dried strips of animal hides, typically beef, that have been pressed into various shapes
Bones, which are pieces of hard bone typically from cattle
Various other treats, such as pizzles, pigs ears, and dried vegetable leathers;
, You need to figure out if there are treats that are better for your dog depending on his health. Your dog may need special treats if he has certain chronic conditions such liver, kidney, or heart disease, food allergies, ingredient intolerances, or dental problems.


For example, there are treats with Glucosamine and Chondroitin specifically for dogs with arthritis, which come in jerky, rawhide, and chewy forms.0
If your dog has a chronic issue, ask your vet for treat recommendations.

, The United States regulates the ingredients in and making of dog treats. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) made it the law to make dog treats with only good, safe ingredients and must reflect what is listed on the labels. Look on the back of the treat bag to find the country of origin. If it is anywhere other than the US, look into the dog treat creating standards in that country before buying them.
China has been found to manufacture dog treats with ingredients that are not safe for dog, so never buy treats made in China., Even with regulations on treats, there may be recalls on treats. There is online database that you can check to make sure that the treats you buy your dog have not been recalled."

Choose dry dog food if you are on a budget.,
Go for dry food if you are away from home often.,
Pick dry food for its potential health benefits.,
Stay away from low quality dry food.,
Avoid dry food if your dog has allergies.",How to Choose Between Dry or Canned Dog Food1," One of the major pros of dry dog food is that it is budget friendly, as a bag of dry dog food is relatively cheap. Dry dog food is known as “kibble” and often comes in the form of small pellets that you pour into your dog’s food bowl. Kibble has a long shelf life, so if you buy dry dog food in bulk, you may not have to go shopping that often for food.Dry dog food is also ideal if you do not have a lot of fridge space to store your dog’s food. Unlike canned dog food, you can simply roll up the bag of dry dog food once it is opened and store it on a shelf. You do not need to worry about finding room in the fridge to keep the food cold.;
, Dry dog food can also be ideal if you do not want to have to keep a close eye on your dog’s food bowl. You can leave out dry dog food in your pet’s bowl without the risk of it spoiling. You may fill your dog’s bowl with enough food for an entire day or for several days, depending on the size and appetite of your dog.This could be very convenient if you tend to take brief trips away from home and do not want to have to worry about your dog’s food spoiling. This may also work well if you tend to work long hours and do not have the time to check on your dog’s food throughout the day.

, Some dry dog food has been formulated to maintain your dog’s oral health and improve your dog’s teeth. You may opt for dry dog food that has these properties, especially if your dog has dental issues.Keep in mind some pet experts are skeptical of this potential health benefit in dry dog food. You should speak to your vet about this health benefit before you give your dog dry food, especially if if is a deciding factor for you as an owner., There is often a lower meat protein and natural fat content in dry dog food compared to canned dog food. Dry dog food may also have a higher carbohydrate content, which can be unhealthy for your dog. If you decide to go with dry dog food, you should look for one that is higher quality, with a more balanced amount of meat protein and natural fat.Some dry dog foods are sprayed with animal fat, which is an unnecessary and unhealthy ingredient in your dog’s food. There may also be synthetic preservatives and artificial flavorings or colorings in dry food as well.
You should check the label of the dry dog food for a list of ingredients. If the first ingredient is not meat or meat protein, it may not be very good quality. You should also watch for any additives or preservatives listed in the ingredients.

, You should be wary of dry dog food if your dog has allergies to gluten or dairy, as many dry dog foods contain a high amount of gluten and dairy. If you do opt for dry dog food for your pet, make it sure it is low in gluten or dairy.Always consult with your vet before giving dry dog food to your pup if he is prone to allergies. You do not want to trigger any allergic reactions or issues in your dog.
You should read the label of the dry dog food to check for any ingredients that may be allergens, such as wheat or dairy.

Bond with your puppy.,
Let them interact with other dogs.,
Encourage interaction with other humans.,
Work on obedience.,
Scatter treats.,
Walk your dog in the woods.,
Train with raw meat.,
Get the puppy used to the smell of squirrels.,
Use a caged squirrel.,
Play catch-and-release.,
Train your dog for gunfire.,
Take your puppy hunting.",How to Train a Squirrel Dog," Start this process immediately after bringing your puppy home. Pet and groom them regularly to get them used to physical contact. Play games like fetch and hide-and-seek to develop their loyalty to you. This will be helpful when giving them hunting commands.Games will also sharpen their hunting skills., This is important if you plan to go squirrel hunting with other dogs. Dogs learn new things very easily between the ages of three weeks and 12 weeks. During this time, allow as much contact with other dogs as possible. Make sure the other dogs are properly vaccinated and protected against heartworm if your pup has not received all their shots yet. Reward your pup treats to form positive connections with these experiences., If you hunt with friends, even occasionally, your puppy should be comfortable around other humans. Invite your hunting buddies over, or bring your puppy to their houses. Begin this process before the age of 12 weeks., Begin obedience training at around 8 to 12 weeks old. Start with basic commands like “Come,” “Sit,” and “Stay.” Work up to more advanced commands like “Squirrel” and “Tree.” Start by leading your leashed pup to a tree and saying, “Tree” in an assertive voice. When you see squirrels, point to them and say, “Squirrel.” Reward them with treats to make this a positive experience.


Puppies have a very short attention span from birth to about 20 weeks. Don’t expect your commands to work for more than a minute or two during this time., Dogs are born with incredible scent-tracking abilities, but hunting dogs need to rely on them constantly.Before the age of 12 weeks, start by making a trail of dog treats in the house or in the yard. Sharpen the pup’s skills by hiding treats behind furniture or under rocks. This will help to sharpen their sense of small.

, Around the age of 12 to 14 weeks old, start taking your puppy on short walks through the woods. Make each trip about 10 to 30 minutes. This allows the puppy to get ""woods wise"" (becoming familiar and comfortable with the different sights, sounds, and smells of the woods).

, Tie a piece of meat to a string or leash, and drag it around the yard. This will create a scent path for the dog to follow. Start with easy distances of about 10 yards (9.14m) in a straight line. Gradually increase this difficulty by creating longer distances of curved paths. When your pup becomes really skilled, take the training into the woods. Reward your pup by leaving a small number of treats on the on the path.Don’t let your dog eat the meat to avoid the risk of bacterial poisoning.

, Around the age of three to six months old, start training with the pup with squirrel tails, hides, or dead squirrels. Use this time to train the pup to look up trees at the decoy and alert you when they find it. When your pup starts barking, reward them with treats., This step is useful if you have limited resources for getting the pup into an area with squirrels. Trap and place a live squirrel in a cage. Set the caged squirrel in an elevated location like a stump, picnic table, or brush. Casually walk your pup near the area where the caged squirrel is located. As the pup’s curiosity increases, they’ll move in closer to check it out. Once they start barking, pet and encourage them.


You can also do this with the caged squirrel having a rope tied to it. The rope will allow you to raise the squirrel up a tree so you can get the pup barking up.Once the pup consistently barks at a caged squirrel, move on to the next step. Be careful to not overdo the caged squirrel. Once or twice is plenty!
You can skip this step if the puppy already barks up at a wild squirrel.

, Turn a caged squirrel loose in an area where the squirrel's choices of trees are limited. Let the pup chase and tree the squirrel. Even if they don’t tree, reward the pup with treats and praise.


Never release a caged squirrel more than a couple of times.

, When your pup is about 14 weeks old, begin to add sporadic gunfire into outdoor activities. Start by having a friend fire a low-volume pistol loaded with blanks from a distance. Reward your dog with treats to train them to anticipate the sound. Gradually decrease the distance, firing the gun into the air. Eventually replace the blanks with real bullets or shells., Your pup should be ready for the hunt by age five or six months. Start with several short sessions per week. Gradually build up to longer, less frequent sessions. Always reward your dog with treats and praise afterward."

Consider hiring a trainer of you don’t meet specific qualifications. You should also consider which jobs your dog’s breed and personality qualify them for.For example:


You should have experience training specific kinds of service dogs. Experience with allergy alert dogs does not qualify you to train a hearing dog.
Working as a medical professional or caregiver doesn’t necessarily qualify you to train service dogs. Experience caring for diabetics might not qualify you to train a diabetic assistance dog.
If you want your dog to be a brace/mobility support dog, they must stand at least 23 inches (58 cm) tall and weigh at least 55 pounds (25 kg).A keen sense of smell is key for an allergy alert or diabetic alert dog.;
, As with any new pet, service dogs require attention that you must take care of during their first few months. These include:


Housebreaking. This is requirement for all service dogs.Start housebreaking your dog when they’re six weeks old.
Spaying and neutering. Neutering makes males less aggressive and prevents females from going into heat on the job. Have your dog sterilized between the ages of eight weeks and six months.Determining their age. A dog must be at least six months old to become a service dog. Although there’s no maximum age, avoid training senior dogs for physically demanding jobs.The annual physical. Schedule heart, eye, joint, and other breed-appropriate tests. Have your dog vaccinated and put on heartworm prevention medication.

If you want your dog trained for mobility assistance, physical fitness and strength are especially important.
Don’t consider your dog for service training if they have joint problems, bone density issues, or diabetes. Let them live as pampered companions instead!, Schedule tests given by the American Temperament Testing Society (ATTS) if you live near a testing location.Otherwise, schedule tests at your local animal shelter, or ask your vet for recommendations.Service dogs are tested on their sensitivity to noise, sensitivity to pain, and their ability to fetch an object and bring it back. Dogs who pass these tests then go for a 30-day evaluation period. Trainers take them into busy public places to evaluate their reactions to noise, crowds, and other factors that might agitate them. If they pass, they may proceed to further train for service.Sometimes, specific personalities determine what kind of service a dog will go into. For example:


Good fetchers usually make a good guide dogs.Dogs who react keenly to sound make good hearing dogs.Dogs who can tolerate frequent mood swings make good companions for dementia patients., Develop objectives and steps toward the Public Access Test. Make a list of manners, tasks, and other goals that your dog needs to achieve. Set dates for these objectives. For example, you could aim to have Fido trained at retrieving in four weeks. As you train, take notes, and review them regularly.

, In addition to basic commands, train your dog to obey more advanced commands like “Take it” and “Alert.” Use an assertive, yet calm, tone when giving commands. When your dog gets used to verbal commands, train them to obey hand signals.Be patient with younger dogs in the beginning, as they have shorter attention spans.

, Service dogs require frequent training and brush-ups even after they qualify. Dedicate at least 30 of those hours to public outings to get your dog comfortable around other people.Service dogs need to be trained in the following kinds of tasks:


Tugging: opening doors and drawers, removing shoes, dragging laundry to the washing machine.
Retrieving objects such as the phone, medicine, and beverages.
Carrying: bringing objects to their partners, paying for items at counters, moving objects between locations.
Nudging: shutting doors, flipping light switches, calling emergency services.
Pawing: shutting doors, pushing elevator buttons, turning on lamps.
Bracing: helping their partner turn in bed, preventing falls, helping partner walk from wheelchair to seat.
Harnessing: opening heavy doors, transporting objects like books, preventing their partner from stumbling.
Medical assistance: fetching medicine/medical devices, helping their partner cough when no suction devices are available, letting emergency services into the house., Use a rope that you’ll eventually tie to the refrigerator door as a door pull. Introduce your dog to the rope by allowing them to sniff and become familiar with it. Pick up the rope and tell them to take it. Play a tug-of-war game to practice tugging doors open. Make sure the dog’s head forms a straight line with the rest of their body. Practice this routine until the dog can tug smoothly until the rope is released. When your dog has mastered these steps:


Tie the rope to the refrigerator door. The dog should be able to reach the rope with all four paws on the floor.
Call them to the fridge. Hold the rope out, and tell them to take it.
Help your dog tug the door open on the first few tries.
When the door is open, click your clicker and give your dog a treat.
Practice until your dog can open the door without help., Choose a beverage in a textured and contoured bottle for your dog to retrieve. Empty the bottle and let your dog to get used to it through gentle play. Use the clicker to prevent your dog from turning the bottle into a chew toy. When they’ve mastered this:


Place the bottle on a shelf in the fridge your dog can reach with all paws on the floor.
Call your dog to the fridge. Open and prop the fridge door. Point out the bottle, and tell them to take it.
Tell your dog to give the bottle back to you. Reward them with treats.
Repeat training until your dog can open the fridge and retrieve the bottle without help. Leave the bottle in the same place so that your dog will be able to find it without difficulty each time., Continue with the fridge and bottle task, adding this step after your dog has mastered retrieval. Click the clicker and tell your dog to give you the bottle. Reward them with a treat.


During each session, stand farther away from the fridge.
Continue to increase the distance between the two of you until they can bring the bottle to you in another room., This will train your dog in nudge- and paw-based tasks. Put your dog on a leash if they won’t stay near you without one. Sit or stand and face your dog. Click the clicker and give your dog a treat for making eye contact with you. Repeat this two or three times. Then, show your dog a treat and enclose it in a closed fist. Have them nudge your fist with their nose. Click and treat. After your dog has mastered this step:


Continue to enclose a treat in your fist. Train your dog only to nudge with a closed mouth. Click and treat for reinforcement.
Work up to clicking when your dog nudges your fist. Open your hand and reward them.
As your dog masters nudging, move your fist to the left and right, up and down.
Gradually increase the distance between the two of you until you get about 3 feet (0.91 m) between you.Apply this task to the fridge/bottle activity by teaching your dog to nudge the door closed. Use a sticky note to mark the target.Switch the focus from the nose to the paws to teach paw-based tasks. Target a wooden door to any interior room with a sticky note. Place the sticky note at the edge of the door and at front-paw height for your dog. Use the same steps you used in nudge-training.Use nudge training when teaching your dog to close glass doors. Paw training on glass can lead to broken glass and serious injuries.

, Bracing-based tasks, harness-based tasks, and medical assistance tasks require the work of skilled professionals.Look for skilled, accredited trainers and training programs through Assistance Dogs International’s (ADI) interactive map. Click on your region of the world. Choose your country and state/province from the provided drop-down lists. The site will provide the contact information of a person or group in your area., Service dog owners are bound to several guidelines and laws. Familiarize yourself with your local dog ordinances, such as leash laws. Keep your dog up-to-date on vaccinations and yearly physical examinations. Groom and bathe them regularly. Teach others about the rights of service animals., The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) doesn’t require certification for service animals. Certification is simply a vest, harness, ID card, or other visible marker identifying your dog as a service animal. This lets you access public places that normally don’t allow companion animals while keeping your illness or disability private.The Public Access Test, on the other hand, is required for service animals. Make sure the organization that tests your dog is accredited with ADI.
Laws vary from one country to another. If you live outside the U.S., look up the legal requirements of service dogs, their trainers, and their partners.

, Visit ADI at http://www.assistancedogsinternational.org/standards/public-access-test. Scroll to the bottom left of the page, and click “Members Search.” This will give you a list of the accredited members and candidates that can administer the test. To find a location near you:

Scroll down slowly to find an organization near you.
Click on their website, call the number, or send an email to the listed address. Ask for the next available dates and times they will be conducting the test.You might be required to do a “demo” before taking the actual test. This will usually consist of three tasks that the organization will assess to see if you and your dog are ready for the next step. If your dog has been trained in medical alert tasks, be prepared to submit a video of your dog performing them.Ask the organization if they record the test. If not, have the test recorded and keep it available at all times. You might need proof in the future that you and your dog passed., During the test, you and your dog will be assessed as a team. Use the following checklist to prepare.


Make sure your dog can

Perform the mandatory tasks.
Obey basic and advanced commands.
Avoid begging for food or eating food that falls on the floor.
Avoid being aggressive toward people and other animals.
Avoid barking or becoming agitated among loud noises or in crowded spaces.


You will be tested on

Unloading your dog into your vehicle.
Entering public spaces.
Keeping control of your dog no matter the situation.
Retrieving a dropped leash.
Calmly handling incidents of possible discrimination.
Loading your dog back into your vehicle., After you and your dog pass the Public Access Test, visit the United States Service Dog Registry at http://www.usservicedogregistry.org/. Click the “Register” tab (second from the left). If you don’t have an account, click the “Next” button on the left. Read the fine print. If you agree to the terms, enter the required information. After that, you’ll be assigned a free 10-digit identification code for your dog and a public profile page. Keep this code on you at all times if you choose not to certify your dog.If you live outside the U.S., search the web using the keywords “service dog (or assistance dog) registration” and the name of your country.

, If you live in the U.S. and choose to take this step, shop around first. Ask the assessor of your Public Access Test for recommendations of suppliers. Different suppliers charge different prices for items that mark your dog as a service animal. Be prepared to declare that you qualify for a service animal under national law. You might have to enter information like your dog’s ID number before proceeding to checkout.

Determine if your dog has a medical condition.,
Choose good training times.,
Let your dog set the pace.,
Physically support your dog.,
Introduce your dog to the stairs.,
Lure your dog onto the first step.,
Motivate your dog to get back down.,
Praise your dog's efforts.",How to Train a Scared Dog to Go Down the Stairs," If your dog continues to refuse using the stairs or if your dog was happy, but is now afraid, have him examined by a veterinarian. Your dog may have a medical condition like arthritis, elbow or hip dysplasia, disc disease, or muscular weakness that can make it difficult for him to handle the extreme angles of climbing stairs.


If you suspect your dog is in pain or has medical reason to fear stairs, you may want to talk with the vet before you begin retraining.;
, Your dog will be more receptive to training if you choose a time when he's alert and content. Avoid training your dog if he'd rather be out for a walk, is overly tired, or needs to eat. You should also break training into several small sessions of about ten minutes each. Doing so will keep your dog's interest.You may want to time the training sessions to fall right before a walk or play session outside. This way, your dog will look forward to training because he knows he'll get to run around afterwards.

, Watch your dog during each training session. Keep practicing as long as your dog wants to. Encourage your dog and reward each small step and improvement. If your dog seems distracted or loses interest, take a break. Never force your dog to train or use the stairs. This will only make him dislike the stairs even more.Forcing your dog to use the stairs could make him aggressive out of fear. He may bite, bark, or snap to show you that he's afraid of the stairs.

, Your dog may fear using the stairs if he's fallen down them in the past. To help him, consider making a sling out of a towel to provide physical support. It can also make him feel safer, since you can catch him if he slips.This is especially helpful if your dog fell because of issues with arthritis or another condition.


To make the sling, simply fold a towel length-wise and slide it under your dog's belly. Gold the two towel ends together at the top. This will gently support your dog to help him up and down the stairs.Another option is to take a sturdy, reusable shopping bag and cut it down the sides so that it lays flat, with a handle on each end. Slip this under your dog's belly and hold onto the handles to support him.Practice using the sling on non-slippery steps and a small staircase.

, Ideally, your dog should be socialized to the stairs when he's a puppy.Fortunately, if he wasn't, your adult dog can be introduced to the stairs in the same way as a puppy. Look at your dog's size and decide on an appropriate start. For example, if you have a large breed dog, take him over to a regular house stair. If you have a miniature or toy dog, stack up two or three books to make shallow steps.


If using books, make sure the cover is not slippery and they are stable. Or, wrap the books in towels to give your dog some traction.

, Place a treat that your dog enjoys on the first step. This will make him interested in climbing up the stair. Encourage him to step up and get the treat. Use kind words spoken in a soft voice, especially when he makes an exploratory move like moving his paw onto the step. Once he jumps onto the first step, give him the reward and praise.For example, say, ""Go on boy. Get it."" When he does jump up, you could reward him and say, ""Brave dog!""

, Your dog may feel stranded up on the stair, so lure him back down with a treat. Have your dog practice going up and down the first step over several training sessions. Eventually, your dog should go up and down the first step confidently. At that point, start working on the second step.


If your dog is hesitant to go back down, you might want to make the drop from the step to the ground shallower. For example, set several books on the ground and place the treat on top of them., Don't feel like you can only reward your dog when he successfully climbs the stairs. Instead, reward and encourage small improvements like looking towards the step or touching it with a paw. You should be helping your dog build positive associations with the stairs. This will reduce his anxiety.Try to make the stairs fun for your dog. Treat training like a game and your dog will be more likely to try climbing them.

React consistently to bites.,
Use a taste deterrent to keep your puppy from biting.,
Redirect your puppy's attention using teething toys.,
Play safely while you supervise training.,
Use a water spray bottle in severe cases.,
Reward good behavior.,
Understand how puppies usually learn about biting.,
Realize the importance of teaching your dog not to bite.,
Take safety precautions if your puppy bites.",How to Train a Puppy Not to Bite," Every time your puppy bites, say ""NO!"" in a firm voice. Then just walk away and ignore the puppy. Social isolation and time outs can be an effective form of punishment for a pack animal.You can also yelp when your puppy bites too hard. It might seem silly but puppies in a litter will cry out if a sibling accidentally bites too hard. Yelping when your puppy lays teeth on your will give feedback to very young puppies about what is acceptable playing and what isn't.Teach children not to shriek, run or flap their hands because this will engage the puppy’s natural prey instincts and add to the problem. Children should remain calm and keep their hands closed and close to their bodies.;
, Before you start playing with your puppy, spray a taste deterrent on areas of your body and clothes that your puppy likes to play rough with. When your puppy starts biting you, stop moving and wait for him to react to the taste deterrent. Once your puppy stops biting, praise him and continue playing. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water to get the material off your hands.Taste deterrents include: “Bitter Apple,” “Vick’s Vapor Rub,” or white vinegar. Use these on your hands to make them taste unpleasant. Contrary to a previous post, please note that tea tree oil can cause temporary paralysis in dogs; use products that are tested as safe for dogs/animals. , When he has calmed down, gently talk to him and stroke him. Keep your hand away from his mouth. Start playing again and avoid getting the puppy excited. This time, use toys instead of your hands to get your puppy engaged. Start playing fetch, so that you are tossing toys away from you and using the puppy’s prey drive for positive fun. Playing with toys can be used as a training reward or break and keeps your hands away from the puppy's teeth.Some trainers suggest playing tug-of-war with your puppy. The puppy learns that the game is fun, but is also controlled by you, the human at the other end of the toy. The fun will stop if the rules of the game aren't honored, keeping everyone safe., Never play roughly with a puppy that bites. Rough play will only encourage this behavior and strongly establish it in the puppy's mind. Never use your hands as toys. You should also closely watch children playing around or with the puppy. Kids are not equipped to train a puppy and injuries can happen.Don't let children play tug with the puppy unless an adult is present, the puppy fully understands the rules, and only if the puppy’s size does not pose a risk to the child during the game.

, In cases where biting is exceptionally strong or persistent, keep a water spray bottle handy. Accompany your firm ""NO!"" with a squirt of water in puppy's face to interrupt the behavior. Take care to set the nozzle to spray and not jet. You just want to startle the puppy, not harm him.Be aware that the puppy will associate the water spray with you, and this could make him wary of you at other times.


Never threaten the puppy with the squirt bottle or create fear. You also don’t want to create a situation where the puppy only behaves if the squirt bottle is in your hand.

, Always praise good behavior with lots of gentle love and cuddles. Use rewards effectively to reinforce good behavior. For example, if your dog successfully responds to your request to drop a toy, say, ""yes!,"" or ""good boy!"" Verbal rewards work well when you're playing and may have your hands full of toys.Remember, you are now the puppy's parent. It's your responsibility to encourage him to become a happy, healthy, well-adjusted family member.

, It's normal for puppies to bite as they develop and grow. Usually, they learn about not biting from other members of their pack, including adult dogs. Puppies learn by playing with other pack mates about when to avoid causing serious damaging through biting. If puppies don't learn to control or stop biting, the other dogs will punish the puppy more severely, possibly by biting the puppy to cause injury.If the puppy does learn easily from his pack mates, they'll become more forceful and clear about biting behavior until the puppy behaves in a manner acceptable to other members of its pack.

, If you allow puppy biting, it may get out of control and your puppy will not learn to control his bite. This can lead to serious behavioral issues when your puppy reaches adulthood. If you suspect your puppy is biting out of fear or anger, talk with an animal behavioral therapist, who may be able to help.It is not acceptable for puppies to bite people, or other animals, unless they are in true physical danger and need to defend themselves.

, If you're starting a training program with the help of a qualified trainer, consider muzzling your puppy with a basket muzzle. Your puppy will quickly learn to stop nipping or biting with the help of the muzzle, but muzzling is not recommended if you don't have a clear understanding of the training approach and goals. If the muzzle isn't introduced and used properly, your puppy can actually become more dangerous to people, especially those trying to put the muzzle on the puppy.


Rewarding the puppy by giving it a treat after wearing the muzzle can help the dog associate the muzzle with something good. This makes it less likely to be wary of you or aggressive, and it makes the whole process easier for both you and the dog.
Never leave children unattended and unsupervised with dogs, even ones that seem “safe”. You may need to isolate the dog and/or crate him when a knowledgeable adult cannot be present.

Make your own dog treats.,
Try vegetables.,
Feed him fruit.,
Give him meat.,
Feed him eggs.,
Try grains.,
Feed him low fat cheese.,
Give him yogurt sparingly.,
Avoid certain foods.",How to Choose Dog Treats2," If you are not happy with any of the commercial dog treats on the market, you can make your own. The most common types to make at home are hard biscuits, meaty treats, jerkies, and vegetable or fruit leathers.


There are many different recipes out there, such as homemade pumpkin pie treats or sweet potato jerky. Research some with the types of ingredients that your dog likes to find more. Homemade treats will have less ingredients and be lower in fat and calories than store bought treats., Raw vegetables are great treats for your dog. Most vegetables should be raw, but if you want to cook the vegetables you feed your dog, avoid using any oils or seasonings on them. These things are bad for your dog's health. Vegetables that dogs often like are:


Baby carrots or carrot chips, which are good raw and cooked
Canned low sodium green beans, rinsed
A handful of frozen peas
Sweet potatoes or potatoes, cooked into cubes or mashed
Squash, zucchini, or pumpkin, cooked
Greens such as lettuce or spinach, There are many different fruit that are also good as treats for your dog, especially if your dog has a sweet tooth. These can be given to him as fresh or frozen. Good fruits for treats include:


Apples, without cores or seeds
Blueberries and strawberries
Watermelon
Cantaloupe
Bananas, frozen as chips, Your dog may also like cooked meat as treats. Cube some cooked chicken into small bites and give it as treats. Bake him some salmon, which is especially good if he has itchy skin since the Omega-3s help with allergies. Cut off tough areas of your cooked steak or pork loins to give your dog as a treat.


These treats can give him a protein boost and make him full if he's hungry between meals.You can also use meat broths to make treats. Freeze no sodium chicken or beef broth in ice cubes and give them to your dog. These are especially good during hot weather.
Never feed him raw meat., One scrambled egg can make a good snack for your dog. It provides a nice protein boost and has needed nutrients, such as selenium and riboflavin. Just make sure you cook the egg without oils, butter, or spices.


Never feed your dog a raw egg., There are some cooked grains that can be good for your dogs. Cooked oatmeal, rice, and pasta in small portions are good to feed your dog, especially if he has an upset stomach.


Grains also provide a good source of fiber for your dog, which can help his digestive tract.
Make sure you don't cook them with any oils, seasoning, or other additive that might mess his system up or add calories., Small cheese cubes can make a good treat for your dog. Make sure you buy good quality, low fat cheese for him. Full fat cheese has too much fat and might cause him to gain weight.Also avoid giving him too much cheese because dogs have a hard time digesting lactose in large doses and may cause problems such as diarrhea., Yogurt can make a good treat for your dog, but only in small doses. Yogurt is a good source of calcium and probiotics, but these may actually cause harm to his system if he is fed too much. In large doses, he also may have a hard time breaking down the lactose, which can cause diarrhea.


These may be good for when your dog has stomach issues because the bacteria can help flush his digestive tract.
There is also a possibility that your dog may be lactose intolerant, so watch to make sure the yogurt doesn't cause any stomach issues., Although these human foods are great treats for your dog, there are certain foods you should never feed your dog because they are toxic to him, which can make him ill or kill him. These foods include:


Grapes or raisins
Onion
Garlic or chives
Avocados
Chocolate
Citrus, including the stems
Coconut
Alcohol
Macadamia nuts
Fatty meat scraps
Small cooked bones, especially chicken bones
Yeast dough
Xylitol, which is found in sugar free foods and some peanut butter"
"
Follow the 10% rule.,
Split up the treats.,
Change it up.",How to Choose Dog Treats3," Although treats are a great way to reward your dog, it should not supplement too much of his daily food intake. This could throw off his nutrition balance and cause him to gain weight. The best rule of thumb is to only let treats take up 10% or less of his daily calorie intake.


The treats can be given at any time of the day, but in between meals is most common. It depends on you and your dog's preference.
The amount of treats will vary depending on how much your dog should eat every day and on the kinds of treats you choose. For example, you can feed him more carrots than commercial dog because of calorie content., If you are having trouble controlling the amount of treats you are feeding your dog every day, split any treats into smaller pieces. This will make it feel like you are giving him more treats than you actually are.


If you are worried, figure out his daily portion of treats and set them aside so you don't go over., Feel free to change up the treats you give your dogs every day. Over time, if you notice your dog likes one type more than one types, give him those kinds of treats more often than others.


If there are some healthier snacks that you want to feed your dog that aren't your dog's favorite, feed those to him first and save his favorites for later in the day.Make sure you keep track of how many calories he eats in treats.

Give your dog canned food if he has certain health issues.,
Pick canned food for its high protein content.,
Go for canned food if you have a puppy.,
Note the higher cost of canned food.,
Recognize the health risks of canned food.,
Try combining dry food and canned food.",How to Choose Between Dry or Canned Dog Food2," Canned dog food often has a higher water content and a lower carbohydrate content. This can be beneficial for dogs who have urinary tract disorders, as added water in their food can help with their issue. Canned dog food can also be good for dogs who tend to get dehydrated, especially if it is very hot outside or they are very active.Canned dog food can be better for dogs who have delicate gums and missing teeth. Dogs with jaw issues or smaller mouths can also benefit from canned dog food.
If your dog has lost his appetite due to illness or age, the smell of canned dog food can encourage him to eat more.

, Canned dog food often contains more meat protein and natural fats than dry dog food. Your dog may benefit from a higher protein diet, as dogs tend to do well on high-protein diets.High quality canned food can also contain less preservatives and by-products than dry dog food. If your dog is sensitive to these ingredients, you may opt for canned food over dry food.
You may go for canned dog food if your dog is overweight, as obese dogs need food high in protein. Canned food can make obese dogs feel full for longer, so they tend to eat less.

, Puppies do better with canned food because it keeps them hydrated and is easier on their teeth. You may consider giving your puppy mostly canned food and some dry food.If you have a dog that is older, he may benefit from having canned food over dry food. Older dogs often need more moisture in their food and dry dog food does not provide much water content.

, Canned dog food is often more expensive than dry dog food and does not have a long shelf life once it has been opened. This means you may have to set aside time to go to the pet store every week and get more canned food for your pup.Keep in mind you can keep canned dog food if it is unopened and sealed for a long period of time.

, Canned dog food cannot be left sitting out in your dog’s bowl for more than one to two hours. Once wet food is exposed to the air, bacteria can grow quickly and it can become contaminated. You need to make sure your dog eats his food within one to two hours and throw away any uneaten food right away.You must always refrigerate any open cans of food and make sure your dog eats it within two to three days. This will reduce the risk of bacteria and contamination.

, If you cannot decide between dry and canned dog food, you may try combining them or alternating between the two types. You may mix a little bit of both types of food together in your dog’s bowl, called “topping”. If you do this, make sure your dog eats all of his wet food right away to reduce the risk of contamination.You may also try alternating between the two types. Feed your dog dry food four to five times a week and then give him canned food one to two times a week. This may also be a more cost effective option.Keep in mind combining two types can lead to added calories for your dog. You should consult with your vet to make sure your dog is not at risk of weight issues due to his diet.

Discuss the best food option for your dog.,
Ask your vet where you can buy the best dog food.,
Follow up with your vet.",How to Choose Between Dry or Canned Dog Food3," Before you choose a dog food, you should consult with your vet. They will likely be able to recommend dry or canned dog food for your pet, and suggest how much food you should give your dog every meal. Your dog may also benefit from mixing the two types of food, depending on his health and dietary needs.Your vet may also recommend dry or canned dog food based on your dog’s age and breed.

, Your vet may know of suppliers who can provide the highest quality dog food for your pet or refer you to a local pet store that stocks high quality food. Discuss your budget with your vet and see if they can suggest a dog food brand that is within your budget and beneficial for your dog., Once you have chosen a type of dog food for your pet, you should schedule a follow up appointment with your vet. You may do this a few weeks after you start to feed your dog his food. Notice if your dog starts to develop any health or behavioral issues on his new diet. You may consult with your vet to determine if the food is beneficial for your pet and if any changes to this diet need to be made."

Become a benevolent leader.,
Set ground rules early and stick to them.,
Plan to practice frequently.,
Remember that a happy owner makes for a happy dog.,
Speak at a normal voice volume.,
Select clear, concise commands.,
Pay attention to your tone.,
Keep training sessions short and sweet.,
Reward your dog for good behavior.,
Stick to voice-only commands.,
Ensure that when you deliver a voice command you can make the dog obey.,
Practice voice commands in different environments.,
Capitalize on any opportunity to reinforce good behavior.",How to Train a Dog to Respond to Voice Commands," Your dog needs to recognize you as the alpha, or pack leader, before it will take your training commands seriously. Undertaking leadership exercises with your dog will help it understand that you are in control and deserve its trust and respect. Dogs are naturally pack animals; your dog will be quite willing to cede you authority once it recognizes you as its leader.Try one or more of the following exercises:


Sit on the floor with your puppy, then pick him up gently with both hands positioned just behind his front legs. Hold him at arm's length and make eye contact. Gently growl if he attempts to struggle. Continue holding him until he relaxes. Vary the length of time and location in which you perform this exercise.;
, Ensure everyone in your household is on the same page. Consistency is key to establishing a successful training regimen.

, Commit yourself to work daily with your dog. You'll need to repeat most commands many times before your dog is fully trained.

, Your mood transfers readily to your dog. If you are tired or agitated, your dog will pick up on these cues. She'll be less likely to obey, and likely become frustrated and tired herself. Wait to hold a training session until you're feeling calm and in a good mood., Yelling tells your dog that you're tense, upset, or otherwise out of control. These cues fail to inspire confidence or trust. Remember, you need to be the alpha figure in your relationship with your dog. Speaking at a normal volume level helps establish your command of the situation., The specific commands you choose are less important than their clarity, although once you've chosen it is important to be consistent.Recognize, however, that using more common commands may help in situations where someone else may need to issue a command for the safety of your dog or those around her. Also make sure your dog understands his or her name. The most common dog commands include:


Watch me
Sit
Stay
Down (as in lie down)
Off (as in get off me or the furniture)
Stand
Come
Heel (walk close to my side)
Leave it, As you determine which voice commands to use with your dog, recognize that your tone delivers an equally important message.


Use a higher-pitched, more excited tone of voice to deliver praise and issue active commands (""Come!"" ""Good dog!""). Dogs hear these tones as encouraging or enthusiastic.
Use a low-pitched, growly tone to issue corrections and commands that don't involve movement (""Off!"" ""Stay!""). Dogs respond to low-pitched or growling noises with caution or acquiescence.
You might try a low-pitched, flat or slowly descending tone of voice for a command such as ""Stay!"" that requires some authority, but less correction., Now that you have prepared your household and selected your commands for training, you can begin the work of teaching your dog that ""Come!"" means ""Come!"" Set aside time each day for training, but remember that dogs have limited attention spans. Limit training sessions to 15 minutes or less.


Introduce new voice commands one at a time.
Keep expectations realistic. Try working on one component of a behavior. If you want your dog to sit and then stay when you walk away from him, start by training your dog to sit quietly while you remain nearby. Over time you can train him to remain sitting while you walk away.
Start with just a few seconds of compliance and then work up over time. For example, you may work with your dog to ""stay"" for five seconds over the course of one week and then work on a ten-second ""stay"" the next. Begin working on a command to ""come"" by encouraging your dog to travel just a few yards; over time, you can develop her ability to respond over greater distances or around a corner.
Voice commands are essentially habits, and as with establishing any good habit, repetition is essential. Try doing five to 15 repetitions of one behavior before moving on to the next command., Use positive reinforcement as a training tool to ensure your dog understands when he's responding well to your commands.


Most dogs are highly food-motivated, so food can be an especially attractive reward. Experiment to see what works best for your pet, but keep food rewards small so you can use them repeatedly: a soft piece of food, doggie treat, or small square of cheese. Avoid hard foods that she'll need to break apart; you want to ensure she associates the reward with her behavior, and the process of eating a more complicated food could distract her.
Couple food rewards with verbal rewards. Praise your dog each time she responds well to your voice command.
Consider non-food treats such as a favorite toy, a scratch on the head, or brief playtime (ideally toward the end of a training session).Over time, reduce the frequency of food rewards. Cut back to three out of four times the dog performs a given behavior, then two out of four, and so on. Be sure to keep selective rewards random, however. Dogs can be quite smart -- you don't want her to figure out she need only comply every other time!
Continue to respond with verbal praise each time your dog obeys., Using touch at the same time as you issue a voice command can confuse your dog. Her sense of touch will always been more important than your voice command. Consequently, she'll be less likely to respond to your voice command alone., If you aren't willing to get up and physically make your dog follow your instructions, refrain from issuing a voice command. Otherwise, you'll teach your dog that your command is optional., Ensure your dog is safe in any training environment before you begin, but practice issuing commands in different places and around distractions such as people and other pets. This way your dog will learn that ""come"" or ""stay"" means the same thing in all situations, and not just in the comfort of your backyard or local park., Keep an eye on your puppy, and as she starts to sit, repeat the command ""sit."" If she then turns and makes eye contact, deliver a verbal reward such as ""good girl."" Over time, she'll learn to associate the sound ""sit"" with sitting down, and realize that if you say that word and she sits she'll receive praise.

Teach your dog to respond to hand signals.,
Accompany hand signals with the appropriate voice command during obedience lessons.,
Reward your dog with a treat, toy, pat on the head, or some other favorable response when he does something you want him to do again.,
Expand your dog's ""vocabulary"" beyond the signs used for formal commands.,
Restrict obedience lessons to about 15 minutes when training deaf dogs.",How to Train a Deaf Dog," You can create your own hand signs, but it's better to use American or International Sign Language when training deaf dogs. Understanding one of those commonly used sign languages benefits your dog because many veterinarians, groomers and shelter employees also use them.;
, A deaf dog won't hear the command, but he'll respond better because your facial expressions and body language will be congruent, more natural and expressive.

, Withhold those rewards when your dog does something you don't want repeated.


Make the hand signal for ""yes"" and give a reward immediately. Keep repeating this until your dog understands the link between ""yes"" and the reward. Use the ""yes"" sign and rewards to teach your dog additional hand signals and to reinforce good behaviors.
Give a reward and the ""yes"" sign when you catch your dog naturally performing any desired behavior, such as sitting. When you believe your dog is poised to sit down, make the hand signal for ""sit"" just prior to him sitting. Reinforce his action with a reward and the ""yes"" sign.

, Teach him signals for common objects, such as ""toy,"" and for daily activities, such as ""walk.""

, Keep the sessions fun for both you and your dog.

Choose a dog that fits your lifestyle.,
Don’t get an aspirational dog.,
Give your dog a practical name.,
Schedule enough time for training.,
Prepare your mental state for training sessions.,
Choose the proper equipment.",How to Train a Dog1," After centuries of breeding, the modern dog is one of the most varied species of animal on earth. While there’s probably a dog to suit every lifestyle, not all dogs will fit your specific needs. For example, if you like to relax, you should not get a Jack Russell Terrier, known for its constant barking and high energy.Instead, you might want a bulldog that would much prefer to cuddle on the couch all day.Research the personalities and care requirements of various breeds. Ask dog owners about their breed’s personality.


Since most dogs live for 10 – 15 years, getting a dog is a long-term commitment. Make sure the breed's temperament is a good match for your lifestyle.
If you haven't yet started a family, consider whether you'll have young children around the house in the next decade. Some breeds are not recommended for households with children.;
, Be honest with yourself about the compatibility of the dog you want with your lifestyle. Don't get a dog that needs a lot of activity just because you want a reason to jumpstart a healthier lifestyle yourself. If you can’t follow through on exercising your high-energy dog, you and the dog will both end up frustrated.


Write down the needs and temperament of the breed, as well as how you will meet those needs.
If it's going to take significant effort to change your lifestyle, you need to choose a different dog.

, He needs to be able to learn his name easily, so you can hold his attention during training. The name should also have clear, hard sounds the dog can recognize. Names such as “Buddy” or “Rover” or “Bee Bee” have distinct sounds that stand out from the regular flood of human speech your dog hears.


Use your dog's name often when you are playing, petting him, training him, or need to get his attention.
If your dog looks at you when you say his name, you know he’s learned it.
Create a positive association with his name so he’ll continue to focus on you when you say it. Praise him when he responds to his name, and give him treats.

, You’ll need to set aside 15 – 20 minutes a couple of times each day for formal training sessions. Puppies have a short attention span and get bored easily, just like a toddler would.


Those sessions are not the only time you’ll train your dog, though. Training actually happens throughout the day when interacting with your pet. He’s learning from you every time you interact.
Bad dog habits develop when owners let dogs get away with bad behavior outside of dedicated training sessions. So, always keep an eye on your dog outside of training sessions. If he knows it during training sessions, then make sure he remembers it outside of training.

, When you’re working with your dog, be calm and neutral. Any form of agitation and excitement on your part will negatively affect the outcome of training. You should be mindful of the fact that the goal of training is to be able to reinforce good dog behavior and to ignore or not reinforce bad ones. It may sound strict but producing a well trained dog requires the determination and conviction to see it through.

, A 6-foot leash and flat collar or martingale collar may be all the you need to start, besides your treats. Consult a trainer for advice on other equipment like a “Promise Leader” head halter, a “No Pull” harness, a metal training collar, or other device. Puppies or small dogs generally do not need harsh equipment. Larger dogs may temporarily need specialized equipment (like the “Promise Leader”) to keep their focus."

Certain breeds of dog are trained to be more prey driven than others, which makes these dogs less trustworthy around your flock. Knowing if your dog is prey driven will prepare you for the careful and consistent training dogs of that temperament require.Some of the best dogs for guarding chickens are:


Great Pyrenees
Maremma Sheepdog
Akbash
Kuvasz
Komondor
Polish Tatra Sheepdog
Anatolian Shepherd
Kangal;
, It is easiest to train a dog from puppy to adult, but if you think your dog has what it takes, consistent and clear training might be all your dog needs.When training your dog, remember to:


Use succinct commands - repeating a command over and over can teach your dog to ignore you.
Reward generously - positive reinforcement, like a treat or verbal praise, can curb aggressive tendencies and instill obedient response.Train cheerfully - dogs are sensitive to human tone of voice and body language. Your dog is your comrade and a partner with you in the training experience; kind treatment will go a long way toward obedient response., There are many different opinions on the best training method for any dog, but when it comes down to it, every dog is going to be different. Trust your instincts and your knowledge of your animal, but consider using the following tools to assist in training:


Collar
Leash
Muzzle (optional)
Shock collar (optional)
Treats (for reward)

, It can be effective to plan your training to occur prior to meals. This way, your dog will be a little hungrier than normal, which will make him more attentive to the treats you are using as a reward. If your dog ever seems as though he's overheated, tired, or too rambunctious, it's best not to force your training.If you become frustrated during the course of your training session with your dog, don't get angry with or yell at him unnecessarily.Dogs with soft temperaments might become anxious or stop paying attention to trainers who yell without reason. If you are frustrated, simply end your session early and try again later.

, This kind of training relies on treats to encourage your dog to perform training exercises and respond to cues, like a spoken command, sound, or gesture.The more irresistible a treat is, the more motivated your dog will be to earn it, so you should experiment to find the treat your dog will work hardest for.Once you have a suitable treat, like small pieces of cut up hot dog or dog biscuits, To train using positive reinforcement you should:


Illustrate the training goal to your dog. You may have to raise a paw to show it how to ""shake hands,"" or you may raise a treat above your dog's head, causing its rump to lower to the ground while issuing the command: ""Sit.""
Reward immediately for responding to a cue/command.
Use the same set of cues/commands between all family members., Whenever your dog responds to one of your cues/commands, especially those related to your chickens, have a treat ready to reward it. Only reward specific good behavior; you don't want your dog to associate a negative action, like barking or chasing your chickens, with receiving a treat., The more distractions there are, the more difficult it will be for you to hold your dog's attention while training. At the age of 9 weeks, most expert trainers begin exposing to livestock in a safe, fenced in area.This way your puppy can become more comfortable with your chickens.

, This is especially important for male dogs. Without neutering, male dogs can suffer from aggression and distracted behavior. By limiting the aggressive hormones of your dog by getting it fixed, your pup's chicken guard training will go much more smoothly., If you are rushed, you may get more easily irritated than normal with your puppy's progress, which can have a negative impact on training. Interruptions, too, like your cell phone, can lead to confusion during a training session., Your dogs should know all basic commands, like sit, down, come, and stay before you allow your grown (or growing) dog to go toe-to-talon with your chickens. These can most effectively be trained through short training sessions that use positive rewards paired with clear, succinct commands.The most important command, however, in the vocabulary of a poultry protector is probably: leave it.


The leave it command can be trained with meat, cheese, or some other kind of treat. Collect a goodly amount of treats, and then place your dog into position.
Place a treat in front of your dog and command him to leave it.
When the dog makes his move for the meat, block it with your hand and give a firm, negative response, like ""Ah"" or ""No.""
When your dog appears to have lost interest in the temptation, reward your him with a different piece of meat from your other hand.
Move the temptation closer and repeat this process., It might take a while before your dog learns anything more than sit, but alternating between commands quickly can be fun for your dog while further entrenching the command. Alternate between sit and down or sit and come to train your puppy as you play., Though some believe a muzzle to be inhumane, many trainers regard it as a suitable tool for a suitable purpose, just like a dog collar or a leash.If you have trouble with your dog pursuing chickens with the intent to kill or eat them, a muzzle will make training safest for all of your animals.

, If your dog is especially excitable, you may want to keep him on a leash until he becomes calmer around your birds.Take him with you on your feeding chores to help him become even more accustomed to the chickens and the chickens more accustomed to him.Exercise simple commands like the compound sit-stay. You may want to practice this while entering the chicken coop to fetch your eggs, which has the added benefit of teaching your dog not to invade the boundary of the chicken coop., You can do this by rubbing down your chickens with damp cloth and putting that cloth in your dog's bed or pen. Dogs have a powerful sense of smell, so the scent of the chickens, when unfamiliar, can cause a strong reaction., While outside with your dog, you may see your chickens and/or roosters fighting. This is not especially uncommon, but can leave a valuable member of your egg laying team out of commission. With your dog on its lead, run towards the fighting animals and break up the scuffle. Once you have pulled the birds apart, practice one of your basic commands, or, if you've trained your dog in it, use the safe command.


By showing your dog what to do in the event of a chicken fight, and rewarding him for helping you break it up, you will begin to teach him to run to help whenever he hears a chicken in distress.

, Your dog already has a keen sense of some wildlife predators, but crows and chicken hawks can be just as dangerous to younger birds and chicks as a fox. Together with your dog on his lead, shoo away crows or any other birds of prey.


After you have successfully chased away the birds, praise your dog and feed him a treat. This will positively reinforce the behavior to protect chickens from birds of prey.

, As your dog becomes more trustworthy and proves he understands your commands and also your expectations of how he should act around your birds, you should allow him to patrol for critters. Thanks to your training in how to break up a chicken fight, he will race to the sound of a chicken in distress and help.

, You can't expect your canine companion to keep the chickens in line if he's out of shape. Go for regular walks, continue short, rapid fire training sessions, and show your dog he's a beloved part of your pack.

Remember that blind dogs already have a bit nervous and frightened perspective on the world.,
Remember that your dog is blind.,
Sit at the bottom of the stairs.,
Make sure you are sitting on the first step of the stairs.,
Pull him up a little bit more, so that he is completely on the stairs.,
Wave the treat in front of your dog's nose and make sure he has smelt it.,
Repeat this step over the next few steps on the stairs.,
Urge your dog to go up 2-3 steps at a time, then 4.,
Take his leash off and go up the steps just as you did before.,
Go to the big step after doing this a few times.,
Do this a lot to make sure he keeps the knowledge that the stairs are safe and fine.",How to Train a Blind Dog to Handle the Stairs," Take it slow, don't get discouraged, and realize that your dog is trusting you a lot by allowing you to lead it up a frightening, unstable-feeling, freaky obstacle that he doesn't understand. However, if you do get this accomplished, be proud!;
, Due to this, it will be a lot different for him/her going up the stairs, than with you or a non-blind dog. Before starting, make sure your dog is very comfortable in your home and with you. Then, introduce him to the stairs.

, Never begin at the top; your dog might fall down and become forever scared and petrified of the stairs. Get your dog comfortable and play around with him. Next, gently pull his front paws up onto the stairs.

, If you aren't, your dog won't see any point in putting his paws up, and immediately take them back down. Make sure he knows that you are on the stairs, and that you are completely safe.

, If you show him that you are happy and safe, he should be fine. Pet him/her and compliment him for doing so well. This will make your dog feel more comfortable and help it relax. Do the same with the next few steps, and reward your dog with a treat.

, Pull the treat away from him slowly, making sure his head and body moves forward reaching out to it.


Slowly pull the treat up to the next step. If you are nervous, you can take your dog back down and begin on the bottom step again. Your dog might trip or bump into the step as he leans towards the treat. At this time, encourage him and jump up onto the next step.
He now knows that not only the treat, but also his soul companion, is on the next step above him. If he appears confused or scared, encourage him and pull one of his paws up onto the next step. He should place his other paw up and with proper encouragement manage up. If he pulls his paw down, replace both his paws onto the next step. If he needs, push his bottom up a little so he gets the idea to go up. When he does, give him a treat, pet him, and compliment him.

, He should gradually get better at this, and go up the stairs more quickly as he realizes he gets treats and compliments each time he does.

, Do so before giving him a treat, and the rest of the deal. Next, get his leash, lead rope, or muzzle. Encourage him up the steps as before except now, go 2 steps up and pull gently on the rope to encourage him up.


When he goes up to you, you may give him a treat and compliment him, or you may wait. If you wait, continue up the stairs until you reach the top, at this point you may give him an overdose of love and several treats. Do this repeatedly.

, He will probably come up, but if he doesn't go down a step to encourage him. Once at the top treat and move on.

, Place your dog at the bottom step, and move yourself to the top. Encourage him and let him know you have treats and that you want him up at the top with you.


He will probably begin up the steps gradually. Also, he will be confused as he wonders why you are not as near to him as you were in the other training sessions. However, he will probably, trying to find you, continue up the stairs. Continue encouraging him, if he slows, go down a few steps or let him sniff the treat and go back up. When he reaches the top, treat and complement.

, Also, if he goes up the stairs by himself or when he does, always make sure to compliment him. Sooner or later, he should be able to go up the stairs by himself.

Teach your dog the boundaries of the electric dog fence.,
Introduce your dog to the boundary.,
With your dog on a lead, casually walk to the boundary of the electric fence where the flags are.,
Repeat the same lesson on days two and three.,
Do a real test.,
Replace the Innotek plastic training contacts with the Innotek supplied metal correction contacts.,
With your dog still on a lead, casually walk to the boundary of the electric dog fence with your dog and helper.,
Retreat immediately to the safe part of the yard or pet containment area and lavish your dog with praise.,
Continue this lesson at a number of different areas around the boundary of the electric fence.

,
Teach the dog to avoid distractions.,
Go through a list of distractions that will tempt your dog to leave the pet containment area and prove each one before proceeding to the next.,
Practice with the dog off lead but supervised.,
Make sure the Innotek device is correctly placed on the dog collar and on your dog's neck and the electronic collar is turned on.

,
Stay with the dog when it's in the yard.,
Teach the “off lead unsupervised” lesson.,
Keep a close eye on your dog for two weeks from inside the house.,
Before and after each unsupervised session in the pet containment area, continue the play and praise routine to continue to reinforce that the yard is a happy, fun and safe place to be.,
Remove the flags.",How to Train a Dog to Use an Electric Fence," After your dog knows where the boundaries of the pet containment area are, then you will have to teach the dog not to cross them for any reason. Your dog needs to learn that distractions on the wrong side of the boundary wire need to be completely ignored all the time.;
, Help your dog upon hearing the tone to understand to retreat to the safe part of the yard or pet containment area when the warning tone is heard. Your system came packaged with Innotek plastic training contacts. Install these training contacts before beginning your training session.

, When the dog reaches the signal field, immediately spin around and briskly jog back into the yard. The dog will feel the tug and run after you. Praise enthusiastically. If your dog does not indicate hearing the tone, walk your dog to the boundary of the electric fence again and follow the same procedure.

, As the training sessions of the next three days progress, you’ll see that your dog will start to anticipate the signal tone and retreat from the electric fence boundary wire without your prompting.

, Day three is successful only if your dog retreats from the electric dog fence boundary wire without your prompting and refuses to approach the boundary as you approach. For each successful attempt, be sure to praise your dog, praise and praise again. If you are not successful keep the training going as you have been the past two days until your dog retreats without prompting. It’s time for your dog to move to the next phase.

, You will also need a helper for this phase of the training.

, The helper should continue to walk through the boundary of the electric dog fence. Should the dog try to follow, he will receive a correction from the collar.

,


Note, it is very important that your helper not stop, look back or acknowledge the dog in any way.

,, If your dog is avoiding the boundary of the electric fence, with the helper moving freely in and out of the pet containment area, you are ready to add more tempting distractions.


Remember, never pull or coax your dog into the boundary area. This lesson teaches that your dog must resist all temptations to leave the yard or pet containment area. Dogs have trouble connecting the lessons learned with one distraction to another. So, you can’t assume that if your dog won’t chase a ball out of the yard. Your dog won’t chase a bicycle… Or favorite neighbor.

, Before long your dog will connect the dots.


Don’t leave the yard for bikes, neighbors, bouncing balls, moving cars means, don’t leave the yard for any reason.

, This is a very important next step for your dog. This is the first time during your training sessions that your dog will be off lead and you must make certain that you and your dog stay in the pet containment area or yard at all times during this training.

,, It’s wise to spend a lot of quality time in the yard with your dog. The more your dog stays on the property for the first month, the less chance of your dog attempting to leave the area. Continue to supervise and play with your dog outside for a period of one week.

, You will know when your dog is ready to be unsupervised inside the pet containment area because your dog will resist all manner of distractions, both on and off the lead. It’s a big step when your dog can be left unattended in the yard with only the electric fence to keep him in the pet containment area.

, This freedom should be brief at first and the amount of time increased gradually.

, Most dogs over 6 months that know the obedience commands, will be able to be trained to stay within the electric fence boundaries.

, After two weeks of successful containment, you can begin removing the flags fro the electric fence boundaries. Start by removing every other flag, every other day until all of the flags are gone.

In particular, the ""recall"" command--teaching your dog to come back to you when you call him-- is the most important part of any dog training, and you should begin training your pup to follow this command early on.


Recall will be especially important during training in order to counteract predatory tendencies in the puppy and help to prevent them from injuring tame rabbits used in the training sessions.
A guide to training a puppy to follow the recall command can be found here.;
, Puppies at this age have a short attention span, so remember to keep training sessions between 2 or 3 times a day for 10-15 minutes., This helps the puppy learn to track a scent.

, Every three feet or so, cut off a piece of the meat. This will help to train the puppy to follow extended scent trails. As your puppy gets better at tracking the scent trail, extend the length of the trail, as well as the spaces between the pieces of meat.


Dragging a dead rabbit through the grass will also familiarize the puppy with its scent and prepare it to track live rabbits., When your puppy is between 12 and 16 weeks, introduce the puppy and a tame rabbit inside of an enclosure, or starting pen. Starting pens are surrounded by rabbit proof fencing (or chicken wire), and can range in size from 60 x 60 ft. to five acres large.Tips on how to build your own starter pen can be found at http://www.beaglesunlimited.com/training/starting-pen-design-part-1.You may choose to take your puppy to a private running pen, where you will pay for each dog that is trained. Alternatively, you can buy a tame rabbit and build a pen in your yard.It is recommended to only train up to 3 puppies at a time in the starting pen. Too many dogs can be distracting, and the rabbit's scent will be weaker to the dogs' noses., Ideally, the puppy will become excited to chase the rabbit, kind of like a ""toy."" Also try tying up your puppy with a leash and having it watch you chase the rabbit around the enclosure. The puppy should become excited and try to break from the leash. , Your puppy should become excited and chase the rabbit. If the rabbit hides behind a log or bush, this is good, as it will help train the puppy to track the rabbit with its nose.

, Allow your dog to track and chase the rabbits around the pen for a 2-3 hours every other day, or at the very least once or twice a week.


You can allow the pup to run, track, chase and investigate the rabbit on its own, but keep watch in order to prevent injuries to either the puppy or rabbit. The rabbit should be too fast for the puppy to catch, and the puppy itself will most likely not understand what to do if it actually catches the rabbit., Once the rabbit begins to tire from running, or if you see the puppy being aggressive, remove the rabbit from the pen. Make sure to not allow your dog to harm the rabbit.

Puppies will not usually harm a tame rabbit, but you should keep a close eye on the pup and the rabbit in order to prevent injury to either animal., If your puppy eagerly follows the rabbit, it may only need a few times in the starting pen before it can move on.


The length of training in a starter pen depends on the puppy's individual temperament. Some puppies will require only a day or two in the pen, while others may take weeks before they are independently tracking and chasing the tame rabbits.
It is important to have cover in the pen that the rabbit can hide behind, as you want to train your puppy to use its nose to track, rather than ""sight chase."", Running pens are similar to starting pens, only larger. Your puppy can track farther afield here, and continue to use its nose rather than its eyes to locate the rabbits.


Running pens can vary widely in size, from 5 acres all the way up to 100 acres or more.
To save time and money, join a local gundog field trial club. Most clubs will have both starter and running pens that you can use, as well as professional dog trainers who can help with puppies or dogs that are proving more difficult to train.
Keep close to your puppy most of the time to build a strong team relationship., This should occur when your pup can independently track a rabbit in the pen for around 10-20 minutes.


A ""brace,"" or two-dog pack, is often created by pairing your puppy with an older dog. Your pup will learn more advanced tracking skills from the older dog, in particular how to behave during a ""check,"" or temporary loss of a rabbit's trail.
Aim to run your young dog with a trained, but slower, female. If you only have one puppy (or puppies), you will have to run it with a friend or neighbour's dogs, or visit the local gundog club., Introduce your dog to gunfire training early on, in order to prepare it for the loud sounds of a hunt.


Gradually train your dog to tolerate gunfire. Incorporate low-level, distant gunfire into daily activities, only moving closer as your dog becomes accustomed to the sound.
Do not suddenly fire a gun near your dog if it has never heard the sound before. , Most rabbits will be found on dry, soft land near dense brush and other cover (thickets, briars, etc.), rather than in open spaces such as fields. Forest edges near grass and new crops are a rabbit's favourite habitat.


Dawn and dusk are the best times to locate rabbits., Well-trained rabbit hunting dogs will actually do most of the work when it comes to rabbit hunting. The dogs will search through briars, thickets and other areas where rabbits like to hide that would be difficult for you to search through yourself.


When hunting in packs, a dog that picks up the scent of a rabbit will begin barking, signalling the other dogs to join the chase., Find an elevated spot or clearing from which you can follow the chase. Make sure to watch ahead of the lead dog, as it will be following the rabbit's scent and the rabbit will be running ahead of it.


Rabbits do not stray far afield from their homes, and will eventually circle back during a chase. If the pursuit seems to be taking a long time, be patient, as the rabbit will begin to circle back to its home., When your dog(s) run the rabbit into an open area such as a trail or field, or you catch a good look at the rabbit running through brush, finish the hunt with your rifle.


If the rabbit puts enough distance between itself and the dogs, it will pause to look back. This is the most ideal situation in which to kill the rabbit.
Always be aware of the location of your dogs and hunting companions, and be certain you have a clear shot before pulling the trigger."

Manage your expectations and mood.,
Keep your dog’s temperament in mind.,
Give immediate rewards.,
Consider clicker training.,
Be consistent.,
Always reward success and good behavior with praise, and sometimes a small treat.,
Use ""high value"" treats when needed.,
Train on an empty stomach.,
Always end training on a positive note.,
Discourage barking.",How to Train a Dog2," Not every training day is going to be perfect, but don’t get frustrated and don’t take it out on your dog. Adjust your own behavior and attitude to encourage your dog’s ability and confidence to learn. If you have a calm mood, generally your dog will, too.


If the dog becomes afraid of your bad mood, he will not learn anything new. He'll only learn to be wary and not trust you.
Dog training classes and a good trainer can help you improve your behavior which will translate to success with your dog.

, All dogs have different temperaments. Just like kids, different breeds learn differently and at different rates. Some dogs are stubborn and will challenge you at every turn. Others will bend over backwards to please you. You may need to adjust your training techniques to meet the need of your dog’s temperament.

, Dogs don’t understand long-term cause and effects. They learn fast. You must praise or reward your dog within 2 seconds of a desired behavior to reinforce that behavior. If you wait too long, he will not associate the reward with the action you asked him to perform.


Furthermore, you must make sure that your praise is fast enough to be accurate. Otherwise, you may reward behaviors that you don't want.
Imagine, for example, that you are teaching your dog the “sit” command. He sits for just a moment, but by the time you praise and reward him, he's started standing back up. In this case, you are rewarding the standing behavior, not the sitting behavior.

, Clicker training is a method of delivering immediate praise with the help of a clicker. You can click faster than you can give a treat or pet your dog's head. As such, clicker training reinforces good behavior fast enough for a dog's learning speed. It works by creating a positive association between the click sound and rewards. Eventually, your dog will consider the sound of the clicker itself reward enough for good behavior. You can apply the principle of clicker training to any dog command.


Click the clicker device, then immediately give the dog a treat. This creates a positive association with the click sound. Later, that sound will “mark” a behavior as correct so the dog knows that he did something right.
When the dog performs a desired behavior, make the click sound, then give him a treat. Once he's performing that behavior consistently, you can give the behavior a command name. Begin tying the command and the behavior together with the help of the clicker.
For example, before you ever teach your dog the ""sit"" command, give the click sound, a treat, and praise when you find him sitting. When he begins sitting just to get the treats, start saying the word ""sit"" to get him into position. Pair it with the click sound to reward him. Eventually, he will learn that sitting in response to the ""sit"" command will earn him a click reward.

, Your dog won’t understand what you want from him if his environment lacks consistency. Everyone who lives with your dog should understand and be on board with his training goals. For example, if you are training your dog not to jump on people, don’t let the kids allow the dog jump all over them. This will undermine all the training you’ve done.


Make sure everyone uses the exact commands your dog learns in training. He doesn’t speak English, and can’t tell the difference between “sit” and “sit down.” Using those terms interchangeably will only confuse him.
Because he won’t make a clear connection between a single command and a single action, his response to the command will be hit or miss.

, Small treats help motivate your dog to learn his training. The treat needs to be small, tasty, and easily chewed. You don't want it to interrupt the training session or make them full too quickly.


Consider how long it takes to chew a hard treat versus a semi-moist treat like “Bill Jack” or “Zuke’s Mini Naturals.” Treats about the size of a pencil eraser head are enough to get the positive point across, and you don't have to wait long for your dog to eat it.

, When teaching difficult or important a command, use a “high value” treat to raise the stakes for him. Examples include freeze-dried liver, roasted chicken breast chunks, or slices of turkey lunch meat.


As the dog learns the command, phase out the high value treats and bring them back as needed to advance your training, but always give him praise.

, Don't feed as large a meal as usual a few hours before training your dog. The more your dog wants the treat, the more focused he'll be on the task he needs to perform to get it.

, Even if the training session did not go well and your dog didn't catch on to a new command, end on something that you can praise him for. By ending the training session with a command he's already mastered, the last thing he remembers will be your love and praise.

, If your dog barks at you when you don't want him to, just ignore him until he stops, and then reward him with praise. Sometimes they bark at you for attention, while other times it may be out of frustration.


Do not throw a ball or toy. This only teaches him that if he barks, he'll get you to do something he wants.
Don't yell at the dog to be quiet, as this rewards him with attention.

Take your dog on regular walks with a leash.,
Discourage pulling.,
Change directions.,
Make it fun to be by your side.,
Pair the behavior with a verbal command.",How to Train a Dog3," This is important not just for training, but for his physical and mental health. Depending on what breed of dog you have, he may need a lot of exercise to keep him happy and in shape.

, Most dogs will pull on the leash when they're learning to take walks. When he starts pulling, stop immediately. Don't take another step until the dog comes to your side and focuses his attention on you.

, An even more effective method is to walk in the opposite direction and encourage your dog to come with you. Once he's caught up, praise and treat him.

, Your dog's natural impulse is to chart his own course and investigate his environment. You need to make walking by your side more appealing that that. Use an enthusiastic voice when changing directions, and lavish him with praise when he comes back to your side.

, Once the dog walks consistently at your side, you can give the behavior a name, like “heel"" or “let’s go.”

"
"
Understand the value of the command.,
Prepare your dog for “come” training.,
Attract your dog’s attention.,
Give immediate praise.,
Pair the behavior with the verbal command.,
Move the training to more public spaces.,
Increase the leash length.,
Work up to training your dog off the leash in a fenced environment.,
Give enormous rewards.,
Do not create a negative association with this command.,
Go back to basics.,
Reinforce the training throughout your dog’s life.,
Keep the fun going.,
Acclimate the dog to collar grabs.",How to Train a Dog4," The “come” is used whenever you want your dog to come to you. This command is potentially life-saving, as it can prevent your dog from running off if he gets loose.

, You always want to start training indoors (or in your fenced yard) with low distraction. Attach a 6-foot leash to your dog’s collar so that you have a way to keep his attention and prevent him from running away.

, You want to make him run toward you. You can do this with high-pitched noises associated with play, with a toy, with an excited clap, or just opening your arms. Running a short distance away from him and then stopping can also work, as dogs will naturally start to chase.


Use praise and your “happy voice” to encourage him to move toward you.

, Sound your clicker, give him praise in your “happy voice,” and give him a treat when your dog reaches your side.

, As your dog begins to realize he’ll be rewarded for coming to you, start giving the verbal command “come.” When he responds to the command, reinforce it in praise by pairing it with “good”: “good come!”

, Because the “come” command could save your dog's life, he must learn to respond to it even when he's distracted. Move the training sessions from your home or yard to a public park. There are more sights, sounds, and smells demanding his attention there.

, You began training with a 6-foot leash, but you want your dog to come longer distances than that. Try attaching two leashes together to increase the distance.

, This will teach him to come over long distances.


Ask someone to help with off-the-leash training. You can play “ping pong” and take turns calling the dog to each of you.

, Because this command is so important, the praise you give for performing it should be extravagant. Responding to the ""come"" command should be the best part of your dog's day.

, No matter how upset you are, never reinforce the ""come"" with anger. Even if you're furious that your dog slipped the leash and ran free for five whole minutes, lavish him with praise when he finally responds to the ""come."" Remember that you're praising the last thing he did did, and the last thing he did was to come to you.


Don’t ever correct, yell, yank or in any way make coming to you a bad thing. You can undo years of training with one bad experience.
Never do something your dog won't enjoy after giving a ""come."" Though you may be tempted to give the command when you need to give him a bath, trim his nails, or cleans his ears, the ""come"" should always lead to joy.If you have to do something your dog won't like, just go and get the dog yourself instead of giving the command. Praise the dog along the way for being calm and accepting of the task. You can use treats, of course.

, If you have a scare where your dog runs loose and ignores the ""come"" command, go back to leash training. Continue working on the leash until he responds reliably to the ""come.""


Don't rush the training on this command. It's too important to do half-heartedly.

, Because this behavior is so important, it must be reinforced throughout his entire lifetime. If you take off-leash hikes with your dog, keep treats in your pocket to reinforce the command.


You also want a command to let the dog know that it does not have to be right next to you all the time. Something like “free” is one way to phrase it, but the idea is that the dog can do what it wants and is not under command until you give it one.

, You don’t want the dog to think that every time they come to you, the fun stops, someone puts on the leash, and they go back home. Otherwise, you will start to get less reliable and less happy “comes.” So, call the dog, praise them when they arrive and set them “free” to play again.

, This doesn’t have to be paired with any verbal commands. When the dog comes to you, grab his collar so he doesn’t grow skittish every time he feels someone touch it.


When you lean over to reward him for the ""come,"" include grabbing the collar in your hand and petting around the neck as you give him his treat.Once in a while, but not always, the leash should be attached when you grab the collar.
Also, you can always attach a short leash and let them “free” again. Leashes should mean fun things are about to happen and we get to go places. There is no room for harsh corrections.

Teach it more commands.",How to Train a Deaf Puppy," Thumping on the floor as you approach the puppy will usually work, since even deaf animals can feel vibrations. Flicking the light switch on and off is another option. A flashlight is useful if you let your dog into an enclosed yard at night and need to call it back.Vibrating collars are available that will let you get the dog's attention with a remote control. These tools are only useful once the dog has learned some basic training and responds to your command, especially because it takes the dog additional training to get used to the collar in the first place.;
, Because your deaf puppy won't get any encouragement from the tone of your voice, food will be even more important during training than it is for other dogs. Find a source of healthy treats that you can provide constantly throughout the day, without giving the dog more than 10% of its calories for the day. Asking the vet is the best way to find a store-bought treat formulated for your dog's needs, but here are a few alternate solutions:Try baby carrots, green beans, or other vegetables. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and bok choy can cause gas, and can cause health issues if eaten raw.Never use onions, garlic, chives, or leeks.Small pieces of fruit will also work, but remove inedible seeds. Avoid grapes and raisins.During early training, you can measure out the amount of food your dog would get from meals throughout the day, and use it constantly throughout the day as treats instead of feeding the dog full meals. You may want to stop this method if it causes the dog to whine or beg more than usual.

, You'll be using touch frequently to get the dog's attention, so it's important to start this training early. While the dog is awake but not paying attention to you, lightly touch it on a convenient area, such as the shoulder or side. Give it a small treat immediately. Repeat this as often as you can for at least a few weeks.Once it learns that being touched in that location is a positive event, you'll be able to get the dog's attention without startling it.


Train the dog to wake up to a gently touch as well. Start with your hand under its nose but not touching it, and two fingers of your other hand gently stroking its shoulder and back. Give the puppy a treat as soon as it wakes up., This is a good idea for all puppies, but a deaf dog should remain on the leash even once it reaches adulthood. The dog's reduced ability to sense danger and respond to your commands makes even playtime at the dog park risky without a leash.A 30–50 foot (9–15 meter) web leash or gives the dog a great deal of independence at the dog park. Flexi-leashes are not recommended for large or rambunctious dogs, and are best used after the dog has been trained.Feel free to let the dog off its leash in a fenced yard.

, You'll need to use gestures or signs to give commands to your deaf puppy. While you can make up your own hand signals, using actual signs saves you effort and makes it easier to find a trainer or pet-sitter who can communicate with the dog.


There are many different signed languages around the world. Use American Sign Language (ASL) if you are in the United States.
You can also use the online ASL video dictionaries signing savvy and .
There are specific guides for dog signs, such as ""Hear Hear"" by Barry Eaton., The treat should be something special, that the dog doesn't get any other time. Pick something soft, so the dog can eat it quickly and resume training. Cooked chicken, ham, hot dog, or cheese are all good options that most dogs love.

, Clickers are a popular and effective tool for training hearing dogs: when the dog obeys a command, you immediately click the tool to make a sound, and feed it a treat. For deaf dogs, you must use a visual ""marker"" that it associates with the command, action, and treat instead. You should choose a single option early on in the training and stick with it. This should also be a tool you use exclusively for clicker training, never for other purposes:A thumbs up sign, or flashing an open palm. This usually works well if your dog pays attention during training, or if you can immediately get your hand in front of the dog's vision.
Turning a flashlight on and off. This option is fine, but works poorly at distances, in bright lights, or for dogs that get too interested in chasing the light.
Deaf and blind dogs can be trained with a vibrating collar or a special touch signal. This is usually more difficult, so it's rarely used on seeing dogs., This is a good, basic command to start with. Make the sign for ""Sit"" while the dog is looking at you. If you're using American Sign Language, take the first two fingers of your right hand and lower them down to a ""sitting position"" onto the first two, horizontal fingers of your left hand.


Have the visual marker and treats ready.

, Show the dog what you want it to do. Some dogs will imitate you when you crouch. You can also try holding a treat above its head and moving backward. Many dogs will sit down to look up at the treat.


Alternatively, put your hand on the dog's haunches and press gently downward until the dog sits on its own. Stop this if it just causes the dog to shy away.

, Immediately after the dog sits, show the visual marker (such as a thumbs up sign). Give the dog a treat. Smile and give the dog plenty of visual or tactile praise (such as wiggling your fingers upward for ""yay"" or scratching the dog's ears).


Remember, you cannot switch between different visual markers. Always use the same one, or the dog will have trouble learning what it means.

, The first training session should only last as long as the dog is interested, and never longer than five minutes. Repeat the same steps above, making sure to give the visual marker and the treat immediately when the dog sits down. After the dog's responded a few times, or when it starts losing interest, end the training session after one more repetition, and give it extra praise and treats.

, Space these out throughout the day, and keep each session between 5 and 10 minutes. Too long a session can bore the dog and sabotage the training. The best time to train is when the dog is slightly hungry and paying attention to you, but not upset.


Always end the session on a positive note and a big reward. If the dog starts looking away or trying to wander off, make it repeat the trick one last time, then give it a lot of praise.
Different dogs take different amounts of time to learn tricks. Some commands may be learned within a couple days, while others take much longer. If your dog shows no progress after a couple weeks of daily training sessions, take it to a certified professional dog trainer.

, Once you've got this method down, training a deaf dog is not much different than training a regular one. Once the puppy becomes more familiar with a command, you can require it to do a better job (faster response, exactly what you want) before you give it a treat, and you can start giving it non-food treats as well such as toys. Eventually, the dog will respond to the command automatically, although you should still praise it with a pat or a ""good dog"" sign.

, Just like a regular dog, your dog should know how to sit, lie down, stay, come, and drop (an object). Teach these one at a time until the dog gets it, using the same method. Focus on one command at a time until the dog responds to it quickly.


It's best to use the sign language most common in your area, but if you want a quick guide to American Sign Language dog commands, try this one.
It's also possible to teach a dog more advanced commands, such as ""go potty"" or ""get in the car.""

"
"
Understand the purpose of the ""listen"" command.,
Prepare a handful of treats.,
Stand near your dog.,
Say ""Listen"" in a quiet but firm voice.,
Don't raise your voice to get his attention.,
Give an immediate reward for the desired response.,
Discontinue treats eventually.",How to Train a Dog5," Also known as the ""watch me"" command, the ""listen"" is one of the first commands you should teach your dog. You'll use it to get your dog’s attention so you can give him the next command or direction. Some people just use their dog’s name instead of the ""listen."" This is especially useful if you have more than one dog. That way, each individual dog will know when you want it to focus on you.

, These may be dog treats you buy at the store, or hot dogs cut into small pieces. Choose a treat that you know your dog loves and will perform for.

, Don’t engage with him, though. If he reacts to your presence, stand still and look away until he loses interest.

, If you're using your dog's name instead of the ""listen"" or ""watch me"" commands, say his name instead. The tone and volume should be the same as if you were calling a person's name to get their attention.

, Save the big booming voice for “life saving” situations, like if he escapes his fence or leash. If you rarely raise your voice, you'll get your dog’s undivided attention when you do need to yell. But if you are always “loud” to your dog, they will ignore that sound and tune it out. Shouting will no longer be regarded as something that commands special attention.


Dogs have excellent hearing — far better than ours. A fun twist on this command is to see how quietly you can whisper and have your dog respond. People will think you are the “dog whisperer” when you can get him to perform commands with hardly a whisper.

, As soon as your dog stops what he's doing and looks toward you, praise him and give him a treat. Make the click sound before giving praise or a treat if you're using clicker training.


Remember that your response must be immediate. The faster you reward him, the better he'll understand the relationship between command, behavior, and reward.

, Once he's mastered the command, you shouldn't give him treats for performing it; however, you should still use your clicker or give verbal praise.


Weaning the dog off treats is important because he may start to expect treats all the time. You'll end up with a dog who only performs when you have food.
Praise your dog regularly even after he's mastered a command, but treat him intermittently. That's the way to keep it solid in his doggy vocabulary.
Once he's mastered command, you can use treats to shape the behavior to be faster or more accurate. He will soon realize that the treats come with the command or activity that follows the ""listen.""

"
"
Get your dog into a standing position.,
Position yourself in his line of sight.,
Focus the dog's attention on the treat.,
Give him an immediate treat and praise.,
If your dog does not sit with the treat technique, you can use your leash and collar.,
Don't repeat the command.,
Praise natural sitting behavior.",How to Train a Dog6," The purpose of the ""sit"" is get your dog to transition from standing to sitting, not just continue sitting. Walk into your dog or step away from him to get him into a standing position.

, Stand directly in front of the dog so that his attention is focused on you. Let him see that you have a treat in your hand.

, Begin with the treat held down at your side. Raise that hand in front of the dog’s nose to let him get the scent, then to above his head level.


When you hold the treat above the dog’s head, most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of it.

, Follow the routine of clicker-treat/praise or just treat and praise. Say “good sit” when he's performing the behavior you are practicing. He may be slow at first, but more treats and praise will speed up his response.


Make sure that you do not praise him until his butt touches the ground. If you praise halfway through the sit, the dog will think that is what you want.
Also, make sure that you do not praise him for getting back up, or you will get that behavior instead of the sit.

, Stand next to the dog, facing the same direction as him. Place a little backward pressure on the collar to encourage a sit.


You may even need to encourage the sit by adding a little gentle scoop behind the dog’s hind legs. Gently lean the dog backward with the help of the collar while doing this.
As soon as he sits, give him immediate praise and reward.

, You want the dog to respond on the first utterance, not the second, third, or fourth. If the dog does not perform the behavior within 2 seconds of your command, reinforce the command with the help of your leash.


When you begin training a dog, never give a command that you are not in a position to reinforce. Otherwise, you risk training the dog to ignore you because there is no follow through from your end and the commands have no meaning.
Create a positive meaning for the dog with praise and consistency., Look for times throughout the day when your dog just sits on his own. Praise that behavior, and pretty soon you'll have a dog that sits for attention instead of jumping or barking at you.

"
"
Get your dog’s attention.,
Use the treat or toy to encourage your dog to lie down.,
Give immediate praise.,
Increase your distance.,
Lengthen the ""down."",
Don't lean over your dog.",How to Train a Dog7," Get some food treats or a toy and find your dog. Hold the toy or treat in view so he focuses on you.

, Do this by moving the toy or treat onto the ground in front of the dog, between his front legs. His head should follow it, and his body should follow shortly thereafter.

, When the dog’s stomach is on the ground, lavish him with praise and give him the treat or toy. Be accurate with your praise, too. If you praise him halfway down or up, that is the behavior you will get.

, Once he’s learned the behavior with the promise of a treat below him, move a little farther away. The hand signal for “down” will become your flat hand — palm down — moving in a downward direction from in front of your waist to your side.


As the dog gets more consistent with the ""down"" behavior, add a verbal “down” or “lie down” command.
Always praise him immediately when his belly is on the ground.
Dogs read body language well and learn hand signals quite quickly.

, As he gets more reliable with “down,” pause a few seconds before praising and treating to encourage him to hold the position.


If he pops up to get the treat, do not give it to him, or you will be rewarding the last behavior he did before the treat.
Just start again, and the dog will understand that you want him all the way down on the ground, as long as you are consistent.

, Once your dog has caught onto the command, stand up straight when giving it. If you loom over him, you'll have a dog that only lays down when you are leaning over him. You want to work on being able to get your dog to lie down from across the room, eventually.

Use treats.,
Get your dog's attention.,
Teach your dog to sit.,
Work on sitting pretty/begging.,
Master the trick.",How to Teach Your Dog to Sit Pretty," A good way to reward your dog for a job well done is by giving them a treat. Some good treats to use are bite size soft treats (from the pet store) or small pieces of meat.;
, Call his/her name and show them the treat. If your dog isn't paying attention, they will not be able to learn the trick.

, If your dog doesn't already know how to sit read the steps below. If your dog does know how to sit, move on to the next step.


Get your dog's attention
Stay in the same position and wait until they sit because of boredom
Reward your dog and say ""sit""
Repeat until your dog sits every time
You could also hold the treat just above their nose and they might sit.

, Now that your dog knows how to sit, you can teach them the advanced version. Have your dog sit in a place where there are no distractions. Hold a treat in your hand and move your hand over your dog's nose. Your dog should lean back and lift its front paws off of the ground. Reward your dog and say ""sit pretty"" Repeat until your dog sits pretty every time.

, Now that your dog can sit pretty, it is time for your dog to master the trick. Have them sit pretty like usual, but this time see how long they can hold it for. If your dog is having a hard time balancing, try helping them by holding their paw. Repeat until your dog can hold the position for at least 5 seconds. Now you can show all of your friends and family what a cool dog you have!"
"
Begin doorway “wait”-training early.,
Place the dog on a leash.,
Walk to the door.,
Give a “wait” command before stepping through.,
Praise him when he waits.,
Teach him to sit in the threshold.,
Give a separate command to encourage him through the doorway.,
Increase the distance.",How to Train a Dog8," Teaching a dog to respect the threshold is important. You do not want a dog that runs out the door every time it opens — that could be dangerous for him. Doorway training doesn't need to happen every single time you go through a doorway. But you should make the most of your training opportunities early in your puppy's life.

, You should have him on a short leash that allows you to change his direction from a close distance.

, Bring the dog along with you on his leash.

, If your dog moves to follow you when you step through the door, use the leash to stop his forward movement. Try again.

, When he realizes that you want him to stay in the door instead of walking through it with you, lavish him with praise and rewards for the ""good wait.""

, If the door is closed, you can even teach your dog to sit as soon as you place your hand on the doorknob. He'll then wait while the door is opened, and not cross the threshold until you release him. This training should be done on leash at the beginning, for his safety.

, You might use a ""come"" or a ""free."" Whatever command you use, it should be the only thing that allows your dog to exit your home.

, Practice leaving the dog at the threshold and do something on the other side. You might get the mail or take out the trash before you return and praise him. The idea is that you do not always call him across the threshold to meet you. You can also come back to him.

"
"
Do not feed your dog from the table.,
Have him wait patiently while you prepare his meal.",How to Train a Dog9," This will only start him down the path to begging. Ask him to go to his bed or crate and stay there without whining while you and your family eat.


When you are finished eating your meal, you can then prepare his meal.

, There’s nothing more annoying than a dog who jumps and barks while you’re trying to prepare his meal. Instead, use the “wait” command he learned in doorway training to have him wait outside the threshold of the room where he's fed.


When you're ready, have the dog “sit” and “wait” while you place the food on the ground.
Stand up and wait a few breaths before giving your release word. You can use “free” or you can create a new command for feeding time like “get your food” or “yummy.” Try to choose something you wouldn't accidentally say to other people, such as ""time to eat,"" or, ""let's eat,"" as this might falsely cue your dog that it's time for his dinner.
Eventually, he will sit on his own as soon as he sees his feeding bowl.

"
"
Understand the command.,
Give your dog a toy to play with.,
Transition to less rewarding objects.,
Pair “take” training with “drop it” training.",How to Train a Dog10," The “take” is used whenever you want the dog to take something you offer into his mouth.

, Give him the verbal command “take” as you do so. As he takes the toy in his mouth, reward him for the behavior with praise. (Plus, he gets to play with the toy!)

, It's easy for a dog to learn ""take"" when the object is so much fun! When he's mastered the connection between command and behavior, move on to boring objects. Examples might include newspapers, light bags, or anything else you might want him to carry.

, Once he takes the toy, use the command “drop it” to have the dog release the toy back to you. Give him a treat and praise when he releases the toy, then start again with “take.” You don’t want the dog to think that the fun stops every time he releases the toy.


Do not get into a tugging match with the dog. When you tug, the dog tugs back harder.

"
"
Understand the value of the “stand” command.,
Prepare for the training session.,
Focus the dog’s attention.,
Encourage the dog to follow your hand.,
Give immediate praise.,
Add the verbal ""stand"" command.,
Combine the “stand” with other commands.",How to Train a Dog11," The value of the ""sit"" and ""wait"" seem obvious, but you may not understand at first why the ""stand"" is an important skill to teach your dog. You'll won't use the ""stand"" every day, but you'll need it throughout the dog's life. For example, a dog who can stay calmly in a ""stand"" is the ideal patient at a vet clinic or client at a groomer's.

, Grab his favorite toy or prepare a handful of treats to both focus your dog's attention and reward him for learning the command. Put the dog in a starting ""down"" or ""lie down"" position when working with the ""stand"" command. He should move from lying down to standing up to get his toy or treats.

, You want to coax him into the standing position by having him follow the toy or treat. Hold the toy or treat in front of his face, at nose height.


If he sits, thinking that will earn him a reward, try again, but with the treat or toy slightly lower.

, Flatten your hand with your palm down. If you're using a treat, hold it with your thumb against your palm. Start with your hand in front of his nose and move it away a few inches. The idea is that the dog will stand up while following your hand.


You may need to use your other hand to encourage him from underneath his hips to get the idea at first.

, As soon as he reaches the standing position, praise and treat. Although you haven't yet started using the verbal ""stand"" command, you can use it in your praise: ""good stand!""

, At first, you will work only on getting your dog to stand by following the hand that holds his toy or treat. When he's mastered that concept, begin incorporating the ""stand"" command into the training sessions.

, There are many ways to combine commands. After getting your dog to ""stand,"" you might add a “wait” or “stay” command if you want the dog to stand for longer periods of time. You can also follow with a ""sit"" or ""down"" to do some “doggy drills,” and gradually increase the distance between you and the dog. Eventually, you'll have your dog performing these commands from across the room.

"
"
Understand the command.,
Clicker train your dog.,
Figure out when your dog barks most.,
Recreate the triggering event.,
Use the verbal ""speak"" command from the beginning.,
Combine the “speak” with the “quiet” command.",How to Train a Dog12," The “speak” command teaches your dog to bark in response to your verbal cue. On its own, this command is something of a novelty. But in combination with the “quiet” command, it can help manage a barking problem in an overly vocal dog.Take extreme caution when teaching this command. Inexperienced trainers sometimes find ""speak"" training spirals out of control. They end up with a dog who barks at them all the time.

, ""Speak"" training requires immediate praise, more so than other commands do. Teach your dog to associate the click sound with a treat by clicking and treating a few times in a row.


Continue this clicker training until your dog sees the click sound as a reward in and of itself. The treat will come later.

, This will vary from dog to dog, so you have to observe your specific pet. He might bark most reliably when you withhold a treat, when someone knocks on the door, when someone rings the doorbell, or when someone honks a horn.

, Once you’ve figured out what makes your dog bark, perform that action in front of your dog. The idea is to encourage him to bark on his own, then praise him for the action.


You can see how this might be dangerous in the hands of an inexperienced trainer.
That's why ""speak"" training is a little different from the other commands. You'll incorporate the verbal command from the very beginning. That way, the dog doesn't think you're praising him for his natural behavior.

, As soon as your dog barks for the very first time, give the verbal ""speak"" command, click, and give him a treat.


The other commands thus far have taught the behavior first, then added a command that preceded the behavior.
However, ""speak"" training gets out of hand too easily that way. The dog gets rewarded for barking at first.
Thus, it's better to associate the verbal command with the behavior already in progress. Never reward the dog for barking without the verbal command.

, If you have a dog who naturally barks too much, you might not think teaching him to ""speak"" is going to help your situation. However, if you teach him to ""speak,"" then you can also teach him to ""quiet."" While you may not need the ""speak"" for a dog who barks too much, you definitely need the ""quiet.""


Once your dog has mastered the ""speak,"" begin incorporating ""quiet"" into your training sessions.
Give the ""speak"" command.
However, instead of rewarding the ""speak"" (barking), wait until the dog stops barking.
Give the verbal ""quiet"" command.
If the dog remains silent, reward the ""quiet"" (no barking) with a click and a treat.

Use a suitable collar and leash.,
Plan on short walks.,
Choose a treat to use only while walking.,
Start indoors if the dog is completely untrained.,
Teach the dog to stay calm before a walk.,
Keep treats in a pouch or pocket.,
Feed the dog treats as you walk.,
Stop and call the dog if it moves away.,
Grant permission to investigate objects.,
Gradually increase the duration of the walks.,
Reduce the number of treats.,
Use punishment sparingly.",How to Teach Your Dog to Walk on a Leash," While the dog is still learning good walk behavior, use a non-extendable leash between 4 and 6 feet long (1.2–1.8 meters), and avoid chokes, prong collars, and other collars that cause pain to the dog.You can use a head halter or ""no-pull"" front attachment harness to minimize the amount a large, energetic dog can pull, but be aware that you should not strain on the leash either, due to the risk of serious damage to the dog's neck.


An extendable leash makes the dog pull on the leash even when it's supposed to move, making training difficult. Long, extendable leashes are better suited for playing at the dog park.;
, Until your dog follows you on the leash without pulling or constant stopping, consider your walks training sessions. Like all training sessions, they work best when they're short, frequent, and fun for the dog. Try taking a five minute walk twice a day, and increase that up to ten minutes only if your dog stays focused on the training exercises described below.


Since this is less exercise than a dog needs, supplement walks with a drive to a dog park, or energetic games of fetch or tug-of-war in a backyard or hallway. If convenient, get this exercise done before the walk, so the dog is less rambunctious., Almost all of the training methods below involve giving your dog treats, an excellent motivation for dogs that will help it learn good behavior. Pick something the dog gets excited about, preferably something with a strong smell and soft enough to eat quickly during a walk. Give this treat only during a walk, and only as described in the instructions below.


Try pieces of hot dog, cooked chicken or ham, cheese, jerky treats, or freeze-dried liver. Many dogs even like fruits and vegetables, but avoid grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, chives, avocados, unripe tomatoes, and inedible seeds.Cut the treats into pea-sized pieces. You'll be feeding the dog a lot of these, so they need to be small to avoid overfeeding., If the dog strains at the leash the entire walk, barks or runs at passersby, or if you've tried the training methods below and the dog won't pay attention to them, start out indoors or in your backyard, where there are fewer distractions. You can use the ordinary training techniques described below, walking around the yard or apartment, or get a training clicker and use these training lessons that you can do in a small area:Put the leash on and stand at the end of it, so it is taut. When the leash goes slack, click the clicker and show the dog a treat in your hand. Put the treat on the ground next to your left foot. Move to the end of the leash, and repeat several times.
Once the dog learns to stay near you (which may take several 5-minute sessions), toss a treat pass the dog's nose, within range of the leash. If the dog comes back to you after eating the treat, click again and put a second treat down next to your foot. Repeat this training exercise until the dog returns to you consistently.

, If your dog starts jumping or barking when it sees you pick up the leash, stand there patiently until the dog stops. Once it is standing still and quietly, slowly move to clip the leash onto the collar. If the dog gets excited again, pull back and wait. Don't put the leash on until the dog stays still for the whole process. Stand still again if the dog tries to bolt out the door, until the leash goes slack. Praise the dog when this happens, then walk it for a couple minutes indoors or in the yard, so it calms down before you begin on the real walk., Being able to reach treats immediately is important for training, so the dog learns which behavior is being rewarded. Traditionally, dogs are taught to walk on the left side, so keep the treats in a left pocket or waist pouch.

, Put a few small treats in your closed fist and walk along with your hand in front of the dog's nose. Every few seconds, pop a treat into your dog's mouth as you continue walking.

, If the dog runs forward or hangs back, stop and call the dog to you. Continue to call the dog back patiently, until it returns. When it does, tell it to sit, feed it a treat, and praise it. Continue your walk as before, feeding it treats as you do.


If the dog starts walking ahead but hasn't lunged to the end of the leash yet, say ""Easy."" Say ""Yes"" and give a treat if it responds by turning around and coming back to you.

, If the dog pulls at the leash to eliminate or to sniff an object, stop and call it back. When it comes, praise it, say ""Yes,"" and let it go where it wants to go. Follow it so the leash stays slack.

, When you start out, you might just walk up and down the block, so the dog doesn't stop paying attention. Each day, walk a little further.

, After at least a week of this, straighten up and keep your hand near your pocket of treats, around waist level. Every other step or so, take a treat from your pocket and lower it to the dog. If the dog can walk for several minutes without pulling on the leash, you can slowly increase the number of steps between treats. Try to reach one treat per minute within a couple weeks.

, Dogs have trouble understanding the purpose of punishment, which makes it an ineffective motivation technique. You should only use these techniques sparingly to discourage unusually bad behavior, not on every walk:


Never use these techniques with a choke, pinch, or prong collar, or a head halter.
If the dog ignores your commands to slow down and return to you, stop talking and turn back the way you came, tugging at the leash gently. Praise the dog when it catches up to you, then turn around and resume the walk.
If the dog strains at the leash and ignores you, give the leash a short jerk back and upward, not a prolonged pull. Match the force of the tug to the size of the dog; it shouldn't be lifted up off its feet. Praise and give a treat when the dog returns.

It also helps if your dog has an energetic personality. Dogs who love to play chase or catch are often good candidates for this trick.;
, This basic command is important for teaching a dog to remain in the standing start until you give the order to bolt.


If you have not yet taught your dog to ""stay,"" read this helpful wikiHow article for advice on this and other basic commands including sit, lay down, recall, and heel.

, Aggressive or overly hyper dogs can become too enthusiastic during a bolting exercise and end up jumping up on someone or even attacking.


If your dog has behavioral problems, you might consider enrolling him in an obedience course. If he is aggressive in any way, including growling, lunging, or biting at you, other people, or other dogs, be sure to address that problem before worrying about any skills or tricks. Nothing is as important as teaching your dog to be safe., A lure is any toy, treat, or person that your dog loves so much he can't resist it. It's likely that your dog already has his list of favorite things, so you may not have to introduce anything special or new.


Teach your dog to sit and stay using the lure as ""bait"" to tempt him. This will help him become accustomed to receiving the lure at the end of a successful trick., To begin, you will need your dog, a collar, a lure, and a partner who can help you.


Practice this trick on a sunny day in a well-enclosed space like a backyard. You don't want to practice it at the park or other public place where your dog is likely to be distracted or where he could run off.
Make sure your dog is restless and ready for a run. Bolting from a standing start requires a lot of energy and momentum.
Get the dog ready by having your partner show him a treat or lure toy. Have the partner give the dog a treat, if you're using food, to get him wanting more.

, Now that your dog has a collar, hold it and walk him into position at the ""starting line.""


Tell the dog to ""stay"" in place at the starting line. Keep a hold on that collar.

, As your friend walks, have her say the dog's name to keep his attention. Keep the dog by the collar until your friend has backed up quite a distance, at least thirty feet.


Once your friend is in place, she should continue keeping the dog's attention on the lure while you hold the dog's collar and say, ""Ready... Set... GO!"" Be sure to build up anticipation in your voice and finish by yelling ""Go!"" as you release the collar and lightly tap the dog's rump. Do NOT hit or push the dog; only lightly pat him to signal him to run.

, The dog should bolt suddenly to your friend, where she should give him the lure as a reward.


Reward your dog with treats, praise and pats. Rest for a bit before your next try, and make sure water is on hand for everyone.

, While you might have to hold an eager dog in the ""stay"" position using his collar at first, eventually you need to train the dog to stay without it. If your dog will stay in place, you can play the role your partner previously filled.


Take your dog to the starting line and say ""stay."" Once the dog is in position, you yourself can back up into the ""finish line"" position. Say ""Ready… set… GO!"" in the same tone of voice you used before, holding your own hand over head with a treat as a lure.
Keep trying until the dog catches on. Remember to reward all good effort and successes with a treat and plenty of praise, since dogs respond best to positive reinforcement., Once you have practiced this trick several times on different days using a lure for bait, do what dog trainers call ""fading a lure"" or eliminating the dog's need to have a reward for performing a requested trick.Your partner can use a lure to get the dog to bolt, then repeat the maneuver but without using a lure. Have your partner hold her hand in a fist over her head as if she had a lure. When the dog bolts to her, she will show her empty hand and pet the dog and praise him for bolting. Have her take the dog and get a treat anyway, so the dog won't feel cheated.Alternate using a lure with not using one, eventually going several times without using one before offering one again. Eventually, a fist will become the hand signal you use to lure your dog to bolt.

Factor in the age of the dog.,
Consider the breed of the dog.,
Think about the number of litters the dog has produced.,
Determine if the dog has demonstrated any inheritable conditions.,
Observe if the dog is healthy enough to continue breeding.,
Consider if the dog has had any complicated pregnancies.,
Reflect on whether the dog meets breed standards.,
Understand the heat cycle.,
Learn about health complications associated with pregnancy.,
Talk to experienced breeders.",How to Know when to Stop Breeding a Female Dog," There are a variety of opinions and standards as to when dogs should be retired from breeding. However, you should follow standards you are most comfortable with to protect the health of your dog.


Many kennel clubs require a dog to be 8 years or younger to register litters.
Many vets suggest that dogs of normal health should be retired from breeding around 8 years old.
The strictest standard to retire a dog from breeding is 5 years of age.
Consult your vet when considering breeding a dog older than 5 years old.
The age of your dog needs to be evaluated with other factors including size and breed.;
, Certain breeds of dogs should be retired from breeding earlier than others. This is because some breeds have physiological issues and other related problems that could cause complications with pregnancy.


Chihuahuas and other toy dogs should be retired from breeding around 5 years old.
Large breed dogs like standard poodles should be retired from breeding around 5 or 6 years old.
Medium sized dogs may be bred longer than small or large breed dogs, depending on specific medical conditions and the opinion of your veterinarian., Many responsible breeders, vets, and kennel clubs suggest that people stop breeding dogs after a certain number of pregnancies. Consider:


Some kennel clubs will stop registering litters after a dog has whelped 4 or 6 litters.
Many veterinarians advise to retire a dog from breeding after 4 litters.
The higher number of pregnancies, the lower the genetic diversity within a certain breed.
Many irresponsible breeders, known as puppy mills, produce large numbers of dogs regardless of the health and well-being of the dogs themselves., You should stop breeding a female dog if she or her offspring has developed some sort of medical condition that is inheritable. Such dogs are bad breeding stock and will perpetuate health problems and the decline of the breed. Some conditions include:


Blindness.
Heart problems.
Hip dysplasia.
Thyroid disease., Discontinue breeding if your dog has developed medical problems that threaten their health or wellbeing. In addition, don’t breed the dog if it has a medical condition that can be exacerbated by pregnancy. Some problems include:


Diabetes.
Hip problems, like hip dysplasia.
Reproductive issues like prolapsed or distended uterus., Most vets and breeders agree that dogs who have had complicated pregnancies should not be bred again. This is because complications are a good indication of problems in the future. Such complications include:


An unplanned C-section.
Miscarriage.
Stalled labor and delivery., One of the major mottos of responsible breeders is “breed to improve.” Thus, you should stop breeding your female dog if you think her offspring does not represent a breed standard or improve the health of the breed. Consider if:


The puppies are good representatives of the overall breed. For example, a desirable boxer dog is flashy fawn (brown with a white chest) and white feet (“socks”).
The offspring possess characteristics that are undesirable. Such characteristics include albinism, blindness, or birth defects.
Consult a kennel club for more information about breed standards., The heat cycle is the cycle, like human menstruation, that regulates the reproductive system of female dogs. Before thinking about breeding, you need to be familiar with the of the heat cycle.


Female dogs go into heat starting around 4 months old. This depends on size though, as small dogs may begin around 4 months and larger dogs may not begin until 24 months.
Heat lasts approximately 2 to 4 weeks.
Many dogs are most fertile about 9 or 10 days after heat has begun. This period is about 5 days long.
After reaching maturity, dogs will go into heat regularly. For most dogs, this is about every 6 months. Smaller dogs may go into heat every 3 or 4 months, and larger dogs may only go into heat every 12 to 18 months., As a demanding physical condition, pregnancy puts serious stress on a dog’s body. In addition, there are a variety of complications that could threaten the dog’s health. Some problems include:


Uterine infection.
Inflammation of the mammary glands.
Eclampsia, which is a condition associated with blood calcium depletion in nursing dogs.
Prolapsed or distended uterus., Experienced breeders in your community, or around your region, are a great resource for you when it comes to learning about breeding. As people who have bred dogs for many years, they know the intricacies of breeding.


Contact a kennel club, like the American Kennel Club, for information on experienced breeders near you. In addition, a kennel club might have information on breeding or a contact person for breeders.
Find a mentor in your community. You might be able to find a mentor through a veterinarian."

Visit your veterinarian.,
Understand your dog’s reproductive age.,
Know when your dog will go into heat.",How to Know When to Breed Your Dog1," Before you decide to breed your dog, you should visit a veterinarian and chat with them about what you will need to do to prepare. They will do a blood test or a vaginal cytology test to determine if your dog is going through heat.Your veterinarian should also do certain genetic tests on your dog to determine if it can deliver viable pups or if it is passing on any degenerative diseases. Finally, your veterinarian should also give your dog any necessary vaccines.Unless you are a professional breeder, your veterinarian will likely try to talk you out of breeding your dog. Because of the overpopulation of domesticated dogs, your veterinarian will probably suggest that you have your dog spayed/neutered.
Properly testing your dog’s heat will help you better know when to breed it.
Breeding studs can reproduce will into old age and generally do not suffer from fertility issues. However, the disease brucellosis can cause infertility in male dogs, so be sure to have your breeding stud regularly checked.;
, Depending on its size and breed, your female dog will not enter estrus until she is at least six months to a year old. Smaller dogs tend to go through estrus before larger dogs. As a female dog ages, she will still be fertile. However, with age comes an increased risk of birth defects and complications. If you breed your dog, make sure it occurs while she is in her prime birthing years.Depending on the breed, many dogs are considered middle-aged or elderly after five to six years.

, Depending on the size and breed of your dog, it will likely go into heat twice a year with an average of six months between each episode. Knowing when your dog will go into heat will help you properly prepare for breeding. Your veterinarian should be able to help you determine what your dog’s cycle is.Depending on the breed and size of the dog, estrus typically lasts 4 to 6 weeks.

Understand the value of crate training.,
Begin crate training young.,
Make the crate an inviting space.Don’t isolate him in the crate immediately by locking the door the first time you get him to enter it.,
Encourage him to enter the crate.,
Feed the dog in his crate.,
Begin closing the door behind him.,
Don't reward the dog for whining.,
Comfort your dog during long crate sessions.",How to Train a Dog13," You might think it cruel to pen a dog up in a crate for hours at a time. But dogs are instinctively den animals, so confined spaces are not as oppressive to them as they are to us. In fact, crate trained dogs will seek out their crates as a source of comfort.


Crate training is a useful way to manage your dog's behavior when he's unsupervised for extended periods of time.
For example, many owners crate their dogs when they go to sleep or leave the house.

, Although older dogs can be taught to enjoy their crates as well, it's easier to train a young dog.


If your puppy is a large breed, don't train him in a large crate that you think he'll grow into.
Dogs won't relieve themselves where they sleep or relax, so you need the crate to be appropriately sized.
If you use a crate that's too large, he might urinate in the far corner of it because he has so much space.

, You want him to create a positive association with the crate, so that he enjoys his time in there.


When you begin the crate training process, place the crate somewhere the household gathers. The idea is to make the crate part of the social scene rather than a place of isolation.
Place a soft blanket and some of your dog's favorite toys inside the crate.

, Once you've made the crate an inviting space, use treats to lure him inside. At first, place some outside the door so he can explore the exterior of the crate. Then, place treats just inside the door, so he will poke his head in to retrieve them. As he grows more comfortable, place the treats further and further inside the crate.


Do this until your dog enters the crate without hesitation.
Always speak in your ""happy voice"" when acclimating your dog to the crate.

, Once he's comfortable entering the crate for treats, reinforce the positive association with mealtime.


Place his dog bowl wherever he's comfortable eating. If he's still a little anxious, you might have to place it right by the door.
As he grows more comfortable over time, place the dog bowl further back into the cage.

, With treats and feeding, you'll find that your dog is growing more acclimated to being in the crate. He still needs to learn how to cope with the door being closed.


Begin closing the door at mealtime, when the dog too distracted by his food to notice what's going on at first.
Close the door for very short periods, lengthening the time as the dog grows more comfortable.

, When a puppy whines, it may be adorable and heartbreaking, but when a grown dog whines, it can drive you nuts. If your puppy whines inconsolably, you may have left him inside the crate for too long. However, you cannot release him from the crate until the whining stops. Remember — every reward you give reinforces the dog's last behavior, which was whining in this case.


Instead, release the dog once he's stopped whining.
The next time you close the door on the crate, leave him in for a shorter period of time.

, If your puppy cries when he's alone in the crate, bring the crate into your bedroom at night. Have a tick tock clock or white noise machine to help the puppy get to sleep. Make sure that they have already eliminated outside and don’t need to urinate or defecate.


Young puppies should be crated in your room at night so that you can hear them tell you they need to go out in the middle of the night. Otherwise, they will be forced to mess in the crate.

Make sure your dog is of breeding age.,
Get a fertility check done.,
Confirm your dog’s fertility with your vet.,
Have your dog examined for health issues.,
Determine your dog’s genetic traits.,
Confirm your dog's breed standards.,
Determine your dog’s ideal female mate.,
Register your dog with the American Kennel Club.,
Create a stud contract.",How to Know if Your Male Dog Is Ready to Breed," Male dogs should only be bred once they are at least 1 ½ to 2 years of age. Many health tests cannot be run on dogs until they are two years of age, so you should only breed your male dog when he is of age and cleared for breeding.Depending on your dog’s breed, he may not be able to mate successfully after the age of seven years old. You may need to speak to your vet to confirm your dog is healthy enough to breed if he is over seven years old.;
, Some male dogs may experience infertility or difficulties with breeding because they are too young or too old for breeding, they have a low sperm count, or they have a disease or disorder. You should confirm your dog is fertile and able to mate with a female dog before you proceed with the breeding process. Your vet can do a physical exam of your dog’s genital area and run tests to confirm your dog is fertile.Your vet will exam your dog’s reproductive anatomy and his prostate. They will also collect semen from your dog to be examined. If your dog is older, the vet may also require a sperm sample for testing.
Your vet may also ask you about your dog’s history of breeding. For example, they may ask, “Has your dog mated successfully with a female before?” “How many litters has your dog sired?” “What issues does your dog seem to have during mating?”

, Once your vet has run tests and examined your dog, they should tell you if your dog is fertile or infertile. If your dog is having fertility problems and he is young in age, your vet may tell you to wait one year and then have him retested to see if his fertility improves with age.If your dog has a thyroid issue that results in a low spear count, your vet may recommend thyroid replacement or a hormone replacement.
If your dog has prostate issues, such as an infection, your vet may recommend antibiotics and hormone therapy.

, Before you breed your male dog, you should confirm he is in good health. Ask your vet to do a complete physical exam on your dog to check for health issues like hip dysplasia and joint problems. You want to be sure your dog does not have these health issues as you do not want them passed on to his litter when he does breed with a female dog.Your vet should also check his ears and his eyes to ensure they are in good working condition.
You should have your vet run a blood test and a urinalysis to check for any diseases or disorders, such as bone disease.

, You should also have tests done to confirm your dog’s genetic make up, especially if your dog is not a pure breed. Having clear information on your dog’s genetics can help you match him with a mating partner and get a good idea of the genetic makeup of any puppies he sires. You can arrange for a genetic test through your vet or through a trusted online testing service. You will need to provide a swab sample from your dog to complete the genetic test.The cost of a genetic test can range from $60 to $150. These tests will tell you about the dog's heritage and therefore any diseases they are at greater risk of carrying. They do not, however, tell you if a dog carries the gene for those diseases or not.

, Study the standard for your dog’s breed and confirm he is a healthy example of his breed. Research your dog’s breed on through the breed’s national parent club to find out more about what traits your dog should possess in order to breed. Some traits may be physical, such as a certain color to his coat or a certain shape to his body. Some traits may be behavioral, such as a certain demeanor or personality to your dog.You can also speak to other pet owners who have the same breed to get a sense of the standards for the breed. You want to ensure your male dog is a high example of his breed, as this will increase the quality of any litters he sires.

, You may want to establish your male dog as a stud that is suitable for breeding so you can find female mates for him more easily. Part of doing this is ensuring you know the ideal female mate for your dog. Make sure the dam complements your dog. Go for a dam who has a strong bloodline and qualities that will suit your dog’s qualities, such as physical appearance or level of intelligence.You should also look for a female dog that has a temperament that is calm, collected, and friendly, as this often indicates she will be a good mating partner.
Make sure the female dog is in good health and does not have any genetic issues. This will ensure the resulting litter is free of health problems or deficiencies.

, Though not required, registering your dog with the American Kennel Club (AKC) will let other owners know that your dog is recognized as a suitable option for breeding. You will need to have certified ownership of your dog to register him with the AKC.You can find out more on registering your dog with the American Kennel Club by looking at their website or by contacting them by phone.

, Once you have decided to make your dog available for breeding, you should draw up a stud contract. A stud contract should cover where the breeding will occur, as well as outline the stud fees, which will be set by you, the male dog’s owner. You may request a cash fee, a “pick of the litter,” or one or two puppies from the resulting litter. The contract should be signed by you and by the owner of the female dog before the breeding takes place.If you are unsure how much to charge in the stud contract, talk to your dog’s breeder or the American Kennel Club for guidance.
If your dog has not been used as a stud before, you may charge the female dog owner a nominal fee to cover health checks and fertility checks as part of the contract.

Check for swelling in the vulva.,
Look for vaginal bleeding.,
Notice increased urination.,
Prepare to start breeding.",How to Know When to Breed Your Dog2," Vulvar swelling is the first physical indication that your dog is entering the heat cycle. The vulva will appear swollen and distended from your dog’s body. This is quite distinct and you should notice it with your naked eye. Depending on the size and breed of your dog, this initial stage can last 4 to 15 days.During this early stage, referred to as proestrus, the female will not allow breeding.

, During proestrus, your dog may have some vaginal bleeding. This bleeding will diminish and the blood will take on a browner hue as she gets closer to ovulation. Your dog may lick the blood off itself, so you will need to be vigilant., During this initial stage, you may also notice that your dog will urinate more frequently. Your dog may need to walk more frequently. It may also act more agitated because of increased pressure on its bladder. If you notice that your dog is urinating more often, in combination with a swollen vulva and vaginal bleeding, your dog has likely entered heat.This increase in urination is a result of your dog releasing pheromones and hormones that let male dogs know that she will be ready to breed soon.

, The best time to breed your dog is 10 to 11 days after you notice the first bleeding. Once the bleeding disappears, your dog is in estrus and ready to mate. You should then breed your dog every other day after that for three days. You should utilize this information in conjunction with your veterinarian’s recommendations to ensure that breeding is a success.If you know that your dog is entering heat, you may want to put a white sheet in your dog’s bedding so that you will know when it starts bleeding.
Most dogs are the most fertile in the first 48 hours of estrus.

"
"
Notice if your dog licks itself more than normal.,
Watch for odd behavior.,
Look for increased sexual activity.,
Pay attention to your dog’s body language.",How to Know When to Breed Your Dog3," As your dog enters heat, she will likely lick herself more than usual. The dog may lick up the bloody discharge. It also may be licking because of discomfort from vulvar swelling.


This usually occurs during proestrus.

, When a female enters heat, she may act differently. Unusual behaviors include increased nervousness, agitation, and irritability. Because of this, your dog may bark more often and be more aggressive towards other people and dogs.If your dog’s attitude changes, this tends to only last during proestrus.
Your dog may be more aggressive towards other female dogs and start fights with them.
Your dog may also become more clingy and not want to leave your side during the early cycle.

, Once your dog enters the second stage of heat, referred to as estrus, she is ready to breed. During this stage, she may begin to mount other dogs. She will also allow other dogs to mount her., When your dog enters estrus, she will wag her tail from side to side in order to let the males know that she is available. This is known as “flagging” and is a sign that she is ready to breed.Depending on your dog’s size and breed, ovulation usually occurs in the first 48 hours of estrus.

"
"
Look for increased attention towards the female.,
Notice amplified aggressive behavior.,
Be prepared for a change in attitude.",How to Know When to Breed Your Dog4," Once a female enters heat, male dogs will be drawn the hormones and pheromones she secretes in her urine. You may notice that male dogs give her more attention at the dog park or that you have stray dogs hanging around your home. Initially, the female will ignore the males but, once she enters estrus, she will allow them to breed with her.If you want the female to breed with a certain male, do not allow her around any other male dogs during estrus.
Increased male attention is a great way to determine if your female is a “silent heater.” This female dog goes through heat and produces hormones, but does not develop any of the external indicators.

, Male dogs will fight over the female and become more aggressive when around her. If you own multiple dogs, you may notice that the males become territorial and aggressive towards each other while the female is in heat. They will also be more aggressive towards other males that they encounter and possibly fight over the female., If you own a male and female dog, you may notice a dramatic change in behavior. Your male dog may begin to pay the female more attention. He may also whimper and become irritable if you separate him from the female. If your male dog begins to show signs of separation anxiety towards the female, the female is likely in heat."
"
Examine your dog’s genital area.,
Check for blood or discharge.,
Notice if your dog is urinating more often.,
Make sure your dog is the correct breeding age.,
Track your dog’s heat cycle.,
Get a vaginal smear done by your vet.,
Have a serum progesterone test done on your dog.,
Locate a suitable male dog for breeding.,
Bring the female dog to the male dog at the right time.,
Create a stress-free environment for the breeding.",How to Know if Your Female Dog Is Ready to Breed," When your female dog is going into heat, her vulva will begin to swell. You should notice that her genital area will appear enlarged and protruding outward. The tip of her vulva should move upwards to make it easier for a male dog to penetrate her. These are all signs that she is in heat. You can turn your dog over on her stomach to examine her genital area or observe her genital area from behind. You should be able to see her swollen vulva from behind.;
, You should also notice your female dog is spotting around your home, such as on furniture, on her bed, or on any carpeting. The spotting or discharge may appear deep red, milky pink, or white. Your dog will be fertile around 12 days after she starts bleeding, as it gets thinner and lighter.You may also notice the blood or discharge has a distinct smell. The strong smell is meant to attract the attention of a male dog.
Some female dogs will bleed very heavily when they are in heat while other dogs will only have minimal bleeding or discharge.

, You should also observe your dog’s behavior and pay attention to how often she urinates. If she is urinating in small quantities more frequently, she is likely in heat. Her urine contains pheromones and hormones, which will help let males know she is interested in mating.You may notice that your female dog wants to be let outside more often to urinate than she usually does. This could be a sign she is experiencing the period in her heat cycle when she is most fertile.

, You should also confirm your dog is old enough to mate. Most female dogs should not breed with a male dog until they have had two to three heat cycles. They should be at least one to two years of age.


If you are not sure your dog is mature enough to breed, ask your vet. Your vet should be able to tell you if your female dog is ready for breeding.

, Dogs go into heat about twice a year, so track your dog's cycle to determine when she is ovulating (which means she is fertile). Female dogs have four different stages in their cycle: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and anestrus. You may need to track several of your dog’s heat cycles to confirm each stage.The proestrus stage starts when the female dog’s vulva begins to swell and starts to spot. It is usually nine days, but can last from four to 20 days. During this stage, your dog may attract males but not accept them for mating.The estrus stage begins next, and this is the period where the female dog can breed. This period usually lasts nine days, and she is most fertile for the first five days of it. She will become more social with males and allow them to mate with her. You'll know the fertile stage is complete when her vagina returns to its normal appearance and she no longer flirts with or accepts mates.The metestrus stage is usually 50 days, but can last from 80 to 90 days, and the final stage called the anestrus stage can last for two to three months. During the metestrus and anestrus periods, the female dog is at the end of her cycle and will not allow breeding.

, You can confirm your dog is in heat by having your vet perform a vaginal smear on your female dog. A vaginal smear is done by examining vaginal cells from your dog under a microscope. It is a non-invasive procedure and does not harm your dog. Your vet will require a sample form your dog and may perform a test on several samples to confirm your dog is in heat.As part of the testing, your vet will look for changes in cells that show your dog is ovulating. The vaginal smear can also determine your dog’s optimal breeding time.

, You can also determine your dog’s ovulation by having your vet do a blood test to measure the progesterone level in your dog’s blood. This test requires your dog to provide a blood sample. Your vet may need several samples to accurately predict your dog’s ovulation period.This test is considered very accurate for determining the optimal mating time for a female dog. It is an ideal option if your female dog has a history of unsuccessful mating or if you want to be sure the female dog is ready before bringing her to a male dog for mating.

, To breed your female dog with a male dog, you will need to find her a suitable mate. Look for a male dog of the same breed who is healthy and has no genetic faults or issues. You should meet with the male dog’s owner beforehand or with the breeder and discuss the dog’s health and medical history.You should also confirm the male dog’s age. Most breeds should mate when they are between one year to seven years old.
Make sure you talk with your vet before you mate your female dog with a male dog. Your vet should clear your dog of any health issues or problems before you start the breeding process.

, Often, male dogs do better when they mate with a female dog on their territory or home area. You may discuss bringing your female dog to the male dog at the ideal breeding time with the male dog’s owner. Set a mating date based on your female dog’s heat cycle so the mating occurs when she is most fertile.Do not mate your dog on her first heat cycle. Wait until she has had one to two heat cycles to mate her. This will ensure she is healthy enough for mating.You may also arrange for two matings between the dogs, twenty-four or forty-eight hours apart. This can help to increase the likelihood of your dog getting pregnant.

, Once the breeding date is set, you should bring the female dog to the male dog in a stress-free environment. The male dog’s owner should set up a space that is clean and open for the breeding. If the female dog is in the right stage of her heat cycle, she should warm up to the male dog pretty quickly. She will show signs of attraction, and if the male dog follows suit, the breeding should occur rather naturally.If the mating is not successful, you may ask the male dog’s owner about next steps. Professional breeders may offer a free service or mating session next time to make up for the failed breeding.

Obtain a whelping box.,
Create a den out of other materials.,
Place the whelping box in a secluded location.",How to Make a Den for a Mother Dog and Her Puppies1," You can either buy a whelping box or build one. You can find whelping boxes for sale at pet stores and online. Make sure to choose a whelping box that is big enough for your dog to stretch out and lie down in, but small enough that the puppies can’t get too far away from the mother.Make sure the walls are high enough to keep the puppies in and prevent drafts. There should be a door or lowered area that is at a height where the mother dog can step over it.
You should make sure the whelping box has rails along the sides to protect the puppies.
You can also build a whelping box. Make sure it still has all the features of one you would buy.;
, If you don’t want to build or buy a whelping box, you can create a den using boxes, crates, or even kiddie pools. You need an enclosed space that is big enough for the mother dog to stretch out in, but that is small enough to keep the puppies close to the mother and each other.You can use half of a crate without the top or a box with a small door area cut into it low enough for the mother to step over.
Make sure the edges are high enough so the puppies cannot get out, but low enough that the mother can step out of the box easily.

, Since your dog will want to keep the puppies protected and safe, you should build their den in a relatively private area in your home. This may be in a quiet unused room, a spare bathroom, or a garage.The room should be away from the normal foot traffic of your family or roommates.
The area for the den should be in a place where other pets cannot get to it.

"
"
Keep the den warm.,
Change the bedding often.,
Place a security bar in the box if it is a large breed.",How to Make a Den for a Mother Dog and Her Puppies2," One of the most important things that you can do for the litter is to keep the den warm. The puppies have to stay at a constant warm temperature, roughly 86 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. This is especially important with smaller breeds. To help with this, place a heat source in the box. You should also place make the den in a draft-free, warm area.Try a covering heating pad. Just make sure that it is not set at too high of a temperature. There have been cases where the puppies have cooked or gotten burned on a heating pad. Place the heating pad under the box, under the bedding material so the dogs won’t be lying directly on them. The heating pad shouldn’t cover the entire bottom of the box so the dogs can move away from the source of heat.You may want to use a heating lamp. If you are doing this, place it far enough above the box that the mother cannot hit her head. Six feet above the box is generally good. Position it over one corner so the mother or puppies can move away if they get too hot.

, Another way to keep your litter’s den comfortable is to keep it clean. The bedding and materials should be changed right after the birth. Then, it should be changed daily to clean up any mess from the puppies eliminating on the bedding or the mother shedding fetal tissues and fluids.Place clean newspaper in the box if you are using that. Lay down blankets that have been washed.

, If your dog is a larger breed, you should build security bars along the edge of the whelping box. These security bars should be tall and deep enough for a puppy to crawl under to get away from the mother so they don’t get stepped or rolled on.Security bars help prevent puppies who get in the corner or pushed outside of the litter group from getting crushed or suffocated on accident.

"
"
Drape a blanket over the den.,
Provide plenty of materials for a nest.,
Place pillows and blankets inside the den.",How to Make a Den for a Mother Dog and Her Puppies3," Dogs prefer that their litters be in a dark, secluded spot. This helps them feel safe and protected. If the whelping box is too exposed, the mother dog may try to move her puppies to a more secluded spot. To prevent this, put a blanket over the box.The blanket makes the dog feel less exposed and more protected from everything that is outside.

, The mother dog will want to build a nest as she prepares for birth and after the puppies arrive. To give her the proper materials, line the bottom of the whelping box with newspaper or puppy training pads. These things will be easy for the mother to shred.These materials can easily be changed daily, so you can keep the den clean. They also will absorb any fluids.

, You want to make the den as comfortable and cozy as possible for the mother and her puppies. To do this, you can place soft blankets, quilts, and pillows inside the box to provide and comfortable living area.If you are using pillows, make sure they are washable. If not, you will need to toss them out and replace them when they get dirty. Keeping pillows, blankets, and quilts clean is essential to keep the litter healthy.

Make sure that your dog is old enough to breed.,
Make sure your dog is generally healthy.,
Have the dog tested for infectious diseases and genetic issues.",How to Know if a Male Dog Is Fertile1," A male dog that is too young will not be able to reproduce. A male dog usually reaches sexual maturity when they are over a year old, however they usually begin puberty when they are six months to eight months old. They can impregnate a female dog from the point of puberty on.If you want to use your dog for breeding when it is at its maximum fertility, wait until it is at least a year and a half old.;
, The first step in assuring that your male dog is fertile is to make sure that he is generally healthy. If he has any severe health problems, these could interfere with his fertility.Make sure that your dog gets regular annual exams and that you treat any problems that are found effectively.
Some general health problems that could interfere with reproduction include mobility issues that could inhibit the ability to complete sexual intercourse or injuries to the reproductive organs of the dog.

, There are some diseases and genetic abnormalities that can make a dog infertile. If you are serious about wanting to use your male dog to breed, then you should have it tested for a diseases that could cause infertility and genetic problems that could cause infertility or genetic problems for offspring.For example, genetic problems could include chromosomal anomalies in the dog or the potential for polygenic disorders if mated.

Look for swelling of the vulva.,
Spot vaginal bleeding.,
Watch for increased urination.,
Consider getting your dog tested to determine when she is fertile.",How to Know if a Female Dog Is Fertile1," When the dog is reaching her fertile phase, known as estrus or heat, her vulva will begin to swell. This can be seen on the outside of her body if you look at the area directly below her anus.The vulva will be puffy and will appear red in color. By the time she is in full heat, the vulva will swell to about three times its normal size.;
, Along with the vulva swelling, she will also have bloody discharge coming out of her vagina.This discharge begins before the dog is fertile and lasts until after she has ovulated and is no longer fertile.


Vaginal bleeding usually starts a week or so before the dog actually ovulates.
Sometimes it is hard to spot the vaginal bleeding because the dog cleans herself quickly and does not allow it to become evident. In cases such as this, you should look for increased licking.

, During her fertile period, a female dog may urinate more than usual. This is a sign that her hormone levels are changing and that she may be ready to mate.The urine passed by a female dog in heat contains pheromones that signals to male dogs that she is in heat.

, There are tests that can be used to identify when a female dog is fertile and ready to mate. These can be done by veterinarians at their veterinary practices.One test is a vaginal cytology test. This is a non-invasive vaginal smear test that examines vaginal cells to look for changes associated with ovulation. To assess when your dog is fertile it may take several tries.
The other test is a serum progesterone test. This is a blood test that looks at progesterone levels. It is very accurate and popular but does require that your dog's blood be drawn.

Relocate the whelping box.,
Place a DAP collar on the dam.,
Create a calm environment.,
Aid the dam in nursing.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Handle a Mother Dog Refusing to Stay with Her Puppies1," If your dog has a close bond with you or suffers from separation anxiety, they may be leaving the whelping box to stay near you. While generally the whelping box should be located in a quiet and calm part of the home, if you suspect that this is the problem, you might want to relocate the box to an area where you spend most of your time., Dog Appeasing Pheromone (DAP) is a natural chemical signal that a mother dog releases when lactating to help calm and soothe her puppies. It has also been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in adult dogs. If your mother dog is refusing to nurse her puppies, placing a DAP collar on her can help encourage her to accept her puppies.DAP also comes in spray bottles. You can spray parts of the whelping box, but you should not spray the dam or the puppies directly with it.
You can buy DAP sprays, diffusers, and collars online or at some pet stores. Your vet may also carry them.

, If the area where the whelping box is located is noisy or busy, the dam might become stressed. This may cause her to stop nursing or to ignore the puppies. To help encourage a calm environment, make sure that the whelping box is in a quiet part of your home. There should not be much traffic through this room.Try to keep the whelping box clean to create a comfortable environment for both the mother and the puppies.
If you have other pets, you should block their access to the whelping box. The presence of other animals may stress the dam out. You can start introducing your other pets to the puppies around five or six weeks.

, Nursing releases hormones that helps bond the mother and the puppies. If the mother initially appears disinterested in her puppies, you might be able to start the production of these hormones by introducing the puppies to her teat. To do this, command the dam to lay down and gently ease her to her side so that the teats are exposed. Hold her down gently. Be sure to comfort her with kind words and petting. Have another person introduce the puppies one by one to her teats to nurse. After a few times, you may be able to convince the mother to nurse on her own.If the dog snarls, growls, or appears aggressive towards the puppies, remove them immediately from this situation.
If this does not work, you will have to feed the puppies by hand, using a bottle or syringe.
If the dog nurses her puppies but refuses to warm or stay by their side, you will have to keep them warm yourself.

, Your vet may have specific instructions to help your dog based on her medical history, breed, and environment. If stress or anxiety is the problem, your vet can prescribe medication that might help your dog accept her puppies.


You should tell the vet whether the mother dog is aggressive or indifferent to her puppies.
Try to determine when the mother abandoned her puppies. For example, did she reject them at birth or did she stop paying attention to them after a week or two?

Line the bottom with vinyl flooring.,
Avoid chemical products.,
Gather additional supplies.,
Clean it every day for the first week.,
Clean it twice a day for the next 2-3 weeks.,
Check the box regularly.,
Remove the puppies.,
Remove all towels and bedding.,
Clean the bottom with a chemical-free disinfectant cleanser.,
Place clean towels in the box.",How to Keep a Whelping Box Clean," If you have built your own whelping box, you may have used wood or cardboard for the bottom. These materials are not easy to keep clean. As such, it is a good idea to line the bottom of your box with vinyl flooring. This can be purchased at any home improvement store, and is self-adhesive. If you are using a commercially-made whelping box, or if you have constructed a box out of plastic, this is not necessary., Pups (just like baby humans) are especially sensitive to household chemicals. To clean a whelping box, you are going to need a chemical-free, disinfectant cleanser. A great option is called “Simple Green,” and it can be purchased at most grocery stores. You will also need a “free and clear” laundry detergent to use on the towels for your whelping box. A good choice is ""Seventh Generation Free and Clear."", In addition to a disinfectant cleaner and laundry detergent, you will need a few other things. Gather some paper towels, clean bath towels (that have been washed using non-chemical detergent), and a cardboard or plastic container to hold the puppies while you clean their whelping box., When the pups are first born, they will not produce a lot of waste, and what they do produce will be cleaned by the mother. At this point, you only need to clean the whelping box once per day. This helps to keep the space free of bacteria and keep your pups healthy., After the first week, the puppies will begin producing more waste. At this point, it becomes important to clean the box twice a day. In addition to keeping the whelping box bacteria-free, this helps to instill the understanding that puppies should not go potty where they sleep. This will help with crate training and housebreaking later on.After this time, the puppies will be transitioned out of the whelping box and into a larger space.

, Beyond your daily cleaning schedule, you should regularly check the whelping box for excessive dampness and solid waste. Even if you have already conducted your daily cleaning, you should remove and replace damp or dirty towels whenever it is needed., To clean you whelping box, begin by removing the puppies. Place them in a cardboard box or large plastic container nearby. If the mother is in the whelping box at that time, help her to exit as well., Next, you will lift up any towels and bedding and place them directly into your washing machine. Remember to use “free and clear” detergent to keep your puppies healthy., Spray a bit of chemical-free disinfectant cleanser on the bottom and sides of your whelping box, and use a paper towel to wipe this up. If there are any particularly dirty areas, you may want to go over them more than once., Take some clean bath towels (that have been washed with chemical-free detergent) and place them in the bottom of your whelping box. You can now return the puppies to their box."

Identify risk factors for infertility.,
Pay attention to lack of interest in mating.,
Get the dog tested for fertility.",How to Know if a Male Dog Is Fertile2," If you are trying to mate your dog and you are having difficulty doing that then you should first think about what the potential problems might be. If you can identify what the problem might stem from, then it may be easier to address. For a male dog, some potential risk factors for infertility include:Age, too old or too young
Injury to reproductive organs
Physical injury or physical inability that restricts ability to mount female dog
Medications that decrease fertility or sex drive

, Lack of interest in mating can signal that your dog has a hormonal problem.Take your dog to its veterinarian if you are trying to get it to mate and it does not want to.


When you are trying to get a male dog to mate you need to get it near a female dog that is in the right stage of its reproductive cycle. The female dog will give off pheromones that lure the male dog towards it and initiate the breeding process., If you are convinced that the issue with infertility is with the dog's semen, and not its ability to consummate sexual intercourse, then you can have the semen tested. Semen testing will tell you about the quality of the dog's sperm, if they are formed correctly, and if they have the ability to move towards a female dog's egg.Semen testing is done at many veterinary clinics, as well as clinics specializing in breeding and fertility.
Conditions that semen testing could identify include Teratozoospermia. This is a condition in which the dog's sperm do not form correctly and some of them are abnormally shaped."
"
Make sure the dog is old enough to reproduce.,
Track your dog's reproductive cycle to spot problems.,
Make sure your dog can physically copulate.,
Assess behavioral factors.,
Have your dog looked at by a veterinarian.",How to Know if a Female Dog Is Fertile2," A female dog usually becomes fertile for the first time after she is six months old. However, she should not be bred during her first estrus. Since heat usually occurs every six months approximately, this means that she should be at least a year old when she is bred.The age of sexual maturity will vary a lot depending on the specific dog and what breed she is. In general, smaller dogs tend to reach sexual maturity sooner than larger dogs.

, Signs that your dog may have infertility issues include problems with an irregular cycle. Track your dog's reproductive cycle to help identify a potential issue. A dog's reproductive cycle includes four phases:Proestrus: In this phase the female dog attracts males, has bloody vaginal discharge, and her vulva is swollen. She will not allow breeding during this phase, which lasts approximately nine days.
Estrus: During this period the dog is fertile and she will allow mating. It usually lasts for about nine days but ovulation usually occurs in the first 48 hours.
Diestrus: Diestrus is the sixty to ninety day period when the dog is no longer fertile but discharge may continue. This occurs whether or not the dog becomes pregnant.
Anestrus: Anestrus usually lasts three to four months and no sexual activity takes place during this phase.

, If your dog is having a hard time mating, it could lead to an inability to reproduce. This is a physical issue that could be caused by injury and by a misalignment between the female and male dog.


In order to assess your dog's physical ability to copulate, you may need to talk it to a veterinarian or an expert in dog breeding. They should be able to assess your dog's physical reproductive issues.
If the dogs you are trying to mate are having a hard time completing the act, then you may need to step in and help. In extreme cases, you may even need to have your female dog artificially inseminated if she and the male dog cannot physically fit together., There may just be issues with your dog's comfort or interest in sexual intercourse due to where you are trying to dog the mating. Make sure your dog is comfortable and well cared for before mating. Sometimes copulation does not occur because the dog is inhibited in its usual environment.Try taking your female dog out of its normal area and having it mate at the male dog's location. This could help her to become less inhibited.

, If you are having a hard time breeding your dog and you have exhausted all other avenues for promoting fertility, then you should get a medical opinion. Your veterinarian should be able to assess your dog's health and look for issues that may be impacting your dog's fertility.


Problems impacting fertility could include a wide variety of issues, including hormonal imbalances, physical abnormalities, or reproductive tumors or infections.

Check the dam’s nipples.,
Watch for restlessness or spasms.,
Take the dogs to the vet.",How to Handle a Mother Dog Refusing to Stay with Her Puppies2," Carefully look over the mother’s teats on her underside. If you notice redness, swelling, pus, abscesses, or discolored milk, the dam might have mastitis. Mastitis occurs when the mother’s milk ducts become inflamed. This makes lactation and nursing very painful for the mother dog. If it is severe, the mother can become aggressive towards the puppies or refuse to nurse. A vet can treat mastitis with antibiotics.You can relieve the pain of mastitis by applying warm water compresses to the mother’s teats.
You can help stimulate the flow of milk by gently pressing the teat between your forefinger and thumb. Be aware that if the dog is in extreme pain, she may become aggressive.

, If your dog refuses to nurse and starts pacing excessively, she may have milk fever. Milk fever, also known as eclampsia, may cause the mother to refuse the puppies. Symptoms begin with restlessness or anxiety. The mother may start to walk with a stiff or wobbly gait. This can develop into tremors, spasms, heavy panting, and fever. If you suspect that the dam is suffering from these symptoms, take her to the vet immediately. If untreated, it can lead to death.Symptoms of milk fever typically begin between three and five weeks after the puppies are born., Even if you do not notice the symptoms of mastitis or milk fever, there may still be an underlying medical cause for the mother’s abandonment. Take both the mother and the puppies to the vet. The vet will do bloodwork and other tests to determine what is going wrong.Occasionally, something might be wrong with the puppies, causing the mother to abandon them. Your vet may be able to help them thrive.If the vet determines that there is no medical cause, they can help you try to encourage the mother dog to accept the puppies. The vet may also recommend that you feed and care for the puppies yourself.

"
"
Feed the puppies every two hours.,
Massage the puppies to encourage elimination.,
Keep the puppies warm.,
Find a foster mother if possible.",How to Handle a Mother Dog Refusing to Stay with Her Puppies3," Puppies require around-the-clock care and feeding. They need to be fed a puppy-milk substitute every two to three hours. Puppies can be bottle or tube fed. Special puppy bottles are available from vets or pet stores, although bottle feeding can take significantly longer than tube feeding. Tube feeding is generally recommended, although you should have a vet show you the proper technique so that the puppies do not accidentally inhale and choke on the milk substitute.To feed the puppy, make sure that they are positioned with their tummy facing down. Hold the bottle slightly tilted down towards the puppy. The puppy should latch on. Let the puppy suckle until they are full.If the puppy starts to cough or if you notice milk coming out of their nose, stop feeding immediately.
Cow or goat milk is not appropriate for puppies. You should use a store-bought puppy milk substitute.
Some puppies may try to nurse and suckle each other in place of the mother. This may hurt the other puppies. If this happens, you may want to separate the puppies into different whelping boxes., For the first three weeks of life, puppies are not able to move their bowels on their own. The mother will lick them to encourage elimination and urination. In the absence of the mother, you will need to do this for the puppy. After each feeding, wet a cotton ball or take a pre-moistened baby wipe. Massage the anal and genitals. After a minute or two, the puppy should urinate and poop.If the puppy does not respond well to this after a feeding, you might try doing it before a feeding.
Puppies will start to go on their own by three weeks of age.

, Puppies cannot regulate their body temperature. Without their mother’s heat, they may fail to thrive. You can suspend a twenty-five watt lightbulb over one part of their box to keep them warm. Heating pads may also be used to raise the temperature. Wrap the heating pad in towels or sheepskin. Always supervise the puppies while they are on the heating pad.The temperature in the room should be 85 °F (29 °C) for the first two weeks. It can be lowered to 80 °F (27 °C) after two weeks and 75 °F (24 °C) after four weeks.

, The mother is responsible for socializing her puppies. It might help to find another dam who gave birth around the same time as your dam did. Introduce the puppies one at a time to her, and see if she accepts them. If she does, she may be willing to foster the puppies as her own.You might contact breeders in your area or a local shelter to see if they know of a dog that might be an appropriate foster dam.
If you cannot find a foster dam, start introducing the puppy to other people after a few weeks to help the puppies socialize. Encourage them to play with each other as well.

Perform CPR as needed.,
Care for the puppy after resuscitation.",How to Give a Newborn Puppy CPR," The moment you realize that the puppy needs CPR, you should have someone call a vet. A vet may be able to walk you through the CPR process and will provide information about care after CPR.


Only call if there is a second person available so that in the meantime one of you can perform CPR.
Have the person call a vet you are familiar with, if possible.
Inform the vet of the puppy's breed, approximate size, and any other relevant information.;
, Take a few seconds and gently examine the puppy’s mouth and throat to make sure that the puppy’s airway is free from obstructions. If it is, you can proceed with CPR.


Gently pick up the puppy.
Gently pull the puppy’s tongue out of the mouth to make sure it is not blocking the airway.
If the airway is obstructed, try to dislodge it by pulling it out with a single hooked finger, two fingers, or tongs. However, be very careful and avoid pushing it further into the airway. If possible, have someone hold a light so you can view the obstruction., Before continuing, you need to lower the puppy’s head. This is important, as it’ll allow you to you to make sure the puppy’s airway is clear – something that is necessary before performing CPR.


Hold the puppy.
Lay or point the puppy’s head downward so any fluid will naturally drain out of its mouth.
Make sure to provide support for the puppy’s head.
Handle the puppy gently., Before continuing, you need to make sure that the puppy’s mouth and throat are free from secretion, slobber, or other liquid that might hinder the CPR process.


Wipe mucus or other fluid away from the puppy’s nose or mouth with a cloth or article of clothing.
Use a suction bulb to remove fluid, if necessary., Since the size of newborn puppies varies based on breed, you'll have to quickly decide whether you are most comfortable holding or laying the puppy on a flat surface.


Perform CPR holding the puppy, if it is small enough for you to do so comfortably.
Lay the puppy down on the ground on their right side, if the puppy is too big to hold comfortably.
Have someone else hold or assist you with holding the puppy, if possible.

, To effectively resuscitate the puppy, you’ll have to breathe for the puppy. Breathing is the foundation of CPR.


Place the puppy on a flat surface and lay them on their right side.
Alternatively, you can also use your hand to form a tight seal around the puppy’s nose and mouth, put your mouth to your hand, and provide breaths through your hand.
Know that diseases like Brucellosis may be transmitted from puppies to humans through fluids. Use the hand method to protect from this danger., After you’ve formed a seal around the puppy’s mouth and nose, you need to begin breathing for the puppy. Make sure you perform this function calmly and slowly, as you don’t want to injure the puppy.


Make sure your breaths are small and measured. The puppy’s lungs are very small. Blowing too much air may damage it.
Do not fully exhale.
Provide a pause of 1 second between each breath., Your most certain sign of success is a breathing puppy. Look at the puppy's chest. If you don’t observe breathing, you need to continue CPR.


If you do not feel or observe a heartbeat or breathing, you need to move on to chest compressions., After breathing for your puppy, you need to search to see if its heart has restarted. While you should do this this quickly, you also need to make sure you stay focused and do not panic.


Place the puppy on a flat surface.
Put your index and middle finger on the chest wall to feel for a heartbeat.
Use a stethoscope, if you have one.
If you don’t locate a heartbeat, you’ll need to perform chest compressions., After you’ve confirmed that there is no heartbeat, you need to position your hands. Positioning your hands is one of the major tasks of CPR – as you want to make sure that they are in the appropriate position to apply pressure to the heart.


Put your thumbs and forefingers around the puppy’s chest.
Your thumbs should be in the middle of the chest, behind the front legs., If you feel no heartbeat, you need to compress the puppy’s chest rapidly. Compression is intended to help restart the heart.


Push down, lightly.
Compressions should occur 1 time per second.
Stop if you notice a heartbeat or breathing., After compressing the chest, you need to breathe for the puppy again. This is important, as many dogs do not respond immediate to the first breaths or compressions.


Perform mouth to snout every 15 to 20 seconds.
Be very gentle and remember not to breathe too hard.
Check for signs of breathing., Whenever you complete your repetitions of breathing, you should also perform more chest compressions. When repeating chest compressions, make sure to:


Check for a heartbeat.
Position your hands appropriately.
Rapidly, but gently, compress the puppy’s chest., In some circumstances, you may need to continue CPR for what seems like a long time before you notice results. You should, however, continue to perform CPR as long as you think there is hope of resuscitating the puppy.


Don’t give up too early.
You may perform CPR for up to 5 minutes.
The success rate for CPR on pets is relatively low – less than one in ten. If you cannot resuscitate the puppy, it is probably not your fault., If you succeed in getting the puppy breathing again, you need to continue care. Ultimately, the puppy won't be out of danger until they can breathe on their own for an extended amount of time.


After resuscitating, make sure to care for the puppy for at least 20 minutes.
Turn your puppy right side up and rub it with a towel after you resuscitate it.
If your puppy starts to breathe and stops again, continue giving it small breaths until it breathes on its own."

Make sure both dogs are the right age.,
Ensure the overall health of your dam.,
Ensure the overall health of your stud.,
Groom both dogs.,
Track your dam’s heat cycle.",How to Keep Both Dogs Safe While Mating Them1," Before mating your dogs, it is important to wait until both dogs have reached maturity. In fact, although most dogs become mature during the first year and a half of life, waiting until both dogs are at least 2 years old can further ensure their health and safety. This is especially true for dams (female dogs), who should not be bred until at least their third heat cycle. Additionally, you should ensure that neither dog is too old for breeding.Large dog breeds are considered mature at 18-24 months.
Medium-sized breeds are considered mature at 15-18 months.
Small dog breeds are considered mature at 12-18 months.
Studs (male dogs) can continue breeding until they are roughly 10 years of age.
Dams should no longer breed once they reach 5.;
, It is particularly crucial for you make sure that your dam is healthy enough to withstand mating, pregnancy, and birth. At least one month before mating, your dam should have a “pre-breeding” evaluation by a vet. All of her vaccinations should be current and she should be free of parasites.Your dam must be the correct weight for her age and height.
Additionally, your vet can screen for any other health problems that may complicate a pregnancy.

, Although it is not quite as crucial, it is also a great idea to have your stud evaluated by a vet. Your vet can check for any anatomical defects, signs of low sperm, and/or infection of the reproductive organs, which could make it difficult or dangerous to breed. Your vet can also determine the overall health of your stud and confirm that he is up to the task., Immediately prior to mating, both dogs should be thoroughly bathed. In particular, their genitals should be clean (which reduces risk of infection) and any excess fur should be trimmed (which enables proper entry).Fur around your stud’s sheath and penis should be trimmed away.
Fur around your dam’s vulva should be trimmed.

, The number one factor is facilitating a safe and successful mating session, it to select the proper time. In order to do this, you must understand your dam’s heat cycle. Your dam should go into heat roughly every 6 months, beginning around one year old. Look for signs of heat in your dam, and take detailed notes. You should watch and track her behavior for at least two heat cycles before you consider breeding.During the first 1-7 days, your dam will exhibit a swollen vulva and some bleeding. Male dogs may pay more attention to her, but she will not accept a mate.
During the next 7 days, her bleeding will slow and she will be willing to accept mates.
During the last days of her heat cycle, she will no longer accept mates. This cycle usually last 21 days, but it can be shorter for some dogs.

Find out about health problems that are common with your dog's breed.,
Learn about your dog's pedigree.,
Get your dog's genetics tested.",How to Know if Your Dog Is Healthy Enough to Breed1," In order to assess whether your dog is healthy enough to breed, you should know what type of problems to look for. It can be very useful to know what to look for when assessing your dog's pedigree history for problems that are common in its breed.If your dog does have a history of breed specific health problems then you may want to reassess whether you want to breed your dog.
This information can also help you assess what type of dog you want to use to breed with your dog. If your dog has a risk of a certain breed-specific issue, then you want to make very sure that a potential mate has no history of it.;
, When considering breeding your dog it is important to know that it will not pass on any heritable health problems. This means that, if at all possible, you should learn about your dog's background and whether they have health problems in their background that could be passed on.If you have a purebred dog that was bred by an ethical breeder, then you should have been given access to your dog's pedigree when you adopted it.
If your dog is not purebred or you got it from a source that did not provide a pedigree, then it may be difficult to impossible to trace its pedigree.

, If you can't trace your dog's pedigree, or you just want to make very sure that you are breeding a dog without genetic problems, then you can get the dog tested. These tests can show you any negative genetic traits or health problems that the mother dog could pass onto its offspring.Breeding purebred dogs can be especially fraught with genetic problems because of inbreeding. If you plan on breeding purebred dogs, you need to be especially clear about your dog's genetic history so you can avoid puppies with genetic health problems.Understanding whether your dog is likely to pass on some bad traits requires knowing a bit about genes and how they work. Some genetic traits are considered ""dominant."" These traits can be passed on if only one parent has the genes for them. Some genetic traits are considered ""recessive."" These traits take genes from both parents to be passed on.
Keep in mind that many heritable traits do not yet have an available genetic test. In these cases it is best to rely on your dog’s family medical history and current health.

Choose the right time.,
Create a calm space.,
Stay present.,
Help with positioning.",How to Keep Both Dogs Safe While Mating Them2," Once you have an understanding of your dam's cycle, you should be able to predict both when she will be in heat, as well as which days will be best for mating. In general, the ninth or tenth day of your dam’s heat cycle is considered the best time to breed.To maximize the possibility of conception, you may want to mate the dogs several times between seventh and fourteenth days of her cycle.
To ensure the dog’s health and safety, they should only mate once per day.

, When it is time to mate your dogs, you must essentially place them together in an enclosed space and wait patiently. This will be safest and most effective if the space is comfortable and calm. Loud noises, people coming in or out, and other distractions may scare the dogs and interfere with their mating. Place the dogs someplace quiet, where they are not likely to be disturbed.The mating process can take several hours.
Ensure that the space can remain calm and quiet for that length.

, Rather than leaving the dogs alone, you must stay present to ensure their safety. Simply sit back, be patient, and allow the dogs to do their thing, but be prepared to calm them down if they should become nervous or agitated. If you have never done this before, you may choose to have a professional breeder present.If the dogs begin to fight, you may need to intervene.
You can usually end a dog altercation by making a loud noise, or spraying them with water.
If you must physically separate them, try yanking at their tails or hind legs. Do this carefully and only if absolutely necessary.
If your dog simply needs to be calmed down, you can try petting them, brushing their fur, and praising them.

, In general, you should not interfere with the mating process. However, there is one exception. If the dam has permitted the stud to examine her and mount her, but one or both animals is struggling with positioning, you may step in to assist. Simply help to position the stud so that he is balanced on her backside and lined up for insertion."
"
Learn about the “breeding tie.” When canines mate, the male's penis swells while the female's vulva contracts.,
Do not attempt to separate!,
Keep the dogs calm.",How to Keep Both Dogs Safe While Mating Them3," This results in the animals being “tied” together in what is known as “breeding tie” or “copulatory tie.” This is a natural part of the mating process that should not be interfered with. The animals will remain locked together for anywhere from two minutes to one hour, but the average time is closer to 20 minutes., Is it very important that you do not try to separate the dogs! Do not try to use ice to reduce swelling, or attempt to pry to dogs apart. This can be dangerous to both dogs, but especially your stud. Pulling them apart can cause severe injuries to your stud’s penis making it difficult for him to mate again., In most cases, the stud will stand calmly. The dam, however, is prone panicking and trying to get away. This can injure your stud (especially if the dam is larger), so you must get down on the floor and pet your dam and keep her calm. You know your dog best! You can pet her, brush her, offer her praise, and/or do any action or activity known to keep your dam at ease. After an average of 20 minutes (possibly up to one hour), the dogs will separate naturally."

Make sure your dog does not have heritable health problems.,
Get your dog a general physical.,
Make sure female dogs can carry a litter.",How to Know if Your Dog Is Healthy Enough to Breed2," Even if your dog doesn't have any health issues in its family history, it may have issues of its own that could be passed on to its offspring. Get your dog screened for any major health problems, especially for those that are common to its breed.If you are unsure what your dog should be checked for, you can look at the websites of experts or accredited associations for a list of the traits your particular breed should be tested for.For example, if you are considering breeding a German shepherd you should have your dog looked at for potential issues with its hips and limbs, its pancreas, its skin, and its eyes., Your dog should have a thorough physical exam a month before you plan on breeding it. All potential breeding dogs should be tested for transmittable diseases, they should be up to date on their vaccinations, and they should be found to be in generally good health. Your veterinarian should be able to tell you whether your dog's physical health is good enough for breeding or what aspects of its health you should work on before attempting to breed it.

, Female dogs should be assessed for whether they are strong enough to carry a litter of puppies to term. They should be of a healthy weight and should have good muscle tone in order to carry puppies more easily to term.


Discuss your female dog's health with your veterinarian. If there are things that could improve her fitness for a successful pregnancy, then discuss how you could achieve them. For instance, if your dog needs to lose weight you should create a weight loss plan with the veterinarian.
If a dog has had a previous litter, then it should be assessed for fitness in light of the previous labor process. If the dog had a hard pregnancy and labor last time, that can impact the next pregnancy and labor.

Care for its health throughout pregnancy.,
Feed the dog properly.,
Assess the dog's health during labor and delivery.",How to Know if Your Dog Is Healthy Enough to Breed3," If you have a female dog that you are breeding you need to make sure that it is getting proper health care throughout its pregnancy. This means following the suggestions from your veterinarian about prenatal and postnatal care, including how often it should be brought in for a veterinary exam.A veterinarian will be able to assess whether the pregnancy is going well and if any alterations to the dog's health care or diet are needed.
Your veterinarian may also do an ultrasound or X-ray of the dog to see how many puppies you should expect the dog to deliver.

, You should feed a high quality food to a dog that you are attempting to breed. This will assure that it is getting the nutrients it needs to have a high functioning reproductive system. Once the dog is pregnant, it should be switched over to a high calorie puppy food in order to get enough nutrition.In addition, you will need to increase your dog's food intake throughout its pregnancy. Generally, a pregnant dog's food will need to be increased by fifteen to twenty five percent over the course of its entire pregnancy.

, It is important that you know what to expect during labor and delivery so that you can assess whether they are going well or if there is a problem. While the dog is in labor and while it is delivering its puppies you should be present if possible and keeping an eye on your dog's energy level and overall health.While your dog is pregnant, discuss what to expect with your veterinarian and ask him or her any questions that you have about the process.
Call your veterinary office immediately if you suspect a health problem with your dog while it is giving birth. The veterinary staff should be able to discuss the problems you are concerned with and they should be able to recommend whether or not to bring your dog in to the veterinary office.

Re-mate the dogs.Two days after the initial mating, you should try to mate the dogs again.",How to Get Dogs to Mate," Just like human beings, dogs need to reach biological sexual maturity before it's medically safe for them to breed. This is especially important for the bitch (female dog), as her health might be put at risk by a pregnancy her body is not prepared to carry.


A male dog should be at least 1.5 years of age before breeding. A female dog should be on her second or third heat cycle.;
, Mating a bitch whose body is too old for pregnancy can be as dangerous, both to mother and litter, as early breeding. There's some disagreement among breeders about what should be considered too old. In general, you shouldn't breed a bitch older than 4 — especially for large breeds that have shorter lifespans to begin with. If you have a medium or small breed, you should still think hard about breeding an older dog. However, proceed with extreme caution if your bitch is between 4 - 6 years old. 7 is definitely too old, even for small dogs.

, Before mating your dog, you must be aware of the inherited conditions prominent in your breed. For example, Border Collies, Briards, Shetland Sheepdogs, and Rough Collies are all at increased risk of hereditary eye problems.In the US, the American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists can screen your pet before breeding.If they certify the dog as clear, it can be listed with the Canine Eye Registration Foundation.


Regardless of how energetic and healthy your dog seems, every breed has genetic health risks. For example, Lhasa Apsos are vulnerable to inguinal hernias and kidney disease, while German Shepherds a prone to hereditary hip dysplasia.You should also research the specific dog's bloodline. If your pet has specific problems that can be pinpointed in his bloodline's medical history, you should not breed the dog., Though it affects them at a higher rater, smaller breeds like Cocker Spaniels can also be affected. Some dogs may not display any symptoms of this condition, but they still should not be bred if they have this issue.Hip dysplasia is the deterioration of the hip joint, so the hip socket sits too shallow in the end of the femur bone. This condition can cause arthritis, destroying cartilage and causing severe pain. Breeders should not pass this trait
A radiologist will x-ray your dog's hips. This can only be done once the dog has achieved skeletal maturity, after 2 years of age.
They will have to put your dog under general anesthetic so he won't move during the x-ray.
The x-rays are then sent off to an independent panel of experts who ""score"" features on the hips. The lower the score, the healthier the joint health. Only animals with low scores should be bred.

, This condition affects the knees, and causes your dog’s kneecap to slide out of place and lock the leg straight. Smaller dogs are more prone to this issue than larger ones.


Diagnosis for this condition is straightforward, and surgery can correct this condition. Still, no dog with patellar luxation should be bred, as this is a hereditary condition.

, It can be hard to tell whether an animal can't hear you or if it's choosing to ignore you. The BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) test actually measures the electrical activity in the ear, though.If a dog fails the BAER test, you know with 100% certainty that the dog would pass down genes for deafness. These animals should never be bred.

, Many breeds suffer from breed-related heart conditions. For example, Boxers are at risk of subaortic stenosis, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels of mitral valve disease.The veterinarian will likely perform an ultrasound scan on your dog to screen for potential concerns. Any red flags should eliminate your dog from potential breeding.

, Many common breeds have specific temperament tests, such as a Working Aptitude Evaluation for Dobermans.You can also take a Canine Good Citizen test, which is open to all dogs and will assess your dog’s temperament and level of training.Therapy Dogs International and other therapy dog clubs have temperament testing that separate actual temperament from training.If your dog has any temperament problems, such as being untrustworthy around people, overly aggressive, excitable, or a biter due to fear, you should not breed it. Even if your dog is shy or submissive, don’t breed it.
You should breed a dog who is happy, confident, and obedient around both animals and humans.

, Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that eventually leads to sterility in both sexes. It can also cause a litter of puppies to be aborted or die shortly after birth.Brucellosis is often passed through sexual intercourse. However, an entire kennel can be infected through contact with secretions.
Brucellosis can occasionally be transmitted to humans via the dog's urine or feces.
Stud dogs should be tested every 6 months. If they test positive they should either be neutered, or treated and only used for breeding after 3 consecutive negative tests.
However, bear in mind that a male dog who has suffered from brucellosis may well be infertile in the future, so the chances of a successful mating are reduced.

, A responsible breeder will try to improve the breed, not pass on genetic flaws that will pose health concerns in the next generation. The dam (female) must be in good health to withstand the stresses and rigors of a pregnancy. Indications of good health include:


The dam being in ideal body condition and weight for her breed. You should be able to feel her ribs but not see them, and she should have an evident waistline. Being overweight poses a risk of birthing complications, and being underweight will make her struggle to provide nutrition for the puppies.
General indicators of good health include a glossy coat, bright eyes, lack of body odor, and eyes, nose and ears that are free from discharge. She should be able to exercise without coughing, and be free from vomiting or diarrhea.
Both dogs should be up to date on their vaccinations.
Keep in mind that typically, the sire (male)'s owner does not incur any costs and receives the pick of the litter as a form of payment. The owner of the dam pockets income from the sale of the remaining puppies, but pays all vet and boarding costs., When bitches reach sexual maturity, they begin going into heat when they are receptive to mating. Bitches come into heat about every 6 months. This is called her ""season,"" and it last for around 21 to 35 days. The signs of being in heat include:Curving her tail to the side when you scratch her backside (revealing her vaginal opening)
Twitching or swelling of her vulva
Bloody discharge from her vagina. Note that a bloody discharge in a bitch that is not due in heat should trigger an urgent vet appointment, because it can be a sign of womb infection and can be serious.

, She's best prepared to accept intercourse and get pregnant is when she ovulates. Ovulation is most likely to happen 7 - 10 days after the start of her season, but there is some variation between individual dogs. Some bitches ovulate as early as day 3 or 4, while others ovulate at day 27. Mother Nature is clever, though, and the hormones that cause ovulation also increase sexual interest in male dogs. Thus, the best way to tell when a bitch is ovulating is to see how she interacts with her potential mate.


If the two dogs live close to one another, have the female visit every 2-3 days. Be alert to behavior that suggests she's open to his attention.

, In that case, you can have a veterinarian do a vaginal cytology on her. First, he will roll a cotton tip over the mucous membrane of the dog's vagina. Then, he'll roll the swab over a microscope slide, air dry it, and stain it for inspection under the microscope.


The cells sloughed from the lining of the vagina vary depending at what stage in her cycle the bitch is.
The cells associated with estrus or heat are large, rectangular cells without a nucleus, as well as cell debris. When the number of red blood cells decrease, but these large anuclear cells are present, the bitch is most likely to be receptive.
When the ""moment has passed,"" an increase in white cells start to appear, as well as nucleated cells, and red blood cells.

, A blood test for ovulation is an alternative to vaginal cytology, and is likely the preferred option for many breeders. The blood test measures progesterone levels in the bitch's blood stream and looks for a significant rise that suggests she is about to ovulate.


Before ovulation, blood progesterone levels are generally below 2 ng (nanograms). They rise to 5ng acts as a trigger to ovulation, and after ovulation they continue to rise and can reach 60 ng.
To detect ovulation, it can be necessary to repeat the blood tests every couple of days. To catch that critical 5ng red flag for ovulation, you should start testing before the expected ovulation date., Artificial insemination (AI) is often used to encourage desirable qualities in breeds and eliminate undesirable ones. It's often used to preserve rare breeds, and is a good alternative when your best mating option lives at a great distance. Sperm is collected from the sire, checked by a vet for activity and quantity of sperm, then stored. It may be chilled if insemination will happen within a few hours, or frozen in liquid nitrogen, in which case it can keep for years. The bitch is then impregnated, ideally around the time she ovulates. The sperm is transferred into her reproductive tract using a long soft rubber tube. Ideally the sperm is placed close to her cervix, which is where natural mating would deposit it.


You can purchase artificial insemination kits online or in pet stores.Keep in mind that artificial insemination still has not reached the same success level as natural breeding. Expect a 65% to 85% success rate, with better results for smaller litters., If your female is a long-haired breed, there's a chance her fur might interfere with the mating process. To guard against that and prevent wasted time during your ovulation window, consider shaving the hair under her tail to improve your chances.

, Taking a male outside of his normal environment can cause insecurity and distraction for him. This, in turn, might make it difficult for him to successfully impregnate the bitch. To avoid this problem, set up a breeding area somewhere he's comfortable. This should be a private, enclosed space at the sire’s home, ideally outside, where they can breed without distraction.


Normally, only two handlers should be present — preferably you and the owner of the other dog.Don’t bring in any strangers who might distract the dogs.

, The mating process should not be rushed — let them get to know one another. The dogs may need several hours or days to get comfortable in each other's company. The time length can vary based on a dog's previous breeding experience, disposition, and the timing of the breeding attempts.You may find that the dogs get along just fine, but ""as friends."" In this case, it's likely the bitch is either not ovulating and not ready to mate, or is not psychologically ready to mate.


The latter can happen with dogs that are particularly bonded to their owners and see themselves more as a person than another dog. If this is the case, do not force the mating — this is akin to canine rape.
Accept that your bitch is not psychologically suited to mating. If, despite her liking the male dog, nothing happens, then that's how it's going to be.

, The dogs should never be left alone, even if the process takes a long time. The most important thing when mating dogs is to ensure their safety at all times. Keep them on leashes and place a gentle nuzzle on the female, especially if she is a virgin. She may lash out at the male if she's not feeling receptive.


Talk to the dogs in a soft, encouraging voice to help them feel secure or comfortable.
Never yell at them if you are frustrated or annoyed by any failed mating attempts.

, An interested sire will sniff the dam's backside, and an interested dam will lift her tail to give him access. The male may also lick the female's vulva and attempt to mount her if she appears willing and ready., She may get overly excited or distracted when the male shows his interest. To keep her still, put her head in the crook of your arm and hold her in the standing position with your hands. You can then shift her position until she's in front of the sire.


The other handler can hold her tail out of the way.

, Once inserted, a part of the sire's penis called the ""bulbous glandis"" will swell.This increased size will cause it to lodge inside the female's vagina. Bitches have strong sphincter muscles at the opening to the vagina. These muscles contract around the swollen penis, further securing it inside the vagina.

, The male will slide his front legs off to one side of the female and usually lift one hind leg over her back, so they are both standing rear-to-rear. They are now “tied” by the holding of the sire’s penis in the dam’s vagina.


This behavior is perfectly natural during mating. The dogs can stay tied for a long time — the average being 15 to 45 minutes for most breeds.
The mating process takes at least 20 minutes. One theory behind the tie is that it protects the dogs from attack during this vulnerable period. In the original mounted position, the male's back is unwatched and his genitals are exposed. When both dogs' faces and jaws face outwards, they present a formidable defense against would-be predators or other dogs looking to mate with the female.

, She may express distress during the first part of the tie and need extra comforting and restraint. Always restrain a female when they are tied; she could pull and hurt the male or herself. It's very dangerous if the dogs try to separate the tie before they are physically capable of doing so, so hold and comfort the female to ensure they do not separate.


After the sire ejaculates, the swelling will subside and the dam’s vagina muscles will relax. The dogs will then be able to release safely.

, Once the male's penile swelling has reduced and the female's sphincter muscles have loosened, they will separate. It's best not to allow the female to urinate for about 15 minutes after mating. The male's owner should walk him around until his erection goes down and his penis is no longer visible.

, This will raise the likelihood of the sire successfully impregnating the dam. Re-mating the dogs is especially important if you're not sure when the bitch is ovulating.

Pay attention to road signs and crosswalks.",How to Walk Your Dog at Night," A reflective collar will help keep your dog safe at night, as it will make your dog more visible. This step is particularly important if your dog has a tendency to get away from you. You can find reflective collars at pet stores or online.You can also add reflective tape to your dog's collar.;
, In addition to your dog's collar, making your dog's leash more visible can keep your dog safer. You can buy reflective leashes, or you can wrap your dog's leash in reflective tape. That way, your dog is visible if headlights flash on it., Another option to keep your dog safe is to add a blinking light. Lights provide more protection than reflective surfaces because they are visible all the time at night. For instance, you can buy lights that attach to your dog's collar or leash to make it more visible.These lights are specifically designed for this purpose. Basically, you just clip it onto your dog's collar and turn it on. That way, anyone can see your dog coming, even if they aren't shining a light at it.

, One way to make yourself more visible is to wear a reflective vest, which catches the light of passing cars and street lamps. It helps to choose one in a bright color. That way, you will also be illuminated if a car comes by, so you'll be safer, too., You can find any number of lights that attach to your body. For instance, you can get lights that are attached to a headband, which keeps your hands free. Adding light makes you much more visible, increasing your safety. Plus, it makes it easier to see where you're going., Even if you don't wear a light, it's a good idea to carry a flashlight. You never know when you'll find yourself in a dark area. Plus, a flashlight makes you more visible to cars if you use it the whole time., As dogs age, they may have increased vision problems. They could also have problems like arthritis, and with decreased vision at night, they may have more trouble avoiding obstacles. Ask your vet to give your dog the once over to make sure it's up for walking at night.You could ask questions such as, ""Do you think it's safe to take my dog out at night? Is my dog's vision up to walking at night?""

, If your dog is susceptible to cold, you might consider adding a vest to help keep it warm, particularly if you have a small dog. As a bonus, you can add reflective tape to the vest to make your dog more visible.You can find vests for dogs at pet stores and online.
If you notice your dog is shivering on a walk, it may be time to get it a vest.

, Make sure your dog's tags are up-to-date before taking it out at night. If your dog gets away from you, you'll have a harder time catching it than you would in the daytime. Tags can help ensure your dog is returned safely to you if someone else finds it.Also, it's a good idea to use reflective tags to make your dog more visible.
You can also get your dog microchipped. Basically, a small chip is embedded under you dog's skin that provides contact information for places that have readers (generally vet clinics and animal shelters). A microchip remains in place even if your dog loses its collar.

, When walking at night, try to stay in areas that are well-lit. Dark areas are a perfect place for crimes to take place. Don't try to cut through places like parks or alleys if they're dark. Staying in the light will keep you and your dog safer, plus make it easier to see where you're going., You don't want to get lost while you're out at night, so stick to areas you know. Plus, it's a good idea to walk in areas where you know people. That way, if you do find yourself in a dangerous situation, you have somewhere to go.For example, don't take a back route just to try it out at night. Instead, stick to the places you've walked in the day. It can even help to drive the route at night so you can inspect how well-lit it is from the safety of your car.

, It can be fun to listen to some tunes while you're taking a walk. However, that can distract you from your surroundings, making you less safe. Take the headphones out, and put your phone in your pocket. Take the time to enjoy being with your dog, instead., As much as possible, stay out of the road. Being in the road with your dog puts you at greater risk of being hit. If you must walk on the road, make sure to face oncoming traffic, so you can see what's headed your way., It's best to cross at marked crosswalks, so that cars will expect there to be pedestrians. In addition, make sure to only cross when the light says to, so that you won't be fighting traffic to cross.Make sure your dog is good around cars before going out in heavy traffic. You don't want your dog getting confused and attempting escape when you're trying to cross in heavy traffic.
Make sure to keep your dog close when crossing the street by keeping its leash short.
Also, act like the driver doesn't see you. That is, don't just assume an oncoming car will avoid you. It's possible that the driver hasn't even seen you. Make sure to move out of of the way of any car that's coming your direction to avoid putting you and your dog at risk."

Give her energy through food.,
Give her access to fresh water at all times.,
Take the dog outside in the first day or two.,
Pay attention to signs of infection and other problems.",How to Help a Mother Dog Rest1," After giving birth and feeding puppies, the mother is going to be noticeably tired and she will need good food to keep her energy up. A food meant for nursing mothers is best, though a high quality food may suffice. Either way, now is not the time to limit food. Let the mother eat what she needs to keep feeding her babies.The mother may not show interest in food for about a day after giving birth.
A nursing dog needs a different diet than her pre-puppy food. Choose a food with a higher fat content to make sure she is getting sufficient calories to meet the needs of milk production, and look for a food that is high in calcium and protein to help provide the puppies with more complete nutrition.;
, You should also make sure that the mother has plenty of fresh water in addition to food. Producing milk takes a lot of her body's liquid, so to keep up, she needs to drink more than she normally does.Not getting enough water can make her more tired.

, Often, the mother will not want to leave her puppies in the first day or so of having them, even to go outside. For that reason, you may need to pick up your dog and take her outside to use the bathroom.However, if she becomes aggressive, it's better to wait until she's more comfortable

, After birth, you should watch your dog to make sure she doesn't develop one of several common problems. For instance, she could get an infection in her uterus or in her teats.Another common problem is low calcium.If you notice any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet.


Some drainage from your dog's uterus is expected. However, it shouldn't be pale or gray. It also should flow freely and not smell bad. If it is smelly, thick, and pale/gray, she may have an infection. Normal discharge should be red, greenish, brownish, or black.
With her teats, look for signs of infection, which include pain, swelling, irritation, and redness. The milk should stay white (and flow freely); if the milk turns green, red, or yellow, that's a sign of infection.
You should also check for mastitis, which is an inflammation of the mammary glands. Look for swelling, red or hot areas, discoloration in milk, and changes in attitude such as lethargy or depression. If you suspect mastitis, contact your vet immediately.Low calcium shows up in various ways. Generally, your dog will show less interest in her puppies, and she may be disoriented or nervous. She may pant, whine, have stomach problems, or develop a fever. Finally, she'll start to walk differently, and she may get muscle tremors. One clear indication of low calcium is laying on her side with her legs extended straight out. If you suspect your dog has low calcium, contact your vet immediately.

Hand feed the puppies if necessary.,
Get the supplies.,
Prepare the formula and bottles.,
Feed the puppies.,
Massage the puppies with a warm towel.",How to Help a Mother Dog Rest2," Mothers who've just given birth may run into complications, such as infection or low calcium. Often, that means she's not able to feed the puppies herself. In that case, you will need to hand feed the puppies while the mother recovers, and you may need to hand feed the puppies for good., You'll need bottles made specifically for puppies to feed from. You'll also need a commercial formula designed for puppies. While you can make homemade formulas, these formulas are not balanced as well as the commercial ones., You can mix up enough formula for a day, but make sure to keep the extra in the refrigerator. Follow the directions on the package for mixing, then heat the mixture to 98 to 100 °F (36.7 to 37.8 °C) by placing it in a pan of water. Also, make sure to thoroughly clean the bottle and nipple each time you feed the puppies., When feeding, the puppy should be on its stomach. In the first three days, feed the puppy every two hours. After that, you can move to every three hours, with four-hour periods at night. The second week, you can change to four-hour stretches during the day and six-hour periods at night.When the third week comes around, you can start moving to solid food, puppy mush, though you still need to be bottle feeding regularly.

, After feeding, use a towel or rag wetted with warm water to gently wipe each puppy in the area around its rear and genitals. This simulates the action of the mother licking the puppy, which encourages them to excrete waste."

Limit access to the mother and puppies in the first month.,
Relocate if needed.,
Give the mother a separate area at about 2 weeks.,
Let her take breaks after the first month.,
Help entertain the puppies.",How to Help a Mother Dog Rest3," Your first instinct might be to show off the new puppies to the world. There's nothing wrong with that. However, you should do it only through pictures. If you let everyone traipse by where the puppies are, giving each person a chance to hold a puppy, you'll put more stress on the mother, who's sole job right now is to protect and care for the puppies. Instead, stick to letting one or two people care for her.You should also keep her away from other pets in your home., Sometimes, a mother may not want to stay with her puppies. Usually, that means she is particularly attached to you and the family and wants to be closer. You can move her to where she can be closer to your family, so she doesn't feel the need to leave the puppies., Once the pups are old enough, at a about 2 to 3 weeks, you can provide a separate area for the mother. It should be very close to the whelping box with easy access. However, having a separate bed will give her a break., In the first month, the mother is going to want to be as close to her puppies as she can be most of the time. However, once the puppies start eating on their own, she may be more willing to take breaks. When that happens, allow her some time on her own. For instance, you could take her for a short walk around the neighborhood.However, follow her lead. if she really doesn't want to leave her puppies, don't make her.

, Once again, you should really wait until about a month has passed before attempting this step. However, once the mother seems more comfortable with having people around, you can help her catch a break by playing with the puppies yourself. Keeping them entertained a bit can help her rest."

Withhold food and water.,
Bring your dog to the vet on the day of surgery.,
Restrict the mother’s activity.,
Observe your dog.,
Schedule a follow-up appointment.,
Contact your vet if you notice problems.,
Educate yourself about why vets recommend C-sections.,
Get a C-section only under certain circumstances.,
Familiarize yourself with the surgery.",How to Get a C‐Section for Your Dog," An appointment will allow you and your vet to talk about a potential C-section. This will give your vet the opportunity to provide you with basic information. You'll also have the ability to ask questions.


This appointment may be made several weeks after you've confirmed pregnancy or a few weeks before the due date -- depending on circumstances and potential complications.
If the vet identifies any potential complications, they may suggest a C-section.
The vet will discuss dangers associated with C-section. As with all surgeries, in rare instances, C-section may result in severe complications such as infection, problems with anesthesia, or even death.;
, If you decide on a C-section, the vet will schedule a time for the procedure. This should be carefully timed as to be the best for the mother and puppies.


Avoid pressuring the vet to schedule the procedure so it will be convenient for you. Your vet will likely plan the procedure for the due date or day after the due date. It is very unlikely that the vet will ever schedule a C-section for before the due date.
The cost of a C-section during normal business hours may range from $500 to $2000, depending on region, complications, and other factors., As with other procedures that require anesthesia, you need to stop feeding your dog in anticipation of surgery. This is important as a full stomach may create complications that could endanger your dog’s health.


Withhold food for at least twelve hours.
Don’t allow your dog to drink water for four hours before surgery.
Anesthesia may cause nausea which might cause your dog to vomit -- a complication that is easily avoided by withholding food and water., The trip to the vet on the day of surgery is very important. Ultimately, you want to make sure your dog is calm and in good spirits.


Act very calm around your dog. Try not to act hurried or anxious when preparing to take her to the vet. Say things like “good dog” or “good girl!”
Avoid letting her jump into the vehicle. If possible, have two people lift your dog into your vehicle. You don’t want to apply pressure to her belly.

, The first thing you need to do when you bring your dog home from the vet after surgery is to restrict her movement. Do not allow her to run or play rough. Ultimately, excessive activity may dislodge or tear the stitches holding the incision together.


Most mother dogs should be kept with their puppies in a small crate or other confined area.
Make sure to leash-walk your dog instead of allowing her to walk freely., Perhaps the most important aspect of home care is watching your dog to make sure she is recovering in the days and weeks after the surgery. Ultimately, identifying problems early is the best way to ensure that your dog makes a quick recovery.


Know that limited vaginal discharge is normal for several weeks after C-section.
Watch the area of incision for signs of swelling, discharge, or infection.
Make sure your dog is eating and drinking plenty of water., You should also schedule a follow-up visit for your vet to examine your dog after the C-section. This will allow your vet the ability to make sure your dog is on track to heal properly.


However, the vet will most likely schedule your follow-up appointment on the same day the C-section is performed. Additionally, see your vet a week or two after the C-section.
See your vet if they instruct you to see them earlier than the scheduled appointment., Move up your follow-up visit if you believe your dog is not healing and improving in health after the surgery. This is important, as your dog may be struck by complications like infection during the days after the C-section.


Generally, your dog may be groggy for a day after anesthesia, but you should see visible signs of improvement on the second day after surgery.
Pay attention to the check list and other printed material your vet provides you with.
Don't hesitate to call your vet if you have any questions or concerns about your dog's wellbeing., There are a variety of reasons why your veterinarian may recommend a C-section for your dog. Ultimately, unless you have a substantial amount of veterinary or breeding experience, you should make the decision to have a C-section in consultation with your vet. Your vet may recommend a C-section if:


The size of the puppies may cause complications in a natural birth.
The shape or size of the dog’s pelvis may result in complications.
A puppy is positioned in a problematic way in the womb, which may result in complications.
Your dog shows signs of fetal distress such red or green discharge, or signs that the placenta has detached., When it comes to C-sections, timing is everything. This is because the health and well-being of the mother and the puppies depend on it.


C-sections should not be performed before the overdue date.
C-sections should wait until the dog goes into labor.
C-sections should be performed after the dog’s temperature falls below 99 degrees and does not rise shortly after.
There are many problems associated with a scheduled C-section that takes place before natural labor. Talk to your vet and evaluate the risks associated before opting for a scheduled C-section.

, Take some time to learn about how the surgery will be performed. By knowing the different steps involved in the surgery, you’ll be able to come to an informed opinion about whether to get your dog a C-section.


Your vet or the vet tech will shave your dog’s belly and wherever the anesthesia will be applied.
After shaving, your vet or vet tech will apply anesthesia.
Your vet will make an incision in the middle section of your dog’s belly, near the uterus.
Your vet will remove the puppies.
The vet and vet tech will stitch/suture the skin around the incision.
Most C-sections take between 45 minutes to an hour and a half. This includes prep time."
"
Figure out the actual temperature.,
Use your hand to check the sidewalk and road out of shade.,
Do the same for areas under the shade.,
Decide if you should still walk your dog.,
If you do decide to take the dog out, stop every few minutes, and if you hit pavement, get to grassy or cool surfaces immediately.",How to Tell if the Pavement Is Too Hot for Your Dog's Paws," If it is really hot, like above 95 degrees, you most likely should not have to check. If it is hot, but you are unsure if the pavement will be hot, then you should check.
, Place your hand down on to the sidewalk/road for 10 seconds. If you cannot handle that for 10 seconds, your dog will burn their paws., Sometimes the shade is not the best way to avoid burning their paws. If you cannot handle touching shaded areas of the pavement for 10 seconds, it is too hot., If you really want to walk your dog, wait until it gets cooler, like in the evening or later. Or, you can find a grassy area, as they are usually cooler., Another suggestion is to put your dog on a cool towel on the pavement if you have to bring them outside."
"
Take on more responsibilities.,
Obtain relevant experience.,
Understand what dog-walking entails.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become a Dog Walker1," Before approaching your parents, make sure to do your chores diligently for at least a week or two. Also, try to take on extra responsibilities in the house. This way, you have material to use to prove to your parents that you are ready to take on the responsibility of having a job.For example, offer to help your younger siblings with homework or babysitting.
If you already have a dog, contribute more of your time to taking care of it by feeding it, taking it for walks, and bathing it more often.;
, By obtaining the necessary experience, you can prove to your parents that you are prepared to have a job in dog walking. Try volunteering at an animal shelter or a rescue organization. Often times, these organizations need volunteers to walk their dogs. Or, schedule and take a dog training or dog behavioral class at your local pet store.You can also build your experience by volunteering to walk your neighbors’ or family members’ dogs. This is a great way to start building your client base, as well.

, As a dog walker, you must be willing to work outdoors and in all kinds of weather conditions. Therefore, you must be physically fit. You must also have a basic understanding of dogs and dog care, as well as enjoy being around dogs. And, understand that you will need to have a flexible schedule to accommodate your clients.Once you have done your research, organize the information in a clear and concise way so it is easy for your parents to understand and digest.
Make an outline that details your clients, your responsibilities, your hours, and your wages. Also, include any contributions that your parents will need to make, like driving you to a location.

"
Prepare for your parents' questions.,
Bring up the topic during a convenient time.,
Ask for a delayed response.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become a Dog Walker2," Your parents are going to ask you a lot of questions. By being prepared for these questions, you can make a better and more persuasive case. You will also look responsible if you have the answers to most of their questions.Questions that your parents might ask are:


“Whose dogs will you be walking?”
“When will you work?” or, “What will your work schedule be like?”
“How much will you be paid?”
“How will you get there?”
“How much do you know about dogs?” or, “Will you be able to handle a dog if it becomes aggressive?”

, Approach your parents when they are not busy doing something, like cooking, fixing the sink, or helping your sibling with their homework. Also, make sure to bring up the topic when they are in a good mood. Don’t bring up the topic when they are stressed or angry.Driving in the car, going for a walk, or after dinner are examples of good times to talk.
If you want to talk, but you see that your parents are busy, then ask, “Can we talk? Is now a good time to talk?” “I have something to talk about with you. When is a good time to talk?” and “Mom (or Dad), do you have a minute?”

, When your parent feels like they are cornered, or if they feel like they are being rushed, they are more likely to say no than yes. Therefore, by asking for a delayed response, it will give your Dad or Mom time to consider your request. This will also make you look patient, and thus, mature.Ask for a delayed response by saying, “You do not need to say yes or no right away. I want you to take the time to review the information, and think about my request before deciding.”
Show some gratitude by saying, “I know both of you guys work really hard to provide for me and my sister. But, I want to start taking more responsibility for some of my things. By having this job, I will be able to pay for some of my clothes and video games. Think about it.”

"
"
Figure out why they said no.,
Make a compromise.,
Remain calm.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become a Dog Walker3," If your parents say no at first, it is not the end of the world. Instead of becoming angry or frustrated, figure out the reasons for why they decided no. Then, ask them what you can do to make it a yes.For example, “How can I change your decision?” or, “What do I need to do to change your mind?”

, If your parents are undecided, offer to make a compromise. Perhaps your parents are worried that you won’t have time for your schoolwork if you have a job. Or, maybe they are worried about your general safety. Instead of arguing with them, negotiate with them.If they are worried about school, tell them, “If my grades start to drop, I will quit dog walking.”
If they are worried about your safety, tell them, “I will only walk dogs of owners who you and I know and trust.”
If they are just generally unhappy with you, tell them, “If you guys allow me to dog walk, I will take more responsibility around the house. I know you want me to be more responsible and mature, but so do I. How can I show you that?”

, Remember to remain calm if your parents decide on a definitive no. Do not get angry and start yelling, whining, or crying. This will only prove their point—that you are not mature enough to have a job. You want to leave a good impression for the next time you ask them.In the meantime, take more responsibility around the house. Help your parents by doing more chores, taking care of siblings, and by listening and abiding by their rules. If they see an improvement, perhaps they will change their mind about their decision.

Secure the dog when you leave the house.",How to Dog Sit," Make sure you know where the food is kept and how much the dog is typically fed per day. Ask about their favorite treats and how often they’re given treats. You should also ask about food allergies and any digestive problems the dog may be prone to. Some dogs require dietary supplements or medications so be sure to ask about that as well.Never feed a dog chocolate, grapes, milk, cheese, onions, nuts, garlic, yeasted bread, avocadoes, or anything with caffeine. If you feed it an apple, make sure you remove the pit as it is poisonous for canines.;
, All dogs need to be walked daily but some need more exercise than others. Ask the owner about the dog’s exercise routine and how often there are walked. Some dogs like the familiarity of their walking route so ask where they are taken as well.In addition to exercise, you may want to take them to a dog park where it can run around freely and socialize with other dogs.
You should also consider researching exercise needs for specific breeds., Dogs often have unforeseen medical crises so you’ll want to be prepared. Make sure you ask about past health problems and research health problems associated with the dog’s breed and how you should handle them. You may vet records in case you need to take the dog to a pet hospital during an emergency.If you have to give the dog medication, ask how it’s typically delivered. If you have to give them pills, it may help to crush them or hide them in food., Proper dog training requires consistency and you can mess up the dog’s behavioral expectations by giving them treats too often or giving improper commands. Ask about how the dog has been trained and how you should react to good and bad behaviors. You can also reinforce their training by giving them commands they’ve already learned and rewarding them appropriately.


Make sure to ask if the dog is good with children and strangers if you foresee it interacting with them.

, The dog’s owner should provide you with everything you need including food, treats, feeding bowls, a leash and collar, plastic bags for picking up excrement during walks, and a cage. Nonetheless, make sure you know where everything is located in the house so you can access it quickly.


You may also want to know where to buy additional food, medication, or anything else the dog might need, especially if the owner is going to be away from a long time.
Always keep contact information so you can speak with the owner if you have any questions.

, Dogs are messy eaters and will often spill water and food around the surrounding area. You should clean this area daily as dogs will eat rotting food or lick water off the floor. You should also do a more thorough cleaning of the food bowls and surrounding floor area with disinfectant at least once a week., Dogs are creatures of habits and can experience anxiety if their schedules change. The dog will be even more sensitive to changes since their owner is gone and especially if they’re staying in a home they aren’t used to.Try to walk and feed them at roughly the same time of the day, especially in the first few days of taking care of them.

, You should try to spend a lot of time with the dog you are caring for when you first meet it. Dogs can suffer from separation anxiety when their owners leave. This can be countered by giving the dog attention and getting it used to your presence.Take the dog for a walk or play a game fetch soon after you meet it. This will distract the dog from the owner’s absence and help it bond with you.
It’s especially important to spend a lot of time with the dog if you’re taking it to your home rather than spending time at the owners. They may look for things to chew on or destroy in a new environment so you’ll want to be nearby to prevent this.Dogs recognize people based on smell. Give the dog time to sniff your hand so they get used to your scent or they might get nervous each time you walk into the room., The anxiety of missing their owner can cause dogs to ignore their training and behave badly.They may start to chew on things, eliminate in the house, or otherwise destroy things. You should generally keep a close eye on the dog for the first few hours.


If the dog is behaving badly, start by taking them for a walk or giving them a treat to calm them down. Walks are good because the dog will work out their aggression outside and be tired when they return home., If you are taking the dog your home, you should keep the dog in a cage or leashed to a stationary object when they are left alone. Dogs get anxious in new environments, especially when they’re alone and may engage in destructive behavior."

Ask friends for recommendations.,
Talk with your veterinarian or those at your local animal hospital.,
Ask the volunteers at your local animal shelter.,
Go to a local dog park.,
Check on typical dog walker rates in your area.",How to Choose a Dog Walker1," If you have a dog, odds are some of your friends do as well. Seek out those who use dog walkers and ask whether they’re satisfied with them and get their numbers.


Ask your friends questions such as, “How long have you worked with your dog walker?” “Are they dependable?” “What kind of coverage do they offer when they are away?” “Is your dog excited to see the dog walker?”
Find out whether their dog walkers are accepting new clients.
Some dog walkers offer financial incentives to clients who recommend them, so be aware of this while soliciting suggestions from your friends.
If the dog walker cannot take on your pet, ask them for recommendations.;
, Many dog walkers work part time at animal hospitals or as veterinary technicians, so those can be good places to start in your search for a qualified dog walker. Additionally, if you choose a dog walker from a business or practice you frequent, you could already have an established relationship with them., Animal shelters are a great resource for finding people who genuinely love and care for dogs. If they’re the type of giving person who volunteers their time, they may be a good choice for walking your dog.


Just because someone volunteers with animals, however, does not mean they are a qualified dog walker. Be sure to ask about their experience with dog walking when approaching them.

, While many dog parents are present at the dog park, dog walkers will be there as well. Frequent a nearby dog park often and strike up conversations with dog walkers whose style you admire.


Ask if they are taking new dogs.
Some possible questions to ask include, “How many dogs do you typically walk in a day?” “Do you specialize in any particular breed or geographic location?” “How long have you been a dog walker?”

, Average rates for dog walkers vary considerably throughout the country, so ask fellow dog owners what they pay in your area.


The rates per walk may vary depending on whether the walker is working only with your dog or with many at the same time.
Find out about whether tipping is expected on top of the agreed-upon rate.

Set up an interview time.,
Talk about logistical issues.,
Ask about coverage if your dog walker is sick or away.,
Find out whether the interviewee will be the primary dog walker.,
Consider the dog walker’s experience.,
Make sure their approach to training is similar to yours.,
Ask about the dogs that will be walked with yours.,
Find out if they are prepared for an emergency.,
Make sure they are insured, bonded, and licensed.",How to Choose a Dog Walker2," Many dog-walking services offer a free initial meeting and consultation. During this time, you can see how the dog walker interacts with your pet and whether you have a good rapport with them.


This is a good opportunity to assess whether the interviewee shows up on time and behaves in a professional manner. After all, you will be entering into a business relationship with them.
Ask if they will accompany you on a trial walk.

, Among the issues to discuss with your potential dog walker are where the dog will be walked, how long the walks will be, and whether the walker will come at the same time each day. Be sure to use this time to convey your dog’s needs to the interviewee.


Clearly state your preferences, such as “I prefer if you walk the dog alone, rather than with other dogs,” or “It’s better if you don’t drive my dog to a trail, since it gets carsick.”
The following questions are useful: “What type of vehicle do you use to transport the dogs?” “Do you crate the dogs together in your vehicle?” “Do you use my leashes or do you provide your own?”
Use the interview to find out the walker’s approach to the job. Ask questions such as, “Do you walk alone or with a friend?” or “Do you typically turn off your cell phone during walks?”
Ask “How do I know you’ve been here each day?” and “Do you provide a written log with information on where and how long you walked and whether the dog took any potty breaks?” You can also ask the walker for a text after each walk is completed.

, At some point, your dog walker will likely need to take time off for vacation or illness. Your dog walker might know another person who can take care of your dog, or you may have to find another dog walker on your own. If the former, find out how you will be notified of the need for time off and who will walk your dog in their absence.


If your walker has a vacation planned, ask them if they will introduce your dog to their fill-in ahead of time.

, Some dog walkers are independent, while others work with a team or company. If the person you interview is not the one who will be walking your dog on a regular basis, ask to meet with the person who will have that assignment.Independent dog walkers can be beneficial because they will become familiar to your dog and give it a sense of security and routine. A possible drawback may be if they have scheduling conflicts and no one to cover for them.
If you choose to go with a business or team of walkers, you will have more coverage in cases of emergency. Be sure that if you go with a team that your dog will typically see the same walker.

, Ask about whether they work with animals in other capacities besides walking them (such as being a groomer, veterinary technician, etc.). This will tell you whether you are selecting someone who is interested in and knowledgeable about animals or is someone who just wants to make some extra money.Ask questions such as, “How long have you been a dog walker?” and “How many dogs have you worked with in the past?”
Find out why they chose to be a dog walker: “What made you decide to be a dog walker?” and “Do you plan to do this indefinitely?” These questions can give you insight into the dog walker's enthusiasm and training philosophy.
Ask how they have handled past problems, such as an injured or lost dog.

, Verify that the dog walker will use positive reinforcement with your pet, instead of yelling or shoving.Ask what type of discipline will be used with your dog, and be wary if the candidate says they “punish” dogs. An answer that includes words like “redirection” or “following instructions” would be more in line with a positive approach to behavior management.Ask questions such as, “How do you handle fights between dogs you are walking?” or, “What approaches do you use to read body language between dogs?”

, You will need to find out how many dogs will be walked with yours and the sizes and types of those dogs. Thinking about these issues will give you a better idea of whether you and the dog walker agree on the approach to the job.


Some possible questions are, “How do you decide whether dogs are compatible for walking together?” or “Have you had problems in the past with dogs fighting while you were walking them? How did you handle that?”
See if the walker follows the “50 percent” rule when pairing dogs: If your dog weighs 25 pounds, his fellow dogs should be no larger than 50 pounds., Ask your interviewee if they can perform canine first aid. Find out how they handle, or have handled, emergency situations.Ask questions such as, ""Which emergency veterinary hospitals have you used?"" ""Are you familiar with clinics in the area?""
Other questions to consider include, ""What types of emergency situations have you encountered and how did you react?"" and ""What do you do with the other dogs while attending to one that is hurt?""

, You will be entrusting the dog walker with your pet, and you will be allowing them access to your home as well. Check their professional papers for evidence of insurance coverage and licensure during the interviewed.


Liability insurance will cover your dog walker for injuries to your dog and any damages that may be done by the dog while in their care. It will also cover any accidents that may take place at your home while the pet sitter is there.Bonding involves a bond provided by an insurance company that will cover damages while your dog walker is working for you. This may be unnecessary depending on your walker’s insurance coverage.There are no professional licenses for pet sitters, so the license they should have is to operate a business in your community."

Look for a large, local dog walking agency and contact the people there to ask if they need any help. This can be a way to both learn about the business and animal safety.In the long run, this is often the best path to your own business. You probably do not want to invest a lot of time and money into a business until you understand things like how to write a contract, how to find customers, and how to be licensed to operate a business. This is a good way to learn all of those things.;
, Programs like dogTEC’s Dog Walking Academy will teach you about a variety of dog safety and training subjects. Though they cost money, you can earn the money back. Clients will be reassured by the fact that you have professional certification. You can parlay this into higher rates or more clients., Go to a library to check out dog books or subscribe to dog magazines. You want to know enough about dog breeds to determine which dogs you should be careful around. You should be able to understand dog body language, how to implement dog training strategies, and understand pack behavior., When you visit the house to meet the owner, try to establish a relationship with the dog. Play with it and pet it. It will be more likely to warm to you if it knows that the owner endorses your presence in the home.


You should also be sure that when you meet the owner you bring a note pad and take notes. The owner will likely tell you some important details about diet and behavior that are worth keeping track of., You should make sure that you have a more than adequate supply of leashes. Bring a bag to dispose of poop. Keep a water bottle with you as well as a variety of dog treats.

, You want to take the dog to a place where they are not likely to encounter an aggressive dog. Avoid dog parks. Find a walking path that does not have much traffic., Talk to the dog. Familiarize yourself with the dog's walking speed and try to keep pace.

, When the dog pees, give it time to do its business without bothering it. When it poops, remember to pick it up with a scooper and place it in the bag. Give the dog a treat if it behaves well.

, If there is another dog or a stranger in the area and one of the dogs gets aggressive, try to calm it down and walk away. Carry a canister of citronella with you, in case of emergency. The spray will deter dogs from approaching you, but will not cause any physical harm to them.Good signs that a dog is aggressive are ears that are tilted back, close to the head; eyes that are narrow and starring intensely; lips open to display teeth; tense body position; tail pointed straight up and puffed out; and growling., A professional dog walker can often handle as many as six large dogs at the same time. However, you should always familiarize yourself with a new dog before you attempt to introduce it to other dogs. Be especially cautious about walking an aggressive breed in the company of other dogs.You can refuse to work with certain breeds of dogs if, for whatever reason, you find that you have difficulty building a relationship with them.

, Some cities require that as a business operator, or a dog walker in particular, you obtain a specialized license. Oftentimes you will also be required to have insurance. Even if you aren’t required to get insurance, you probably should to cover liability if a dog is hurt or damage is caused to someone’s property while you are in charge of the dog.Consider searching the local municipality’s website or going to city hall to get information about local laws.

, To run a business you need to know something about accounting and advertising. You need to know how to write a contract for your clients. Consider taking some courses at a local community college, or checking out some business books at the library.


It is especially important that you can write a contract that covers you for any liabilities and ensures that clients are obligated to pay you appropriately. Consider reviewing the contracts used by other dog walkers in the area., When advertising a business, it is important to have people who can testify to the fact that you know what you are doing. It might be best to start working with people who you already know well. You can even consider charging below market rate to the first customers to get started., Research what other dog walkers in the area are charging and charge accordingly. Consider how much income you want to make and calculate how many customers you would need to meet that goal., To get customers, you need to get your name out there as many ways as possible. You should have your own website and you should post information about your services on as many other sites as possible. Try specialized websites like dogwalker.com. Bring flyers to pet shops, veterinary clinics, and dog owner organizations.See if there is a professional organization for dog walkers in the area that you join for networking opportunities.Be sure to keep a business card with you at all times, in case, after striking up a conversation with someone you meet, you find a potential client. You want to make sure that you can capitalize on this by giving her a way to reach you.

, Once you have dog walking clients, it often makes sense to parlay them into extra business pet sitting. You will need to check in regularly to make sure that water and food bowls are full, play with the dog, and take the dog for walks. This will involve spending more time unattended in the person’s house, so you should be especially mindful to respect their space; do not search around or consume anything in the house.


Before choosing this route, make sure that it is cost effective. Would you be making more money walking dogs than pet sitting? Is pet sitting getting in the way of your more lucrative dog walking jobs?
When pet sitting, be sure to communicate with the owners every couple of days to reassure them that their dog is doing well. You can even text a picture!

, Cutting nails and hair involves a different skill set than dog walking. However, if you have a good professional relationship with a lot of dog owners and a friendly relationship with the dogs, you can consider grooming. Alternatively, you can hire a groomer to work with you., Once you have a successful business with more customers than you can manage, consider bringing in some more people. Search for people who are experienced, reliable, and trustworthy. Vet all candidates thoroughly.When franchising, you should have franchise contracts that are well constructed by a professional. You should also have guidebooks that subordinates study to establish a uniform standard of care for your furry friends.

First of all, think of a name for your pet sitting/dog walking business.,
Decide how much you're going to charge for what service.,
Put yourself out there to the world!,
Once you've made up your posters, put them around in as many places as possible.,
If you want to attract even more business, make business cards and hand them out to friends/family/neighbors.,
Once you get your first customer, be friendly to them and do a good job with their pets.,
After doing all of these steps, your pet sitting/dog walking business should really get off of the ground!",How to Be a Pet Sitter/Dog Walker," If you're making an amateur business, something like ""Sarah's Dog Walking"" would suffice, but if you actually want to make this a small business and copyright the name, it will have to be more creative.;
, Will you charge for how long you walk/look after the dog? Will you charge more if the dog is badly behaved and you have to control it more? Think about these things. If you just want to walk/look after dogs for fun, you can offer your services for free!

, Nobody is going to know about you if you don't advertise. You need to make posters advertising your dog walking service. Your poster should have the following on it:


the name of your dog walking/pet sitting business
the services you provide
when you're available (weekdays, weekends, after school?)
how much you charge
means of contacting you (phone number and/or email address)
a little bit about you (are you a student? Do you have previous pet ownership experiences?)

, Tape them to streetlamps, post them at community centers, schools, and supermarket bulletin boards. If you don't attract the attention of other people, your business will never get off the ground!

, This will make you look very professional.

, Show them that you're a trustworthy person. People love their dogs, and if you do a good job of taking care of them, your customers will talk to their friends and recommend you to them. Word will get around and will earn you even more customers. All you have to do is be trustworthy, polite, and professional.

, You may have to be patient, but the results will eventually come, and you might end up making a fair bit of money! Good luck!

Go on a walk with the dog walker.,
Check their references.,
Select a walker and sign a contract.",How to Choose a Dog Walker3," Once you've whittled down the candidates, take walks with a few who did well in the interview. Allow the dog walker to take the leash if you feel comfortable and check whether the walker is calm and assertive with your dog and whether your dog is comfortable with them.Give them specific tips if you would like them to treat your dog in a certain manner (walk fast or slowly or let off the leash in certain areas). They won't know your preferences unless you impart this knowledge clearly. Watch both your dog’s and the walker’s body language throughout the walk. Do they seem comfortable with each other?
See whether the candidate seems to pay attention to your dog’s needs, like adjusting the speed or changing their tone of voice if necessary.

, Once you have interviewed potential dog walkers, be sure to call a few references for each of them. Be wary if each reference you call had concerns about the dog walker or refuses to even speak about them. You can also search online for reviews of your dog walker.


Possible questions for references include the following: “How long did the dog walker work for you?” “Did your dog enjoy the walker?” “Were there ever any issues, like fights or missing personal property?”

, Once you have chosen your dog walker, it is time to make the agreement formal. A standard contract between you and your dog walker should specify the rate, how often and in what manner you will pay, the amount of time the dog is to be walked each day, and the cancellation policy if either of you need to change the schedule on short notice.

Ask those in your neighborhood or family friends at even the slightest mention of a vacation or being too busy to walk the dog. And when you do it once successfully, you'll likely be asked to do it again.


Mention to your new network that you're considering making this a career, so if they could drop any of their other soon-to-be-departing or dog-owning friends of your interest, that'd be great! Right now is the time for shameless advertisement. In time, you won't have to do it at all.
This stage is all about building up a reputation. Whatever you do, don't risk damaging it by abusing your powers. Having the key to someone's home is a serious gesture of trust -- be as responsible to your new clients as you would yourself, your grandma, or the President. That means no throwing parties, no forgetting to feed the dog, and no raiding the refrigerator (unless they allow it, of course).;
, Point blank, the easiest way to start making money walking dogs is to join an agency. Sure, they'll take a cut of the money that's charged, but you'll get experience and they'll handle the legal mumbo jumbo. Whether the agency is for pet sitting or walking, join. It's a simple Google search away.


The only downfall of this is that you're not your own boss. Relax -- that can come with time. But right now you're meeting people, networking, learning the ropes, and getting a feel for the dog walking market, not to mention beefing up your resume.
Joining an agency is not an absolute, 100% must-do. You can get around it by building up your dog-walking network yourself. However, it's a lot easier to get experience and clients (and meet other people with acumen in the dog-walking business) if you join an agency.

, Obtaining a dog handling certification would build some serious credibility with clients. Some schools, such as the Canine Club Academy, offer full-tuition scholarships.And the best agencies may even require you to obtain it, either before becoming a full-time employee or after hiring.


Certain academies, like DogTec, will help you in starting your own business too (if that interests you) in addition to dog handling and protocol. Their classes last 4 days and are in locations all across the US and British Columbia., First off, you've gotta know what your city's laws are when it comes to canines and their walkers. Some cities require dog walkers to be insured; if you're working with an agency, hopefully they took care of that for you. But if you're thinking about doing it on your own time, it's something not to be taken lightly.


Get to know your city's layout, too. The less you're driving around wasting money on gas, the better. Know the parks, the hidden hideaway spots, the dog parks, and back trails you can frolic with your new furry friend. You want to spend as little time commuting and as much time ""working"" as possible.

, It may seem like dog walking is the perfect career for a surefire introvert, but the humans are where your bread and butter is. Make small chat with the doormen, the guy who works from home, and your coworkers and bosses. The better rep you have, the more professional contacts you'll have in the future.


In addition, realize that your human clients will have all sorts of expectations, based on their own beliefs in dog-care and often with a dose of guilt that they can't spare the time to do what you are doing for them. Be generous in your compassion for their concerns (after all, they know their own pooch best) and be tolerant of the more difficult requests. Gentle persuasion and negotiation will often win the human client over!

, You need to love dogs to have a successful career with dogs. It is as simple as that. Dogs sense non-dog people and it won't be smooth riding if you aren't truly comfortable around them. There are some important considerations to think about:


Do you know as much as possible about dogs? Know as much as you can, not just from your own experience with them but also from reading and speaking to the owners and to your local vet.
How many dogs will you walk at any one time? Some dog-walkers can walk as many as ten dogs at once, all shapes and sizes. Consider whether you think this is a good thing or even achievable for you!






Do you know which breeds of dogs might not be compatible or will be compatible with one another? Know this before teaming them up for a walk.
Do you know what to do if a dog is in heat? It'll attract more than its fair share of attention and you'll need to be prepared.
Do you know how to handle a dog that suddenly turns aggressive on you? Or on passers-by around you?
Do you know how to poop-scoop? Do you know the local by-laws on walking dogs in certain areas etc? Read up! Your being well-informed will impress clients and will reassure them that you are not amateur and will help them to feel you are going to have their dog's best interests at heart.

, While it may sound like a dream come true (and it very well could be), not all dog walking is a glitzy, paid way to gallivant the sidewalks. You'll be dealing with poo in its very literal sense, in addition to ornery owners, ornery dogs, and ornery pedestrians. Are you ready?


You'll also need to consider your climate. If this is going to be your main source of income, can you dog walk in the winter months? How do you feel about rain? If you're ready to tackle the less than stellar climes, be prepared! Boots, rain jacket, snow gear -- and maybe some for the pooch, too.

, Being relatively fit is obviously a necessity to dog walking for a living. If you find that you get tired after a dog or two, use your free time to get in shape. Adding cardio (swimming, walking, tennis) to your list of activities will make the hours spent trotting along with Fido much more enjoyable.


Get a good pair of shoes. When you're on the job, you'll probably be on your feet for hours on end. You don't have to go running triathlons to get accustomed to it, but it is a good idea to get a nice pair of shoes so you don't go home every night crawling on all fours like FrouFrou over here. A decent pair will make the new physical stressors much more manageable.

, Be realistic - you'll probably need to start small, and allow yourself time to grow. Do you want it to be a part time or a full-time career? How much time can you devote to dog-walking? If you are young and want to make money by dog walking, make flyers and offer around your neighborhood, or put up notices on notice boards or in shop windows. For example, consider these scenarios:


If you are a student who needs income during studies, you will have crunch times around exams and essay due dates but you will likely be fairly flexible during the rest of the time. Be honest with a potential client and explain your availability, including the possibility that there may be certain times when you will be very busy and may need to reschedule temporarily at such times. Always let them know you'll make up for it during vacation etc.
If you want to start a permanent business, consider whether it is something you want to work 9 - 5 (or extended hours) 5 - 7 days a week, or is it something that only interests you part-time, say 2 - 3 days a week of a few hours here and there? These are important considerations that will either expand or limit your options and availability. More hours means more clients and a likelihood of referrals. Less hours will mean more devotion to a small corps of clients and a need to make it clear to them that your availability is limited to them.

, If you have no business past, it's more than just a good idea to take some classes and get your feet wet. Enlist the help of others that have a good grasp on the endeavor, can get you through the red tape, and form a solid business plan. If you want a large business, are you prepared to manage employees and cover a larger part of the city than you could do alone? Instead of just you, you'll be taking care of an entire team. You will need to:


Get insurance and become bonded.
Interview pet sitters, check them for reliability, train them and pay them.
Be able to trust them to do their dog-walking according to your instructions.
Keep good financial records, manage a payroll system, pay taxes on business income, and manage other worker's requirements.
Keep a tight leash (no pun intended) on the client arrangements. As owner of the business, you should make all arrangements for dog-walking directly with clients and then provide the instructions, keys etc. to your employees. That way, if things don't work out with your dog-walker employee, you keep the client and substitute with a new employee.

, How you price your services will depend on the quality of your service and the length of time you have been dog-walking professionally. It will be difficult to charge higher amounts until word-of-mouth begins to boost your business and you have solid references.


Research the field first. What are other dog-walkers charging in your area? Ask them if they are willing to divulge information to a potential competitor. Compete fairly with them - you could undercut slightly at first to get a toehold in the business. Don't undercut viciously; after all, you want to stay in this industry, not be cold-shouldered by your fellow dog-walkers. If there is no one competing, then use the internet to get some idea of the costs for your region.
Don't under-charge or over-charge. Undercharging will lead some to think you are an amateur, perhaps even the local school kids looking for odd jobs. Charge a fair amount in return for good, reliable and professional services.

, Make sure that they present a professional image and provide your contact details. Include a few short, pithy lines or words about what you offer as part of the dog-walking service. For instance:


Say where the dogs will be walked - for example, to the parks, on green grass, in quieter areas of the city - whatever you think dog-owners would appreciate and trust.
Explain what you will do with the dogs to keep them entertained and well-exercised - for example, that you are prepared to run with the dogs for exercise, that you will play ball/tug rope/fetch with the dogs etc.
The ways in which you will pay attention to nutritional and medical requirements of your canine charges.

, Pass around flyers or business cards to let people know about your business. Stop residents walking their dogs as you walk around, introduce yourself and offer your business card to them. Begin to network with family and friends regarding your business. Start small and let your good business spread by word-of-mouth.


There is no harm in asking your first set of clients to refer you to their friends, colleagues, etc. If they are happy with your work, many will be happy to do this. If you've built up relationships with people from past clients (security guards, doormen, maids), they may be a potential hot bed of business, too.
Bid on keywords on Google's Adwords program, and purchase paid directory listings on dog walker directories and other websites. Hit up Craigslist, Facebook, and even veterinary bulletin boards.

, The internet is increasingly becoming people's first port of call and aids them in their decision making. When choosing your domain name keep it simple by choosing a domain with relevant keywords (so your website appears on the first page of Google).


Consider the layout and design. First impressions count and if your website is a reflection upon your service it should depict your core values (such as friendliness and professionalism) and what you have to offer. Enhance it with images or even a video so people can get a real feel for you and your service.
Consider a website that allows users to book a time slot and services online. Some customers prefer to book online rather than over the phone.

If you don't know the first thing about making a website, odds are you know half a dozen people who do. So ask!



, People looking for dog walkers have often just gotten a puppy and are looking for tips on training. New dog owners are also interested in learning about dog health, local parks, and pet organizations. If you can be a vital source of information (cue Lori Beth Denberg) for them, they'll likely keep you around.


Join a professional organization or two that can keep you on the up-and-up when it comes to doggy care. The International Association of Canine Professionals and the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters are two good places to start.When they ask where you learned that tidbit of info from, you just respond, ""Oh, you know. I've been a member of IACP for a while now.""

, It might be worthwhile adding other dog-services to your skill set. While these additional services will also add costs and some may even require business or home-office style space, if you are seriously considering making an entire career from dogs and their care, this may be the key to a lucrative career. Consider extra services such as:


Dog-bathing and dog-grooming

Dog-sitting (either on client's premises or at yours if you have space for boarding kennels)
Dog-training and/or dog-listening (if you are properly qualified only)
Spending extra time after the walk at client's home with a dog to simply be with it, play with it, feed it etc; and

Dog medical attention - some owners can't stay home from work to medicate their dogs; you could be the answer.

, Ask at a local veterinary clinic for some training in basic dog first-aid (expect to pay the vet for this advice). It will help you to fix some of the little problems that you may encounter. And while you're at this, do you know the first-aid for a dog bite?


Your local Humane Society may be another resource you can tap into. If a veterinarian seems a bit hard to get work in with, the staff here may be a useful alternative. And you could help out pups that need love.

Post ads on the internet.,
Make variations of your ad.,
Make yourself a website to advertise your services.",How to Advertise Dog Walking1," You could try posting your advertisements on Craigslist or another website like MerchantCircle, GoogleMaps, or PetSitter.com. You can post ads by creating an online account, which allows you to revise or edit any online ads you post. If you post an ad without an account, it is more difficult to manage your personalized ads. Include a small paragraph of information about yourself to let new customers know your background and love for animals. State in your ad how long you have been doing this type of work, and why they should choose your services over another dog walking service.Make your listing stand out from others. You can accomplish this in many different ways. One way is to capitalize important words and frame these words with asterisks. Use a catchy headline to grab the reader's attention. A good example would be, ""New Customers RECEIVE 50 PERCENT off DOG WALKING Services.""
Repost your ad every two days. Craigslist has rules and regulations to keep spam posts limited. This is why you are advised to post only once every two days.
If you are underage, you might want to have a parent or trusted adult answer the replies so that they can talk to the person and decide if it is safe for you or not.;
, Change your advertisement up by adding different worded ads to attract different kinds of customers. Keep specific types of customers in mind as you design different ads targeted towards different people.For example, make ads for new customers, different ads for returning customers, and ads for people with more than one dog.
Be sure to edit your ads for different target audiences. If you are writing an advertisement for PetSitter.com, you might want to emphasize your diverse pet watching skills, rather than just mentioning dog walking. If you are writing an advertisement for customers for with more than one pet, you should consider offering a discount.

, The website is a great way to showcase your pet-loving nature and walking/pet care service. Describe yourself and let potential dog owners get to know you. You should also upload a picture of yourself and several of you with some furry companions to show how much you love animals.Make sure to include some information about yourself like, “Hi, my name is Joe. I am 14 years old and I love taking care of my family’s black lab, Buddy. I have been taking care of Buddy and taking him on walks for several years. I would love to share my love for animals with you and your family by being hired to walk your dog.”

Optimize your website to local search results. This Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can be time consuming, but it guarantees that your website will be shown higher in the organic search results when someone searches for your targeted keywords.

This will allow you to pay self-employment taxes incrementally throughout the year; if you wait until the tax deadline comes along, you’ll have a big bill to pay and may be hit with a fine., Since you’re taking care of someone else’s dog, you’ll need to have liability insurance to cover any pets in your care and damage they may cause. The rates will depend on whether you are caring for a dog its own home or boarding it. If you do board dogs, you can sometimes add specialist pet business insurance to your home insurance.

, You want to advertise a daily rate that will be attractive to potential clients. Check the classified ads to see what other dog sitters are charging locally, so that you don’t price yourself out of the market. It’s also a good idea to check to see what local kennels charge per day, so that you can offer a better value.


Your rate should also reflect your experience. If this is your first time dog sitting, consider charging a lower rate than other dog sitters. Once you have a few clients under your belt and have a few good references, you can increase your rate.

, Prepare yourself to work with dogs by going to your local vet, breeder, or trainer to learn about the different breeds and get tips about looking after them. You’ll also want to have references from people who can attest to your character and skills on hand in case a potential client requests them.


Taking a class or consulting with an expert can be great preparation for facing sticky situations, such as deciding when a dog needs to see a vet or handling aggressive dogs and aggressive dog situations. It also can be an impressive qualification when you're advertising to potential clients.
If you’ve dog sat before, be sure to ask if you can use your client as a reference. If you have not, you can still ask for references from people who can speak to your general character and work ethic. Keep in mind that your trainer can serve as a great reference.
When someone agrees to serve as a reference, be sure to ask them for their preferred contact information. If they don’t mind a potential client calling, use their phone number. If they prefer email, get their address.

, Decide if you’d like to offer boarding as part of your services. If you intend to house any clients’ dogs while you’re dog sitting, it’s important to pick a place that’s clean, safe, and appropriate to their needs. If you intend to confine the dog to a specific room or area, it should be comfortable for the dog, appealing for the owner, and convenient for you.Keep in mind that dogs are sociable. They’ll be much happier if they aren’t kept in isolation all day.
The room you pick should have toys, bedding, and water available to the dog. It should not contain anything that could be harmful (like exposed wires or a bowl of chocolates). It should also not contain anything that you're worried about a pet destroying (like an expensive vase or heirloom quilt).

, It’s a good idea to start with your family and friends, and then use those connections to expand your pool of potential clients. Ask your friends and family to recommend your services to others who are looking for a dog sitter.


Keep some business cards on hand with your contact information so that you can hand them out whenever you meet someone who might be a potential client. Give some to your family and friends so that they can pass them along. If you have a vet, ask them if they would be willing to hand out your card to pet owners who inquire about dog sitting services.

, Put an ad in the local newspaper’s classified section, and/or post one on a local classified advertisements website like Craigslist or Gumtree. Create a flyer or poster that you can put up around your neighborhood and on community notice boards. (You can also try distributing flyers door-to-door or in mailboxes, but check first to see if your state has a law against that type of solicitation.) Give interested parties a destination where they can get more information by designing a simple website.


Keep the copy on ads, flyers, and posters brief, professional, and informative. For example, “Experienced dog sitter who is comfortable with big breeds. Available for short or long-term arrangements. Be in touch for more information and references.” Save the list of your skills and experiences for when a client actually contacts you or looks up your website.
Be sure to include your name, contact details, website URL, hours, and rate on all your advertising materials.
Your website doesn’t have to be flashy or expensive; it just needs to provide more information about your services, experience, qualifications, and references. Having a website can save you time when it comes to finding and communicating with clients because it can provide most of the information they're seeking and make the pitch for you.
Many platforms, like WordPress or Wix, are extremely user-friendly and will let you make simple websites for free.

, If someone is in touch to inquire about your services, be ready to explain what services you offer (like walking and boarding) and share your related work experience, skills, and the breeds to which you’re accustomed. You should also be ready to offer references if they ask for them.

, If your potential client is interested in hiring you, arrange to meet with them and their pet in advance. That way, the dog will have a chance to get to know you and vice versa, so you can ask questions about its specific needs, habits, and behaviors.Having a short face-to-face meeting will help the owners instill their confidence in you while making your job as a sitter easier because you’ll be better informed about your ward. It can also head off any potential problems you may have with the assignment. For instance, if the dog is aggressive towards you, you might want to pass on this client.
If the dog will be boarding with you, schedule this meeting at your house so that the dog has a chance to get familiar with this new setting.
While you’re at it, take down a list of emergency contacts, including numbers for the owner(s), their dog’s vet, and another person they trust in case you can’t get a hold of them. Keep these contacts with you at all times while you’re dog sitting in case you need to use them.

, Before you seal the deal, make sure that you settle all the logistics related to dog sitting their pet. The main things you need to figure out is when and where you will be doing the sitting and who will provide the food and other necessary supplies.Schedule times for drop-off and pick-up (or arrival and departure) that are convenient for both of you.
Some clients may prefer for you to house sit while you dog sit so that their dog can be more comfortable in a familiar space. If you’re happy with that arrangement, be sure to get a key and a tour of the house beforehand. If you’d rather house the dog yourself, discuss where you’ll be keeping the dog during the day and at night.
For the sake of costs and the comfort of the dog, it’s usually best for the owner to provide the necessary supplies. That way, you can be sure to feed them food that agrees with them and have supplies, like toys, dog beds, and leashes, that are familiar to them. If you do need to provide some of these supplies, agree as to which in advance.

, It’s important to be clear about the dog owner’s expectations before you dog sit. Ask the owner(s) about the dog’s typical daily routine, and see how you can best incorporate it into your own. If you can’t make an aspect of it work, agree on an alternate arrangement that fits with your schedule.The schedule should include when the dog usually goes out to go the bathroom, when the dog is usually fed (and how much), and how often and for how long the dog is walked each day. Write down your agreed upon schedule or ask them to create a checklist so that you have it as a reference.

, Take the dog out at least once a day, or even better twice, for a long walk to keep them sane, healthy, and happy. It will tire out even the most energetic dog if you take them on a couple of walks through an exciting park with lots of dogs and smells!Making sure that the dog has enough exercise will help mitigate any potential behavioral problems, keep them quiet, and make them easier to handle before bed.
Exercise each dog according to their fitness levels. If a dog is older or has health issues, check with their owner about how far and long it’s able to walk before you take it out.
Check with the dog's owner to see if they have any suggestions for good local walking routes and destinations.

, Adult dogs need to urinate every 8-10 hours, and sometimes more often than that. Besides taking them on a walk, you should let them out the first thing when you wake up, right before you go to bed, and after meals. Doing so will keep them healthy and your floors safe from accidents.

, When the dog you’re watching takes a #2, be sure that you immediately pick it up using a bag and throw it away. Whether it’s in the owner’s backyard or the park, it’s your responsibility as the dog’s guardian to keep the grass clear of waste and help prevent the spread of disease., Since canines have sensitive digestive tracks that respond poorly to abrupt changes, you want to keep the dog’s diet and feeding schedule as close to what they have at home as possible. Healthy dogs are well-hydrated dogs. They should have access to clean, fresh water at all times, even at night.Ideally, the dog’s owner(s) should provide the food and food dish to ensure their pet’s health and comfort.
Be sure to ask the owners if there is any special routine associated with their dog’s meal times that you can also perform. For instance, perhaps they use a particular word like “dinnertime” to tell their dog it’s time to eat, or maybe they make their dog sit and wait for permission to eat before digging in.

, You can either purchase one or assemble one yourself. Either way, it should include basic supplies like a pet first-aid book, self-cling bandages, gauze pads, an antibacterial ointment or antiseptic wipes, disposable gloves, scissors, and tweezers.It’s also a good idea to keep the numbers for the nearest emergency veterinary clinic and a poison-control center hotline with your kit.

, The place where you’re watching the dog should be heated (you don't want ""dogsicles""), dry, and well-ventilated. It should be part of or attached to a house, not a shed at the bottom of your garden. Windows that provide plenty of sunlight are a must; you don't want the dogs kept in a windowless cell.If you live in a cool climate, be sure the room is heated. It’s also a good idea to have thick curtains and a rug or carpet to help keep the room and dog warm.
If you live in a hot climate, make sure the dog’s room stays cool and offers plenty of shade.

, If you are planning on babysitting more than one dog at a time, the best idea is to place the dogs in dog crates at night since you don’t want them to attack each other or accidentally get pregnant. While it may look like a cage, many dogs enjoy the sense of den-like security that a crate can provide.The crates should be just large enough for the dog to stand up, sit, lie down, and turn around in.
It is best to stock a crate for each size of dog from a Chihuahua to a Great Dane.
Each crate should contain some sort of bedding. You can use anything from a few clean towels to a duvet to a squidgy dog bed, just make sure the bed fits the dog. It is not ideal to have a Chihuahua in a Great Dane's bed or vice versa.

, Dog sitters generally aren’t expected to be dog groomers, but it’s helpful to have supplies on hand in case you need them. Brushes for various lengths of coats are the most important thing since brushing helps to control shedding and eliminate any surface dirt without affecting the natural oils in dogs’ skin.If you are planning to wash the dog, (and after a long trudge through knee-deep mud, it's probably a good idea), make sure you have a bath with a non-slip mat, a movable shower nozzle, and a mild dog shampoo, sponges, and towels. The owner(s) will thank you for returning a clean dog to them!

On average, they need at least an hour of exercise daily, and do best with a yard or large fenced space to play.Owners of working breeds need to be in charge and able to handle a large, intelligent animal.;
, If you have a specific breed in mind, one of the best places to look is a breed-specific rescue group. For instance, you can search online for “Giant Schnauzer breed rescue groups near” your location.


If you live in the United States, you can also search the American Kennel Club website. They have a thorough list of national and regional rescue groups organized by breed., Look around local shelters and try to find a working breed or mix. You can find a local shelter’s contact information online or in your phone book. Give them a call, ask them if any working breeds are available for adoption, and find out if they have specific hours during which you can drop by to see the dogs.In the United States, you can track down local shelters by searching your zip code on The Shelter Project: http://theshelterpetproject.org/shelters/


, Contact your local shelter or rescue group and ask if they offer fostering opportunities. You can either foster the type of dog you'd like to adopt, or a specific potential adoptee. In addition to providing a loving home for the foster dog, you'll get to understand its needs firsthand., If you're not committed to adopting a puppy and live in the US, you can rescue a retired military working dog (MWD) by applying here: http://missionk9rescue.org/. You'll need to show that you can offer enough space and can handle a MWD in your adoption application. In addition, while there are no adoption fees, you'll need to travel to San Antonio, TX, and transport your new dog to your home.Note that the adoption process can take some time, since MWD adoptions are both limited and popular.

, Once you find a dog you’d like to adopt, the shelter or rescue group should finalize the adoption with some form of contract. It should discuss any adoption or vaccination fees you’re responsible for paying, and describe a spay or neuter agreement if you’ve made arrangements for a procedure with that organization.The shelter or rescue group should also provide instructions on how to care for your dog. It should include information about any specific health requirements your new companion has.
Make sure you know if the dog has already been vaccinated, spayed, or neutered. Find out if you’ll be responsible for providing vaccinations, initial veterinary exams, and spaying or neutering, and make sure you understand the costs. Some shelters will provide assistance with initial medical costs or waive adoption fees during certain times of the year.

, Working breeds are diverse, but there are many general and breed-specific health conditions to note. Due to their high activity level and size, many are prone to joint issues.In addition since they're typically curious, working breeds are prone to eating things they cannot digest. Some breeds, like Boxers, are also prone to digestive disorders such as bloat because of their body form. Signs of bloat include dry heaving or unsuccessful attempts to vomit and abdominal swelling. You should seek immediate emergency care if your dog shows symptoms of bloat.

, Ask the shelter or rescue group what they’ve been feeding the dog before you take it home. It’s best to keep a dog’s diet consistent, so stick with what it’s been eating if it’s in your budget and matches your standards.If you want to switch up its food, go with food marked for its specific breed or for larger breeds. If your new companion is a puppy, buy a brand marked specifically for puppies, since they need a higher calorie count. You can also discuss your dog’s diet with its vet during the initial exam.

, Purchase treats while you’re looking for food, as you'll need them for training your new dog. Look for brands approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council. These will be marked with a “VOHC accepted” seal of approval.Remember treats should comprise a maximum of 10% of your dog’s caloric intake.

, Get a collar that will fit your dog, and if you have a new puppy, be sure to check the fit every couple weeks. As soon as you can, have tags made with your contact information and the dog’s name. If the shelter doesn’t make tags, your local pet store will.While you’re at the pet store, grab a leash, as you’ll need one as soon as you pick the dog up from the shelter or rescue group.
Purchase a few toys, including a ball and chew bone. Consider getting a treat dispensing or puzzle toy, since working breeds require mental stimulation in addition to physical exertion.

, Choose somewhere secluded, like a bedroom or spare room, for a size-appropriate dog bed or pile of blankets. Your dog will need a safe, comfortable place if it needs rest or privacy. Having a place it can turn to if it gets anxious will help it adjust to its new home., Consider investing in a crate that’s just large enough for your new dog and crate train it, especially if it’s a puppy. Since they’re den animals, dogs can actually associate a crate with a sense of security, as long as you don’t use the crate as a form of punishment.A crate will be useful if you want to leave the house but aren’t sure how your new dog will behave in its new surroundings.
Whenever you crate the dog, always make sure it has toys to keep it busy.
If the crate is too large for your dog’s ultimate size, your dog won’t find it safe and secure. Buy a crate that’s just large enough for your dog to be able to turn around and stand.

, Put away everything that might tempt your new, curious dog, including clothes, shoes, breakables, and anything else you wouldn’t want it to chew or destroy. Try to make electrical cords inaccessible, and be sure to keep the lid to the toilet down.Houseplants can be toxic, so make sure they're out of chewing range.
Use baby gates if you want to keep your dog out of areas without closing doors.

, First, put a leash on your new dog and take it outside to go to the bathroom to prevent any accidents on the ride home. If the dog has never been in a car before, be aware that it will likely experience anxiety and motion sickness.Consider having someone pick the dog up with you. When you take it home, have them hold the dog in the backseat and try to comfort it.
If you have a new puppy, have someone hold it in a blanket or towel to soothe it during the ride.
If you need to stop on the ride home, avoid areas frequented by other dogs if your new dog or puppy has not been properly vaccinated.

, If you have already have a dog or other pet, take your time introducing them to your new dog. Be patient, and first use scent articles to make them aware of each other. Then, keeping them leashed, consider introducing them first in a neighbor’s yard, then inside your home through a baby gate.Let other people in your home offer your new dog treats and let it sniff them.
Show your new dog where its food, water, and bed are located. Then give it time to adjust and look around its new environment.

, If you have friends or family members who own pets, ask for a recommendation. Before you leave the shelter or breed group, ask for a referral to a good vet.Tryin asking the breed rescue group, “Do you know of a good vet who’s especially familiar with this breed?”
If you have more than one good referrals, look up the potential vets’ office hours and cost. Choose the one who’s not only well-recommended, but cost-effective and convenient for your location and schedule.

, If the shelter or rescue group hasn’t already, get your dog vaccinated against rabies, parvovirus, and other required core vaccinations. Your vet will tell you what’s required for your jurisdiction, and will give your dog a medical exam.Your dog’s vet can also deworm your dog and offer internal parasite, flea, and tick prevention.
In addition, you and your dog’s vet can discuss spaying or neutering and set up an appointment for the procedure.

, A working dog will need at least an hour of exercise every day. Go for long walks for about a half hour a couple days a day. Since they're so curious and intelligent, varying where you walk your dog will expose it to new sights and smells, offering necessary mental stimulation.

, Get your new working dog familiar with your house rules, and don’t make any exceptions to the rules you establish. Begin basic command training immediately to offer your new dog the combination of physical and mental exertion it requires.For example, if you don’t want your dog on furniture or to beg for food, don’t make any exceptions to these rules. This is especially important when you’re teaching your new dog your house rules.
To teach commands, like sit or stay, first say the command clearly, like “Sit!” Physically guide the dog into the appropriate position if necessary. Offer a small treat as soon as the dog is in the correct position. Repeat around 20 times per training session, offering praise and a piece of a treat the instant the dog follows the command so it’ll associate following the command with a reward.

Schedule playtime.,
Play different games.,
Reward your dog when you play.",How to Give Your Lonely Dog Some Company1," Play is an important part of a dog’s life. It gives a dog the chance to get some physical and mental exercise that will help keep its body and brain healthy.In addition to playing with your dog in the evenings, try to schedule a few minutes of playtime in the mornings before you go to work.


Try to fit in some extra playtime on the weekends.;
, Make playtime fun and interesting for your dog. When you notice your dog is lonely, play some interactive games with it to give it some company:Fetch: If your dog is healthy enough to run and jump, play fetch with it. Have your dog fetch a dog-specific Frisbee or favorite toy.
Hide and Seek: You can play this game inside or outside. Hide some of your dog’s treats, a favorite toy, or even yourself!
Chase: Chase your dog around the house or outside in your yard or dog park.

, Dogs love to please their owners. When you play with your dog, let it know you’re happy with it by giving it verbal praise (Good dog! Great job!), extra petting, and some extra treats. Don’t give a lot of treats, though—those extra calories could cause your dog to gain too much weight.

Call your local newspaper.,
Use your computer to create a flyer.,
Post your flyers around town.",How to Advertise Dog Walking2," Ask for the ""classifieds"" advertising department and place a classified ad in the services advertising section of the newspaper. Depending on how much money you want to spend on your ad, you can have a large or a small ad; however, the key component to attracting customers is to make your ad short, concise, and catchy in order to grab the attention of potential customers.A good example of a successful ad would be, ""Have a dog? Need your dog walked? Call xxx-xxxx for fast, reliable, low-cost dog walking services.""
Run the ad for at least a few months. This is the length of time it usually takes to attract customers.
Depending on how large your newspaper ad is, the cost could get very expensive. However, if you choose a small ad size, you can probably spend less than $40 – depending on how widely distributed your newspaper is.Switch your ads every couple of weeks. Run varying ads to attract different customers. Check to see when there is a correlation between ads and customers.
Once you determine which ad is more successful at attracting customers, use the remaining time you have left for the newspaper ad to post this particular ad.

, Make a hand-bill or flyer as an ad that you will post, hand-out, and place around town. This is a great way to increase visibility and get new clients.Include your name, your phone number or email address, and a brief introduction. You could even include a picture of yourself walking a dog.
Make different sized ads. Use bright colored paper to catch the attention of onlookers.
You can also create simple tear-off flyers that include your advertisement at the top, with your phone number on little strips at the bottom that people can rip off to take home with them.

, You can create small flyers and hang ads on street-light poles facing traffic. You can also post these ads on the windshield wiper blades of cars in parking lots, though this is intrusive and not allowed everywhere. In order to reach your target customer base, it might be a good idea to visit pet store parking lots and veterinarian offices.Go inside these places of business and ask if they have a bulletin board for professional services. Place one of your ads on this bulletin board.
Keep in mind that not all places will allow you to post flyers. So be careful not to break any rules by checking ahead of time.
Try posting flyers near the mailboxes at apartment residences.

Ask your parents to put the word out.,
Tell your friends.,
Let your community know.,
Ask your veterinarian to recommend you.",How to Advertise Dog Walking3," Your parents can be a great asset for you in advertising your dog walking business. Ask them to tell their friends, colleagues, and acquaintances that you are trying to make money by walking dogs so that they can see if anyone is interested.Ask your parents to say something like, “My daughter has started a dog walking business. I know that your family has a dog. Would you be interested in hiring her to walk your pet a few times a week?”
Your parents probably have a much bigger network than you have of people they know, so this is a great situation for you to take advantage of.
You should also ask other family members if they need their dog walked or if they know of anyone who might be interested in your dog walking services.

, Ask your friends if they would be interested in hiring you to walk their dog. Maybe their family or someone they know has a dog that needs walking too. Working for your friends can be complicated sometimes, so make sure you establish clear guidelines about what you both expect from the situation – how much money they will pay you and how long or how frequently you will walk the dog.

, There are people you interact with every day who would benefit from your services as a dog walker. You need to find them and let them know you are available. Network within your existing community because people are usually more willing to hire people they already know and trust.This means talking to your teachers at school, members of your church, your neighbors, or even family friends.

, If you have a good relationship with your pet’s veterinarian (or a family friend who is a veterinarian), ask them to recommend you to their clients. This would be a great (and safer) way to get the word out to fellow pet owners.


You could even ask if you could hang one of your flyers in the vet’s office.

Run with your dog.,
Walk a new route with your dog.,
Go hiking with your dog.,
Take your dog to the beach.",How to Give Your Lonely Dog Some Company2," All dogs need daily exercise. However, some dog breeds, like Huskies, Golden Retrievers, and Dalmatians, need an hour or more of daily exercise.If you have a high-energy dog, loneliness can lead to destructive behavior. Give your dog some company by taking it for a run.


Running can be hard on a dog’s joints. Have your vet examine your dog to make sure its joints are healthy enough for running.

, Walking can be good exercise, too. Rather than taking your dog along the usual route, take a different route. This will let your dog see new sights, sniff new smells, and maybe make some new friends along the way.

, If you live near a nature trail, consider taking your dog for a hike. Not only will this give your dog some company, it will allow your dog to get some exercise and experience something new. Bring some water, plastic bags to pick up poop, and a doggie first-aid kit.The first aid kit should contain some basic supplies, such as absorbent gauze pads, scissors, and tweezers.The website http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/pet_first_aid_kit.html has a helpful list of first-aid kit supplies for dogs.
Check the weather before you go hiking so you don’t get stuck in rain or other unpleasant weather.

, The beach is another great location to give your lonely dog some company. You can play fetch at the beach and even chase your dog in the sand. If your dog likes the water, you can play or swim in the surf."

Teach your dog new tricks.,
Visit different areas near your home.,
Spend quiet time with your dog.",How to Give Your Lonely Dog Some Company3," Teaching your dog something new will allow you to give your dog company when it’s lonely. If it’s been a while since your dog has learned some tricks, now would be a perfect time to teach it something new. Ideas for tricks are:


Playing dead
Giving you its paw
Rolling over

, If your dog is lonely, taking it to a new area can be just what it needs to perk up and enjoy its time with you. For example, if there’s a dog park you’ve never been to, take your dog there.


Go to music or art festivals that allow dogs. Keep your dog on a leash at the festivals.

, Giving your lonely dog some company doesn’t require a lot of physical activity. Consider just sitting quietly with your dog and petting it. Your touch could be all your dog needs to not feel so lonely.


Your dog may just want to be close to you. Consider sitting down beside your dog and reading a book.

Set up playdates with other dogs.,
Adopt another dog.,
Hire a pet sitter.",How to Give Your Lonely Dog Some Company4," What if you're not able to spend a lot of one-on-one time with your dog? Consider exploring other options to give your dog some company. For example, if you know your dog is friendly with other dogs in your neighborhood, consider setting up doggie playdates. Here are some tips for doggie playdates:Choose a dog that’s the same sex and about the same size as your dog.
Have the playdate in a safe, enclosed area.
Watch how your dog plays with the other dog. If your dog growls or tries to get away, start searching for another playmate.
If the play becomes too rough, you and the other dog owner should separate the dogs.
Allow the dogs to take frequent breaks and rest in the shade.

, If your dog gets lonely during the day when you're not home, adopting another dog may help lessen that loneliness. Don't just adopt any dog, though—you will need to find one that is compatible with your dog and will provide good companionship. Before going to your local pet adoption center, ask yourself some questions:Can I afford to take care of another dog?
How does my dog like to play (wrestling vs chasing)?
What is my dog's personality (mellow vs high strung)?
Does my dog tend to guard its food or belongings?
What if the two dogs don't get along?

, If getting another dog isn't feasible, consider hiring a pet sitter to give your dog companionship during the day. The pet sitter can take your dog for walks and play with your dog so it doesn't feel so lonely. Visit http://www.petsitters.org/ to find quality pet sitters in your area. When you interview different pet sitters, ask the following questions:What type of services do you provide?
What type of animal training have you completed?
Will you take notes about my dog, such as routines, medical conditions, and what it likes to eat?
Do you work with a particular vet that you take dogs to if they get sick?
Can you provide me with references so I can speak with some of your other clients?

Pick an appropriate time to bring the dog home.,
Block off other rooms.,
Try a 6-foot leash.,
Let the dog come to you.",How to Supervise a New Dog1," That is, you do want to supervise a dog when it's first in your home. That means you need to pick a time to bring a dog home when you can be there for several days in a row, such as a weekend or even a long weekend., One way to keep a dog nearby is to block off exits to other rooms you don't want the dog to be in. Close doors or use baby gates to keep the dog contained. The dog should be in your sight at all times, at least while you're establishing house and crate training.You want to keep your new dog in sight for at least the first few days, which is why you should block off some time to be home.
You can leave your dog at home if needed. A crate is the best option, but if you haven't been able to crate train your dog, try locking the dog in an area where it can't do much damage. Try to remove anything that could be a danger to the dog (plants, chemicals, cords) or that your dog could damage (expensive furniture, breakables). If the space is small enough, such as part of a laundry room, they generally won't want to use the bathroom inside., If blocking off an area isn't feasible, try using a 6-foot leash instead. That will help keep the dog in sight, so you can keep an eye on what it's doing around your house, such as chewing issues. You'll also be able to tell more easily when the dog wants to go to the bathroom., When you're getting to know a dog, it's a good idea to let it come to you for affection. Yes, you may have it on a leash, but don't force your affection on it until it seems ready. Let it come up to you as it explores the room, and only then, offer to pet it.Letting the dog approach you is much less threatening to the dog. Talk in a calm, soothing voice as it comes towards you. You can try to pet the dog, but make sure the dog can see your approach. Also, don't make any sudden movements, which could startle the dog. Avoid going over the head.

Play with the dog every day.,
Make sure that your dog has a variety of toys to play with and try changing up the activities you partake in from day to day.,
Find ways for your dog to engage in quiet, nuzzling play.,
Find opportunities to get your dog really moving.,
Find ways for them to play when you’re away.,
Find safe toys to suit your dog.",How to Engage in Healthy Play with Your Dog," Just as regular exercise is important for humans, daily play will strengthen your dog’s body as well as your special bond with them. Especially for new owners, this is the best time to develop a strong relationship with your dog and to also establish your role as leader. It is also an easy preventative for problem behaviors like destructive chewing, anxiety, or indoor “accidents”. Playtime is also a perfect time to educate your dog with tricks and commands. Set a daily schedule that works for you and your pooch. Making it part of your daily routine will become easy over time and your dog will certainly be grateful for it.;
, This will help maintain ongoing interest in play throughout your dog’s life stages, and will also keep a well-rounded exercise regimen in place. Again, similar to humans, working different parts of the mind and body will aid in maintaining your dog’s best health.

, In addition to balls and chew toys, soft comfort toys are soothing, reassuring tokens for when it’s time to calm-down. These toys are very helpful for dogs that suffer from separation anxiety as well. Give your dog stuffed or unstuffed plush toys or old t-shirts that have your smell on them. You may see your dog engage in healthy, low-energy activities with these toys like nuzzling, licking, gently tugging or simply cuddling while relaxing in their dog beds. This low-energy activity is still a wonderful benefit to a dog’s mental stimulation.

, Whether that means playing fetch outside with balls and squeaky toys or a game of “find it” that spans the whole house, it is important to give your dog a full range of active play. High-intensity activity releases hormones in dogs that are similar to those that give humans that wonderful “runner’s high”. Variety in their space and movement is equally valuable to a dog’s happiness as having access to a variety of toys.

, While you can’t be there during the day, you can still find ways to keep them playing. Task-oriented toys will help alleviate pent-up energy and separation anxiety when they are alone or crated. There are all sorts of puzzle toys and treat-dispenser toys that will keep your dog occupied during these times. Consider your dog’s tendencies with toys when you select things for them to play with while you are gone though. If your dog is destructive and you have to supervise them with certain types of toys, remove those from your dog’s area until a time when you can keep an eye on things.

, Again, as important as play is, safety always comes first. Look for toys that are size appropriate for your dog. Toys that are too small can easily become choking hazards. Toys that your dog has already destroyed or that can break off into small pieces should be replaced with new ones. Many dogs like to “gut” stuffed animals. To prevent ingestion of filling, find plush toys for dogs that are not stuffed or that you can insert water bottles into.

Look for toys made out of hard rubber.,
Buy toys made out of hard nylon.,
Look at durable rope toys.,
Avoid soft toys.,
Take your dog to the store, if possible.,
Buy from brands you trust.,
Do not purchase toys that look like household items.,
Examine toys for any removable or dangerous parts.,
Read the toy’s label.,
Pass on toys with squeakers.,
Look for toys that are the right size.,
Read reviews.",How to Find Durable Dog Toys," Durable toys tend to be made out of harder materials, like nylon or a hard rubber. However, durable does not always mean indestructible. Even some very durable toys can be torn apart, especially if you have a larger dog with a strong bite. Solid rubber dog toys are typically the toughest and most durable. You want to find a rubber that is hard but still has some flexibility to it.


Kong toys are very popular and come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and there are a number of other toy brands that are designed for use with dogs that love to chew.;
, Reinforced nylon is another material that makes toys more durable. Often, you’ll find toys that combine rubber with nylon fibers to make them even stronger.Check the tags of toys to see whether they use reinforced nylon in conjunction with rubber.


There are toys that are only made out of nylon, though these are often harder to find than toys that are made out of both rubber and nylon, or just rubber.

, Many dogs enjoy playing with rope toys, especially for games like tug of war. The fibrous materials of the rope, which are usually nylon or some other synthetic fiber, are strong enough to withstand a lot of chewing.Generally, rope toys with more threads are stronger.


Rope toys can also be cleaned fairly easily. The fibrous materials are also good for cleaning your dog’s teeth., Soft fabric toys are fine for less aggressive chewers, but are not durable enough for stronger dogs.Soft, plush toys are also filled with stuffing that can be harmful to your dog if they swallow it. Soft toys are not durable and will be easily destroyed by any dog who enjoys chewing.


Some soft toys are marketed as more durable, especially those that have multiple layers of fabric. However, they are still not as durable as rubber or nylon toys.

, One great way to make sure that you choose a toy that you’ll dog will love is to take them with you to the store. Most pet stores allow dogs, as long as they are on a leash, to come into the store with you. Take your pup with you to the store and show them a few different options. Let them choose which toy they’re most interested in. You can also ask the store's staff for their recommendations on durable toys that the store carries.


At the store, look for a few of the options on your list. Get them off the shelf and hold them out to your dog to sniff and inspect. Choose whichever one they seem the most interested in.

, It’s best to buy from name brands, especially those made in Europe or North America. These toys are more likely to be safer than toys that are imported in bulk from China or Mexico where safety standards aren’t as stringently regulated.While these toys might be more expensive, they are much higher in quality and are made of safer materials. Buying from brands that you already are familiar with is a good choice.


You can ask your veterinarian for toy recommendations. You can also ask friends or family members about the toys they use, especially if they have dogs roughly the same size as yours.

, Avoid any toys that are shaped like kid’s toys, shoes, and other household items. Your dog will come to associate the shape of their toy with the items in your household and see them as other toys. This encourages bad behaviors, like chewing on shoes.Your dog, especially if they are young, may not be able to differentiate their toy with your child’s toys so it’s easier to just avoid any similar shapes.

, Safety should be your top priority when it comes to choosing new toys. Many dogs that are vigorous chewers will become fixated on nibbling or ripping parts of their toys. Assume that any small or easily broken piece of a toy will be ripped off and swallowed.


The exception to this is a rope toy. Loose fibers that your dog might swallow are easily passed and don’t pose a health risk., This toy is going to be in your dog’s mouth frequently so it’s very important to make sure that the toy is made of a non-toxic material. Each dog toy should have a label that describes the material that the toy is made out of. Keep in mind that hard rubber and nylon are typically the most durable materials. The toy must also non-toxic.


Avoid toys made out of latex, since this material may also contain lead.
Keep an eye out for any toxic heavy metals, like cadmium, lead, or chromium. These can lead to serious health problems.Avoid any toys that are treated with fire retardants or stain guards, since these may contain formaldehyde., Many dogs love toys with squeakers in them since it appeals to their prey instincts. Unfortunately, some dogs become fixated on discovering the source of the squeaking and pull out the squeakers from their toys. Squeaky toys are usually not a good option for dogs that need durable chew toys. The squeaker can be swallowed or choked on, which is a serious health hazard., You want to find a toy that is the appropriate size for your dog. For instance, a tennis ball is too large for a Chihuahua while it is too small for a Great Dane. You want to find toys that your dog can fit in their mouths that do not pose a choking risk.Toys that are too small for your dog can be swallowed and pose a choking risk.

, Unfortunately, dog toys aren’t regulated like human toys are. That means that there aren’t any federal agencies that regulate how dog toys are made and whether they are safe. When there is a problem with a dog toy, it’s up to the manufacturer to issue a recall, which they may or may not do. Search online for reviews of specific dog toy brands to see whether other consumers have had problems with the toys.Many American toy manufacturers meet the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s guidelines for lead in children’s toys. Not all manufacturers meet these standards, but a CPSC seal can help you assess a toy’s safety."

Take the dog out every hour.,
Teach your dog to use a crate.,
Establish a feeding routine.",How to Supervise a New Dog2," When you're not sure if the dog is house trained, it's a good idea to take the dog out every hour to try and use the bathroom. When the dog does use the bathroom outside, praise it extensively. You can also offer the dog a treat and praise, right after the dog goes. That way, it will connect the praise with the action of going to the bathroom.Praising the dog when it goes outside is the main way to toilet train it. However, while you're supervising the dog, you can also watch for signs that it needs to go to the bathroom, such as circling, squatting, or barking/scratching at the door. If you notice these signs, take the dog out right away, then praise and reward it if it used the bathroom.
If you catch your dog going to the bathroom in the house, make a loud noise, like clapping or yelping. Then say ""outside,"" and take the dog outside. If the dog continues outside, reward it. If you find a place the dog soiled in the house, punishing or yelling after the fact won't help. The dog won't associate your anger with the earlier act of going to the bathroom., A crate gives your dog a space in your home that's its own. Pick a crate with enough space for your dog to stand up, sit down, and lay down comfortably. If you put the crate in a part of your home where the family goes often, the dog will feel more included.The first step is introducing your dog to the crate. Have something in the bottom, such as a pillow or blanket. Let your dog explore on its own. If your dog doesn't seem interested, try using treats leading up to the crate, then put some inside.
Next, try feeding your dog in the crate. Start with the food as far in as your dog will go. Eventually (over several days), you'll want to move it all the way in, so your dog is eating in the crate. Once your dog is eating comfortably in the crate, close the door while it's eating. If it complains, don't let it out until it stops.
Crate your dog at other times. Use a treat to lure it over and inside. Try using a word, such as ""crate"" or ""bed,"" to associate with the crate. When it goes inside the crate, offer the treat and praise. Close the door. Start by sitting nearby, then move to another room. Only leave the dog in the crate for about 10 minutes the first time.
Slowly up the time the dog is in the crate. When the dog gets more comfortable, you can leave it in the crate while you're gone, starting with short periods.

, Your feeding routine depends on how you want to divide up the dog's food. You may prefer just morning, just evening, or morning and evening. However, if you already have a dog in the house, keep the same routine, so you don't upset that dog more.The general recommendation is to feed larger dogs once a day and smaller dogs twice a day.All you need to do to get the dog on a schedule is to offer the food about the same time each day.

Carry a repellent with you when going on walks.,
Walk in areas that are properly lit.,
Look toward the dog without making direct eye contact.,
Walk slowly past or away from the dog in a calm manner.,
Protect your body if a dog attacks you.",How to Protect Yourself from a Dog While Walking," A repellent can be used on a dog if they become too close or try to attack you.


Bring pepper spray or an electronic dog whistle set to a frequency that feels uncomfortable for dogs when blown. Refer to the manufacturer's directions for each repellent to determine how it can be safely used.;
, This will prepare you to react in the safest manner if you see a dog approaching you.

, Aggressive dogs will consider direct eye contact a challenge and may try to attack you.

, Sudden movements can induce panic or fear in the dog and cause them to attack you; whereas running away from the dog may cause them to chase after you.


If a dog walks up to you, stand completely still and allow the dog to sniff you until they determine you are not a threat. If you speak to the dog or make hand gestures, they may see you as a threat and attack.
Above all, remain calm. Be mindful of your body language. Are you showing any signs of fear, such as trembling, or jerking back. Keep your shoulders up and square, chest out. You can turn your body sideways to avoid looking as if you are challenging the dog.
Avoid smiling,(showing teeth is a threat to a dog.)
Avoid direct eye contact. Do not stare into the dogs eyes. That would be another threat to a dog.
If a dog aggressively runs toward you barking or growling, stand still without making hand gestures, then shout commands at the dog such as ""No"" or ""Stay"" as if you were the dog's owner.(In your mind,OWN THE DOG). This may cause the dog to calm down or back away.

, If a dog attacks you, you will be required to defend yourself to prevent any major injuries or fatalities.


Kick small dogs in the nose with your foot. This may cause small dogs to retreat from you immediately and prevent them from biting.
Assume a fighting position if a large dog lunges toward you for an attack. Place one leg in front of the other, with one arm held across your neck to prevent the dog from biting your neck. Focus on trying to punch or kick the dog in its nose, eyes, or rib cage.
Stay in an upright position for as long as you can manage without being knocked down. If the dog knocks you down to the ground, arrange your body in a fetal position and cover your neck and face with your arms and hands to prevent fatal bites.

Choose a neutral location to introduce your new dog to your old dog.,
Give them a chance to sniff.,
Take the dogs home.,
Introduce your dog to a resident cat.,
Help your dog learn social skills.,
Don't force interaction.",How to Supervise a New Dog3," It's best to introduce your new dog to an old dog in a neutral space, to reduce territorial issues. Try going to the park or a neighbor's yard, where the dogs have space to introduce themselves.If you have more than one dog, try introducing them one at a time.
Have another person on hand. You'll need to have a leash with the old dog. Someone else will need to have the new dog on a leash. That way, they can be separated if you need to give them some space. Give them a little room on the leash, though, so they won't feel quite as restrained., Let them give each other a quick once-over by letting them circle and sniff each other. However, don't let them get too involved in this action. Rather, get them doing something else semi-together, such as going on a walk.In fact, one way to introduce them is have the person with the new dog come up beside you while you're walking. Leave a little space between the dogs, but let them sniff at each other as you walk.Watch the dogs' body language. Be sure to watch both dogs for signs of aggression. You may see their ears stand up, their hair ruffle up, or their tail go up. They may growl or bare their teeth. They may also hold each other's gaze for a long period.If you notice signs of aggression, distract the dogs with toys, treats, or something else each one will be interested in.
However, signs of play are good. A sign of a playful dog is bowing the front part to the ground with the back end up in the air.

, When you go home, start with the yard rather than the house. Let them get used to each other again. When they seem ready to play, rather than be aggressive, you can let them off the leashes to play in the yard.Keep the dogs separated when you can't watch them. It's best to supervise new dogs with your old dogs at first, just in case one or the other gets aggressive. If you can't supervise them, separate them into different crates or different parts of the house., To introduce a new dog to a resident cat, it may be easiest to start with the dog behind a baby gate. That way, the cat still has free range of the household, but the dog and cat will slowly interact with each other through the gate. You can encourage interaction with treats., Once your dog starts to get used to you and your household, consider socializing it with other dogs and people. You can take your dog out to public places where dogs are welcome, like pet stores and dog parks. You can also invite people over to visit your dog.If your dog is nervous around other people, try using treats to help the situation. When a person is at a safe distance (doesn't make your dog nervous), give the dog a few treats. Keep the person at this distance (it can help to use a friend), and continue giving treats as the person walks out of sight. When the person is gone, stop giving treats. As your dog becomes more comfortable, try having the person get closer, as you continue to offer treats. Your dog will eventually come to associate strangers with treats, which should decrease its nervousness.However, some dogs will always be nervous, and you may just want to avoid taking them around strangers as much as possible.

, While you want your dog to socialize with others, it's important to let the dog decide when it is comfortable interacting. That is, let your dog approach other people and dogs; don't force the dog to approach. That can lead to bad interactions, as your dog may feel threatened and even get aggressive.Signs of aggression include barking, growling, and lunging, as well as ears up in the air, puffed-up fur, and a high tail. These body movements are meant to make your dog look bigger and more threatening.
If you're dog is anxious, it will try to make itself seem smaller. It may tuck its tail between its legs, lick its paws, or crouch or cower.
If you notice either of these behaviors, it's best to pull the dog away from the interaction.

Limit where the dog can go in your home.,
Hold off on getting a big dog.",How to Keep Kids Safe Around Large Breed Dogs1," You should not let your kids walk the animal on their own until they are at least 10 years old. A child will not be able to control the dog properly if it gets excited and pulls away from them. This can lead to your child getting hurt and your dog running away.Properly leash training your dog should make taking walks safer. However, you should never let your child walk the dog unsupervised.;
, An adult should supervise all interactions between your dog and your children. They can help control the dog’s behavior and intervene if the dog attacks or hurts the child. Your dog may also try to assert its dominance by nipping and mouthing at small children. If you see that behavior, remove the child and gently scold your dog by telling it no sternly.Never hit or yell at your dog. This could scare your dog and lead to behavior problems.

, Because large breed dogs tend to have poor body awareness, they often bump into things and knock things over. This applies to household items, other animals, and small children. The same is true of excitable dogs. To keep your dog from knocking over your child or knocking things down onto their head, train it to behave indoors and secure or put away any dangerous projectiles, items hanging on walls or resting on shelves, in your home.For example, you should train your dog not to jump up on people and discourage it from running indoors.

Teach your children how to read a dog’s body language.",How to Keep Kids Safe Around Large Breed Dogs3," Teach your children that they should never pet someone’s dog without permission. When approaching someone else’s dog – even if it is one they are familiar with – there is a risk that the pet may react territorially and aggressively. Instruct your kids to always ask for permission and approach the dog cautiously before petting it.When approaching the dog, your child should curl their hand into a closed fist with the back of their hand facing upward. They should then slowly extend their hand towards the dog and allow it to sniff the back of their hand. This will help the dog process their smell and better familiarize itself with your child., Do not let your children wrestle or roughhouse with the dog. This can get it excited and lead to a bite. Teach them to play with the dog gently and in a non-aggressive way.Encourage your children to play games like fetch that exercise the dog and promote positive socialization.

, Teach your kids that they should never tease, hurt, or startle the dog. These actions could lead to the dog reacting aggressively towards them and hurting them.

This may trigger its territorial instincts and result in a bite.Even a well-trained dog will react aggressively to being hurt or scared.

, A dog’s body language is a great indicator of its mood. A dog that is growling or has raised hairs on its back is feeling defensive and may strike. In addition, if a dog is moving away from you, it is likely feeling anxious or agitated.

Differentiate between stray animals and lost pets.,
Assess the situation.,
Stay calm.,
Walk away and don’t run.",How to Be Safe Around Stray Dogs1," If you happen upon a dog, you will most likely be able to tell whether the dog is a stray or a lost pet.


Stray dogs may not have had any positive human contact and are not socialized towards humans. They tend to be wary of humans and their fear can be triggered into aggression.
Pets that are lost are more likely to approach you and be comfortable around humans. They may be wearing a collar. They will probably be at a healthy weight, look cleaner, and appear as though they’ve been cared for.
Your interactions with stray dogs and pets may be very different. However, just because a dog is a stray does not mean it is automatically aggressive or a safety threat to you.Dogs, stray or pet, that appear injured may come to you for help or they may be even more reluctant to approach you. It depends on the dog and its level of human socialization.;
, You will need to take stock of the situation to decide how you will proceed.


If you are with your pet, it is best to keep the two dogs separate and away from each other. Keep the widest distance between the two that you can, even if the other dog appears friendly. If the dog is friendly, you can return to the area that you found it after you’ve secured your dog at home or with someone else.
If you have small children with you, keep them far away from the dog even if it appears friendly.
If you see a dog approaching traffic, you must consider the safety of yourself and other drivers. The dog may run into the road, but you cannot run into the road to follow it. This is a major safety concern in which you must keep yourself safe.
Do not corner the dog in a small or confined area. This can frighten and agitate the dog and make it act erratically.

, Staying calm is one of the most important things you can do in this situation.


Dogs are aware of others’ fear, which may agitate them or make them afraid.
Your concern should be your safety, the safety of the dog, and the safety of any others around you.

, This is true for any situation with an unknown dog. A dog’s instinct is to chase anything that is running from them. This is not necessarily an aggressive act, but can lead to confrontation.


If you plan to return to the area that you found the dog, you should speak in a soft and kind tone and back away from the dog.If the dog is aggressive, try to avoid any confrontation with the dog by backing away slowly.

Send calming signals.,
Avoid acting dominant.,
Avoid confrontation with large packs of dogs.,
Assess the dog's body language.,
Protect yourself during an attack.,
Leave the area.",How to Be Safe Around Stray Dogs2," When you signal to the dog that you are not a threat to their safety, they are more likely to stay calm and peaceful. Some calming signals that you can use are:Avoiding eye contact
Standing sideways to the dog
Letting them approach and sniff you (do not raise your hand in a sudden movement — this may frighten the dog and they may bite)
Yawning
Licking your lips

, Aggressive behaviors may signal a threat to the dog, making them feel hostile or agitated. Aggressive behaviors to avoid include:Staring at the dog
Making sudden movements
Walking or running towards them
Yelling or making loud noises.

, A dog’s confidence is found in numbers. When a dog is in a pack, their confidence increases and they can pose a greater safety risk.


You should not attempt to interact with a pack of dogs that you think are stray. It is best to call animal control and let them take care of the situation.

, Dogs use body language to communicate that they are agitated, afraid, angry, or intimidated.


Dogs that freeze when you approach them, curl their lips to show their teeth, or stand with their head low looking at you are agitated and can be aggressive. Do not approach a dog that is caring for puppies. Their maternal instinct to protect the puppies may make them less willing to interact with you.
Dogs can show their aggression by snapping, growling, barking, lunging, and snarling. Avoid dogs that display these behaviors.
If a dog displays aggressive behaviors, try to stay motionless and avoid direct eye contact with the dog. Stay quiet and resist the urge to run and yell.

, If you have done everything that you can to avoid an attack, but the attack seems imminent, your focus should shift to protecting yourself.


Use an object like your bag, a stick, or a shirt wrapped around your arm to fend off the attack. Do not try to hit the dog. The dog will probably dodge the attack and be able to move closer in range to you.
Use your forearm to shield your face, head, and neck at all costs.
If you are knocked to the ground, curl up and use your hands to protect your neck with your face towards the ground.
You can purchase pepper spray that is specifically designed to deter dogs, though unless you walk through the area with the pepper spray out, you will be unlikely to use it during a sudden attack.
Do not run away, as the dog will most likely attempt to chase you.

, If you are able to avoid an attack and back away from the situation, you should leave the area immediately.


If you have been attacked, you need to go to the hospital immediately. Let the emergency room know that you have been bitten by a dog and they will administer a rabies vaccine and treat your wound.
Even if your injuries are minor and easily treated, you still see your doctor so they can determine if you need a rabies shot.
Call animal control and let them known that you encountered a potentially dangerous stray dog. Be sure to tell them the location you found the dog, what the dog looked like, and how the dog was acting. They will determine the best course of action to get the dog out of the area and into a safe environment.In rural areas that do not have a local animal control, you can call the non-emergency telephone number for the police.

Take the dog with you.,
Take the dog to a shelter.,
Take the dog home.,
Leave food for the dog.",How to Be Safe Around Stray Dogs3," If you realize that the dog is approachable and friendly, you can try to entice them to go with you. A treat or friendly commands can be helpful to convince the dog to follow you.Do not corner the dog. This will make them feel trapped and even friendly animals can act erratically when they feel trapped in an area.
The dog may follow you willingly. If it has a collar on, you can attempt to use a leash to lead the dog.
Decide where to take the dog. Once you’ve convinced the dog to follow you, you have a few options.

, A shelter is well equipped to treat any medical issues the dog may have and can house the dog.The dog may have an embedded microchip that has the owner's contact information on it. The shelter should have a reader to check for a microchip.Ask the shelter if anyone has reported their dog lost. Many shelters will take a picture of the dog and keep your contact information in the case that an owner comes looking for the dog.
The shelter may release the dog into your care if you decide to take it home with you.

, If you feel comfortable and are able to take care of the animal, taking the dog home with you while you attempt to locate its owner.


If you have other dogs, be sure to introduce the new dog in a safe and relaxed environment.
Make posters with a picture of the dog and your contact information.
Your area may have a local pet rescue that can find a home for the dog.
Reach out to local veterinarians. They may be able to post flyers letting their patients know about the lost dog., If you are unable to take the dog with you, you can leave food and water near where you first saw the dog. This is a good way to encourage the dog to be more trusting around humans.

Tire the dog out.,
Do extensive training.,
Allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time.",How to Keep Elderly Family Safe Around Active Dogs1," Take your dog for a long walk or let it run around at a dog park before being around elderly people. You can also play fetch or another game where the dog runs around a lot to tire it out. Most of the danger of having an active dog around elderly people is that the dog might knock them down or injure them just out of excitement. In order to curb this risk, you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting.If the dog is tired out, it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable. However, there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them. Make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog.;
, In order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog, you need to control that dog's behavior. Extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior. Training requires daily practice with your dog, clear and consistent directions, and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands.


With a well-trained dog, you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded.
Training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog's behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command.
This type of training takes a long time to complete. Don't expect to get total control over your dog's actions in a week or two. It takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog.

, If you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time. Getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with.


If the dog has already smelled someone, then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog's excitement. This tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters.
This technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies, but can work with other types of situations as well."
"
Keep them separated.,
Place barriers to restrict your dog's movement.,
Keep the dog on leash.",How to Keep Elderly Family Safe Around Active Dogs2," The easiest way to keep elderly people safe around active dogs is to keep them separated. This may mean putting the dog in its crate, out in the yard, or in a separate room that is closed off while an elderly person is visiting.Placing an active dog in an isolated location may require that you train it not to bark or cry as well. In some cases an active dog that is isolated from the group my be very upset about that isolation.

, If you cannot put the dog in a totally separate room, you can at least force it to keep physical distance from the elderly person. Place baby gates or obstacles in the way that keep the dog in a separate space from the elderly person.This solution works best for dogs that cannot jump and that will not use their brute strength to knock down an obstacle.
Also, using a baby gate does not keep your dog from barking or whining incessantly. In order to stop this, you will need to train it not to.

, If the dog needs to be in the same room as the elderly person, then you will need to keep a firm hold on it. This is most easily done by keeping a leash on it and holding that leash tightly.If you have a harness on the dog this can also be used to hold onto the dog and make sure it does not knock over or otherwise injure the elderly person you are around.

"
"
Make gradual introductions.,
Set firm boundaries with the dog.,
Promote calmness.,
Teach the elderly person dog commands.",How to Keep Elderly Family Safe Around Active Dogs3," It is important that you don't just let the dog go and let it jump all over a new person, even if the dog can't actually knock that person over or injure it. Instead, make the introduction gradually so that the dog is never allowed to act inappropriately towards the elderly person.


This is where a leash comes in handy, because you can let the dog sniff the new person and the new person can pet the dog but the dog can be stopped from jumping or generally getting too active during the introduction.
This gradual introduction may be most effective in a neutral location, such as outside at a park. This reduces the chance that the dog will be protective over its space and act badly.

, There are some things a dog should never do to an elderly person and the dog needs to know that. For example, a dog should never jump up on an elderly person, as this could cause them to fall over. Your dog needs to know that it is never to jump up and that that kind of behavior has negative consequences every time.


If you are trying to stop a dog from jumping up on your elderly family member, then you should also stop it from jumping up on anyone else. Consistency is key to training dogs to eliminate negative behaviors., Encouraging excitement when the dog is interacting with an elderly person will only create more of a problem. Instead of asking your dog ""Are you excited the Grandma is here?"" and riling it up, you should act like nothing out of the ordinary is happening when your grandma comes to visit.In many cases, your dog will look to you to gauge what its reaction to a new person should be. If you are calm and happy to see one, the dog may give that reaction too. If you scream and shout in excitement that someone has arrived, your dog will probably mimic your reaction as well.
Talk to the dog in a calm and quiet manner. This will promote calmness.

, If your dog is active but responds really well to commands, then you should teach those commands to the elderly person the dog is interacting with. This will help to assure that the elderly person is safe by allowing them to have some control over the situation.


Commands that might be of particular help are sit, stay, and lay down.
It's also good to teach the elderly person how to tell the dog to go to its bed. If the dog has been trained to follow that command, it will then know that it needs to leave this person alone and go calm down in its bed."

You need to think seriously about whether or not your small dog needs to be walked in the snow. There are many dangers to walking a dog in the snow, and you don't want to accidentally lose your little friend to the cold.;
, If there's a way to exercise your small dog in the house, such as a tennis ball or chew toy, try that instead. If you need to get somewhere with your small dog, he or she may be small enough to carry in a backpack or in your arms.

, If so, it would be wiser to wait for that. Also be sure to check if the black ice risks are high, in which case no one should be out at all.

, If you absolutely have to or want to walk your small dog out in the snow, you need to know how to prepare your dog for his or her walk. He or she will need protection from the cold, as well as you. Check the weather for the 'warmest' time of the snowy day.

, It may look ridiculous to some people, but it's your friend's best defense against the chill. Choose the right jacket: a knit or windbreaker-like jacket isn't a wise choice for thick snow. A better jacket would be a two layer fleece and nylon coat. If you get your pet boots to protect his or her feet, make sure they fit securely. If they're too tight they could hurt your dog's feet, if they're too loose they will fill with snow and defeat the purpose.

, Don't use his or her collar, because if they slip on any ice they could get choked by the leash and collar. A harness also allows them to breathe better, which is helpful in the cold.

, Make sure there isn't many clouds or a storm expected at any time that day-- it could hit while you and your friend are out and gravely endanger you both.

, These will come in handy for warming up your pet upon return.

, If you're coming home after the walk, choose a short, even route. If you are traveling somewhere, decide the quickest and most even way to get there. Try your best to avoid hills, you and your pet will have difficulty tackling them.

, If the snow is two times deeper than your dog is high, consider staying home, for it is incredibly dangerous for your dog at that point. If not, walk in front of your dog so you can tramp down a path for him or her. If the snow comes up to your dog's chest, do the same thing. If the snow comes halfway up your dogs legs, you can let your dog lead until you see it get reluctant to walk through the snow any further.

, Not so much at a crawl, but don't run. There could be ice hidden under the snow.

, If your less than or halfway through your walk and your dog is showing signs of freezing, like whimpering, acting angry or slow and groggy, immediately turn around. If your dog starts acting like this more than halfway, try pressing on, but keep a better watch on your friend.

, Pick your dog up and carry it, or put it in your jacket to warm it up, then try walking him or her again. If he or she refuses at that point, collapses, or starts getting sleepy or aggressive, pick him or her up and head for home immediately.

, If his or her jacket starts going sideways, stop and fix it. If one of his or her boots is slipping off, stop and put it on again. Don't ignore even slight misplacement of your pet's clothing. Fix it so your pet doesn't have to add the discomfort to the already big issue of cold.

, If you have other dogs or cats, get them away from your small dog until you can get its clothing off and give it a chance to rest and warm up.

, Chances are, they're wet from the snow, so hang them up somewhere to dry or toss them in the dryer. You must take good care of your dog's clothing if you want to use it again.

, If you haven't, show your dog its bed. Let it sleep if it wants to.

, After the cold walk, a nice meal and drink might be just what it needs.

, The walk was probably a big event for your dog, so he or she's probably had enough excitement for the day.

, If it won't eat or drink or falls asleep and won't wake up, or remains groggy for a long time, consult a vet immediately.

, He or she doesn't need that stress on him or her every day. If your dog was in distress during the walk, don't take it out in the snow like that again.

Trim the hair on your dog’s paws.,
Buy a set of booties for your dog.,
Consider buying a sweater or coat for your dog.,
Put a brightly colored vest on the dog.,
Train your dog not to pull.,
Shorten your walk.,
Avoid chemicals on the ice.,
Walk in places where you and your dog can find traction.,
Clean your dog’s paws after the walk.,
Get a good pair of winter boots.,
Wear several layers.,
Walk safely.,
Wear a bright color at night so cars can see you.",How to Walk a Dog on Ice," This is especially relevant if your dog has longer hair. Excess hair on a dog’s paws—especially between the pads on its feet—will freeze and become clogged with ice. This is painful for your dog, and will take away much of their traction when walking on ice.Once you have trimmed the hair, you can apply a thin layer of protective balm to your dog’s feet. This will protect your dog’s paws and prevent the fur from freezing. Protective balms are available from all pet retail stores.
If you can’t find a protective balm, Vaseline is an acceptable substitute.;
, There are many retailers which sell dog booties; a reliable set can be found inexpensively. Dog booties will prevent your dog’s sensitive paws from being cut or scratched, which can easily happen when your dog is walking on top of coarse ice.A good set of booties will also improve your dog’s traction on ice and give them better traction in slick areas.

, Although this will not help protect their feet, it will keep them from getting cold or, worse, experiencing hypothermia.Certain breeds of dogs are more adapted to live in the snow (e.g. huskies and other long-haired breeds); these breeds are less likely to need a coat.


Buy your dog a coat especially if they are going to run through snow (which will get on their fur and then melt, leaving them wet) or if they will walk through a stream or puddle.

, Just as it’s important for you to be easily visible to passing cars, your dog should be too. Many dog vests are sold with reflective material


Alternately, you could buy a dog collar with reflective material. This will also improve your dog’s visibility, and is less cumbersome than a vest.

, This will reduce the likelihood of a fall, as your dog will be less likely to jerk the leash in your hand and pull you off balance.


If your dog pulls on the leash consistently, consider buying an extendable/retractable leash. This will allow your dog to run ahead on ice without pulling you to the ground.

, Many dogs—especially those with shorter hair—do not have the endurance to take as long of a walk as they would in summer.Over time, you’ll get to learn your dog’s limits—while a 30-minute walk may be fine for some dogs, for others, it will be difficult and cold.


If your dog has long hair or has been bred for cold temperatures, this may not be an issue. In fact, they may prefer walks in the winter, because they are less likely to become overheated!

, If you’re walking your dog on a road (even in a rural location) or sidewalk, there will likely be chemicals on the path. These are sprayed to melt the ice more quickly, but are poisonous to your dog.These chemicals can harm the pads on your dog’s paws and, more seriously, cause severe medical problems if ingested.

, In addition to having the potential to cut or freeze the pads of your dog’s feet, ice is also slippery. To decrease the risk of falling for both you and your dog, walk on areas with higher traction.


Snow can also provide some traction; it’s much less slippery than ice. If you have a choice between walking on ice and walking on 1-2 inches of snow, always choose snow.

, If you applied any substances to your dog’s feet, you’ll need to wash the paws off after the walk.


Dogs often lick their feet after a walk, and the substances you’ve put on the feet may not be healthy when ingested.
Even if you didn’t apply anything to the paws directly, they could still use a cleaning. The salt and chemicals commonly sprayed on sidewalks and roads are harmful to dogs’ feet, and need to be cleaned off.If you put booties on your dog’s feet, you’ll simply need to remove the booties; no cleanup required.

, These are different from hiking boots: winter boots have thick soles (for traction) and provide insulation to keep your feet warm. A good pair of winter boots should cover your ankle; some come partway up your calf.


Instead of winter boots, you can also buy shoe attachments that provide traction on ice. These come in various forms (some have small ice spikes on the bottom), but they strap on to the bottom of your hiking boots.

, In winter settings, it’s important to keep your body warm by wearing warm winter clothing. Focus on layering, rather than wearing a single coat—with layers, if you get too hot, you can take off one layer at a time. You should wear:


A warm winter coat.
A sweater or light jacket under your coat.
Gloves.
Long underwear or snow pants.
A warm winter hat.
Even if you are already wearing warm hiking boots, you should also wear a pair of wool socks. Wool will keep you warm even if it’s wet, so wool socks are much better than cotton in winter.

, Since you will be walking on ice, there are certain tips you can follow to walk safely and without risk of falling. The primary concern is adjusting your center of gravity and weight, to avoid the risk of slipping on ice.When on ice, lean slightly forward. This will keep your feet from flying out from under you.
Walk flat-footed to give yourself as much traction on the ice as possible.
Your arms are helpful in adjusting your balance. When on ice, keep your arms out of your pockets so you can flail them if necessary.You can even walk with your arms extended to your sides; this will maximize your balance.

, Walking at night can be dangerous if you are not wearing bright or, ideally, reflective clothing. It’s important to consider your dog’s safety before starting a nighttime winter walk.


Many different clothing brands sell reflective clothing; look especially for a jacket with reflective stripes on the back.

Have some standard safety rules for every member of the household with respect to your dog or dogs.,
Know when it best to leave a dog alone.,
Take particular care with children relating to dogs in the house or elsewhere.,
Be careful around strange dogs too.,
Understand why dogs bite or attack.,
Know the signs of an imminent dog attack.,
Keep still.,
Stand tall and still immediately.,
Do not stare at the dog.,
Command the dog to stop.,
Recognize feints or test moves.,
Protect yourself if you end up on the ground.,
Do not struggle or fight back.You risk getting more serious wounds and making the dog more frenzied in its attack; a dog will simply keep on biting and biting until what it views as a threat is abated.,
Hold your ground.,
Know what problems can ensue from dog bites.,
Treat a dog bite immediately.,
See a doctor.,
Report the incident.",How to Keep Your Family Safe Living with Dogs," These should include:Let the dog come to you rather than going to the dog.
Let the dog smell you before you try to touch the dog because what you smell like is how a dog gets to know you.
Do not pat a dog until you are certain that it full accepts you.Be careful about where you touch the dog (to a dog, vulnerable areas are often the head and the neck).
Respect the dog's personal space. If the dog moves away, don't follow her or him around.
Even a normal calm dog that is being hurt or teased or feeling sick might bite suddenly.;
, It is not advisable to disturb a dog while it is eating, sleeping or caring for puppies.


Do not tease a dog by poking it through fences or cages using hands or objects.

, Here are some key rules:


If there is a baby in a house, never leave your baby unattended and never leave it alone with the dog, no matter the dog's size. Train your dog to stay away from the baby. Dogs will try to assert dominance over the weakest member of the pack, making it risky, so always be with your baby when the dog is about.
Never leave a child under 12 alone with a dog. This includes when visiting friend's houses. Ask that their dog be locked up if the children will be playing without supervision in the dog's backyard space.
Never let the dog snatch food from children. If you see the dog do this, discipline the dog; it would expect as much from a fellow mother dog in the pack and will respect this rule. In turn, do not have children feed the dogs without your supervision.
Stay alert when children play. Even if dogs seem friendly, he or she might play rough by jumping up and knocking a child over.
Always enter and leave through doorways before your dog. This includes children of the house. The dog must be last; it must be admonished if it disobeys this rule and taught to wait.
Only allow older children to discipline the dog (around 12 or over). Any younger and the dog will not respect them, believing them to have no authority over it. Up to that point, the parents must admonish the dog for any bad behavior toward young children.
Children should never walk dogs by themselves. They do not have the strength to deal with difficult situations, such as dog fights, the strength of the dog pulling away from the child and the distress of the dog running away from them without them being able to keep up.
Teach children to respect dogs and all animals. Explain to them that it's wrong to pull ears, tails, fur, etc., to tease a dog or to hit it with anything.

, Have the following safety rules in place:


Teach children how to stay safe around dogs.
Do not approach a strange dog or one that is not attended by its owner. Even then, realize that the owner usually cannot tell whether or not his or her dog will behave with you or your children.
Report any stray dog in your neighborhood.
Stay away from a dog that is tied up unless it's your dog. You don't know why it's tied up or how it will react.

, It is helpful to know what can provoke a dog to bite or attack, in order to avoid being the source of such provocation. Typical causes that lie behind dog biting or attacks include:Fear: When a dog is frightened, it feels the same fight or flight response that a human would feel when scared. If the dog chooses to fight, biting is likely to be used. Once a dog has learned a fear reaction, it may return whenever a trigger occurs, such as a stranger with a certain voice or appearance, a sudden movement or another dog.
Territoriality: Dogs defend their space or area just as human beings defend their own backyard or property.
Food protection: Pushing to get to and guarding food is an instinct from puppyhood, when not doing so may have meant the dog missed out on food. This gets transferred to the human owner unless the behavior is properly trained out of the puppy very early on.
Self-protection: The dog is directly threatened in some way and reacts instinctively. This may be to protect itself or its food stash.
Protection of a pack member, own puppies: If a dog feels that a fellow pack member, dog or human, or its own puppies are threatened, it will bite to protect them.
Illness: Some illnesses can cause a dog to behave erratically and dangerously, such as distemper, rabies and brain tumors. Hormonal fluctuations can also cause problems.
Poor upbringing: An inadequately trained or poorly cared for dog may not learn to socialize properly with human beings and/or other dogs. As a result, it may be easily provoked.

, These include:Dogs growl or bark in the first instance to warn of their intent. However, barking as it runs toward you can indicate that it is alerting its pack or owner, and wants to sniff you.
Have stiff front legs, stretching up to increase height, getting ready to pounce.
Have hair standing on end.
Run with a steady, purposeful gait with their head level, rather than ""trotting over"" to you with their head lowered.
The tail may be held upright over the dog's back. Note: A wagging tail denotes anticipation, not happiness. The dog may very well wag its tail before an attack, so don't mistake it for happiness.
The ears may be pricked upright.
A dog that is afraid will bare its teeth.
The dog will likely stare at your directly.

, Do not run! It is not possible to outrun the dog, and when it catches you, it will not be possible to defend yourself effectively. Moreover, you'll be tired from running. Do not even back back––any form of movement is an incitement to attack you.

, This means stock straight, not attempting to reach out to or pat the dog.Avoid extending your arms. This makes them more prone to damage and likely to to be bitten. Instead, curl your fingers into a fist and keep your arms by your side. The dog views this pose as neutral, neither aggressive nor submissive.Do not crouch or try to get to the dog's level; that way you offer your face for biting.
Do not make any form of movement, especially not provocative ones.

, This will be treated as a challenging threat. Continue with your non-confrontational and calm posture.

, Since dogs are a pack animal that spends most of its life obeying commands, use commands with force. Keeping an erect body posture, use firmly and harshly spoken commands such as ""get down"", ""bah!"" or ""go home"". Your height and the imposing voice will have an impact on the do. causing it to oblige.


Do not shout or scream. This confirms for the dog that you are frightened. Screaming will not prevent an attack but it can make the dog become more excitable.

, A dog may knock you with its nose as you stand still and tall. It is testing for a reaction. Do not give it one––keep standing still. This confuses the dog and causes it to back off. Another thing it may do is grab a leg. Do not react if this happens; instead, say ""bah!"" in a harsh voice and wait for the dog to let go.By not moving you show the dog you are not a threat worth continuing with. Once again, the lack of reaction confuses the dog.If the dog tries to attack from behind (the sign of a frightened rather than an aggressive dog), circle on the spot to keep facing the dog, but only as the dog moves.Stay standing upright and have the turning on the spot the only movement you make, then stand stock still again. This prevents a dog that won't attack front on from attacking you from behind., If the dog attacks you, and either knocks you to the ground or you trip and fall to the ground, immediately protect yourself by curling into the fetal position or a ball, and protect your face, throat and chest with your arms.Stay absolutely still––you become harmless to a dog when still. Moreover, by doing this you ensure that any bites you receive will be less likely to be fatal.


Teach children to roll into a protective ball and to go absolutely still should a dog attack them. Due to their height, they will most likely not be able to hold off a dog attack by tall posture, and may also be easily knocked over. Protecting themselves is the best defense that a child has., Remember always––dogs are stronger and fiercer than humans.

, Stay calm and remain firm. A dog's mood is very changeable, within seconds it may submit to you and back down. Once it does so, never take your eyes off it. Very slowly move to safety, such as a car, behind a fence, inside a house, etc. Stop immediately if the dog seems alerted by your movement.

, Dog bites often tear human skin, creating a laceration with a rough ragged edge. A dog bite can be infected with bacteria, a virus, rabies, and so forth. A lot of dog bites can disfigure you, cause permanent damage to skin, muscle and bones and can be life threatening, depending on how badly bitten you are.


A bite from a mad dog causes rabies, which causes hydrophobia.

, To self care a single dog bite if you can't get medical help immediately or at all:


The immediate care of a dog bite is to wash the wound and disinfect. Soak in warm water with salt for about 20 minutes.
Change the dressing daily. Check carefully for infection. Keep the area elevated as much as possible. Apply warmth for 15 to 20 minute about 4 times a day.

, For peace of mind, see the doctor regardless of whether or not you believe self treatment is adequate. There may be bacterial or other issues involved, especially if you live where rabies is common.


If you are in severe pain, you have been bitten severely or you are unsure about your injury, get to the hospital or a doctor immediately.
If a bitten person is in shock or unconscious, consider administering appropriate first aid but get the person medical help as quickly as possible.
Go to the doctor immediately if there is redness around the wound, red streaks, swelling, drainage, fever, tender bumps in groin or armpit or around the wound, or an unexplained in pain or tenderness.
Any child, sick or frail person or elderly person should see a doctor immediately if bitten by a dog.

, If you are bitten by any kind of animal visit doctor and report to city's animal control officer.

Supervise your dog to avoid him/her licking it off.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies in Dogs (Home Remedies)2,", Unlike Gold Bond, Coconut oil will not relieve an itch, but it will soothe irritated skin. Dogs tend to break skin when scratching.

, Coconut oil is safe for your pet, but we don't want them ingesting it. It won't help soothe their skin if they eat it, and if they ingest too much, it will give them diarrhea.

Talk to the owner first.,
Avoid making eye contact.,
Stay calm.",How to Feel Comfortable Around Big Dogs1," When around a big dog, be sure to greet and talk with the owner first. This should be done while completely ignoring the dog. Your positive interactions with the owner will signal to the dog that you have a positive, non-threatening presence., Staring directly at a dog can be seen as a challenge or a threat. Consequently, try to avoid making eye contact with the dog. Also, try not to stand facing the dog, but stand with your body sideways.Standing with your body sideways is less threatening, and will encourage the dog to want to meet you.

, When talking with the owner, speak in a calm, soothing tone. This will signal to the dog that you are a calm, non-threatening presence. If you seem too excited, it could make the dog excited and lead to an unpleasant greeting, like the dog jumping on you. On the other hand, dogs can sense fear, as well. If the dog senses that you are fearful, it might respond in an aggressive manner. An overly excited tone can also trigger the dog’s flight or fight instinct.
Do not baby talk to the dog either. Some dogs regard this energy as weak, and are more likely to jump or pounce on you."

Be ready with a wet rag in winter.,
Check for frostbite.",How to Walk Your Dog in the Rain or Snow," Some dogs are equipped for cold weather, such as Alaskan huskies. Other dogs, particularly small dogs, have more trouble in cold and snow. A vest can help keep your dog warm in bad conditions. You can also add reflective tape to the vest for visibility.Look for vests online or in your local pet store.;
, Not all dogs will wear a rain jacket, but it can help keep them dry when you're out in bad weather. Most pet stores sell rain jackets for dogs, and you can also find them online., Ice and snow can be hard on your dog's paws, especially if you're walking in areas where there might be salt on the ground. To protect your dog's paws, consider using dog boots or paw wax. Dog boots are exactly what they sound like, shoes for your dogs. For most dogs, wearing shoes will take some getting used to, so practice inside first by putting your dog's boots on at slowly increasing intervals.Try applying a bit of paw wax nightly. One way to make it easier is to wait until your dog dozes off next to you. Keep treats nearby, and put one in front of your dog's nose, then gently massage the wax into each paw. When your dog wakes up, it will be distracted by the treat, plus you can offer more as needed. You should build up a good layer to help protect your dog's feet, but you may need to work up to doing all your dog's paws., When it's raining or snowing, your dog will be less visible to traffic. A reflective collar, found at pet stores or online, can help. You can also simply add reflective tape to your dog's collar. Either way, making your dog more visible will keep it safer.You can also add a flashing light instead., Like your dog's collar, the leash should also be reflective, making it more visible in bad conditions. You can buy leashes that are already reflective or add reflective tape to make them more visible., In low visibility, such as when it's raining or snowing, you won't be able to see your dog as well. If it escapes the leash, you'll want to be sure your dog has information on it that will allow it to be returned to you.Reflective tags add another layer of visibility.

, If at all possible, stick to areas where there's less traffic. Cars can give dog some anxiety. Plus, if there are puddles, you and the dog will get splashed, which can cause chaos, particularly if your dog isn't a fan of water. Therefore, it's best to pick a less-traveled route if possible., Some pets have a hard time getting through big mounds of snow, so try to shovel a pathway if you think your dog will have issues. In addition, they may slip and slide if it's icy underneath (and so will you), so it's best to make a clear pathway where you can melt the ice., Just like you, your dog can slip on the ice. It's best to melt any ice on pathways and stairways around your house. However, you shouldn't use salt, as that can irritate your pet's paws. Instead, stick to pet-safe ice melts, which you can find in some big-box stores, pet stores, and online., It can be easy to think that your dog's waste will just disappear with the snow or rain. Often, though, it doesn't, leaving waste around when the snow melts, which is unsanitary and encourages cross-contamination of germs among dogs (who like to sniff what's around). Just like any other time of year, pick up after your dog by carrying plastic bags with you., If your dog jumped around in mud puddles, try rinsing your dog off outside with a hose if it's not too cold. If it is cold, try wiping your dog off with warm, wet towels just inside the door to get the worst of the mud off., Whether it's snowy or rainy, your dog is likely to get wet on the walk. Make sure you have towels ready by the door so you can dry off your dog the instant you get home. It will keep the mess out of your home and make sure your dog is dry and warm., It's a good idea to also have your dog's hairdryer by the door when you come in. That way, you can dry your dog off with towels, then finish the job with the hairdryer, making sure you dog is thoroughly dry., If your dog won't wear boots, it's a good idea to wipe off its paws when it gets home. In winter, you'll find there may be extra chemicals on the roads and sidewalk, and your dog could lick them off its paws. It's best to give your dog's paws a quick wipe down with a warm, wet rag when you get home., When out in extreme temperatures, your dog is at risk for frostbite (just like you). Frostbitten skin will be pale and cold (even after being inside awhile), though it may also swell and turn red. Check your dog's nose, tail, ears, and foot pads in particular.If you suspect frostbite, use warm (not hot) water on the area as well as blankets (not electric). Contact your vet if the condition seems severe.

"
"
Carefully move your dog inside.,
Treat any hypothermia first.,
Cover the area with warm water.,
Pat the skin dry.,
Avoid hurting the tissue further.",How to Treat Frostbite in Dogs1," The first thing you should do for your dog is to get them out of the cold weather. You should move them into a warm environment, like your house. Make sure to be gentle with your dog, especially around the frostbitten skin., If your dog has hypothermia or low core temperature, this needs to be treated before the frostbite. Wrap your dog in warm blankets or towels. You can also place water bottles filled with hot water around the body.Make sure to wrap the bottles in cloth to keep it from burning the dog’s skin, and make sure the blankets or towels you wrap around the dog are dry.
Symptoms of hypothermia include violent shivering followed by listlessness and a rectal temperature that is below 95°F (35°C). Other signs include a weak pulse, lethargy, and coma.

, Gently warm the frostbitten skin with warm water compresses. You can also soak the affected area in warm water. Never place hot water onto frostbitten skin. This can cause additional damage.The best water temperature is between 104°F to 108°F (40 to 42°C).

, After your dog has warmed up, dry the skin and fur. Wet skin and fur can cause your dog to be chilled. Take a towel and gently pat the area dry., Though you definitely want to get the dog warm again, you want to make sure not to hurt them further. Don't rub or massage the frostbitten skin. This may cause additional damage.You should also not use any direct heat from heating pads, heaters, or hair dryers.
If for some reason you have to remain outdoors, don’t try to warm up the frostbitten skin unless you can keep it warm. More cold against the skin or refreezing will make the tissue damage worse.

"
"
Let the dog approach you.,
Offer the back of your hand to sniff.,
Pet their sides, not the head.",How to Feel Comfortable Around Big Dogs2," Always let the dog approach you first. This will allow the dog time to adjust to having you in its space, and become more comfortable with you. If a dog is comfortable with you, you are more likely to be comfortable around the dog.If a dog is shy, but still approaches you, do not talk to the dog or make eye contact with it. Let your hand hang by your side so the dog can sniff it.

, Once the dog has approached and sniffed you, then it is ok for you to offer your hand for it to smell. When offering your hand, offer the back of your hand with your fingers closed, i.e., a relaxed fist position., When petting the dog, always pet the sides of the dog first. Try to avoid petting its head. A general rule of thumb is to start from the body and move towards the head.For example, begin by touching the dog’s back. If the dog is comfortable with light touch, then begin to pet its back. If the dog becomes comfortable with you petting its back, then you can move toward the back of its head and ears.

"
"
Read the dog's body language.,
Don’t force the dog to do something it doesn’t want to do.,
Give the dog a treat.",How to Feel Comfortable Around Big Dogs3," By knowing how to read a dog's body language, you can deal with the dog appropriately. This way, you can avoid any negative interactions, such as a growl or a bite. A dog that indicates that it is shy or not ready to meet you should be left alone and given space.Shy dogs will move away or lean away to create more space. They might also have their head lowered with their tail tucked between their legs.A raised paw, yawning, and a licking of its lips accompanied with a lowered head are also signs that the dog is unsure of you., If the dog does not want to interact with you, never force it to. Forcing the dog to interact with you might cause it to growl or bite you. If the dog is standoffish, then give it space. By giving it space, it will understand that you respect it, and the dog will be more likely to approach you when it is ready., Treats are always a great way to get a dog to like you, and thus, be comfortable around you. This way, you will also be comfortable around the dog.When giving a dog a treat, do not dangle the treat in the air. This can cause the dog to stand on its hind legs or jump up to retrieve the treat. They have less control over the mouths when jumping up to retrieve a treat.Instead, place the treat in the palm of your hand. Make sure your palm is flat. Then, bring the treat close to the dog’s face, i.e., under its mouth or at chest level. Let the dog lick the treat from your hand."
"
Visit a dog park.,
Gradually expose yourself to large dogs.,
Practice breathing techniques.",How to Feel Comfortable Around Big Dogs4," With a friend or a family member, visit a nearby dog park. You do not need to go inside the dog park. Instead, you can stand outside of the park. Watch how the dogs interact with each other and the people. Particularly, watch the larger dogs. Observe how their interactions aren't any different than the interactions medium and small dogs have.Bring some dog treats with you. Try giving a large dog a treat through the fence if their owner allows. You can also have your friend give the dog the treat. Watch how the dog interacts with your friend. Then, try to give the dog a treat.

, To overcome your fear of large dogs, try exposing yourself to small or medium dogs first. By becoming comfortable with small and medium dogs, you can learn how to interact and be more comfortable around bigger dogs.Instead of meeting large puppies, expose yourself to larger dogs that are older and more mature. Older dogs are relaxed, and are typically less interested in interacting with other people. For example, they are less likely to run up to you, jump on you, and follow you around.

, Breathing and relaxation techniques will help you regain control of your emotions when you are in the moment. Also, come up with a mantra that you can repeat to yourself to calm your nerves.When you feel your body becoming tense and your heartbeat growing faster, relax your shoulders and begin to breathe in and out. Instead of focusing on the dog, focus on your breathing. Inhale, hold your breathe for a couple seconds, and then exhale.
Repeat a positive mantra to yourself, like, ""I am in control and I am not afraid of dogs. I know how to handle dogs.""

"
"
Take your dog to the vet as soon as possible.,
Get pain medication.,
Have your dog undergo extra measures to warm up.,
Treat secondary infections with antibiotics.,
Remove dead tissue surgically.",How to Treat Frostbite in Dogs2," If your dog has frostbite, you should get them treated by a vet immediately.
