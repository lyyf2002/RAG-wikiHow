Ask the owner first.,
Don't look the dog in the eye.,
Let the dog come to you.,
Give the dog a chance to smell you.,
Watch for the approval from the dog.,
Keep your petting away from bad areas.,
Let your dog greet another dog.",How to Handle an Approaching Dog1," Don't try to greet a dog that's not on a leash and with its owner. You know nothing about the dog, so you can't be sure whether it's aggressive or not. When a dog is with its owner, you have a chance to ask if it's okay to approach.The owner may have a good reason for not wanting you to approach. For instance, the dog may not be comfortable around strangers.;
, Looking a dog in the eye is a sign of aggression. Therefore, if you're trying to keep an interaction friendly, skip looking it in the eye. Focus on the dog's owner. You can also look further down, like at the dog's paws.Also, don't smile, as that looks like you're showing your teeth, a sign of aggression., If you move towards it, the dog may take that as a sign of aggression. Instead, stop and let the dog move towards you. It lets the dog feel more in control, which makes the dog more comfortable., Hold out your hand so your dog can test you out in a dog's way, by sniffing you. Either hold your hand out with your fingers together, palm down downwardor hold it out in a tight fist., The dog will let you know if it's okay to take the interaction farther. If it approves, it may move a little towards you. It may also bend its head down so you can pet it or wag its tail.On the other hand, if its ears go back or he growls, let the dog be. Backing up or cowering is also a bad sign from the dog.

, Dogs are sensitive about certain areas, like their stomachs and paws. Pet the dog on the back of the neck or shoulders, not the head. The chest is also fine for petting, as long as you approach gently with an open hand.If the dog shifts out of your reach a little or steps back, the petting session is over.

, If your dog is with you and the dog appears friendly, you can encourage an encounter by letting them arch around each other sideways while you keep the leash somewhat slack. They will likely sniff each other. You do want to be able to pull the leash back if you need to. Once they greet each other, both will probably be ready to move on.Watch for the dogs getting angry or aggressive. If either dog gets stiff or stands up taller, you should pull your dog away. Also look for flat ears, growling, or bared teeth.

Look for signs of aggressiveness.,
Don't make eye contact.,
Try not to be afraid.,
Put distance between you and the dog if possible.,
Stand still if the dog is too close.,
Curl up.,
Protect yourself with a shield.",How to Handle an Approaching Dog2," Often, dogs greet each other from the side when they're not on a leash, rather than from the front. Watch for dogs who are running straight at you and looking you in the eye. That's a good time to start moving away, as it's more likely to be aggressive., Because looking the dog in the eye is an invitation to fight, try not to stare an advancing dog down. You may want to give a nervous smile, but that's also a bad idea. If you show your teeth, that is dog language for aggression., While it can be difficult to do when an aggressive-looking dog is coming your way, it's important to not be afraid. Dogs can sense when you're afraid, and they will use that as an opportunity to attack., Move across the street in a steady walk. Also, try to put physical objects between you and the dog, such as cars, light poles, fences, or trees. Sometimes, that will distract a dog., If a dog jumps out at you, try standing still with your limbs tucked closely to your body. Running at this point will only encourage the dog to chase you, and most dogs won't attack when you hold your ground. If you notice the dog start to back up, take a step towards it to encourage it to move on.Try to stay quiet while standing still.

, If you're on the ground, your best option is to curl up into a ball. Make sure to protect your head with your arms. Pull something over you if you can, like a jacket. Also, make sure your fingers aren't sticking out because they make easy targets., If the dog bites, your first instinct is to pull back. However, that will just make the dog more aggressive. Instead, try to protect that area with something like clothing, a bag, or a purse. Don't be aggressive back, as that eggs the dog on."
"
Try to move your dog away.,
Move out of the way.,
Don't run.,
Put the focus on yourself.,
Distract the dog with treats.,
Consider carrying a distraction tool with you.,
Don't put yourself in the middle of a fight.",How to Handle an Approaching Dog3," If a dog is coming at you and your dog looking like it might want an interaction or a fight, you should try to get you and your dog out of the way. The best way to do that is to distract your dog with treats, which is why it's important to carry treats with you when you're out and about with your dog. Hold the treats up for your dog to see, making sure to get in its line of sight. If you need to, reward your dog with a treat every step or two to keep the focus on you., The best thing to do with an aggressive dog, particularly if you have your dog with you, is to get away from it if possible. Walk quickly to a place that hides you, such as a car or even a fence. If you can get out of the dog's line of sight, you're better off., Running will encourage the dog to come after you. It'll think it's time for a chase. Therefore, just try to walk in a quick and determined manner. Jogging may also encourage the dog to come after you and your dog., If you can't get enough distance between you and the approaching dog to be on the safe side, you'll need to stand your ground. Get your dog to sit and then step between your dog and the approaching dog. Hold your hand out, and say a command like ""stop"" or ""sit"" in a loud, deep voice. Use a common command, as the dog is more likely to respond., If the dog stops at all, throw some treats in its direction. Often, the dog will stop to hunt around for the treats, giving you a break in the action. Use the opportunity to take yourself and your dog away from the situation., You can use things like air horns, loud whistles, and even umbrellas to distract a dog from attacking. The first two rely on noise to distract the dog. Opening up an umbrella in the dog's direction can scare it enough to make it back away., If you try to get between two dogs who are gearing up for a fight, you could find yourself with a serious injury. Getting yourself injured is no way to save your dog because then you have to deal with treating your own wound.The best way to break up a dogfight is to find someone to help you. Each of you should grab a dog by the back legs, lifting up and pulling back to remove them from the fight. Try to move the dogs as far away from each other as possible. If you can only do one dog, pick the one that's being the most aggressive."
"
Call an ambulance.,
Clean the wound.,
Call animal control about the dog fight.,
Get your dog checked out.",How to Handle an Approaching Dog4," If you are bleeding a lot, it's best to call 911. It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to something like a dog wound. The ER doctors will be able to assess if you need stitches and/or antibiotics to treat the wound., If the wound isn't too serious, you can try cleaning it at home. Make sure to wash it out with soap and water. You can then apply antibiotic ointment and cover it with a bandage. However, if you notice deep puncture wounds, you should see a doctor.Other bad signs that may show up or develop in the following couple of days include swelling, redness, and increasing pain. If you notice these signs, you should see your doctor., All dog fights or attacks should be reported to authorities. Make sure you have a description of the dog. You'll also need to give a general location of the dog, as well as what happened with you or your dog., If your dog is in altercation, it's best to take it to the vet for an exam. You may not be able to find wounds under the fur, and they could develop into serious infections. Your vet is better equipped to handle it."
"
Groom your dog well.,
Bathe your dog indoors.,
Keep the hair around paw pads well trimmed.,
Avoid overfeeding your dog.",How to Keep Dogs Warm in the Winter1," Avoid trimming, shaving or cutting your dog's hair because a dog's full weight coat is his source of warmth during winter. It is important to maintain a good grooming regime, combing out knots and brushing the coat thoroughly, through winter too, as matted hair is less efficient at keeping out the snow and cold rain, and does not insulate the dog as well.Consistent grooming can alleviate dander problems in dogs living through dry winters, should this be a problem for your dog.;
, Make sure your dog is completely dried before letting him or her outside. Give fewer baths during cold snaps, or consider skipping baths altogether. Remember, in cold weather it takes the dog longer to dry off. This will help you to keep them away from severe cold problems.


If important, give shorter baths with warm water and dry your dog as quickly as possible. Never bathe a dog in cold water, as this will chill him or her, and the low atmospheric temperature will give him or her little chance to warm up.

, This will help prevent ice and snow balling up between footpads.After walks outside, check paw pads for cracks, cuts, and any foreign debris. Where practical, keep his or her pads in good condition by applying a little vaseline or E45 to condition them, but beware of sticky paw prints over the house though!


If your dog won't wear dog booties, be sure to clean off the salt and snow removal chemicals after every walk; the chemicals can be toxic and the salt will become an irritant.

, It is important for your dog to eat regularly and well during colder months, in order to keep up energy and warmth. However, an indoor dog does not need increased food amounts over the winter. Doing so can risk creating an overweight dog.


More food for a dog is only justifiable for dogs living outdoors all of the time and for dogs who are especially active during the winter months. Talk to your vet about your dog's particular energy needs.
Be sure that your dog has constant access to clean, unfrozen water, indoors and outdoors. Heated bowls can be purchased for use outside.

"
Guard against canine winter illnesses.,
Keep your dog dry and warm.,
Frostbite can be a problem for some dogs, especially hairless varieties.,
Keep winter-time toxic items away from dogs.,
Pay attention to your dog's existing ailments.,
Take shorter walks when the weather is severely cold.,
Be aware that sheet ice is slippery for dogs as well as people.,
Keep your dog on a leash when walking in winter.",How to Keep Dogs Warm in the Winter2," As with humans, dogs can fall ill during the colder months, especially when cold or as a result of winter conditions. Respiratory infections in damp climates, frostbite, and consumption of toxic substances are some of the principal concerns.

, This will help to guard against respiratory infections, such as kennel cough (the human equivalent of a cold). If your dog gets a respiratory infection, seek veterinary attention immediately. Be aware that if you have several dogs all sharing the same air space, such as in a communal kennel, then illnesses are more likely to spread., Check the ear tips and tail tips in particular. If they look and feel cold, appear white, red or gray, and/or are dry and hard, then frostbite may have occurred.If you suspect frostbite, wrap your dog's extremities in blankets or towels to warm them gradually and see the vet immediately., Anti-freeze tastes unusually sweet to dogs and they will lick it if they can access it. It only takes four teaspoons worth to kill a dog under 10 pounds.If your dog does ingest antifreeze, see a vet immediately, as treatment needs to be given within hours to save your dog's life.
Another toxic problem during winter is rat bait, used in greater amounts due to everyone living in close proximity over winter. Keep all toxic items well out of the reach of dogs and other pets and clean up any spills immediately.

, Your dog's arthritis and osteoarthritis can be exacerbated by cold weather. Talk to your vet about medication, treatment options, and ways to keep your arthritic dog fit and warm through winter.

, Don't try to take your dog on the same length walks as during warmer weather. A shorter walk can still accomplish enough exercise and relief breaks without causing your dog (and you) to become too cold.


Even if you are indoors, keep exercising. Play indoor games with your dog, such as fetch, tug-of-war, hiding toys, and if it's possible to let them run around inside, then do so. Run them up and down the stairs for agility practice. Keep in mind that if your dog has some joint or hip problems they may not be able to run, so just let them walk up and down the stairs.

, Slipping on ice can lead to strains and sprains, so never encourage your dog to play on ice, especially games such as fetch or frisbee.


Keep dogs away from icy ponds or bodies of water. The ice may look firm, but if the dog falls through he could drown. Unfortunately, people trying to rescue their dogs also drown, so sad as it is never be tempted to try to rescue your dog.

, If something happens, such as a snowstorm, the sudden appearance of an ice plow, or if your dog rushes out onto an ice lake and falls in, you won't be able to help or retrieve your bolting or falling dog. Make sure you take a charged up cellphone with you in case you or your dog has a problem, so that you can call for help.

"
Understand your breed's particular susceptibility to the cold.,
Provide appropriate shelter.,
Make sure the shelter is adequately insulated.,
Make sure the shelter protects from the wind.,
Bring all outdoor dogs inside if the cold spell becomes exceptionally cold and long; even a barn is warmer than an outdoor dog shelter.,
Check the kennel daily to make sure it is dry and there are no leaks in the rough.",How to Keep Dogs Warm in the Winter3," Some dog breeds are more prone to the cold than others, while some breeds are adapted extremely well to the cold. Dogs that do not do well in the cold should not be outdoor dogs. However, even dogs that do well in the cold need warmth and shelter to thrive as outdoor dogs.


Dogs that are great in the cold include Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies and Chow Chows.Dogs that find it harder include Dobermans, toy dogs, low hair or hairless dogs, and Greyhounds. Any shaven or excessively clipped dog will fall into this category as well because the thick winter coat is a dog's insulation.

, It is optimal if your dog can remain indoors throughout winter, going outside for exercising and answering nature's call only. This will ensure that your dog doesn't get cold while you're out or asleep. Young puppies should not be left outside as they don't have the ability of older dogs to keep themselves warm outside.


If you have an outside dog (such as a sled dog), ensure that it has access to a shelter and bedding inside the shelter. Fresh straw provides a suitable layer of insulation against the cold of the ground for an outside shelter.Be sure to change it regularly though.
An outdoor dog shelter should have a sloped roof, insulation and heating, especially for very cold climate locations.For rainy winters, ensure that the entrance way is protected so that rain cannot get into the shelter.

, In an outdoor kennel situation, consider creating a false floor that is lifted 4 - 6 inches off the ground. Place insulating material such as straw or bubble wrap in this gap, to prevent cold radiating up from the ground. You can also use this gap by placing a hot water bottle beneath it to give under floor heating on a particularly cold day.


On top of the false floor, ensure the dog has plenty of warm bedding. Whilst blankets are good, make sure the dog has deep straw on top of the platform. Provide a minimum of 6 inches of compacted straw, but consider banking it up around the walls, and providing extra loose straw so that the dog can circle around and create a nest to snuggle down into. This will help keep the heat in around the dog's limbs and also reduce drafts.
Remember, if it's not warm enough for you to spend the night in, then the kennel isn't warm enough for your dog.

, The wind chill factor significantly magnifies the intensity of the cold. Always make sure outside dogs are completely protected from the wind. If they are kenneled, perhaps add porch onto the entrance so that wind into the kennel is reduced, Work out which way the prevailing wind tends to blow, and then face the entrance in the opposite direction. This also gives you the opportunity to put insulation around the kennel, especially on the side the prevailing wind strikes, in order to reduce heat loss. To get an idea of the wind chill factor you can look online for relevant meteorological websites sites., Remember the more layers of insulation you add, the cozier the kennel will be. Consider covering the kennel with an old duvet and then throwing a tarpaulin over that, to help beef up the protection.

, Wet and cold are far more dangerous than dry cold. Also check the bedding is warm and dry. A dog lying on soiled bedding will quickly develop sores and infected patches of skin.

"
"
Ensure that the bedding is warm and well placed.,
Provide heating on cold nights.,
Clean and change bedding regularly.,
Use canine clothing options for particular dogs and situations.,
Use booties to protect your dog's paws when walking on snow and salt.",How to Keep Dogs Warm in the Winter4," Bedding is an important part of keeping a dog warm through winter. If your dog sleeps on the ground or somewhere with drafts, place the bed up off the floor. You can do this by putting the dog bed on a low platform, raised a few inches off the ground. The object is to stop heat loss by transmission with the ground.


You can easily improvise a platform with a sheet of hardboard resting on some books or a bricks.
A custom-made bed with cushioned insert, blankets, and old clothing make good, warm bedding.

, This is especially important for old and arthritic dogs. Consider using a heated dog bed or a hot water bottle.Once the dog realizes how nice and snuggly a heated bed feels, most accept it and even look forward to being tucked in at night.Older dogs in particular, stiffen up in the colder weather. Keeping heat in around their joints can greatly aid their comfort. Again, simple things can help, such as placing a thick blanket over the dog once they have settled down for the night.
If your dog is well past the chewing stage in his life, then look for bags of cherry stones which you can microwave and are designed to keep human joints warm. Following the manufacturer's instructions, heat the bag up in the microwave and lay it over the stiffest or most swollen of the dog's joint, then cover him with a blanket, which will give him extra comfort.There are a variety of pet electric blankets or heat mats available, and another type of mat to investigate is a whelping blanket. These are designed to keep young puppies warm and provide a gentle background level of heat which is safe to be lain on for long periods of time. When choosing a heat mat, always carefully read the instructions to see if the pet can lie directly on it without the risk of thermal burns. Some mats designed for veterinary use are not safe to be laid on directly and require that they are covered with a blanket to avoid burns., This will reduce fleas, germs, and mess. This is especially important over the winter, when insects look for any warm places they can find.

, Canine clothing can help to keep your dog warm through winter. It is especially good for small or toy dogs, dogs without long hair (for example, whippets and greyhounds), and old or sick dogs.One of the key signs that your dog may need some clothing is if a dog is shivering, just like a human.Dog jackets, snuggies, and sweaters can be purchased or made (knit, sew, crochet, or quilt) for any sized dog. For wetter winters, you might like to attach a rainproof layer over the top but make sure that it is breathable.
Make sure any dog clothing is dry before use. If the dog goes outside in a wet coat, the wind will cause the water to evaporate and drag the dog's body heat with it, thus making it cold. It is a good idea to have several items of clothing so that you can have some in the wash, some drying, and some ready for wear.
Where possible, remove the clothing when your dog is inside, unless the temperature in the house is very low. If a dog wears clothing all the time it won't feel the benefit when it goes outside.

, Salt serves as an irritant on dog paws and snow is very cold. Booties will keep the paws warm and free from salt irritation. However, unless you've trained your dog to accept booties from puppyhood, this can be a bit of battle with some dogs who won't tolerate wearing them.


If your dog is having difficulty wearing booties, use positive reinforcement training. Put a bootie on one foot, feed a treat, then remove it. Repeat daily and gradually increase the amount of booties until the dog is used to having them put on."

Hide treats around your house for your dog to find.Place treats under the bed, under the couch, in the closet and in all kinds of locations doggie wouldn’t normally look.,
Play tug-of-war.,
Play hide-and-seek with your dog.,
Play fetch.,
Invite dogs over that your dog already knows.,

Teach your dog to sit.",How to Entertain Your Dog on a Rainy Day," Initiate the game by showing doggie where one hidden treat is. Exclaim in an excited voice, “Oh my! A yummy treat for a good doggie!” This will inspire curiosity and excitement in your canine friend.


Place treats in locations where they can be found, but are not immediately obvious upon surveying the space.
Do not forget where you placed the treats. They might attract bugs if left to sit for too long, or they might be found by doggie much later when they are no longer good to eat. If needed, keep a list of where you place each treat and add new items to the list as you place new treats.;
, Tug of war is a classic game you can easily play with your dog. Dogs have a natural urge to pull, bite, and shake things in their mouths.Tug-of-war capitalizes on this tendency and allows you to spend quality time with your pet, even indoors when it rains.


Do not shake anything your dog has in its mouth too vigorously. Doing so could hurt the dog or give it whiplash.
Only play tug of war with soft chew toys of rope or cloth.

, This game work just as it does with small children. Have a partner hold the dog still so that you can run off and hide somewhere around the house. Take a doggie treat with you so that when doggie finds you, you can offer a well-earned reward. After a count of thirty, your partner should set the dog free and encourage it to find you.


The first time you play, your partner should encourage your dog to find you by speaking in a high-pitched whisper “Where’s ?” Your partner should lead the dog through the house looking for you in order to help him or her understand the objective of the game.
After checking several locations and rooms in the house without locating you, have your partner lead the dog to where you are. Administer the doggie treat and offer fulsome praise to your dog for finding you. Then, reset the game and have another go, hiding in a different place.
Alternate places with your partner so that sometimes you hide and sometimes they hide.
This game is great because it gives your pet a chance to exercise its mind and its sense of smell as it seeks you out., If you’re less energetic than your dog, you may opt to let him or her do the work of making playtime fun. Choose a ball, chew toy, or edible rawhide bone and toss it across the room. Your dog will not only get a great workout running to fetch the thrown object, but he or she will have great fun doing it.Your dog might not bring it straight back to you, in which case you’ll want to take the object again from the dog and toss it again.
If you’re worried about your house getting torn up as your dog tears through it to recover the thrown object, try rolling the ball in a fast but straight line down a hallway. This alternative (“Hall Ball”) is equally fun for your doggie.Only play fetch when you have adequate space to do so in. Do not play fetch on slippery linoleum floors where dogs might, in their haste and excitement, end up running into a wall and hurting themselves. Similarly, do not play fetch near stairs or a balcony which is not secure the entire way around at its base.

, When inviting dogs over to play with your dog, think about how they get along together. Some dogs like very physical play with lots of jumping on one another, nipping, and wrestling. Other dogs prefer chasing and gallivanting about, or playing together with a shared chew toy. Invite dogs over who you know are good counterparts for your own dog.

, Do not let them play in or around stairs or balconies which are not totally enclosed at the base. Make sure there are no sharp objects on the floor, or anything which might be ingested by one or another of the dogs in the play date. The space should be neither cramped nor excessively spacious. It is important that the dogs have enough space to run around and work off some energy, but you should be able to get to them quickly if a kerfuffle erupts., Encourage each owner to bring a variety of dog costumes. Have everyone dress their dogs up secretly, then bring them all out at the same time for a big reveal. Dog costumes and clothing are readily available at pet stores and online. You could also have contests for dogs of similar sizes like high-jump or speed trials.


To test a dog’s high jump, hold a treat above his or her head and encourage the dog to jump for it. Repeat with all dogs. Whichever dog jumps highest wins.
If you have a spacious basement, have one owner hold a given dog. Place a dogie treat 15 to 20 feet ahead of the dog and start a stopwatch when the owner releases it. Repeat with all dogs from the same starting position and with the treat replaced after each run in the same place. Whichever dog gets the treat fastest wins. Taking turns, you can do this activity several times. If your dog or another becomes winded, take a break.

, Breaks are important because different dogs have different levels of stamina, and one dog might attempt to continue chasing, playing, and wrestling with another even after the other is no longer willing to do so. When that happens, tempers flare and fun can turn into irritation and conflict among the dogs.

, Tell your guests a funny story, and invite them to share a similar experience. For instance, maybe you could tell a story about how you cut your finger so badly that the pain made you put the band aid on the wrong hand. If you don’t like telling stories or engaging in conversation, bust out a game. You can play videogames, card games, or table top games with the other dog owners. Monopoly, Scrabble, and Jenga are all fun games appropriate for multiple players.


Offer little snacks like cheese and crackers, garlic and pimento-stuffed olives, and hummus with pita bread.
Even though you’re schmoozing with the other dog owners, supervise the play date carefully.Always stay within sight of your dog. Do not let the dogs wander out of range where they might get into mischief. If you have baby gates (collapsible barriers used to block babies from certain parts of a house) you can use them effectively to keep the dogs in a controlled, central area where they can be easily monitored.

, Dogs respond well to shows which are shot low to the ground, and shows which depict animals. Channels like Animal Planet and National Geographic are good options. If there is nothing good to watch, grab your camera to take videos of your pet and let your pet watch the video. This will be of great entertainment value for him or her.


Ensure the refresh rate of your TV is over 75 hertz.This is important because if the refresh rate is lower than that, the number of frames on the TV will be too low for the dog to identify as a moving image.
Ensure your dog can see the screen. Dogs need the TV to be at their eye level, which is lower than that of humans.Letting your dog sit on the couch or a comfy chair with you is the best way to ensure your dog has a good seat from which to see the action.

, Sit your dog next to you on the couch or bed. Using a clean brush, brush your dog gently, starting at the top of his or her head. To brush your dog’s ears, place your hand between the dog’s ear and the comb so that the fur of the ears pokes up from between your fingers.Use the same technique when brushing your dog’s chest. Roll them over on their back to get better access to the chest and belly fur. Always pull your brush with the grain of your pet’s fur. Move slowly to ensure you don’t make any sudden movement which might hurt your dog.

, Dogs should be bathed about once a month on average. If your dog is small you could plop it in the sink; if it’s larger, you’ll need to get it in the tub. Brush your dog before a bath, as matted fur tends to retain more water than smooth, well-brushed fur. Use lukewarm water when bathing since dogs have more sensitive skin than we do. Work a handful of dog shampoo into your dog’s coat, being careful not to get any in his or her eyes. Rinse the shampoo off. A detachable shower head is a useful tool to have during the rinse.


When you’re finished, rinse your dog off and let them shake off a bit inside the tub or sink. Give them a gentle pat down with a towel, then let them air dry the rest of the way.
Don’t bathe too often; doing so could remove the natural oils of your dog’s skin, making it more likely to develop dandruff and matted fur., Your dog has a unique personality. Let it shine by putting him or her in an appropriate outfit.If your dog is a tough guy, for instance, always barking at people he doesn’t know, give him a doggie-sized leather jacket and spiked collar. If your dog likes reading with you in bed, dress her up so bring out her inner librarian -- think horn-rimmed glasses and a fluffy sweater. Your dog will look adorable and enjoy shaking up its daily routine.


Don’t forget to take pictures and post them to social media so everyone can see what an adorable doggie you have.

, Ensure your dog wears a rain slicker and little boots when going out in the rain. If it is cold as well as damp, have your doggie wear a warming jacket beneath his or her raincoat. Thus clothed, your dog will stay warm and dry despite the yucky weather. This will also save you time later when otherwise you’d have to wash and dry your dog.


If you don’t have a doggie raincoat, keep your dog relatively close to you and try to keep the umbrella over it.

, Dog strollers are like baby carriages for your dog.If you have a good dog stroller, it will have a waterproof collapsible top which you can pull down over your dog. Pull it down when going out into the rain. There should be a transparent or nylon mesh front out of which the dog can see everything around it. Using the dog stroller in nasty weather is a good way let your dog go out into the world without getting soaked.


Ensure you get a stroller which will accommodate your dog. Check the size of the stroller before purchasing. If possible, talk to a pet store employee about a stroller which would be a good choice for your dog, read reviews online, and try some out in the store to find one you like.

, Just like the outdoors, shopping centers offer a multitude of sights, sounds, and smells.


Do not bring your pet into a large shopping center if they are still a puppy and not yet potty-trained.

, Doga is the doggie counterpart of yoga. Doga classes are offered in most big cities. Bring a yoga mat, your dog, and your workout or yoga outfit. Before beginning the class, get limber by stretching out, rolling your shoulders and neck, and touching your toes. By helping your dog stretch and get into a variety of contorted poses, you will get your daily dose of exercise as well. Use the doga class to bond and grow closer to your dog as you learn and move together., Take your dog to the park. Besides the many new and wonderful smells your doggie can encounter, the park offers new encounter for not just your dog, but potentially for you as well. Many dog parks are even indoors, so you can go no matter the weather.Find a park near you and keep your dog entertained even when its raining. Check out this list of over 5,300 dog-friendly hiking trails at http://www.bringfido.com/attraction/trails/.If the weather permits, your pet may want to go out
Check the park's policy about pets before visiting. You will probably need to keep your dog leashed at all times and collect and poo he or she makes.

, When a dog plays shy, it will cover its face with one or both paws. Inspire the dog to cover its face my placing a sticky note or band-aid on the place between its eyes. Immediately after placing it there, say “Play shy!” Continue encouraging your dog to play shy with the verbal command until it brings its paw up to remove the object on its face. When it does bring its paw up to its face, hold it there for a few second, then say “Good boy/girl!” Reward the dog with a treat.


Continue training this way for some time, then stop using the sticky note or band aid, and the dog should be able to play shy with simply the verbal command to do so.

, Kneel down on your dog’s level. Hold a treat close to their nose with your palm up, but don’t let the dog eat it. Say “Roll over!” Push your dog’s body down (if it knows how to lie down already, use this trick to get it into the correct position). Turn the dog’s nose toward its shoulder by bringing the treat in the direction of the shoulder. From the shoulder, continue to move the treat over the center of it back. The dog will become unbalanced and flop over onto its back. Reward your doggie with a yummy treat and fulsome praise.Repeat the move and command until the dog can perform the maneuver with your command alone and none of the physical assistance provided during training.

, Get on your dog’s level. Hold a treat close to his or her nose and say “Sit.” Bring the treat up in a vertical motion. As your dog's head comes up, his or her butt will go down. When their butt hits the ground, release the treat and give doggie a pat on the head. Repeat a three to four times a day for several more days. Remember to issue the command “sit” before every trick.

Avoid chocolate and other candy.,
Put your dog in a safe place, either a separate room or his crate, when the trick-or-treaters are coming by.,
Don’t leave your dog around kids without supervision.,
Be careful about placement of electrical cords for decorations.,
Don’t leave candles unattended.,
Make sure that your dog’s costume is the right fit.,
Watch out when the door is open.,
Walk your dog before the festivities begin – all those costumes can be scary.

,
If the noise is bothering him, try adding background sounds (radio, TV) to distract him from the neighborhood hubbub.

,
Be careful when out walking your dog after Halloween – loose candy can be found and he may grab a big piece if he sees it before you do.

,
Think twice about taking him out with your family to trick or treat.,
Tell kids the dangers of the treats and to not feed the dog.

,
Be firm.,
If you take your dog with you, do not take him up to a stranger’s door – the resident dog may not take kindly to that and it could end up being a bummer.,
Do not leave your dog outside.,
It may seem like a lot, but the truth is that Halloween is a fun time for parents and kids and can easily be fun for dogs too.",How to Keep Your Dog Safe on Halloween," Make sure to keep any candy that you are going to hand out safely hidden from your dog. Notify kids in the house to put their candy bags away. Chocolate is a big no-no for dogs as it contains theobromine, which their bodies cannot properly digest. The darker the chocolate, the worse it can be. Small amounts are typically not lethal, so if he does snag a bite, don’t freak out. But also, don’t let it happen.;
, You should not let him be at the door to greet the kids. Costumes, commotion, and loud noises will stress him out and can cause problems ranging from stress to aggression.

, The erratic movements and loud, startling noises can really upset him. Add in a scary costume and you have a formula for disaster.

, If your puppy or dog chews on these, trouble will follow. Arrange them for safety and use a bitter apple spray on the cord to keep pets at bay.

, Carved pumpkins look great with a candle burning inside them, but they can be tipped over. They can also be investigated by curious pets which can lead to burns or worse.

, Don’t put him in a costume that is too small or tight. Also check for loose ends that could be chewed on and swallowed or cause other problems. If your dog hates having the costume on be a friend to him and take the costume off.

, If your dog is not secured in another room or in his crate, then he might bolt out the door. With all the activity outside it may be even harder to get him back in. If you need to, use a gate in your doorway if you have strong/large dogs.

,,,, There’s a lot of costumes and commotion which can put any dog on edge. He might be happier at home.

,, Don’t let anybody who wants to greet your dog just to be polite. Be willing to say “no thanks” if your dog is feeling anxious or if the other person (perhaps an excited, sugar filled child) is approaching inappropriately.

, Someone should wait at the end of the driveway with the dog.

, There are plenty of rumors that dogs are taunted and teased, that gates are opened, and that candy is tossed in yards. It’s unlikely that lots of kids are running around causing harm to dogs on Halloween night, but the commotion is enough to unnerve your dog and it is conceivable that a youngster might toss a treat toward your dog with the best of intentions but bad results.

, Many dogs enjoy being the center of attention and will tolerate wearing a costume (which we get a huge kick out of!) to do so. Keep an eye out for the dangers of candy, keep your dog secure in your house, and be ready to ward off over excited kids and all will be well. Happy Halloween.

Train your dog how to drop, let go and stay away from objects.,
Reward compliance with the command with treats.,
Avoid exciting her attention.,
Arrange fragile ornaments securely and out of the way.,
If your dog likes to chew paper, place wrapped gifts around the tree just before it's time to give them.,
For yard decorations, try staking the wire frames of animal and other display items into the ground with ordinary tent stakes.,
Choose decorations with care.,
Last but not least, relax and enjoy the holidays.",How to Keep Your Dog Safe Around Christmas Decorations," Use a common command aimed at getting your dog to stop investigating items (get away from them) and another one to drop items. This command can be used for item your dog picks up or plays with, including Christmas decorations.;
, Positive reinforcement is an important part of showing your dog that she has done the right thing.


Whenever your dog looks away, leaves the area of the decorations or drops an ornament, reward her.

, Part of the problem may be your own excitement to show off shiny decorations, waving them around and tossing the tinsel about when the dog is in the room. Ways to deal with this include:


Avoid decorating the tree or house when she is present. Put her in another room or outside until you've finished moving the decorations around. That way, there is less motion to catch her eye.
Don't show her the objects, especially not in a playful or excited way. She may interpret this as an invitation to play with them.
Play with your dog anywhere but in the decorated room. When in this room, make it clear that it's time for quiet, good behavior. Never play with your dog around the Christmas tree.
Until your dog is fully trained around the decorations, crate or gate her in a room that is undecorated.

, Accidents happen when people and pets bump the tree and any other decorative displays. Check that all fragile objects have been securely attached or are out of reach. For glass ornaments, either keep them at the top and center of the Christmas tree, well tethered, or place them on a safe place such as a mantelpiece or as a centerpiece on the dining table.

, Prevent access to the room by the dog the night/day before by keeping the door closed. Let other family members know to keep the room closed off.


Encouraging your dog to open her own gift may be asking for trouble if she interprets this as a cue to open more gifts. Use training commands to warn her off, or have her open her gift in a separate place so that she cannot see that there are other wrapped gifts.

, This will make them difficult for your dog to pull out.

, If your dog seems keen on chewing the tree lights, try using plastic Christmas lights, instead of glass. Other things to be careful about include:


Do not leave scented votives, pine cones, or paper decorations on coffee tables or anywhere else within dog's reach.

, If you have a dog, she is part of the family and you're likely to want to include her in part of the day's celebrations. Keep an eye on her, be firm if she shows any desire to be disruptive and reward her with suitable treats for good behavior. Keeping calm will go a long way to ensuring that she remains so too.

Train your dog to behave around visitors.,
Keep food out of your dog’s reach.,
Ask guests not to feed your dog.,
Keep track of alcoholic beverages.,
Provide your dog a safe space.,
Occupy your dog with safe, fun holiday treats.",How to Survive the Holidays with Your Dog1," If you plan to host a party with your dog, there a few important commands your dog should know. Fortunately, these commands are easy to teach your dog, and provide the basis of a solid training regimen. In particular, if your dog has not been trained to “sit”, “stay”, and “get down”, begin training them to do so immediately.Many of the necessary behaviors dogs should know can be learned in a few weeks. If you are unable to train your dog, contact local kennels and other pet organizations to see if they offer basic obedience classes. Your vet can likely recommend a few good options.;
, You likely try to keep this rule year round, but it may prove more challenging during the holidays. The main things to remember include keeping any gifts that have food in them off of the floor, and remembering to clean up after serving snacks and meals.Note that social gatherings in your home will increase the risk that your dog may try to get some human food, either by scoring something left within reach or begging.
In particular, ask guests not to leave food on any low-lying surfaces, such as coffee tables or end tables.

, You may be pretty diligent about not feeding your dog any table scraps. However, with more people around during the holidays, there are plenty more people your dog can beg for that ham bone.If you know a guest might want to give Shia LaBeouf a treat, provide a dog treat for them and direct them about how to do so. You can even provide a piece of the boneless, well-cooked meat to your dog. Never provide anything with any bones.

, Unattended drinks are another intriguing item that may get the best of your dog’s curiosity. Not only do they pose considerable risk to your dog, they are also more likely to be set down and forgotten than other potentially dangerous items., Many dogs may wish to retreat when faced with the overwhelming stimulation of a human gathering. Make sure they have somewhere they can go. Ideally, designate a certain room in your home off limits to visitors, and leave several items your dog favors, such as his bed and a new toy, in the room., Let’s face it, Woofrow Wilson deserves some presents this year too. Stick to safe, healthy options, such as high quality chew toys and treats that are nutritious and easily digestible.This is especially helpful if you plan to host a large sit-down meal. Providing your dog with a feast all their own can keep them away from the table.

Play games with treats.,
Teach your dog hand signal commands.,
Engage with your dog.",How to Encourage Your Senior Dog to Play1," One way to encourage your senior dog to play is by incorporating treats into the game. Most dogs are motivated by food and will happily play food related games. Some of the easiest and most stimulating games that you can play with older dogs include foraging for food. These games will not only encourage your older dog to get up and moving, but they will also stimulate their brains allowing them to problem solve. These are also typically low energy games that are even appropriate for older dogs with mobility issues. Try out the following food-related games:Food hunt: Simply scatter dry food across the floor or yard and allow your dog to use their nose to find and eat the food. This activity will stimulate your dog and they will happily search for food.
Three Cup Monte: Cut a small hole into the bottom of three empty yogurt cups and place them top down on the ground. Place a small treat under one of the cups and then have your dog sniff the cups until they find the treat. You can also try rearranging the order of the cups once the treat has been hidden to make it harder for your dog. Always allow your dog to have the treat, even if they don’t initially choose the correct cup.;
, As your dog ages, it may lose its hearing and be unable to follow simple commands, such as sit and stay. One way to stimulate your senior dog is by spending time teaching them hand signal commands. Dogs thoroughly enjoy spending quality time with their human and training can actually feel like a game to many dogs. Use food-based rewards to teach your dog hand signals.For example, teach your dog to sit using a hand signal. Simply place a treat in your hand, stretch your arm out in front of you (palm facing up) and then move your arm downwards to the side of your leg.
At first you may need to give the signal and physically adjust your dog into a sitting position.
Once sitting, give the dog a treat. Repeat this until the dog learns the signal command and no longer needs to be adjusted.
You can teach other hand signals either by following standard dog obedience commands or by following American Sign Language commands.

, One way to encourage your dog to play and be active is to actively engage with your dog on a regular basis. Some aging dogs will slow down and can even appear depressed. If you want to help lengthen your dog’s life you need to continue to play with them. Get down on the floor and enthusiastically play with your dog. If you give energy and time to your senior dog, they will be encouraged to play and interact with you."

Secure your Christmas tree.,
Keep other holiday plants away from your dog.,
Don’t leave flames unattended.,
Make sure that lights and ornaments are out of your dog’s reach.,
Watch out for unexpected risks.,
Train your dog the command to leave something alone.",How to Survive the Holidays with Your Dog2," As pretty as your ornamented and light-wrapped indoor tree may be, it can also pose a consider threat to your dog. Namely, the tree may liable to fall if your dog bumps into it. To prevent this, use strong string or wire to secure the tree in a stable vertical position.Meanwhile, use a base that is not only sturdy but that prevents Virginia Woof from drinking the water you provide the tree. Standing water can cause your dog to become ill.
Sweep beneath the tree whenever you notice pine needles have collected. They can make your dog sick too.

, Other popular holiday plants, including Mistletoe & Holly, can cause significant health issues if ingested. Unfortunately, their aroma may intrigue your dog enough to snack on them. If you’re using these plants, make sure they are secured in places outside of your dog’s reach.Consider decorating with silk or plastic artificial plants. While these can also pose a minimal threat to your dog, your dog is much less likely to try to eat them.

, It’s important to be especially aware of fire risks during the holidays. This means never leaving any source of fire unattended, regardless of the context.For example, while a candle on a table may seem safe, Joni Muttchell may bump the table and tip it over.

, Make sure any holiday string lights are out of reach of your dog. Further, avoid hanging ornaments where your dog can reach them, unless absolutely sure that they don’t pose a risk. Note that ornaments made of dried play doh are especially dangerous, as your dog may attempt to eat them.Many ornaments are fragile or fragrant. Even if Dumbledog doesn’t try to eat one, they make knock it off the tree, causing decorations to shatter on the floor.

, There are few things that are especially dangerous to your dog that may surprise you. In particular, the liquid within snow-globes is extremely toxic. Unfortunately, it also smells enticing enough for a dog to eat. If you decorate with snow globes this year, make sure they’re safely and securely located somewhere they won’t be broken.Similarly, salt and other materials used to melt ice can be extremely dangerous - and intriguing - to your dog as well. If these products are used on your property, make sure your dog is not able to eat any of them.

, Good training provides the foundation of a fun, healthy relationship with your dog. During the holidays, there is one command in particular that can help you keep your dog safe. Namely, be sure your dog understands and responds to the command to “drop” or “leave” something alone.These commands are most effective when the dog is touching something they shouldn’t be. Further, they are best learned in everyday situations. Whenever you dog is getting into something they shouldn’t, immediately command them to “leave it!” in a loud, clear voice.
When the dog turns away from the item, immediately give them praise and provide a treat or a toy instead. This will help teach them that listening to your command will be rewarded.

Bring your dog along.,
Pack the necessary supplies.,
Leave your pet with people you trust.",How to Survive the Holidays with Your Dog3," If you’re traveling for the holidays and it is safe for your dog to travel, there are several steps you can take to ensure the trip goes smoothly. Foremost, ensure that any accommodations will be able to host your dog. If visiting friends or family, contact hosts ahead of time to make sure your dog will be welcome in their home.Depending on your dog, significant travel may present a challenge. Talk to your vet about any concerns you have about traveling, especially for long periods of time.
Whatever your chosen method of travel, use a safe, comfortable carrier for your dog.
While you may be able to bring some dogs onto the plane with you, some airliners require you to transport larger dogs in the cargo area of the plane. This will frighten some dogs significantly.

, Aside from the proper traveling equipment such as a sturdy crate or carrier, you should also bring extra dog food and a few extra toys and treats. Most importantly, however, make sure to bring any medication your dog is taking, as well as a copy of their medical history in case you need to visit a vet while traveling.Do not assumed you will be able to get the type of food your dog likes wherever you go.

, If you determine that it is not appropriate to bring your dog, make sure you’re leaving them with someone who will care for them intently. Either arrange for your dog to stay with a friend who has dog handling experience, or board your dog at a trusted kennel.Your vet can recommend reliable places to board your dog.
If you’re not boarding your dog at a professional facility, have whomever will be caring for your dog meets them beforehand. Make sure that both the person and the dog are comfortable with one another.

Select softer toys.,
Choose toys that accommodate the weakened senses of older dogs.,
Modify the games you play with your dog.",How to Encourage Your Senior Dog to Play2," In order to encourage your dog to continue to play as it ages, you may need to select softer toys made specifically for senior dogs. Older dogs often have weakened muscles and joints, sensitive teeth and jaws, as well as reduced olfactory sensors. As a result, it is important to select toys that can accommodate their aging bodies. There are a variety of options for senior dog toys.For example, senior Kongs are made from a softer rubber and are gentle on the teeth and jaws of senior dogs.
Planet Dog also has a complete line of toys, called Old Soul, designed specifically for older dogs.
Try and find these types of toys while shopping at your local pet supply store.

, Older dogs often have weakened vision and olfactory sensors. As a result you should choose toys that are easier for your senior dog to see and smell. For instance, toys with bright and contrasting colours will allow your dog to see the toy more clearly. Similarly, you can select toys that have a stronger scent to help encourage older dogs to play., A senior dog, although interested in playing, will not be able to play with the same intensity that it did when it was younger. In order to continue to play with your dog as they age, you should modify the games so that they are suitable to an older, less mobile dog. You can also allow your dog to continue to play with some of their favourite toys, but in a modified way.For example, if your dog enjoys to play tug-of-war you can still play this game, just don’t pull as hard on the toy.
Alternatively, if your dog likes to play fetch, try throwing the ball a shorter distance and only throw it five times instead of twenty.
Regardless of the activity, always monitor your dog’s energy level. If they begin to slow down and pant excessively while playing, it is probably a good idea to take a break.

"

Take your dog swimming.,
Go on interesting walks.,
Play on a carpeted surface.",How to Encourage Your Senior Dog to Play3," Swimming is another activity that is excellent for senior dogs because it is low-impact and easy on the joints. Providing your dog with an opportunity to swim will help them maintain their cardiovascular health, stimulate muscle development, and is a fun activity. If you have a pool let your senior dog swim daily.Alternatively, you can take your dog to a pond, river or any local body of water.
Monitor your dog and make sure they stop swimming once they are tired.

, Another way to play with your dog is by taking them outside to allow them to get exercise. You may find that your senior dog has mobility issues and finds it difficult to go for walks. You should not stop providing your dog with opportunities to exercise, but instead, modify the type of exercise they get. For instance, take them for shorter and more interesting walks. This will provide them with gentle physical exercise and will stimulate their senses.Switch up your walking route. Don’t take your dog for the same walk up the street every day. The smells will become repetitive and less stimulating to your dog over time.
Instead, try taking your dog on unique and interesting walks. This will help encourage them to remain active as they age.
Take your dog for two shorter walks each day, instead of one long walk. This is easier on aging joints.

, When you are playing with an older dog, make sure that you use a carpeted surface. This will provide your dog with more traction and your dog will be less likely to slip or fall while playing. It is important to remember that your dog will likely do anything to please you. This includes overexertion. In order to encourage your dog to play as they age, make sure that you provide them with a safe environment. A carpeted surface can encourage your dog to continue to play even into old age."

Examine the toys for dangerous components.,
Read the toy label.,
Purchase toys that are large enough for your dog.,
Use caution when buying stuffed toys.,
Select a safe version of rawhide bones.,
Select indestructible toys.,
Purchase toys that will keep your dog busy.,
Buy chew toys for your dog.,
Choose interactive dog toys.,
Pick toys based on your dog’s life stage.",How to Buy Dog Toys," Not all toys are safe for your dog. Toys with removable parts (e.g., string, ribbons, rubber bands), can pose health hazards—these small parts could cause your dog to choke or develop an intestinal obstruction if he swallows them.Both of these scenarios would require veterinary care.


Plastic eyes on a stuffed animal can also be hazardous.
Your dog may like toys with squeakers or bells because of the sound they make. However, these internal components could be harmful if swallowed.Closely supervise your dog if he plays with these types of toys to ensure he does not swallow the noise-making components.;
, Although a dog toy make look harmless, it may contain material that could be toxic to your dog. For example, some dog toys may be coated with toxic heavy metals (e.g., cadmium, lead, chromium).Other toys may be coated with fire retardants or stain guards that contain such toxic ingredients as formaldehyde.Be mindful that the product packaging may not contain information about what the toy is made of. Often, the information is more for advertising, and could thus leave out important wording about the toy’s safety.Consider visiting the toy manufacturer’s website to learn more about how they make their dog toys.If the label does not provide much information, you can smell the toy—a strong scent may be indicative of residual chemicals from the manufacturing process. In addition, bright-dyed fabrics could contain toxic materials.In toys containing lead, the lead can come off in your dog’s mouth when the toy is partially chewed on and becomes wet with his saliva., This is especially important for larger dogs. Toys that are too small can be easily swallowed, and thus become a choking or obstruction hazard.Ideally, your dog should not be able to fit the entire toy in his mouth.

, Dogs love stuffed toys. However, the filling in a stuffed toy can be harmful to your dog’s digestive system if he swallows it.Particularly dangerous fillings include nutshells and polystyrene beads.Stuffed dog toys labeled as safe for children under three years of age are not likely to have dangerous fillings.Monitor your dog closely if he plays with stuffed toys. Replace the toys when you notice a torn seam or other damage that would provide easy access to the filling., Dogs enjoy chewing on rawhide bones.Not only would a rawhide bone keep your dog busy,but it would also strengthen his jaw bones and help maintain his dental hygiene. However, rawhide bones, especially those made of one large sheet of rawhide that is rolled and knotted on each end,can be choking hazards.Look for pressed rawhide bones. When chewed on and softened, pressed rawhide bones will break into small pieces that will be safe and easy for your dog to swallow., Dogs tend to see toys as wolves see prey, and thus like toys that taste like food, make a noise, and/or can be torn apart.Therefore, it is important to choose very durable toys. Indestructible toys are commonly made of hard nylon or hard rubber.Kong toys are very durable.
Over time, even the indestructible toys can develop sharp or rough edges that could injure your dog.Replace the toys when you see these signs of wear and tear.
Rope toys containing hard nylon or rubber are durable, but can unravel over time.Replace the rope if it is no longer intact.

, Whether large or small, young or old, your dog will need toys that will distract him for extended periods of time. Food cubes can keep your dog easily entertained.Small bits of food easily fit in the cube, but do not easily fall back out—there is a maze inside the cube, so your dog will have to roll it around to get the food out.Treat balls are similar to food cubes, but the food comes out more easily. Treats balls would be good for your dog if he likes quick rewards without doing much work.Kong toys are another type of ‘entertainment’ toy. Not only can you hide treats inside of it, but you can also use it as a fetching toy., Your dog will probably always want something to chew on. Technically, though, your dog is not chewing the toy—rather, he is trying to tear and shear the toy with his premolars and molars (‘grinder teeth’), as if the toy was prey.Durable toys made of hard nylon or hard rubber make great chew toys, since your dog will not easily be able to tear them apart.


Your dog’s premolars and molars are in the back of his mouth. He may end up swallowing a small chew toy in his efforts to tear it apart, which could pose a choke hazard. Make sure the chew toy is large enough that he cannot fit all of it in the back of his mouth.Dental chew toys will help keep your dog’s teeth clean. Choose name-brand dental chew toys that are made of soft material and will soften and dissolve when in contact with your dog’s saliva., As much as your dog loves to play with his toys, remember that toys are not are not substitutes for human interaction.In fact, your dog will probably be more interested in his toys if you play with him.Examples of interactive toys include rope toys and balls.


Even if a toy does not seem particularly interactive, you can hide it and encourage your dog to find it. Playing ‘hide and seek’ with your dog is a great way to interact with him.Rope toys are not good interactive toys for aggressive dogs. These toys can encourage rough and aggressive play., Your dog’s toy needs and preferences will change as he progresses through the different life stages (puppy, adult, senior). For example, a teething puppy would need a durable chew toy, but an older dog may do fine with a soft toy that he could mouth on without using his teeth.A puppy or young adult dog that’s full of energy would need toys that would keep him active (e.g., rope toy), but an older dog may prefer toys that he can easily play with when lying in one place.Dogs tend to play less as they age."
"
Make paths for your dog to move in.,
Shovel snow often.,
Drive your dog to clearer areas.,
Prevent your dog from pulling on the lead.",How to Help Your Dog Move in the Snow1," If your dog typically goes out in your yard for exercise and to relieve itself, this is a great place to start. Shovel or use a snow blower to clear paths through the snow for your pup to walk through. Take care to avoid creating piles of snow high enough that your pup is in danger, if the snow collapses onto the path., You can make little paths that lead to your dog's favorite spot in the yard or at least from your door to a cleared area. This will make it easier and safer for you and your dog to walk in the snow. If you keep the areas around your doors, driveway, and sidewalk clear by shoveling after each new snowfall, walking your dog will be much easier., If your neighborhood, street, or yard are too snowy for your pup to walk safely, look for less snowy walk locations. Typically, parks and schools are cleared by the city, so you’ll be able to walk further with less obstruction for your pup. If you are able to drive your pet, take a train, or bus to an area with less snow, this could be your best option for a comfortable walk., Dogs should always be trained against this behavior, but it can be especially precarious in the snow. If your pup starts pulling on the lead, stop immediately, and try to establish both solid footing and control of the dog. Stay in one place until your pup stops pulling, and continue to stop each time it starts pulling."

Feed them more calories.,
Adjust their food intake and schedule.,
Give your dog fish oil supplements.,
Provide them constant access to clean water.,
Protect your dog from antifreeze poisoning.,
Put out sleeping pads for your dogs.,
Keep dogs inside as much as possible.,
Provide adequate shelter if your dog does need to be left outside.",How to Care for Your Dog in the Winter1," If your dog is a worker or goes outside a lot, they’ll be burning even more calories than normal to just stay warm. Any dog, even a house dog who goes outside a few times a day to do their business, will be using up slightly more calories simply regulating their body temperatures. To compensate for this, it’s a good idea to increase your dog’s caloric intake according to their increased expenditure of energy in the winter.The amount of extra calories will depend on your dog’s size, coat, age, activity level, and outdoor exposure as well as the severity of the climate. Most dogs will not require more than a 10% bump in their caloric intake, but outdoor working dogs could require nearly double the calories. Consult with your vet to get their winter diet recommendations for your pet.
While dogs do generally need more calories in the winter, they (like us) also have a greater tendency to overeat during the holiday season. If your dog starts to put on weight, go back to their normal diet and consult with your vet.;
, Besides generally needing more calories, dogs benefit from a more consistent caloric intake during the winter. The easiest way to add extra calories is to add a bit more food to your pet’s daily serving size. If you usually feed your dog once a day, consider switching to twice a day and increasing their overall daily serving so that your dog has a steadier caloric intake.


If your dog needs to significantly boost their calories, consider swapping their normal dog food for a higher-calorie formula. When switching foods, always be sure to monitor your dog to ensure that it is not causing any digestive issues. Watch for telling symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea.
It's not necessary to feed dogs hot food or warm water to help them stay warm. This can mess with digestion and upset your dog's stomach. It’s better to keep the dog's diet relatively stable.

, Fish oils offer natural lubricants that can benefit your dog during cold months. Adding more Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids to your dog’s diet in the winter can help them stave off any potential weather-related irritations to their skin and paws.It can also be beneficial to older dogs in alleviating arthritis pain that’s exacerbated by cold conditions.

, We often forget that hydration is just as critical in the winter months as it is during the summer. Be sure that your pooch always has a dish of fresh water close at hand, even at night.If you have your dog outside, be sure to regularly check their water to make sure it isn’t frozen.

, We use antifreeze a lot in the winter, a substance that’s tasty but toxic to our pets. Be sure to keep it out of the reach of your dog on a high shelf or in a securely locked cupboard. Always clean up any spills immediately., If you have hardwood or tile floors, it can get awfully cold at night during the wintertime. Dogs, like you, enjoy being snug and cozy. When they struggle to find a warm spot, they can lose sleep or even disrupt yours with their restlessness. Buy some sleeping cushions or pads for your dog, or put out a couple old blankets for the dog to nest in., If the temperature drops below freezing, dogs should be inside far more than they’re out. In general, you don't want to leave dogs out for longer than you'd stay out in your winter coat. Even long-haired dogs can be susceptible to frostbite and hypothermia.


If your dog usually sleeps outside, try letting them sleep inside in a designated area (such as the garage, kitchen, or entryway) when it drops below freezing temperature in the winter.

, High winds and cold temperatures can be deadly for outdoor dogs. It's absolutely essential that you provide them with a dog house and wind-breaks.If you don’t already have one, buy or build a dog house. Keep your dog warmer by raising the floor of the dog house off the ground with raised flooring or palettes. Cover the bottom with thick, dry bedding (like blankets and straw) for your dog to nest in.
You can also consider purchasing a heated dog house for your pet. However, do not try DIY alternatives like space heaters or electric blankets since these can pose serious fire risks.

Dress your dog for the weather.,
Use dog shoes.,
Dry your dog after the walk.,
Trim your dog’s nails.",How to Help Your Dog Move in the Snow2," Depending on the depth of the snow and the temperature, you should make sure your dog is wearing a sweater or water wicking coat to keep them warm. Some pet clothing made specifically with weather protection in mind will include information about the lowest recommended temperatures for wear. As always, ask your veterinarian for suggestions, if you’re worried your pup isn’t warm enough on their walk.Pay attention to breed specific or dog specific needs. If your pup is panting or looks overheated when wearing a sweater or coat, you may want to leave the coat off for your next outing.

, Like humans, dogs loose most of their warmth through their extremities, so keeping dog feet and legs warm is essential to equalize their body temperature during walks in the snow. Dog shoes are the easiest way to keep your pup's paws warm. Most dog shoes made for cold weather are also waterproof and add traction to keep your dog safer.


With your dog standing, lift one foot and place it in a shoe. To ensure your pup puts its full weight into the shoe, lift the opposite leg once the shoed foot is in place. Then, adjust any straps or closures as necessary.
You can find shoes for dogs at most pet stores and online. If you don't see any in your local pet store, ask an employee whether or not they stock this item., Have towels by the door and dry off your pup as soon as you get home. Water will trap moisture onto your pet's coat and will keep its body temperature too low. Take a few moments to towel or blow dry your dog when you return home from your walk., This improves traction, as your dog’s foot is able to flatten out completely on the ground. By staying up right, your pup will remain drier and warmer. Trim nails using children’s nail clippers or those specifically crafted for pets, but take care as a large vein runs through dog nails. Known as the quick, this vein can cause serious bleeding when damaged.


Trim your dog's nails as often as necessary to prevent them from reaching the ground or otherwise impeding your dog's movement.
If your dog has lightly colored nails, you’ll be able to see the quick. It’s the darker pink colored part of the nail.
If your dog has darkly colored nails, you’ll need to look for the quick as you clip. Remove a small amount of nail. Then, look at the newly exposed end. If you see a gray area in the nail, this is the quick, and you should stop clipping."

Add a weighted backpack.,
Walk only as long as your dog seems interested.,
Avoid walking too far from home.,
Burn your pup's energy in other ways.",How to Help Your Dog Move in the Snow3," The additional weight will require your pup to expend more effort to walk a shorter distance, so they’ll be burning off more energy while walking closer to home. That way, you won’t need to venture too far in the cold, and your pup will still burn off all that pent up energy., If your dog has access to an area for waste relief, they don’t need to go for lengthy walks, so don’t push them to keep walking in the snow if they seem uninterested. Instead, take them outside to relieve themselves and for short walks, if they seem to have excess energy., Know your limits. You don't want to find yourself exhausted and stranded blocks from home and still have to trudge through the snow on the way back. Instead, do laps around your block or even your house. It will get your pup plenty of exercises, and ensure you're close to home if you need to warm up., Walking is a great way to relax and tire a pup, especially if your dog has a lot of extra energy, but if there’s snow on the ground, try some different energy burning games. For instance, have a friend play keep away with you and your pup. Stand on two sides of your pup and toss a Frisbee, ball, or another toy back and forth, letting your pup try to snatch the object from you. If you don't have a friend handy, you can play tug of war with your dog, or give it a puzzle toy to play with."

Don’t leave your house dog unattended outdoors.,
Go on shorter walks.,
Avoid frozen water.,
Dress small and short-haired dogs in sweaters or jackets.,
Fit your dog with booties.,
Wear lights and/or reflective gear.,
Keep a towel by the door.,
Play inside, instead of going out.",How to Care for Your Dog in the Winter2," It’s critical to be aware of your dog’s tolerance for cold temperatures. While most dogs are naturally equipped to deal with cold conditions, many aren’t used to them and may struggle to cope. Especially if your canine companion is usually an indoor dog, always keep a close eye on them when they’re out in cold weather.Be on the lookout for symptoms of any potential problems, especially hypothermia. If your dog begins to shiver or whine, look like they’re weakening or slowing down significantly, take them indoors immediately.Screen your dog for frostbite by watching for early symptoms, including waxy-looking skin and blisters., Your pet will still need daily exercise, but if your dog is sensitive to cold temps, make the walks relatively short to keep the dog as warm and healthy as possible.

, Lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams can be very hazardous to your pet and you during the winter. Breaking through the ice can easily lead to drowning or hypothermia. It’s often difficult to tell if the ice covering a body of water is thick enough to support your dog’s weight, so it’s best to steer clear of it altogether., Very small dogs, like Chihuahuas, and short-coated dogs, like Boxers, are often much colder during the winter months, and may need a little extra help when they go outside. If you have a small or short-haired breed, get your dog a sweater or jacket that fits it snugly and will help them to retain their heat.These are commonly available at pet stores, or you can knit one yourself.

, If you live in a consistently cold climate with long winters or your dog’s feet are especially sensitive to salt or cold, consider getting your dog cloth or rubber booties to protect their paws.Since these are specialty items, pet stores will not always stock them, and ordering them online may be easier. If you do order them online, be sure to measure your dog’s feet and check the booties’ specific sizing chart to get the right fit. There are no standard shoe sizes for dogs, so it’s important to consult the one used by the brand of booties you are ordering.
Dog boots should fit snugly but leave enough room for your dog’s paws to breathe since they regulate heat through the pads of their feet.
It will take your dog a while to adjust to wearing shoes, so be sure to keep them on a leash at first until they’ve adapted to walking in them. If you notice that the booties are slipping off, stop and adjust the velcro straps until they fit tightly enough to stay on.

, Winter weather means that the dark sets in early. Be sure that both you and your dog can be seen by suiting up in bright or reflective clothing.Consider getting your dog a collar with lights so that you don’t lose them, and they’re clearly visible to other people, bikers, and motorists.
Put on a jacket or vest with reflective strips so that your dog and others can see you.

, Always make sure to dry your dog and clean their paws each time they come in from the snow. Besides creating a big mess in your house, paws that are left wet and dirty will sometimes start to crack or split and can become very painful., If you or your dog don’t want to go outside because of the cold, it's still important to give your dog some exercise each day. Find an area inside, like a long hallway clear of furniture, and play fetch or other games to keep your pooch fit."

Play with your dog.,
Walk your dog.,
Spend time with your dog.,
Give your pet physical affection.",How to Bond with an Aloof Dog1," A good way to build a bond with an aloof dog is to play with them. Dogs love to run, chase, and chew. Incorporate these things into your interactions with your dog. You may have to coax them into playing because they’re aloof, but keep working at it until the dog comes around.Try going out into the backyard and running around with your dog. You can try playing fetch with them by throwing toys they enjoy.
Take a toy the dog enjoys and try to engage them in a game of tug-of-war.
Get Kong toys and hide cheese or treats inside them so they can work to get them out.;
, You can bond with your dog by taking them for walks every day. Keep the leash loose so they can explore while they are with you. This will stimulate them and provide them with entertainment, and they will connect this positive experience with you. By controlling the leash and leading the dog, you are helping show the dog you protect and care for them.Talk to your dog while you walk them. Pet them occasionally and interact on the walk.
Let your dog explore instead of forcing them to do what you want to do the entire time. If they want to stop and sniff something, let them. However, remember you are the leader and are protecting them. Make sure they don’t end up in something dangerous.

, You are not going to bond with your dog if you don’t spend time with them. You can do this by playing and exercising with your dog, taking them to obedience classes, training them, and being in the same room with them.Encourage your dog to lay or sleep in the room you are in. When you are in the living room, fix up a bed for them to lay on or place blankets near the couch or chair. Fix them a bed in the bedroom so they can sleep near you.

, Touching your dog can help you build a bond. Touch involves many different things. You can pet your dog, paying attention to places they like to be petted and places they don’t.Try grooming your dog. This touch can make your dog feel safe and start to build a bond between you.

, If the dog doesn't know you, approach it slowly. Put your fist out in front of the dog's nose. Do not bend over the dog, as this may intimidate him.


Back off if the dog growls, barks, or stiffens.
If a small dog seems nervous, squat down closer to its level.

, If the dog is done sniffing your hand and doesn't seem hostile, reach out from the side of her head and scratch behind her ears. This is a good place to start petting a dog who doesn't know you.

, The dog may let you pet his neck, shoulders, and upper back as well. Many dogs do not like strangers petting their legs, belly, or lower back, but there are exceptions.


If the dog is not yours, ask the dog's owner if there are any injuries or sensitive spots you should avoid.

, Stop petting or playing if you see any of the following signs of discomfort:


Raised hairs on the scruff or down the back
Stiffened posture and deliberate movements
Mouth closed accompanied with wide pupils or a sideways look
Excessive mouthing to the point of red marks, bruising, or teeth marks
Shying away with tail tucked down
Crouching down

, Just like people, different dogs enjoy playing in different ways. Some dogs love their toys, and others prefer to play by wrestling or running. If this is a new dog in your household, you can guess what it might enjoy by researching its breed online. Over time, you'll get to know the dog's individual personality and exactly what it enjoys.


Smaller dogs and dogs with poor upbringings tend to be more skittish and nervous.

, A cheerful, high-pitched voice will get the dog in ""play mode."" These are all signs that the dog is feeling playful:


Stretching with his rear in the air and front legs on the ground
Wagging his tail or acting ""wiggly""
Pricking his ears up or forward

, Throwing a ball or stick is a good way to start, although not all dogs love fetch. Wave the object to get the dog's attention, then throw it so she can see where it goes.

, If an unfamiliar dog doesn't drop the ball at your feet, don't try to pry it out of its mouth. Until you know the dog won't nip you, it's best to wait until the dog drops the toy on its own.


To protect your fingers, keep your hand clenched in a fist when near an unfamiliar dog's mouth.

, If the dog isn't great at fetch or if you find it boring, try holding up the toy and running with it. Make sure the dog sees the toy and gets excited by it. Many dogs have a natural instinct to chase running people anyway, but it's best not to encourage it outside of playtime.

, Many dogs love play-wrestling, tug-of-war, and other rough games. This can be great fun, but it can be unsafe with an unfamiliar dog. Get to know the dog first, or ask the owner if light roughhousing is okay. Even if the dog is friendly, one of you could hurt the other by accident.


Never hit a dog, pretend to bite it, pin it down, or provoke a dog for a reaction.
Some dog trainers believe that letting a dog win rough games could encourage negative behavior, but animal behavior scientists disagree., Your dog enjoys the attention it gets from daily walks. If you don't have time to play today, go for an on-leash run with the dog instead. The occasional trip to the dog park gives the dog a chance to socialize with other dogs.


Bring water for the dog, especially in warm weather.
City dogs love to get a taste of nature. Most state parks allow dogs on the hiking trails, and sometimes even in the cabins.

, Some dogs are scared of water, squeaky toys, or toys shaped a certain way. Don't push a dog to play when it seems uncomfortable. If it goes into full-blown ""fight or flight"" mode, back off until it calms down.

, It's not going to be fun anymore, if the dog is too tired. If the dog loses interest and walks away, let it go. Bothering it to keep on playing could make it grumpy. If you notice the dog lay down or start breathing heavy make sure to provide some water. Also stop if the dog starts getting rougher or play-biting more aggressively than he should, even if it doesn't hurt.


It may seem cute when a puppy gnaws your hand or jumps on your head, but these are behaviors it will learn and continue doing as it grows up. Teach it appropriate limits now to save yourself effort later.
Do not punish them or scare the dog. Just walk away and stop engaging with the dog. Even bad attention (""stop"") may encourage the dog to keep trying.

, To play tug of war, show the dog the rope and let him take it in his mouth. Hold onto the other end and pull the rope a little, but not so much it hurts his teeth. Let him pull it back and forth, then let him take it, while you smile and look happy.


Growling is normal in this context, not hostile.
Some dogs might interpret tug-of-war as a game of dominance.

, Most dogs love raw hides, bully sticks, and other natural chew toys. Durable, nontoxic rubber chew toys are a longer-lasting option. Either way, supervise the dog to make sure she doesn't injure her gums from over-chewing or from splintered pieces of bone.

, These toys usually have a hidden container that you stock with treats. This could be a good choice to entertain your dog while he's home alone.

, There are all kinds of other toys for different kinds of dogs. Here are a few to consider:


If your dog loves to run, get a supply of balls for him to chase. Some dogs prefer soft fabric balls, but these quickly become dirty and worn.
Many dogs grow attached to animal toys. Get stuffing-free toys from a pet store, since stuffing can be messy and could injure the dog if eaten.
If you have cats, see if the dog likes cat toys. Some dogs enjoy laser pointers and string.

, This can upset or alarm the dog. If your dog acts violent or overprotective around toys, food, or other objects, learn about resource guarding and how to change the behavior.

The dog run should be constructed in an area you can easily see and monitor from inside your home.


Area should be well-shaded to keep your pet cool in the summer months.Make sure there are no poisonous plants.
If you have an outside water tap, consider placing your dog run around it or nearby so you can easily get water for your pet.;
, While a dog run doesn't have to be very big, you may need a less or more depending on the size of your pet. At a minimum, a dog run should be at least 4 feet by 8 feet.This will allow most dogs to move a little and get a little exercise. Ideally, longer cages give your dog a chance to run back and forth, hence the name ""dog run.""


Dog runs can be long or square. Choose a shape based on what works best with your yard.
If you have a doghouse you want to incorporate inside the dog run, you should figure the size of it in your planning as well.

, Put stakes in the ground and run a line around the area for your dog run. Use a garden tiller or rake to remove the grass and loosen the dirt on ground. Excavate the pad to a depth of up to six inches. In most cases 3-4 inches is adequate, go for six if you plan to pour concrete. You may choose to leave grass in half of the run and excavate the other half and train your dog to use that area.


Before digging be sure to check for any utility lines that might be in the way. If you aren't sure where the lines are located, contact your local providers and they can come out and mark them off for you.

, Use a post-hole digger to dig a hole one to two feet deep. It should be twice as wide as the post that you will be using for your fence. Start at the corners and make post at even distances along the sides. Leave several inches of space between the hole that was dug out for the floor and the fence post holes.

, Constructing the flooring is crucial to creating a good dog run. You can use inexpensive materials like mulch or gravel, however if your dog likes digging you might need a different idea. Concrete is often used, but care must be taken to create an adequate solution for draining. Flooring systems are interlocking panels or grids that are raised off the ground. They allow a nice surface for pets to walk on, but still provide adequate drainage. You can even cover the floor with artificial grass.

, Use a rake or shovel to evenly spread the material. Keep adding until it comes about 2 inches above the ground. Use boards or small plastic landscaping borders to keep the material in the desired area.


While this is one of the more affordable flooring solutions for your dog run, eventually the material will need to be dug up and replaced. Even if you clean the area regularly, replacing the flooring will be the only way to avoid build up of odors and bacteria.

, To construct a concrete base, first spray the dug out area with water. This will prevent your concrete from drying out too much while pouring. Build a ""form"" around the desired shape of the concrete pad using 2"" by 6"" boards.Mix the concrete in a large wheelbarrow according to the directions. Then, prepare a bed of three inches of medium gravel. Finally, pour three inches of concrete into the form. Use a board to smooth over the surface so the concrete Wait at least 48 hours for the concrete to become completely solid.


In cold climates, add reinforcing fiberglass mesh to prevent the concrete from cracking.
Finish the surface so it is medium smooth. Excessively rough surface can irritate your pet's paws.
Make sure the concrete drains properly, ideally not into the doorway.
If you feel like pouring the concrete might be too much for you, it might be best to hire a professional.

, While chain link is probably the most popular choice for fencing a dog run, it doesn't look great and that can impact the value of your property.You can also consider using wooden posts and cattle fencing to create a more attractive area for your pet.


Chain link fences can be ordered or painted in many different colors. Consider a black or green fence if you want it to be less noticeable in your yard., The height should be three to eight feet, depending upon the breed, size, and temperament of the dog. If your dog is a digger, you may even want your fence to begin below ground.


Find out if your town or homeowner's association has any laws or codes regarding the height of fences for private residences. Make sure any of your plans meet their guidelines.

, Have someone hold the post so that it is centered in the hole. Use a level to check that the post is straight and adjust it if necessary before it dries. Allow a day or two for the concrete to dry before proceeding


If you don't have someone to hold the post, use cable or rope to tie the post to two stakes in the ground to keep it steady., If you have manufacturer instructions for attaching your particular fencing refer to that first.


To attach chain link fencing begin at one corner and attach the top and bottom of the fencing to the post. Use pliers to bend the metal fence ties then attach them to the fence post and a link in the fence. Stretch the fencing to the next post. It is important to get the fence as tight as possible to is will not bend or become loose in the middle. Attach the fence and continue until fence is complete.
To attach cattle fencing start by making a rectangular wooden frame for each side of the fencing. Place the fencing between the wooden frames, then nail the frames together. Attach the whole piece to a support post at either end.

, You can purchase a regular gate for a chain link fence, or get a smaller gate that is just big enough for your dog to go in and out.


Pay close attention to the latch system you select. Be sure your dog isn't going to figure out how to open the gate.

, While you can build a roof over your dog run, it adds a lot of work and cost to your project. Use a tarp instead to give your dog some shade. You always have the added option of removing them to let your dog soak up some sun.Get one or two tarps that are big enough to go across the run. Fasten the tarps to the top of the fences using cable ties.

, You can purchase water bowls that hook up to your hose and will instantly refill when the water level gets low. It is important to provide ample water to pets at all times, so this is a great way to be sure they will never get thirsty. You can even get bowls with built in heating so your pet won't have frozen water during the winter months.

, In mountain lion and bear country, the dog run should have a secure top. In areas where venomous snakes may be present, a bottom course of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wire cloth may be added.

Don't shave your dog or trim long-haired breeds.,
Brush dogs regularly.,
Bathe them very infrequently.,
Give extra attention to their nails.,
Take extra care of their feet.",How to Care for Your Dog in the Winter3," Medium or long-haired dogs, who require frequent grooming, should always have their hair as long and thick as possible during the winter months. No dog should be shaved if they are living in a cold climate. This is an important part of helping them stay warm and clean during cold weather., Since dogs are more prone to dry skin and dandruff in the winter, it’s important to comb them with a soft brush at least once a week to help condition their coats and skin. Doing so will remove dead skin cells while distributing the natural oils in their skin that help protect them against the elements.Double-coated dogs, like Huskies and Collies, should be brushed daily to help maintain their undercoat, which is what keeps them insulated.

, Cold weather dries out your dog’s skin, and giving them a bath can make the situation worse. If you do need to wash your pooch, do so using only water or a hypoallergenic, moisturizing shampoo.Never let your dog outdoors with a wet coat. Cold temperatures can quickly lead to a frozen mane and hypothermia, so always give your dog enough time to dry after a bath before they go outside. Use a blow dryer if necessary to speed up the process.

, You may need to clip your dog’s toenails more often in the winter since they’re probably going outside less and meeting with less hard surfaces when they do., Your dog’s paws take a particular beating during the winter due to ice, snow, and rock salt. Keep them clean and trimmed to avoid irritation, dryness, and cracking.Rinse your dog’s paws with warm water after each outing. Use a towel to wipe between the pads of their feet to get rid of any lingering salt, grit, or ice.
Check your dog's pads for signs of roughness or cracking. If they are, use a specialized foot-pad balm or a natural cooking oil such as coconut or olive oil to soften them up. Protect their pads by rubbing them with petroleum jelly before your dog goes outside.Keep the hair around your dog’s paws and the pads of your dog’s feet short. Trimming it regularly with a scissors will prevent snow and ice from matting on their fur or forming balls that are painful for your dog to walk on.

"
"
Be consistent with your dog.,
Remain calm.,
Use consistent commands.",How to Bond with an Aloof Dog2," Bonding with your dog is easier when you are consistent. Dogs like routine and clear expectations. When you use the same commands, expect the same behavior, and reinforce rules the same way, your dog will respect you and feel comfortable because they know what to expect.For example, if you don’t want your dog on the furniture, don’t let them on the furniture. Don’t allow them on the couch or bed for a “special treat,” and then punish them when they get on the furniture the next time.

, You cannot gain a dog’s trust and bond with them if you are not calm. Yelling, getting angry, or lashing out is one guaranteed way of making an aloof dog even more aloof. Instead, respond to frustrations with a calm voice and level manner.If you are frustrated with your aloof dog, take a moment to breathe. Inhale through your nose and then out for a count of four. This will help you control your temper.
If you want to get angry, yell, or hit the dog, walk out of the room. These behaviors will do more harm than good.

, Dogs are good at learning physical commands, and eventually learning vocal commands, but they get confused when you change it up. Using consistent commands helps your dog know what you expect, act accordingly, and receive praise from you, which helps strengthen the bond.They can’t understand you when you talk to them. They understand consistent gestures and one-word commands they’ve been taught.

Respect the dog’s space.,
Pay attention to your dog’s dislikes.,
Make the dog rely on you for food.,
Avoid using violent actions.",How to Bond with an Aloof Dog3," Aloof dogs may take time to warm up to you. This may be due to their upbringing, the fact that they were in a shelter, or their overall temperament. Don’t shower too much attention on the dog. Let the dog know you are there, show them affection, but give them space. Let them come to you. Don’t always go to them.While you are bonding with your aloof dog, it will take time for them to warm to you. As you work on the bond, give them time to miss you and make the decision for themselves to come to you and want to be near you.

, Dogs, like people, have preferences. A way to bond with your dog is to figure out what they like and don’t so you can avoid forcing them to do or eat things they don’t like.For example, your dog may hate having their ears touched, wearing clothes, or being around loud noises. Knowing what to not do around your dog can help demonstrate to them that you care and strengthen their sense that you will protect them.

, You may want to adopt a routine where you feed your dog instead of leaving food out all day. This can help your dog associate you with food, which will help you be an important provider for them.Pick two to three times each day you can consistently give your dog food. Feed your dog at the same time every day.

, To build trust with your aloof dog, you should never use violence. This includes physical violence, like hitting or kicking, and harsh words. Yelling or screaming will not get an aloof dog to bond with you.Don't punish your dog for not wanting to do things they don't want to do, like go for walks, be groomed, or take a bath. Instead, be patient, calm, and use positive reinforcement.

"
"
Take your dog to the vet.,
Consider whether or not you dog is frightened of you.,
Emphasize positive experiences.",How to Bond with an Aloof Dog4," If your dog doesn't warm up to you or doesn't get excited around you, you may consider taking them to the vet. There may be an underlying medical problem that is causing them to feel bad or be lethargic.Some medical conditions can cause fatigue, depression, or overall lack of exuberance.

, Another reason your dog may be aloof is because they have had a bad experience with you. Figure out if you have punished your dog when you have come home or when the dog has approached you.If you believe this is a reason for your dog to be aloof, you should work on providing your dog with more positive associations with you. For example, after you come home, give your dog love, take them for a walk, or play with them. When the dog comes when you call them, give them a treat.

, If your dog remains aloof, try to make every experience positive. This includes things your dog may hate, like a bath. When you need to do something your dog may not like, try to use positive reinforcement to make it more pleasant for your dog and form a bond with them.For example, you may get bath toys for or give treats to your dog to help make it a better experience. This may have to be done gradually as you help train your dog to associate positive ideas with the unwelcome activity.

Make your dog comfortable.",How to Build a Dog Box," Make sure your dog has adequate room inside the box to be comfortable. Measure your dog to determine the minimum height, width, and depth that your box needs to be. Give your dog enough room to lie down and shift position without the box taking up unnecessary space in your vehicle or living space.For height, have your dog sit on its rear legs. Its butt should be on the ground, while its head and nose should be as tall as possible, with its front legs fully extended. Measure from the floor to the highest point of its head or nose. Then add two to four inches for extra head space.
For depth and width, have your dog stand on all fours with its legs fully extended. Measure from the tip of their nose to their butt. Do not include the tail. Add two to four inches to your measurement so they have room to turn around inside the box.;
, Make sure your box will fit where you need it to before you start building. Measure the following:The opening to the vehicle (such as the trunk or side door) so the box can be easily transferred in and out.
The space inside the vehicle, with an eye out for uneven surfaces (such as a lower roof in some places, or less floor space between the vehicle’s rear tires).
The minimum height that the box needs to be versus your line of sight in the rearview mirror.

, If you can’t find your measuring tape at the moment, perform a keyword search online instead. Enter “dog box configurator.” Find a website that will provide the dimensions recommended for your dog’s particular breed. Select the breed and then the make and model of your car.Such websites may be retailers selling their own dog boxes. Instead of offering dimensions, they will match your dog to their own recommended product. However, a second keyword search with the company’s name, the product’s name, and “dimensions” should turn up the info that you need., Before you begin, go through your checklist of things you'll need, which are listed at the bottom of the article. Save yourself the time and trouble of having to search for them later or run to the store. Also make sure any children or pets are clear of your work area, since sharp tools and hardware will be involved. For yourself, wear protective gear such as safety glasses and work gloves.

, First, purchase one or more sheets of ½” plywood to match your measurements for the box’s four sides and top. Trace the outline for each piece on the plywood. Cut your pieces out with a jigsaw.Be sure to purchase a sheet of plywood large enough to leave you with extra material afterward to use as frames for the side vents.

, Choose where to place each. Trace the outline for each on their respective piece of plywood. Use a power drill to cut a pilot hole at any point along your outline. Use the pilot hole to start cutting along your outline with the jigsaw.When cutting, be sure to follow your outline in order to cut out one solid, unbroken piece of plywood. Save the cutouts of each door to use later.
The dimensions of your doors should be a few inches wider and taller than the girth of your dog’s body so they can pass in and out easily.
Later, you will be attaching 3-inch wide strapping along the corners and top, so make sure each door in vent is at least three inches from any side.
Placing your door three inches from the side-edge will require less materials later on, when you attach the hinges.

, Measure each vent. Unroll your galvanized fencing. For each vent, trace an outline on the fencing that is one inch wider on all sides than the vent itself.Use a side cutter or fencing tool to cut out each piece of fencing.Staple each piece around the side vents with heavy-duty hardware staples.


Be careful with the edges of the fencing once you cut them, since they will be sharp and could draw blood.
Use the extra plywood left over from your sheet to create frames wide enough to cover the fencing. Prevent your dog from cutting itself on the fencing.

, For each piece of siding, use your jigsaw to cut 1” x 3” pine strapping into four lengths of equal height to the box. Place each piece in one corner of your box, on the inside. Assemble the sides by screwing each piece of plywood to the strapping in the corners., For each corner to the box, cut two more pieces of strapping of equal height to the box, minus three inches. Line each one up along either side of the corner, with one end flush to the bottom of the box. Screw them into the original piece of strapping inside. Next, cut four more pieces of equal width to the box. Place each one along the top of the box and screw them into the interior strapping., For each door, cut four more pieces of strapping to create a frame for the piece of plywood that you cut out for that door. Using that piece as backing, screw the strapping to the plywood cutout. Then use your jigsaw to cut out the center of the framed plywood. Measure out another piece of fencing to staple to the back of the frame.Hold the door in place over the entryway when finished. Check from the inside to see if any sharp edges of fencing are accessible from the inside of the box. If so, create another frame out of plywood to attach to the back of the door in order to cover the edges.

, First, screw one side of your hinges to the door’s strapping. If you cut your doorway so that one side lines up with the strapping on the outside of your box, simply screw the hinges’ other side to the reinforcement. If not, attach a new piece of strapping to the plywood, along the doorway’s side, and attach the hinges there. Screw another piece of strapping into place along the doorway’s other side. Use this to attach a hasp or latch in order to keep the door securely shut.

, Use 1” x 2” pressure-treated lumber to raise the box and keep the other wood out of reach of moisture to prevent mold, mildew, and rot.Cut four lengths to line the bottoms of the box’s four sides. Gently turn the box over with the bottom facing up and screw the pressure-treated wood into the strapping at the corners.

, First, judge where to place them based on the size of the box and your own lifting abilities. Determine whether the box is small enough for you to easily reach two handles on opposite sides and then lift without straining.If not, you will need a partner to carry it from one side.


Screw handles into place along the top, bottom, or both as you see fit.
Fasten two handles per carrier so they can use both hands to lift.

, Screw one pair into the strapping on either side of the front of the box, two inches up from the bottom.Attach another pair along the back. Install another two pairs into the bed of your vehicle, each within a few inches of where the box’s corresponding eyebolt will be once inside. Use these eyebolts to secure the box in position with straps or chains.


If your dog box doubles a doghouse, use the eyebolts to secure the box to the ground with tie-out chains.

, Cut another piece of pressure-treated wood to equal the box’s width. Lay your tarp out and place the cut wood along the center of the tarp, parallel with its shorter ends. Fold the tarp in half over the wood. Transfer it as is to the top of the box, with the wood lined up along the front of the box. Unfold the tarp and make sure that it covers the front and back of the box entirely, and at least five or six inches of each side. Then screw the pressure-treated wood into the strapping along the top of the box.After that, cut another piece of plywood to cover the top and screw that into place through the tarp and strapping along the top of the box.
The tarp will shield the doors, vents, and wood from rain, wind, and other elements.

, Once your box is assembled, lay a bed for your dog over the area where the box will sit.Lay down blankets, pillows, straw, or other soft material. Set the box's open bottom down over this area.


The open bottom will make cleaning up after your dog a cinch in case it gets car sick or makes any other mess.

Consult your local pet store.,
Consider what your dog likes and enjoys.,
Choose something unique.,
Buy custom gifts from an online vendor.,
Avoid traditional wrapping paper.,
Place your dog's gift under the tree or in a stocking.,
Give your gift with a treat.",How to Buy Christmas Gifts for a Dog," Consult employees at your local pet store about potential gifts you'd like to give your dog on Christmas. Ask them if they have any best sellers this season or what might be a good gift to give your specific dog.


Ask about your specific breed and if there is anything particular for your dog. A luxury dog bed might be more common with larger breeds whereas a custom collar might be more popular with smaller breeds.
Check pet stores like PetSmart or Petco as well as small family-run dog stores in your area.;
, Considering what activities, treats, and toys your dog likes will help point you in the direction of a certain gift. Try taking something your dog likes and spinning into a fun and thoughtful gift. For example, if your dog happens to love walks at night, get them a glow-in-the-dark leash or a leash with LED lights.


Buying your dog a Christmas gift can also be an opportunity to give them an item that can be used for training, like a custom harness.

, There are many different gifts you can get for your dog, from custom accessories to toys, treats to beds, and novelty items to seasonally themed gifts. Choose a gift that you wouldn't buy for your dog any other day. Try browsing online vendors or viewing blogs geared toward Christmas gift options for dog(s).Give your dog something meaningful, like a customized collar, or something playful, like a box full of cigar dog toys.
Remember, this is an excuse to give your dog something that you would not normally buy them. Be creative and have fun!

, There are many online vendors that can offer you custom made gifts that you think up or imagine. Many online vendors also regularly stock custom items. Be sure to contact your online vendor to place custom orders a few weeks, if not months, before the holiday season in order to ensure your gift arrives on time.


Check online vendors, like Etsy, for custom and hand-made dog gifts.

, Your dog will likely not be able to unwrap a gift wrapped in normal wrapping paper without making a mess or eating some paper in the process. Most wrapping papers can be toxic to dogs and possibly make them sick, even in small quantities.


Try using pet friendly wrapping paper, like Pet Party Printz, that is free of toxic chemicals to wrap your gift., Once you have your gift, you are ready to place it under the tree or in a stocking. Placing your dog's gift in a stocking is a good way to also keep the gift out of your dog's site and avoid them getting into their gift before Christmas morning.

, Call your dog over and give your gift with a treat to let your dog know that it is receiving something special. Present them with their gift first and let them smell and become familiar with it. If it is an unusual or custom gift that it will not be familiar with, like a custom water fixture or light-up toy, show them what the gift does. After your dog has seen, smelt, and become familiar with their gift, give them a treat.


If your dog's gift is something to wear, place your gift on your dog before giving them a treat.

, Measure the desired length of the ramp. Mark the length on both boards with a pencil.

, These boards become the frames for the dog ramp.

, Position the 2 frame boards 12 inches (30.48 cm) apart on the plywood.

, Cut the plywood as marked.

,,,, Look for splinters and nails that are not flush with the wood. Make sure to eliminate any rough or sharp edges that could injure your dog.

Measure your dog.,
Decide on the dimensions of your crate.,
Choose the best material for your purposes.",How to Build a Dog Crate1," To start concretely planning the dimensions of your crate, you’ll need to accommodate your dog’s size. Measure your dog’s height (from its feet to the top of its head) and length (nose tip to the tip of its tail).
, Once you’ve measured how big your dog is, you’ll need to plan the size of your crate accordingly. Your dog will need enough room to stand, sit, and turn around in this crate. You’ll want to give your dog room to move side-to-side, so avoid making the crate too narrow.For example, if your dog measures 3 feet from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail, and 1 foot high, consider planning for a crate that is 4 feet long, 2 feet high, and 3.5 feet wide.

Some dog owners may be looking for a relatively small dog crate, in which their dog can sleep. Smaller crates can also be used to contain your dog when guests are over, or if you need to be out of the house for several hours at a time. On the other hand, dog owners may want a larger crate—or even a primarily outdoor crate—that can house the dog for longer periods of time. A large crate can also serve as a place for the dog to sleep.
If you have the time, you could also visit nearby pet supply stores and look at the manufactured crates that the store offers. This will give you an idea of common crate sizes, and you can see which would work best for your own dog

, Most homemade crates are built either out of wood planking or chain link fence, since both of those materials are fairly cheap and can be found at local hardware stores. Both types of crates can be moved, but if you want a crate that you can relocate throughout your house, a wooden crate will better meet this need.

Consider building your crate out of wood if you’d like for it to be located indoors, and if your dog will not be spending large amounts of time (over 8 hours) in the crate. You should not leave a dog unattended in an indoor crate for longer than 8 hours at a time. It can be unhealthy for the animal to go longer without access to food, water, and a place to go to the bathroom.
Consider building your crate from chain link if you plan to keep it outdoors, and if your dog will be spending more substantial amounts of time in the crate. If your dog will be in the crate for over 8 hours, provide it with food and water.
Although it is not technically a crate, some dog owners build their animals large outdoor enclosures—for example, 150 square feet—to give the animal plenty of space to move and use the bathroom.

Help your dog feel safe around you.,
Get to know your dog's personality.,
Train and discipline your dog.,
Incorporate your dog into your family life.,
Teach your dog basic commands.,
Invest in fun, safe toys.,
Teach your dog to play fetch.,
Do agility training.,
Give him some alone time.,
Get out of the house!,
Listen to music or watch TV with him.",How to Become Your Dogs' Playmate," The most important first step is ensuring that your dog feels secure and comfortable with you and in his new home.


Before you bring the dog home, purchase a large crate for your dog to retreat to if he feels overwhelmed. Dogs view the crate as their own personal den, and find it reassuring to have their own personal space where no one will bother them. The crate should be big enough for the dog to stand and move easily around in it.Keep it quiet and calm for the first few days at home, especially if you have a large family or a lot of people tend to come and go in your house. Everyone is probably excited to see the new pet, but the dog is also adjusting to a huge change and needs some peace and quiet to explore.;
, For the first few days after bringing a new dog home, you will learn a lot by observing your dog's behavior and giving him some space to adjust to his new environment.


Some dogs are timid and afraid, often because of prior mistreatment but sometimes just because of their personalities or breed tendencies. These types of dogs may need extra patience and coaxing before they will be a true playmate.
Other dogs are full of energy and love playing right from the start. You may have to make adjustments to your home to prevent these high-energy canines from tearing things up in their eagerness, and you will likely have to plan for extra play time every day.

, Dogs are pack animals and need to know who the ""alpha"" or leader of the pack is. It's your job as the pet's owner to establish that you are in charge, which leaves the dog feeling secure and confident.As you train your dog, be consistent. Use positive reinforcement and never hit or punish your dog. It takes patience to train a dog. You might find that a dog obedience class is well worth the investment, especially for a particularly stubborn dog., When you adopt a new pet, it becomes a part of your family. Most dogs enjoy being at the center of the action. Plan on involving the dog in exercise, games, and outings whenever possible.Be sure you have a collar with tags and a leash so that you can bring your dog along when you go for a walk, to the park, or anywhere that is dog-friendly in your city.

, This is a great way to spend one-on-one time with your dog while incorporating some important training that will be useful for other activities. Remember that dogs learn through play and play to learn, so even though this might feel more like school than playtime, it is still an important form of play.The most important basic commands are sit, stay, and come; after your dog has mastered these, you may also want to add down and heel.Teach each command separately; work on one repeatedly until it is mastered before moving on to another command. It may take weeks for your dog to master one simple command. Be sure that you don't overdo it; only practice the command when your dog is in a cooperative mood and stop practicing when you lose his attention.Use positive reinforcement, such a small treat, extra playtime, or a good ear scratching for each behavior your dog performs correctly. When possible, try to connect the reward to the behavior itself. For example, ask your dog to sit and stay by the door, and then when she complies, let her go outside through the door as her reward. Or have her sit and stay while you prepare her food bowl; then her reward is the food., Toys provide endless entertainment for your dog, and they also serve a practical function: most dogs will chew on your shoes or furniture if you don't supply fun, stimulating toys. Try out several types of toys to see what your dog enjoys.


When you offer your dog a toy, assume that he will destroy it and tear it into pieces. Avoid toys that have strings, ribbons, eyes, or other parts that could come off and prove to be a choking hazard for your dog.
Be sure that the toy is appropriate for your dog's size. Small balls work fine for smaller dogs, but avoid toys that are small enough to swallow or that could become lodged in your dog's jaws.Similarly, very large toys may be difficult for a small dog to pick up.
Try a rope toy with knotted ends, a tennis ball, or a hard rubber toy. Some dogs love to have a small stuffed animal to play with, but be sure it's not small enough to choke on.Keep children's toys, shoes, and athletic equipment away from your dog's reach; he is unlikely to know the difference between what is ok to chew up and what is not.

, Many breeds of dogs love this classic game, and it is great exercise that also teaches patience and agility.


First, you have to teach the dog to chase the ball. Put the ball on the ground and encourage the dog to get it. If he picks it up, encourage him by giving him a small treat and a good petting, along with verbal encouragement (say ""Good boy!""). Then, toss the toy a little farther each time until eventually the dog has to go quite a distance to get it.To encourage the dog to bring the toy back to you, call him back to you and then ask him to drop the toy for you. You can try offering him a second toy or treat to encourage him to put the first toy down., Agility training involves teaching your dog to run through, around, and over obstacles and hurdles. You can train your dog for agility competitions or just do it for fun and exercise. Use his favorite treats as incentive.


Agility training is best for younger, healthy dogs who don't have any joint issues(such as arthritis) as well as an energetic and obedient personality. Herding breeds are ideal for this type of activity, but many other types can be trained for it.Be sure your dog is familiar with basic commands like sit, stay, come, and lie down before beginning agility training.
Get started by constructing a simple agility course in your backyard. You probably already have materials to make some obstacles yourself, and the rest can be purchased at your local hardware store. Make weave poles from ski poles or PVC piping, a dog walk from a picnic bench or small table (such as a children's picnic table), standard jumps made from cinder blocks, a tunnel from a collapsible children's tunnel toy, a tire jump made from an old bicycle or car tire hung from a sturdy tree branch, and teeter boards made from plywood and PVC piping.Demonstrate the course for your dog, and then lead him through it on a leash. Be sure you walk through it the first several times and reward him when he completes it. Then, jog through the course, increasing your speed each time you lead him through it., While playing with your dog is an important time for bonding and exercise, sometimes dogs need a break from interaction with you or other dogs and prefer to just be alone. Invest in a couple of chew toys for your dog to enjoy on his own.


Most dogs get enough alone time while their owners are away at work or school, but if you have a large family or work from home it is possible for your dog to be overstimulated.Your dog will likely want privacy while he eats, uses the bathroom, and for up to an hour every day, as well as during rest time.

, Most dogs love a change of pace and take great pleasure in any kind of exploration. Plan for an adventure that will be stimulating to both of you and also provide great bonding time.


Try taking your dog hiking or backpacking. This is a fun way to explore nature with a companion. Be sure to plan ahead if you take your dog on a trip that requires a lot of exertion. Your dog will need to train for a few weeks to a few months beforehand in order to be in good shape for the trip, especially if she is older or overweight.Find out if your city has a dog park. While dog parks are not ideal for aggressive or territorial dogs, they are fun for dogs who love other dogs and can be trusted to follow basic commands like sit, stay, and come. Keep a close eye on your dog at the dog park, especially if he is small, as your dog could be injured while playing with others.Go on a day trip. If your dog likes car rides, look for dog parks or outdoor activities within driving distance of your home and head out. You can plan to stop at a pet store that allows pets if your dog is sociable and friendly. , It may seem weird, but dogs enjoy music and just like you, they enjoy some peaceful time to relax and unwind.


While many dogs are content to just lay on your lap as you watch your favorite shows, some dogs especially like watching nature programs or shows with other dogs or animals. Try a variety of shows to see what your dog is into.
If you're feeling up to a challenge, try out the new sport of freestyle musical dance-- it’s a type of choreographed dance involving dogs and their owners. If your dog easily learned his basic commands and enjoys agility work, he may also love dancing!"

Buy your wooden planking.,
Make the top and bottom sections of your crate.,
Make the sides and back.,
Attach the door to one of the crate’s sides.",How to Build a Dog Crate2," You will be making a wooden crate, so pick out what kind of wood you’d like to use. The simplest way to build a wooden crate is to have wooden planking on the top, bottom, and sides, with a door that allows for ventilation attached to the front.Pine is very common when it comes to animal crates—it’s a sturdy, common, and cheap wood.
You will also need to purchase a tape measurer, nails and hinges, and a hammer. Unless you already have a door for the dog cage, or plan to build your own, you can buy a gridded metal cage door, which you can attach to the side of the crate.
All of these materials should be available at a local hardware store.

, Using a table saw, a circular saw, or a hand saw, cut the pieces of wood to the exact measurements that you decided upon earlier. Since the top and bottom of the crate will be the same size, you can mark both with the same measurements.

When you measure the planking before making the cuts, trace a pencil along the lines where you need to cut. This will help you guide the saw while you are cutting and will ensure that your cut pieces of wood are the correct size.

, Cut out pieces of wood to the desired dimensions for the sides and back of the crate. As with the top and bottom, mark the dimensions on the planking before you cut the wood. Measure and cut two pieces that are the planned size for the two sides of the crate, and stand these pieces on their sides next to the bottom of the crate. Then, repeat the procedure, but with the dimensions planned for the back of the crate.

Stand the three wooden side-pieces (two sides and the back) next to the base-piece of the crate. Align the pieces, and then nail the sides and back into the bottom plank.
Put your top piece on top of the crate’s sides. Make sure that the edges of the top align with the sides, and then nail the top in place.

, If you’re using a gridded metal door that you’ve purchased, it should already have hinges attached. Mount the loose ends of the hinges on the dog’s crate, using the method suggested by the door manufacturer. Finally, attach a latch to the other side of the door so that it can close properly.

You may be able to attach the hinges to the side of the crate using gorilla glue or another extreme adhesive. If you must use screws or nails to attach the hinges, make sure to file down the screw or nail tips on the inside of the cage, so they do not stab your dog. If you don’t have a file, use your hammer to bend the tips of the screws or nails so that they are parallel to the wood planking and can’t scratch your dog.
Make sure that the door can open freely.

Check the label.,

Beware of tennis balls.,
Purchase hard rubber toys.,
Stay away from toys intended for children.,
Inspect stuffed toys manually.,
Check with your vet about rawhide.,
Keep your dog away from hazardous items in the home.,
Know your dog’s habits.,
Supervise your dog when chewing rawhide or tennis balls.,
Get rid of damaged toys.,
Rotate different toys.,
Clean toys regularly.",How to Avoid Dangerous Dog Toys," You can avoid a lot of hazardous toys by checking the label for important information. The best toys to purchase are those identified and certified as safe for children under three years old, as this means the toy has been tested for toxicity and doesn’t contain any easily detachable parts which can be swallowed easily.It’s also a good idea to look for the national origin of the toy. Toys made in North America or Europe are more likely to meet general safety standards than those imported in bulk from China or Mexico.;
, While most American-made toys contain only negligible quantities of lead, some imported products have been found to contain over 100 times the amount of lead which is considered safe for ingestion. The toys most likely to carry such elevated levels are those coated in lead paint, so if you must purchase an imported toy, you should avoid those that are painted.If you’re suspicious of a toy you already own, you can purchase a home-testing kit to make sure it’s safe.
Lead poisoning is characterized by symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, lack of appetite, and tremors.If you notice any of these symptoms in your dog, take it to the vet and have them check for dangerous lead levels.

, While tennis balls can be a great, affordable way to keep your dog active and engaged, be aware that they can also present a significant safety hazard. Not only can large dogs accidentally swallow or choke on the ball, but studies have found significant levels of lead in them, particularly in those balls labeled as dog toys and not intended specifically for sporting use.You can keep tennis balls in your dog’s life by taking some basic safety measures. Buy tennis balls in the sport section of the store rather than the pet section, and discard any ball as soon as it shows signs of tearing., Tug toys, fake chewing bones, and hollow toys made to fill with peanut butter or other treats are frequently made with safe, long-lasting rubber, so they’re always a good option for your pet.Tug-of-war can be a good way to exercise your dog and keep it playful, while hollow, treat delivery toys are good toys to keep your dog engaged in a healthy activity while distracting them from destructive behaviors like chewing furniture or paw-licking.

, Plush toys made for children often have small, hazardous parts like doll eyes, noses, and long threads or ribbons which your dog can choke on or ingest.Avoid potential health problems from these toys by shopping exclusively in pet stores and removing any hazardous features like tags, squeakers, or buttons.


Plastic toys for children are also unsafe for dogs. Dogs have sharp teeth which can break and cause bleeding and damage to its teeth and gums, or a dog can swallow or suffocate on a broken plastic toy.
Additionally, a harmful chemical compound called DINP has been found in soft plastic toys, so opt for natural latex or rubber over plastic if you’re in the market for a chew toy., Even if you’ve avoided hazardous children’s plush toys and purchased what looks like a good-quality, dog-specific stuffed toy, you should still inspect the toy for defects or other issues. This is because some manufacturing mistakes are inevitable, so things like long sewing needles and other dangerous objects have been found concealed within chew toys.You can perform this manual inspection by feeling and squeezing around the toy before giving it to your dog. Any big or sharp foreign objects should become apparent if you probe carefully.

, Dogs love rawhide bones, but you should seek expert advice before purchasing any for your dog. Imported and flavored varieties are bound to contain many more chemical additives and processing chemicals, and some bones are small enough to present a choking hazard to your dog.Avoid choosing the wrong rawhide by asking your vet which size and type of bone is appropriate for your dog, and see if they have any specific recommendations.


Chewing on rawhide can also be a good way for your dog to clean its teeth naturally, so consider opting for a safe rawhide bone if you’re worried about your dog’s dental health.
Imported rawhide is often a product of the international fur trade, so, if you’re anti-fur and animal cruelty, pay extra attention to the label next time you’re shopping for rawhide., Just because something is not intended to be a toy, doesn't mean your dog won't want to use it as such! Take some time to dog-proof your home by putting away any tempting items such as ribbons, rubber bands, and shoelaces which could be dangerous to your dog.Also remember to keep human food and medications stored safely out of reach. Your dog won't necessarily want to play with these items, but it could get curious and try to eat them. If your dog is super nosy and crafty about getting to forbidden items, install locks on cabinets or buy some locking, pet-proof food bins to keep canine snouts out.

, Different dogs approach toys and chewing in different ways: while some immediately try to ‘disembowel’ a toy and rip it open, others prefer to mouth it peacefully and carry it around, and still others like to tear it into pieces while consuming the dislodged pieces.It’s important to know what kind of a chewer your dog is, because it will tell you which toys are appropriate for your dog and how long or when you can let it play. So take some time to observe your dog when you give him different chew toys and see what it does.


If your dog likes to rip into toys and pull out the stuffing, be sure not to give it toys that have a squeaker inside. Your dog will find the squeaker and potentially choke on it., Since rawhide and tennis balls can be easily damaged, you should only give them to your pet when you can be around to supervise.This is particularly important if you have a big dog, as their particularly large jaws and throats make them more susceptible to swallowing and choking on toys.Be particularly wary of any new toys you’ve brought into the house. Even if you’ve inspected them for defects or problematic features, be sure not to leave your dog unattended with the new toy until you’ve witnessed how it works and what your dog does with it., Some wear-and-tear to your dog’s toys is inevitable, so make sure you keep track of the condition of household toys and that you throw them away when any structural damage becomes visible.If your dog resists when you try to take the worn toy away, try to distract it with a new toy or a treat.


Keep an eye on any rawhide bones your dog has been working on and throw them away when it gets short enough to swallow whole., You can keep your dog’s toys in good condition by putting them in a rotation: give your dog a few toys to play with for a few days or a week, and then put these toys away and substitute them for a few different toys which you’ve been keeping stored out of sight.Try to keep a mix of toy types in each rotation. For example, have one soft toy, one interactive toy, one chew toy, and one distracting, food delivery toy available at the same time.

, Rubber, latex, nylon, stuffed, and rope toys can all be cleaned fairly easily, and you should do so fairy often in order to avoid the build-up of harmful bacteria.Just remember that rawhide bones cannot be cleaned, so make sure you don’t keep them too long.


You can pop nylon and rubber toys in the dishwasher, while stuffed toys can be tossed in the laundry machine and rope toys rinsed and put in the microwave. Just be sure not to use any harsh or fragrant detergents which could irritate your dog’s skin or gums.

, There is a wide range of bling that can be added to your dog's lifestyle that is not necessarily worn. Consider adding bling to your dog's life by purchasing custom leashes or adding accessories to your dog's bed or doghouse.


Try finding custom leash charms or leashes made out of more exotic material.
Convert your dog's bed into a throne or other novelty, like converting your dog's doghouse into a castle.

, Try to avoid purchasing accessories that have sharp edges or corners, are too form fitting, or have long attachments that can be risked getting caught. If the item your purchased for your dog doesn't fit, don't force it. Get in touch with your vendor and ask about their return policy.

, Measuring your dog's collar size will make sure that the collar is both comfortable and effective. Although some custom accessories are novelty and are not necessarily to be used for training or walking, some custom collars can be both practical and fashionable.


If you are unsure about the capabilities of the custom collar you've purchased contact your vendor to inquire about its functionality.

, Measuring your dog for their clothing size will help your dog remain comfortable and ensure that the clothing does not restrict breathing or cause overheating.

, Although giving your dog bling or dressing them in accessories may be cute and fun, be sure to remove them if your dog is distressed. Feel the inside of clothing to make sure it isn't too itchy, charms or jewelry aren't too sharp, or collars are not too heavy. Being responsible about what might be ""too much"" will make sure your dog stays safe and happy.


Signs your dog may be distressed are difficulty walking, hesitation, or attempting to remove or resist the accessory.

, Both in-store and online vendors generally provide sizing charts that indicate your dog's average size (S, M, L) as well as listing dimensions in inches. Be sure to measure your dog before purchasing your accessory to ensure their comfort.


Always choose the larger size if your dog is in-between sizes.
Consult an employee at a pet store or get in touch with a representative from an online vendor if you have questions about sizing.

Know how puppies learn not to bite.,
Understand the dynamics in a dog group as puppies age.,
Use good judgment when training.",How to Get Your Puppy to Stop Biting1," Young puppies often do not know how hard they are biting, and so they bite playfully without understanding how it affects others. Puppies usually learn that they're biting hard by playing with other puppies or adult dogs. Puppies will nip and bite each other playfully until one puppy or dog is nipped too hard and gives out a high-pitched yelp. The victim will stop playing, and the puppy that bit the victim is taken aback and also stops playing momentarily.


Next time the puppy plays, if she bites too hard and gets the same reaction, she begins to realize that her bites can actually hurt other puppies and people. The puppy uses this evidence to modify her behavior.;
, Adult dogs tolerate the (sometimes naughty) behavior of young puppies reasonably well, but they become less tolerant as the puppy ages. It is as though the adult dog thinks that the puppy “ought to know better.” Hence, as the puppy ages, the severity of the correction from an adult dog changes from a mere change in play to a quick message that may include a growl or a snap.


In more extreme cases of correction, an adult dog will jump on a puppy and pin it down on its back to really teach her a lesson; in most cases, this should not be replicated by human owners unless under direction and supervision of an experienced trainer.
Due to this natural progression, puppies generally learn from adult dogs that biting is unacceptable before they are old enough to cause harm to other dogs or people.

, When selecting a training technique for your puppy, keep in mind the amount of time you are able to spend on the training and the appropriateness of the training method for your situation.


If you have children, it is important that the puppy understands not to bite them, but it may not be appropriate for the children to participate in the training.

Ask your veterinarian for their opinion on the stroller.",How to Buy a Dog Stroller," Place one end of a tape measure on the floor and bring the other end up to the top of the dog’s head. This will tell you how tall your dog is when standing upright. You’ll need this information when looking at strollers, as larger dogs will need larger strollers.Make sure that you


Most dog strollers have covers to protect against weather and sun. Knowing your dog’s height ensures your dog will have enough room to stand up and turn around inside the stroller, even when the cover is down.
Allow ample room for growth if your dog is still a puppy. You can anticipate your dog’s adult size by researching standard height and weight measurements for your dog’s breed.;
, Think of where you and your dog will go when using the stroller. Will you only use the stroller for neighborhood walks or will you take it to places such as shopping malls or on hiking trails? The intended use of the stroller will influence the type of stroller you’ll need to buy.Also consider how often your dog will walk on their own. Will you be pushing the dog the entire time you’re on a walk, or will the dog be walking on its own for much of the time?
Collapsible dog strollers offer the most portability but tend to cost more than inflexible models.Obtain measurements of these folding models to determine if the stroller will fit in your vehicle when fully collapsed.

, The dog stroller you purchase must be adequate for the locations you plan to use the stroller, whether rural or urban. For example, you may be able to find online descriptions of hiking trails that you plan to take or rural roads you plan to walk along.This helps determine the best type of stroller tires and construction for you and your dog.


Decide if you will use your stroller on long hikes in the woods or only on concrete sidewalks. If you’ll primarily be jogging on roads and sidewalks, you may decide to purchase a lightweight, three-wheeled jogging pet stroller.If you’re going to take your dog stroller on longer hikes, access printed maps to evaluate the steepness and difficulty of trails.

, Individuals or families with multiple dogs may need to buy a larger stroller, in order for it to comfortably fit both dogs. If you’re going to hike, walk, or jog with two or more dogs in the stroller, make sure that the dogs will have enough room to comfortably stand up and turn around when the stroller’s cover is shut.This should be relatively easy if you have multiple small dogs, but larger dogs may not fit together in a dog stroller.
If you have dogs of different sizes—for example, one large and one small dog—you can bring a stroller for the smaller dog, so it can rest while the larger dog continues to hike or run.

, If you are planning to take the stroller on longer hikes through rougher terrain, you’ll need to purchase a sturdy model which may have helpful features, such as a rainproof exterior. Conversely, if you’ll primarily be taking your dog on short walks or using the stroller indoors (at the vet’s office or mall), you can select a model with fewer features.Look for a stroller with all-terrain, knobby tires and a reinforced undercarriage if you plan on using the stroller on uneven surfaces such as dirt, sand, or snow.
Purchase a stroller with standard, bicycle-type tires if you only plan on using it on pavement.

, A top cover can be zipped or buttoned shut in order to keep your dog inside. This feature will be useful in rain or other inclement weather, and can also come in handy if you want to contain your dog inside the stroller: for example, when at a family picnic.Closing the top and front cover will also ensure that your dog won’t jump out while the stroller is in motion.

, The ability to carry supplies like water and food is handy for long hikes, jogs, or walks. If you purchase a dog stroller that does not come equipped with storage space, or that has a limited capacity, you’ll likely be left carrying pet accessories in your hands. A good pet carrier will have cargo space like pockets or sleeves on the back or sides of the stroller.When using the stroller, you’ll likely be carrying:


Water and a water dish for your dog.
A leash and/or dog harness.
Waste bags to pick up after your dog.

, Visit websites such as Amazon.com to learn what other buyers think of the model you may be purchasing. There are also multiple online blogs and websites dedicated to reviewing and promoting dog strollers; a quick Google search will reveal multiple dog-stroller blogs.Consider asking other local buyers if you can test drive their strollers. For example, place an ad in CraigsList.org to find local a dog-stroller owner. Then, bring your dog with you, and meet at a dog park to try the stroller. Make sure your dog fits in the stroller and, if the stroller’s owner allows, take your dog for a brief walk while it’s in the stroller.

, Ask what model they recommend for your dog’s breed, weight, and height. (These size recommendations may also be listed on the company’s website). Although you’ll have already done similar research yourself, it will still be helpful to have your dog-stroller evaluations confirmed or modified by the manufacturer.


This step is especially valuable if you plan to purchase a stroller online. Since some of the best dog stroller deals are online, you won’t be able to test the stroller until you purchase one.

, Ensure that you can return the stroller if it isn’t the correct size for your dog. Once you’ve confirmed the warranty and made your decision, you should purchase the dog stroller from a manufacturer who will pay for return shipping if the stroller isn’t right for your dog.


A generous return or exchange policy is a good sign that the manufacturer provides a quality product.

, Before you purchase a dog stroller, check with your veterinarian and make sure that that dog stroller will not cause any health problems or concerns for your dog. Describe to the vet the locations where you plan to take your dog in the stroller, how much room the dog will have inside the stroller, and how long your dog will be in the stroller during a typical hike, jog, or walk.


It’s likely that your vet will support your decision to purchase a dog stroller. They may advocate dog strollers as an effective way to transport a dog that is sick, recovering from surgery, or in a cast."

Choose and purchase your fencing materials.,
Decide on the flooring material.,
Assemble the crate.,
Consider adding shade or insulation.",How to Build a Dog Crate3," Chain link-fence will be the easiest and most convenient to use. You can select the height and length of fence you’d like to purchase—buy enough to match the size dimensions that you’ve decided on for the crate. You should be able to purchase readymade wall and door sections at your local hardware or home-center store; this will be easier to assemble than fencing material from a spool.Plan for the fencing to be at least 4 feet high, so that your dog will not leap out of the crate. You can also purchase a readymade top to affix to the top of the crate—this should guarantee that the dog will not escape.

, Assuming that this dog crate will be installed outside, flagstone and pea gravel are popular options.Choose which you would like to use, and purchase the material at a hardware or gardening supply store.

If you decide to bring a chain-link dog crate inside, you could affix the bottom of the fencing material to a large piece of plywood that has been cut to the dimensions of the crate.

, Depending on the type and amount of fencing material you purchased, you’ll need to assemble the premade wall and door segments as directed by the manufacturer. Locate the crate in your backyard or other outdoor area near to your house. If you choose to locate the crate inside your house, set it on a surface—such as concrete or cement—that will not be damaged by the steel wires.

Chain-link crates are typically installed outside. Consequently, in order to prevent dogs from digging out under the chain link, you may need to dig down and bury the bottom edge of the crate fence about a foot deep., If the dog is going to be spending substantial amounts of time in its crate outside—especially if you live in a region with extreme high or low temperatures—you may want to install some material to protect your dog from the sun or inclement weather.Even setting plywood up against the edges of the crate will keep wind from coming in, and placing a couple sheets of plywood on the top of the crate will prevent sun and rain from hitting the dog.

Provide fresh water with your puppy's food.,
Set aside a quiet area for your puppy to eat.,
Feed your puppy at the same time every day.,
Make arrangements if you will not be home to feed your puppy.,
Take your puppy to his potty place after he finishes eating.",How to Feed Puppies," Puppies have a lot of growing to do, so their bodies require more calcium, protein, and calories than an adult dog. Therefore, it is essential to feed your puppy food that is meant for puppies and identified on the label as food for ""Growth"".It is difficult to provide a balanced homemade diet for puppies, because they have such specific nutritional requirements and must have the correct balance of calcium and phosphorus in their food. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in puppy food needs to be within the range of 1:1 to 1:5 to help the puppy develop strong bones and teeth. Getting the ratio wrong at a young age means the puppy may have irreparable damage to their adult teeth, and may also have stunted bone growth.;
, The first ingredients on the list should be a meat protein like “chicken” or “beef’ and not a grain like “corn” or “wheat.” The caloric content of the food is often found on the manufacturer’s website and not on the bag. There will be information on the protein, fat and fiber in the nutrient analysis section. Most puppies are fed a diet in the mid 20 to 30% protein range.When it comes to choosing any food, make sure you look at the list of ingredients. If it contains chemicals and ingredients you can't pronounce, don't give it to your puppy.
Labelling regulations mean the contents are listed in order of quantity. Thus look for high quality ingredients, such as meat. The type of meat should be listed such as ""Beef"" or ""Chicken"" etc. Be wary of ""meat meal"" because this means meat by-products such as offal or skin and is lower quality., A BCS will help you determine whether your puppy or adult dog is at a healthy weight.A dog that is neither under nor overweight will have ribs that are not visible, but easily palpated with the flat of your hand. It will also have a nice waist just in front of the hips and a flank tuck when viewed from the side.

, The amount of food that you feed a puppy has an impact on its lifespan. Puppies that are overweight in their first year of life may potentially die 2 - 3 years ahead of their lean littermates.Use the suggested feeding quantities on your puppy's food package as a starting point, but then assess your puppy's body score on a weekly basis.


Each puppy is different and so the amount of food you need to feed them is very different. The amount you give the puppy is dependent on how many calories it needs to stay at a healthy weight and size.Adjust your puppy's food up or down by small amounts (such as 5 - 10 %) when you need to make changes. This fine tuning helps to prevent the puppy's weight from see-sawing up and down.

, If you want to make sure that you are feeding your puppy the right type and amount of food, talk to your veterinarian. The dog food bag may offer some guidelines, but it is impossible for the dog food manufacturer to be able to tailor their recommendations for each individual dog. Your veterinarian may be able to make a recommendation based on your puppy’s specific needs.

, The milk the puppy's mother produces contains the exact combination of nutrients it needs to grow healthy and strong. It should make up the entire diet for the first four weeks after birth.If you actually bred the litter and have the puppies and the mother dog, the introduction of “dog food” typically starts around one month of age.If you try to wean the puppy too early, his health will be compromised.
If possible, let your puppies watch their mother eating. Puppies like to copy and they will understand what to do much better by following her example.

, Puppy kibble provided three to four times per day will allow the puppies to start investigating and ingesting the new food. Soak the kibble in water or puppy formula. The puppies will start licking and eating the new food as they become more familiar with the taste and new texture.


The puppies will also walk through the food and make a mess. You will need to keep on top of keeping things clean.
Make sure the new food is designed for puppies.

, If you are bringing home a new puppy, stick with the same brand your puppy was fed by the previous owner for a few weeks before deciding to change to a different food. Food changes should be done gradually over a week or two to prevent stomach upset and possible diarrhea.Add in small amounts (about 10%) of new food to the old diet until you reach 100% new food. Unless your veterinarian recommends an abrupt change in diet, take your time.

, It might be tempting to give your puppy enticing foods like bacon or ham from the table, but do not get into the habit of doing this. Table scraps will often make your puppy vomit or give him diarrhea. Giving your puppy table scraps may also lead to obesity and even pancreatitis.Bear in mind that the more people food you give your puppy, the more he'll want, so it can interfere with training and even cause behavior problems.
Consult your veterinarian about dog safe supplemental feeding. Low fat options include vegetables (green beans, carrots, broccoli, etc.) or tofu or skinless chicken breast. Remember, everything in moderation and you have to be cautious of creating a picky eater.

, Toy and miniature breed puppies are predisposed to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In extremely rare instances, the puppy's blood sugar can drop and the puppy will be lethargic. In severe cases, the puppy can start having seizures.This is an emergency and you need to take your puppy to the veterinarian immediately. You can try rubbing Karo syrup on the gums to help, but still take your puppy to to your veterinarian.
Providing access to food all the time or every 3-4 hours for the first 6 months of life for toy breed puppies will help prevent dietary based hypoglycemia. For larger breed puppies, feeding three times per day is generally sufficient.

, Fresh water should be provided for your puppy at all times; there's no need for a schedule. Refill your puppy’s water dish often and wash it out once per day to keep it clean.Bring a bottle of water and a collapsible dish with you when you travel.

, Puppies need a quiet area to eat their food. Make sure that your puppy has a nice quiet space to eat and prevent other animals from getting to your puppy's food bowl. If your puppy feels threatened while eating, he may start guarding his food bowl. This resource guarding behavior can escalate and become dangerous to you and others.Try placing your puppy's food and water bowls in a quiet corner of your kitchen or at the end of a hallway. Make sure that your puppy can access his food and water bowls with ease.

, Puppies are like babies in that they like to stick to a schedule. Meal feeding also helps with house training, since the puppy will need to relieve itself on a schedule. Bear in mind that a puppy has a small stomach and he cannot take in his calorie requirements for the day in two large meals. However, as he grows his stomach expands relative to his frame and he can cope with larger, less frequent meals.


If your puppy is under 3 months of age, then feed him 4 meals a day.
If your puppy is between 3 - 6 months of age, then feed him 3 meals a day (4 for toy breeds).
If your puppy is 6 months or over, feed him 2 meals a day.

, If you are often not home during the day, you'll need a way to feed your puppy while you are gone. For example, you could come home at lunch or arrange for a neighbor to feed your puppy in the middle of the day.You can also purchase feeders that operate on a timer that will make food available at certain times during the day. This schedule will only be for a few months, then you can feed morning and night when your puppy is older.

, Most puppies need to eliminate 15-20 minutes after eating a meal, so it is a good idea to get into the habit of taking your puppy to go potty right after he finishes eating. Doing so will help prevent accidents in the house and teach your puppy good bathroom habits."
"
Keep in mind your pet's age and activity level.,
Determine the nutritional needs of your dog.,
Talk to your veterinarian about your pet’s diet.,
Don't be fooled by advertisements.,
Decide between canned and dry dog food.,
Make sure that the label has the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) statement.,
Check the label for the list of ingredients.,
Compare ingredients between different brands of dog food.,
Check the label for the “proximate analysis” that will tell you the amount of protein, fat, and fiber.,
Find the freshest package of dog food.,
Keep dog food stored properly.",How to Choose Healthy Dog Food," Your pet’s energy and nutrition needs are based on multiple factors including growth, activity, reproductive status and age. Pet food is geared for feeding during certain life stages of the animal. A young growing puppy will need more calories than an older pet. A pregnant or lactating dog will also need more calories than its spayed or neutered counterpart., You should think about the caloric needs of your pet, but also remember that those calories should not all come from just one type of nutrient, for instance only protein or only carbohydrates. For instance, protein ranges of 20-25% of calories is sufficient for healthy dogs, growing and otherwise.


If your pet is maintaining a healthy body condition where you can see a waist and easily feel the ribs with the flat of your hand, those are signs that your pet is in good shape. If your pet is heavier than they should be, cut back the calories by 10-25% for a month and then re-evaluate. If your pet seems too thin, then increase the calories by 10-25% and see what happens. Level off the amount fed once the desired body condition has been achieved.
If you feed too many calories to your dog, it will store the excess calories on its body, whether it is calories from fat, protein, or carbohydrates.
Dogs can develop pancreatitis with high levels of fat (and sometimes protein) in the diet.Fat is a form of concentrated energy. A lower fat dry dog food will have 6-8% fat, while a higher fat diet can be as high as 18% fat.

, See what advice they can provide based on your pet’s current health. If your dog has a particular health problem that is affected by diet (diabetes, kidney disease, pancreatitis, food allergy, etc.), your veterinarian will discuss options with you and develop a plan for your pet.


Consult your veterinarian if you have concerns about chronic diarrhea or skin conditions that may be related to food allergies. Diarrhea in dogs may have multiple causes (internal parasites, bacterial infection), but food is certainly a big possibility.
Occasional loose stool that corrects itself in a day or so in a pet that is otherwise acting and eating normally, is not usually a cause for concern. However, a pet that has chronic bouts of diarrhea that does not resolve and/or there are other clinical signs, like lethargy and decreased appetite, should be investigated and a dietary change may be part of the management of these cases. Chronically itchy skin that does not seem to change with the seasons may be related to a food allergy.There are commercially prepared diets or the diet formulation recommended may require the help of a veterinary nutritionist.

, Remember that marketing on TV, in magazines and in stores is targeted at humans. Even the design of the bag or can label is designed for humans to pick up and purchase. Don’t be fooled by pretty pictures and cute commercials. Do some research for the sake of your furry friend.


Labels that include marketing terms such as “premium,” “natural,” or “gourmet” are good for selling dog food but they do not have an actual definition recognized by the FDA or pet food manufacturers., Giving your dog canned instead of dry food, or vice versa, is a matter of choice and budget. Most dogs will do fine on either one, but, on occasion, you may find a dog that is sensitive to the form of diet. They may develop symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea, that show their system cannot process the food correctly.


Canned food is generally more expensive than dry food options but it is about 75% water.

, AAFCO membership is voluntary, but it provides guidelines for the formulation and manufacturing of pet foods. Having this label offers a baseline of assurance to the consumer that the food meets the basic nutritional requirements for the type of animal listed on the container., Dogs are omnivores and they can eat meat, grain, and vegetables. However, you want to see the first ingredient listed as a meat, such as “chicken” or “beef” rather than “meat by product” or “meat meal.” Seeing the word “chicken” on the ingredient label means that the meat is primarily of muscle tissue, but can include the diaphragm of the animal or heart (or other parts).You are also looking to ensure that the first ingredient is not a grain or tuber or vegetable, unless for some reason you are feeding your dog a vegetarian diet.

, The ingredients list on the label is listed in order by weight as they are found in the food’s formula. Ingredients with water included, like meat, will usually be higher on the list.


In order to compare dry (10-12% moisture) and canned diets (75% water), to truly get to the actual percentage of protein found in dog food, you need to consider the amount of moisture in the diet.To calculate the “dry matter basis” of the amount of protein you are feeding in a can of dog food, you need to remove the amount of water in the food with a calculation. For instance, if the food says that there is 12% protein and the can has 75% water, divide 12% by 25% to get 48% protein. That is pretty high. (You use 25% in the denominator to reflect the dry matter left once you have removed the 75% water in the diet.)This will help you compare dog foods, even if they come in different formulations.

, The suggested amount to feed your pet, based on your pet’s healthy weight, can also be found on the side of most pet food bags.


Of course, it is impossible for the manufacturer to be able to tailor the amount fed for each and every pet individually, so use this information as a basic guideline and monitor your pet’s body condition.
You will most likely not find calorie content on the bag or can and will need to call the company or check online for that information.Consult your veterinarian if you have any questions about your pet’s weight and condition.

, Once you have picked out a type of food, you need to make sure that the food is still fresh. Check the sell by (or best before) date on the container. Dry food in particular is sprayed with fat on the outside to increase palatability. Fat will eventually go rancid with time and exposure to air and light. Heat will increase the chance of rancidity.Also check that the bag is intact and there are no holes in the bag before you take it home.
Pet stores will place the oldest food on the top of the stack or the front of the line for the sake of inventory turnover. They want to sell the oldest food first, which makes sense. Just check to see if the product at the back or bottom of the row or stack has a much different date on it and take from the bottom or the back if appropriate.
Although it seems like you are saving money buying a 40 pound bag of food for your 10 pound dog, you are better off with a smaller bag for the sake of freshness, unless you store it in the freezer nicely wrapped up to prevent moisture contamination and freezer burn. Don’t forget to label the bag with the name of the food, lot number (in case of food recall), date of purchase and sell by date. Just take the desired portion out the day before you feed it to allow the food to thaw completely., You should store dry dog food still in the original bag in an airtight container (plastic or metal) in the cool and dark place, like a closet or pantry or even the freezer.Store leftover canned food covered in the refrigerator. Unopened canned food should be stored in a cool, dry place.


It is best to use up opened dog dry food within 6 weeks of opening, as long as it is stored properly."

You can also ask your veterinarian for any recommendations, especially if your dog has health problems or you are concerned about their nutrition.;
, Many pet owners tend to be loyal to one pet food brand over time. Many larger brands offer a range of products that address a dog’s nutritional needs in different stages of life. Be aware that advertisements for dog foods do not mean that these brands are the best available, they may simply be larger brands with more money for advertising.


If you are happy with this brand, feel free to stay with it and continue purchasing their products as long as they meet your dog’s nutritional needs.
If there is a specific ingredient that you want in your pet food, like salmon or chicken, use this ingredient as a way to narrow your search between brands.

, It is easy to find reviews for dog foods online by searching things like “Brand (insert the name of the brand) Reviews”. Look for reviews that are well researched, extensive, neutral, and thoughtfully written.


Look to see whether the author mentions that they are sponsored by the dog food brand or if they have been paid for their review. This can help you to evaluate whether this review is biased or neutral.
There are several Internet sites that are devoted to providing reviews of dog food brands. These reviews may be user submitted or written by experts. Sites like Dog Food Advisor also provide information about products that have been recalled.Some larger review sites, like Consumer Affairs, offer accreditation for brands based on expert reports and ratings from consumers., Brands that have been independently tested and studied can receive accreditation from regulatory agencies. Many brands will feature their accreditation on their packaging and on their websites.


For example, the Association of American Feed Control Officials is a regulatory agency that sets standards for the ingredients and labeling of pet food. Brands that meet their standards for quality and nutrition are a great choice.These accreditations signal that the brand has devoted time and energy into testing their products and that the food meets quality standards.

, Like other food products, dog food can be contaminated and its quality can be compromised. Searching on the Internet is the best way to determine whether the brand has been recalled for any safety reasons.If the brand has been recalled recently, avoid this brand in your search for a new dog food.
If you see that your current dog food brand has been recalled, check the packaging information on your dog food container to see whether your product has been affected. If your dog food has been recalled, immediately dispose of the contaminated food and purchase new food.

, After you have decided on the brand and product that you wish to purchase, you should find an online retailer that distributes that product.


Some larger retailers, including large pet stores, will offer rewards for members on online purchases. If you are a member of one of these retailers and they offer the product that you’re looking for, use their site to purchase the product.

, The easiest way to find an online retailer is to search for the product in your browser. At the top of the list, there will be sponsored links that will redirect your browser to a retailer that sells the product. These sponsored links will usually be from the largest retailers because they have to pay to sponsor the links.


If you are familiar with a pet store that you’ve used in the past, search for that pet store in your browser and look to see whether they have a website. If they do, click the link and visit their website.
Look at their inventory. Their inventory will usually be under a page heading entitled “Shop” or “Online Shopping”, or something to that effect.
You can also search for the name of the dog food brand. Many larger manufacturers of pet food will have a website that you can purchase the product through. This can be a convenient way to buy the product without having to search for third party retailers.

, If the product that you intend to purchase can be found on multiple online retailers’ sites, compare prices and shipping costs across the different sites to find the best deal.


If price is not a factor in your decision making process, you can purchase the product from the retailer that offers the shortest shipping time, offers rewards, or has the easiest check out process.

, Since you will be entering and sharing your debit or credit card information, ensure that this website is reputable and secure.On most Internet browsers, look in the search bar where the URL is located. If a website is trusted by the browser, there will be a small lock icon. This icon tells you that the website is secure and uses security measures to protect your information.

, If you purchase a new brand of food that your dog doesn’t like or won’t eat, the online retailer may offer return options.


If you are uncertain about the validity of a website, find a different online retailer. Feel free to search for reviews of online retailers to see what other consumers have to say., If you have doubts about the website, or you would like to compare websites, search for online reviews for the retailer. Searching “the name of the website reviews” is an easy way to find consumer reviews.


Most people who submit reviews about websites are either very happy or very angry with their purchase. Take these reviews at face value and use your best judgment to decide how much weight you will give these reviews.

Play with your puppy until your puppy bites you.,
Let your hand go limp when your puppy bites you.,
Play with the puppy again.,
Reward positive interaction.,
Add a time-out to your reaction if the yelp alone doesn’t work.,
Lower your tolerance for bite strength.,
Be patient and persistent.",How to Get Your Puppy to Stop Biting2," When she does, give out a high-pitched yelp, imitating the yelp of a dog. The sound should be loud and sharp, like a dog’s yelp would be. Stand up to stop playing with the puppy to further reinforce that her paper was not acceptable.


If you are clicker training the puppy, click as soon as he withdraws her mouth from your hand or lets up the pressure.

, Jerking your hands back in pain, while certainly a natural response, may actually encourage your puppy to play harder and continue biting. When your hands move, you are encouraging the puppy’s prey drive, which will make her want to continue biting you. A limp hand, on the other hand, is very little fun to play with.

, If she starts to bite again, let out your yelp or stern rebuke and withdraw from playing again. Repeat these steps no more than 3 times in any 15-minute period.


Overwhelming the puppy by trying to train too long won't send a clear message. Your puppy won't learn to stop biting and her behavior will just continue.

, Between biting incidents, if your puppy licks you or tries to comfort you, praise her and/or give her a treat. She should be rewarded and encouraged to offer positive feedback that does not involve biting.

, When your puppy bites you, yelp loudly and remove your hand to signal that playing has stopped. Then ignore the puppy for 20 seconds. Physical isolation from the pack sends a strong message to the puppy that she has acted incorrectly.If the puppy bites you again, get up and leave for 20 seconds.


After the 20 seconds are up, go back and start playing your puppy again. You want to communicate that gentle play is encouraged and rough play is discouraged. Play with your puppy until the same sequence happens again and repeat the ignore/withdraw steps.

, If you begin communicating that hard bites are unacceptable, your puppy may try giving softer bites. You want to continue giving feedback that moderate bites are also unacceptable. Continue discouraging your puppy's next-hardest bites, and so on, until she can play with your hands gently and control the pressure of her bite.

, This process can take quite a long time, particularly with puppies that have a high prey drive. The method should work effectively, but you may receive many bites along the way.

Encourage your puppy to play with other friendly puppies and dogs.,
Substitute your puppy's favorite bone or chew toy for your skin whenever she bites you.,
Engage in other forms of play.,
Use a taste deterrent to keep your dog from biting.,
Make sure your puppy is getting plenty of exercise.,
Don't treat like with like.,
Don't discourage normal forms of play.",How to Get Your Puppy to Stop Biting3," Playing with other vaccinated dogs is a normal part of your dog's puppyhood. And just like your own childhood, this is a time for exploration and learning lessons. Regular play with other well-mannered dogs, who don't need to act to teach bite inhibition, will encourage her to play nicely around other dogs and you.Consider enrolling your puppy in a puppy training class, where your dog can learn essential skills while having fun.

, Take out a toy or bone and let her bite on it.This will teach her that her teeth belong on a toy or bone instead of on your skin.

, Playing rough with your hands is plenty fun, but it might be giving your puppy the wrong idea. Encourage other forms of play that don't involve your puppy nipping at your fingers, hands, ankles, and toes.


Learn how to play fetch with your dog. Stick to the same rules every time you play.
Learn how to play tug-of-war with your dog. Stick to the same rules to encourage your puppy to stop mouthing if she gets close to your hands.Provide plenty of interesting and new toys so that you keep your dog engaged. A bored dog is a lot more likely to seek attention from you by biting. Cycle out your toys so that your dog is less likely to get bored.

, Before you start playing with your dog, spray a taste deterrent on areas of your body and clothes that you dog likes to play rough with.When your dog starts biting you, stop all movement and wait for her to react to the taste deterrent. Praise her and continue playing with her when she lets go.


Some options for taste deterrents include bitter apple,vapor rub, tea tree oil, or white vinegar. Alternatively, you can spray breath freshener spray (such as Binaca) into the puppy’s mouth as both a taste and sound deterrent at the moment of a bite.
Spray the taste deterrent on your body and clothes (if it is fabric-safe) for at least two weeks. After two weeks, your puppy will likely have developed a strong distaste for your hands and ankles.

, A well-exercised puppy (exercised to the point of being tired) will not be as rough when playing with you. This will help avoid forming bad habits in the first place. A tired puppy is often a well-behaved puppy.

, It's sometimes tempting to want to physically punish your puppy by slapping, hitting, or waving your fingers in her face. The problem is that these responses can do one of two things: they can encourage your puppy to continue playing rough, or they can encourage your puppy to act out with real aggression. Avoid other methods of physical punishment that might scare or intimidate your puppy.


If you are contemplating this sort of retaliation, you should contact a professional dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist for assistance.

, You might not enjoy being bitten every time you go out to play with your puppy, but you do want to forge a real bond between you and your puppy, and playing is partly how you do this. Don't give up on play time just because your puppy doesn't yet know how to play gentle. Teaching her the difference between right and wrong, not abandoning play altogether, will be best for both of you.

Take your dog on daily walks.,
Replace your hands with chew toys.,
Give the puppy a timeout if she gets to rough in her play.",How to Get Your Puppy to Stop Biting4," Discuss the status of your puppy’s vaccinations before taking your puppy to walk in public areas that are shared with other dogs.Be sure to keep your puppy on a leash for her own safety.

, Give your puppy the opportunity to chew on an appropriate chew toy. Praise her for taking and playing with the toy.


If your puppy seems unsure about the chew toy, try putting a little tuna juice or peanut butter on it to make it more enticing.

, If your dog begins playing too roughly, you can give her a “time out” from playing for a while, even before a bite occurs."

Crate train your puppy.,
Set up her sleeping area near where you sleep.,
Give your puppy ""creature comforts."",
Do not put your puppy in the basement or garage.",How to Love Your Puppy1," Putting your puppy in a crate may not seem like a way to show her you love her; however, when done properly, crate training will help your puppy see her crate as a place of comfort and security, not punishment.In addition, crate training will teach your puppy not to urinate inside the house, since she will not want to urinate where she sleeps.A good sized crate is not so small that your puppy feels cramped, and is not so large that she is able to soil one area and sleep in another.Keep in mind, though, that puppies grow quickly — if you have a large breed puppy, she may soon outgrow her crate.
Unless it is overnight, do not keep your puppy in the crate for more than a few hours at a time, especially when your puppy is less than six months old.Make the crate comfortable by placing blankets and a few toys inside of it.
Give your puppy a verbal command (""In,"" ""Kennel Up"") to enter the crate. Immediately reward her with a treat when she does so.Eventually, she’ll learn to enter her crate with only your verbal command.;
, If you have just brought your puppy home, it will be very important to help him feel safe in his new environment. This will probably be the first time he has been away from his siblings and mother, so he may begin to experience separation anxiety.To relieve this anxiety, you should arrange his sleeping area near or inside your bedroom.Place his dog bed, crate, or blanket on the floor near your bed.Your puppy will likely need to be let out in the night to go to the bathroom, so it may be easier for him to alert you that he needs to go out if he is close by.
It is your personal choice whether you want your puppy to sleep in the bed with you. Keep in mind, though, that you may create behavioral problems in the future if you decide you no longer want your dog in the bed with you.You can also set his crate just outside your bedroom door. Keep your bedroom door open., Your puppy will feel safer in your home if you give her items that have scents of her new family.For example, you could give her a pillow case or old item of clothing that smells like you or another member of your family.The more familiar she becomes with your scent, the more relaxed and secure she will feel in her new environment and with her new ""pack.""


Setting these items in your puppy’s crate or on her dog bed/blanket will help relax her before she goes to sleep.
Consider giving your puppy a ""beating heart"" toy that mimics the sound of a canine mother’s heartbeat.Placing this toy in your puppy’s sleeping area will help her feel more at ease when she sleeps.
Be mindful that puppies can be very destructive. Do not be surprised if she tears apart or chews through items with your scent on them.

, Your puppy’s separation anxiety may cause him to howl, whine, or bark.To get a better night’s sleep, you may be tempted to place your puppy in the basement or garage where his howls will be muffled or not heard at all. This is not a good idea, however — this would only increase your dog’s anxiety, thus increasing the howling.Placing your puppy in the basement or garage could also lead to him developing behavioral problems as he gets older.If your puppy cries at night and you want to check he is OK, wait for a gap between the barks to do so. Avoid going in whilst he is barking, or he will believe he called and you came.
Also avoid yelling or telling your dog off for barking, as it gives him attention and he believes you are joining in, which encourages him to bark more. You should aim to calm him/her down not rally them up.

Research the brand.,
Pay attention to online reviews and ratings.,
Ask fellow dog owners for recommendations.,
Keep an eye out for recalls.,
Consider both canned and dry foods.",How to Buy Dog Food1," There are few regulations controlling the manufacturing process of dog food. That makes it very important to locate a company’s name on the food and investigate their quality control measures and ingredient sourcing. Find their consumer relations number as well and give it a quick call. Ask them about food testing measures or the history of the company.Look for a company that uses its own facilities for manufacturing and shipping, as opposed to hiring other companies for these areas. One company controlling the process from start to finish leads to a safer final product.
Large companies often get a bad rap in favor of smaller ones. However, be aware that more sizeable companies often have additional funds to invest in food science research and safety and quality control measures.;
, Once you’ve narrowed down your choices to a handful of possible brands hit the internet and search for reviews. You will find many websites that provide up-to-date rankings of dog foods based on a wide variety of factors. Read the reviews to see if any one brand stands out above the rest.Look for more specific reviews. A user that states, “My dog didn’t like it,” is much less helpful than a review that says, “My dog liked the beef flavor better than the chicken. Avoid the turkey if possible.”

, Get ahold of your friends or family who own dogs and ask them for food suggestions. They can also tell you which foods to avoid. Or, go online to a pet owner’s forum and ask the users to recall their dog food experiences.


An example forum post might be, “Hello everyone, I am looking for food suggestions for my 5-year-old lab. Thank you!”

, Unfortunately, the dog food world is plagued by fairly frequent recalls. To stay updated it is a good idea to sign up for a pet forum’s recall email list. Another option is to check the FDA website where most major recalls will be posted. If the recall is widespread, some major new agencies might report it as well.Make sure that whatever recall list you check is current with the present date and covers both dry and wet dog food., You will find that many companies offer both dry and wet dog food options. It is a good idea to look at both when you start shopping. Dry kibble is popular due to its low cost, convenience, and benefits for the teeth. However, canned food is tastier, better for hydration, and often made with better ingredients.Don’t forget that you can always mix the two together in order to give your dog the best of both worlds.

Determine if your dog needs a change in diet.,
Choose an appropriate food.,
Search for a food that is specifically tailored for a certain life stage (eg: puppy, adult, senior, etc.).,
Consider how much protein to feed your dog.,
Remember that simply changing a dog's diet may not be enough.",How to Adjust a Senior Dog's Diet," There are a number of factors to consider before changing your dogs diet. In many cases, the dog is not sick, but is coming to terms with the fact they are getting older, so they exert themselves less, sleep longer, or consume less food. These are all perfectly natural occurrences, and do not warrant any immediate action unless accompanied by negative effects such as considerable weight loss or hot spots, as these could be indicators of a deeper issue.

As with any situation you have not experienced before, it is both completely acceptable and reasonable to ask for help. Visit your veterinarian if your dog is behaving strangely. They will be able to determine whether or not the issue is medical, physiological or even the result of a developed allergy. Once the issue has been determined, you may form an action plan for your dog.;
, Now that your vet has given you an idea of your dog's current issues, you can look for a food that meets specific requirements and is the perfect fit for your aging dog. Depending on your dog's diet throughout its life, it may require more or less of a certain vitamin or mineral. For example, dogs with liver or kidney disease require much less protein in their diet.

Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a ""universal food"". What may be right for a 5 year old Golden Retriever, may not be suitable for a 2 year old St.Bernard, or a 12 year old Chihuahua.

, While this doesn't guarantee that it will meet every criteria you're searching for in a food, it does indicate that the food in question is formulated to meet the average standard of nutrition for that life stage, as per AAFCO's regulations on ""Labeling and Labeling requirements.""

Be proactive. Start the puppy off on a quality food specifically tailored for puppies, and work through the life stages without switching brands when possible.

, One common misconception people have is that an older dog needs less protein. This is entirely false unless the dog has developed a disease in the kidney or liver. In many cases, the protein consumption is actually increased in senior dogs, and the consumption of carbohydrates is drastically reduced. Both dogs and cats have very short intestinal tracts with large elastic stomachs. This means they can store a lot of food within their stomach, but the digestion process is faster, resulting in not all the carbohydrates being broken down and used as energy.

Proteins derived from meat are more easily and readily digested by the animal, and are often digested first, meaning after your dog eats, and goes for a nice walk or run, their body works to burn off the protein first and by the time all that energy is expended and they're ready for a nap, their body has nothing left to store but carbohydrates. An excess of carbs in the diet, coupled with a slowing metabolism means that unless the dog thoroughly works off the food (which may prove difficult for an aging dog with energy issues), that left over energy will go to waste and turn into fat.

, Your dog may need more exercise, more or less of a vitamin or they may need to eat only a specific protein or carb in the case of an allergy.

Even if trying to determine why your dog is not the same as they used to be can be frustrating, it is important to understand that your dog's body works at a much faster rate than the human body. What has only been a decade to you, feels like 50 to 60 years of wear and tear to your dog's body.
While the average human's heart-rate at rest is between 60-80 BPM (beats per minute), the average dog's heart-rate is between 80-120 BPM.
The average dog breathes roughly 10-35 times per minute vs. 12-20 breaths per minute for the average human.
Even though dogs have 4 legs to balance on compared to our 2, the hips and joints take much more wear and tear throughout the years. This is due to improper bedding, injuries and general everyday use such as stairs and daily walking. By no means should you limit your dog walks; just be mindful that in your dogs old age, their hips may start to hurt after only a few minutes. If this is the case, stop and have your dog lay on a soft surface such as grass for a rest. Be sure to provide them with cool, clean water, and after you and your dog are feeling relaxed, turn around and head home. Do not continue the walk as the more you walk the farther you get from home, and if your dog's hips become too sore, they may refuse to move any further.

If applicable, treat the underlying condition.,

Be on the lookout for complications, like secondary pneumonia.",How to Care for a Dog with Megaesophagus," The normal feeding posture for a dog is standing on all fours with his head down in a bowl on the floor – this won't work for a dog with this ailment. The simplest remedy is to get gravity to work for the dog by feeding him from a raised up bowl. The optimum angle is to have the dog's backbone and neck running at a 45-90° angle to the ground.To achieve this, place the food bowl on a chair or low table, depending on the size of the dog. Thus for a Labrador putting the food on a surface elevated two to three feet from the ground is desirable. At this height the dog is may need to put his front paws on the surface in order to reach the food, and this is an advantage because it elevates all the forequarters, and the stomach will lie in a lower position.
In anatomical terms, when eating ""normally,"" the food he swallows passes uphill from his mouth to his stomach. A dog with megaesophagus lacks the muscular contractions necessary to milk the food upwards against gravity and push it through the gastric sphincter guarding the entrance to the stomach.;
, In addition, after finishing a meal, the dog should rest in a similar position with his paws and head elevated. Food does not pass instantly into the stomach; by maintaining this posture for a ten to twenty minutes after eating, it gives gravity a chance to help.


To do this, get your dog situated on a couple of pillows or blankets. In time, you can train him to sit like this after eating so he'll do it even when you're not around.

, A dog with a vascular ring anomaly often has a narrow, but patent, lumen in the gullet and can often drink fluids and keep them down. This is because liquid can pass through the narrow lumen but food gets stuck and dams back. If surgery is not feasible for whatever reason, these dogs should be fed from a raised up bowl (see above) and be given a liquid diet.


Special high calorie, prescription diets are available which are pate-like in the tin, but when mashed with a fork (and without the addition of water) become liquid. This is an effective way of providing a balanced diet that the dog can cope with.
Another option is to feed him a regular diet but put it through a blender prior to serving, so that the food is a gruel-like, or porridge type, consistency.

, Apart from a liquid diet, it is worth experimenting with different textures of food from dry to kibble, to bulky wet food, to a gruel or porridge like consistency. There are no set rules as to what texture a mega esophagus can best handle. Sometimes fluids slip down well, other times giving the muscles of the gullet something to grip on, such as a bulky food, can maximizes whatever contractility is present.


What seems to work for some dogs is preparing ""meatballs"" made of dry biscuit kibble and tinned food, rolled into a ball. These are then hand fed, one at a time, to the dog. Perhaps the round shape gives the gullet something to grip on, or maybe it is because the animal is hand fed and eats more slowly, but for some dogs this recipe does seem to help.

, As well as regurgitating undigested food, a dog with megaesophagus may lose weight because he is not getting his full daily caloric requirement. If you've changed your dog's diet and means of intake and your dog is still underweight or losing weight, contact your vet immediately. Adequate nutrition is essential to your dog's health.


The key to caring for a dog with megaesophagus is to feed him in such a way that it maximizes the chance of food passing successfully into the stomach. If that doesn't work, you may have to explore your medical options.

, In some dogs there is normal motility, but an anatomical irregularity, such as a vascular ring anomaly, preventing the food from passing all the way along the gullet. In the hands of a skilled thoracic surgeon this condition is correctable. The abnormal blood vessel can be surgically tied off and sectioned, which frees the esophagus from the ring constricting it.


A vascular ring anomaly is a congenital condition that occurs in the fetus when a blood vessel grows in the wrong place and encloses the esophagus. This has a similar effect to putting your foot on a hosepipe, in that it forms an obstruction and prevents fluids (or food) from traveling along the gullet successfully.

, Some dogs are so severely affected that they are unable to meet their daily calorific requirements and lose weight. In extreme cases, some dogs struggle to even get fluids into their stomachs and can become dehydrated. In these cases, it may be necessary to have a gastrostomy tube fitted.


A gastrostomy tube is a feeding tube that gives direct access to the stomach. It is fitted under general anesthesia and involves placement of a soft rubber tube inside the stomach, which is anchored in place and then passed out through a surgical incision in the body wall. They are only suitable for liquid feeds, but the advantage is that nutrition can enter directly into the stomach.

However, gastrostomy tubes require constant care and rigorous hygiene in order to prevent infection around the stoma site. Food needs to be liquidized in order for it to pass through the gastrostomy tube. After each feed the tube needs to be flushed with water to remove food contamination which could harbor bacteria. Obviously, since the tube empties into the stomach, this cannot be done with disinfectants, but must rely on copious flushing with water. Needless to say, it is a huge commitment on the part of the owner.



, In a small percentage of cases, the megaesophagus is a symptom of another health issue such as an underactive thyroid, or myasthenia gravis.Treatment of this underlying condition can help maximize esophageal motility.


However, in the majority of cases no predisposing factor is found and it is a case of control rather than cure. Sadly, there is no effective drug treatment that promotes muscular contraction in the gullet.
A medication called metoclopramide is sometimes uses for its prokinetic properties on the stomach and end part of the gullet. The drawback is that this drug also increases the tone of the gastric sphincter, so although the esophagus may work harder, it is effectively pushing against the closed door of the gastric sphincter, so you are back to square one.

, This condition can happen for three reasons:


The muscles of the tube don't contract properly and fail to massage food down into the stomach
The muscles lack tone and a baggy pocket forms, trapping food
The esophagus is caught within a ring of blood vessels (a vascular ring anomaly), and is physically constricted at a point in its length (imagine putting your foot on a hose). This stops food from passing along.

, The most common symptom a dog with megaesophagus will display is regurgitating food on a regular basis. Regurgitation is a passive process whereby the dog may only need to lower his head to the ground and food that was sitting in the esophagus spills down into his mouth because of gravity. This food usually is undigested because it hasn't made it as far as the stomach, and has been sitting passively in the pouch.


It can be difficult to tell the difference between regurgitation and vomiting, but there is a subtle difference between the two events. Vomiting involves food that has entered the stomach and requires forceful muscular contractions, often involving the diaphragm and stomach muscles, to void the stomach of its contents. Vomitus is usually partially, or fully, digested depending on how long food has been in contact with the digestive acids in the stomach.

, Your pup is also at greater risk of accidentally inhaling food or fluids down into his lungs. This can cause secondary pneumonia, in which case the dog will be lethargic, cough, breath heavily, and refuse food. Dogs with a secondary pneumonia tend to be very ill, may run a fever, go off their food, and progress to a state of collapse over four to five days. The associated cough tends to be moist and rattle-like.


If the dog breathes in at the wrong moment as he regurgitates, he inhales food or fluid, down into his lungs. This sets up an ""aspiration pneumonia"" which can be serious and needs prompt treatment with antibiotics. Be vigilant for any coughing, and always seek prompt veterinary attention should your dog seem breathless, off color, or cough.

Look for foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Talk to your veterinarian.,
Give your dog a fish oil pill.,
Add fish oil to your dog’s meals.,
Cook some fish for your dog.,
Watch for adverse effects.",How to Add Healthy Fatty Acids to an Old Dog's Diet1," These fatty acids are important for maintaining your dog’s joint health. Look for dog foods that contain fish oil or fish products, as well as flaxseed or canola oil, which all contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. You can also purchase supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids from your veterinarian or over the counter.Look for foods or supplements that are high in omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These are particularly important for your dog’s dietary health.
Flaxseed products can lower your dog’s platelets, so talk with your veterinarian if your dog has a chronic blood condition. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian before giving your dog any supplements.
There are particular dog foods designed for aging dogs in need of increased omega-3 fatty acids. You should be able to find them at your local pet food store.;
, If you are considering giving fish oil or any other omega-3 supplement, you should consult with your veterinarian. They will help you get the right dosage and ensure that you do not give your dog too much. Your veterinarian should also check to make sure that any symptoms your dog is exhibiting are not the result of another disease.Your veterinarian may also suggest supplements that your dog can take instead of fish oil.
Depending on your dog’s size, breed, and age, the amount of fish oil that you feed them will vary.

, Once you have visited your veterinarian, you can begin adding fish oil to your dog’s diet. If you are giving the oil in pill form, you will want to smear it with peanut butter or put it in a treat before feeding it to your dog. Your dog will not swallow the pill on its own. Be sure to give the dog a treat after the pill to ensure that it has ingested the pill.This step also applies to any other fatty acid supplement.

, If your dog will not take a pill regardless of how well your disguise it, you can also pour fish oil on your dog’s food. This will ensure that your dog gets some of the omega-3 fatty acids that you are trying to add to its diet. However, it is not as efficient as a pill.You can also follow this step when giving your dog any other fatty acid supplement.

, If you are having a difficult time getting your dog to eat the supplements, you can serve your dog some cooked fish. Salmon, herring, and sardines are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Consider giving your dog two cooked sardines a day to meet its fish oil needs., Fish oil can cause some negative effects to your dog’s health if the dosage is too much or if your dog suffers from chronic health problems.Be sure to consult your veterinarian and follow their dosage recommendations, and if you notice any side effects, stop giving your dog the fish oil.Possible side effects include:


Increased bleeding
Slow wound healing
Upset stomach or diarrhea
Insulin sensitivity in dogs with diabetes.
Weight gain
Pancreatitis
Toxin exposure due to eating contaminated fish

Be aware that your puppy may become frustrated if he is not able to find his toy, which may cause him not to like the game.Hide the toy in easy-to-find places (behind the couch, under a chair) until your puppy becomes better at using his nose to find items.

, Playing fetch with your puppy is a good way to exercise her, and teaches her how to focus on you and follow your instructions.A small toy or a soft doll are good fetching toys, since your puppy would be able to easily grab and retrieve them.Do not play fetch with sticks. Sticks could injure your puppy’s mouth, or cause digestive problems if she swallows pieces of the wood.If your puppy does not understand what you want her to do at first, show her how to retrieve the toy and bring it back to your starting place.Fetch is an easy game, so it shouldn’t take your puppy long to catch on.

, If your puppy loves the water, then water games are a great way to show him you love him. Water activities are low impact,and will not put stress on his joints.


Your puppy will probably not be a strong swimmer the minute he jumps in the water. For safety, you may want to put a pet-appropriate life vest on him until he strengthens his swimming skills.Life vests may be available at your local pet store, but may be easier to find online.
A swimming pool or a calm lake are good places to help your puppy become a strong swimmer.Play fetch with him in the water.Playing in the water can be exhausting for your puppy. For his safety, make sure he rests every 10 minutes to regain his energy.Do not force your puppy to play in the water if he does not want to., Playing tug of war with your puppy builds up her physical strength, as well as her confidence.To play tug of war, choose a small, soft toy that your puppy can easily hold in her mouth. As you play with her, make sure that her play does not become aggressive.If your puppy starts to snarl, her play is probably becoming aggressive.

, Teaching him tricks will give your puppy a healthy mental and physical challenge. Start out with simple commands, like ""sit,"" and ""stay."" When he has mastered the basic commands, challenge him with more complicated commands and tricks, like ""roll over"" and ""play dead.""


Teaching your puppy tricks teaches him discipline,which will help him become a well-behaved adult dog.
Reward your dog with immediate positive reinforcement (treats, verbal praise, affection) when he correctly performs a trick., Consider making an obstacle course for your puppy in your home.In a large room, position pieces of furniture and different objects (cardboard boxes, toys) that your puppy will need to navigate to get to you. In addition to being a game, an obstacle course improves your puppy’s agility.

, As much as puppies love to run and play, they need adequate time to rest and recharge. Limit your play and teaching sessions to 10 minutes.Apart from your puppy resting between play sessions, she also needs time to nap.Naps are an important part of your puppy’s growth and maturation. If you let her play too much without time to rest, she may become grumpy.In addition, you may negatively affect her natural growing process.

Listen to your puppy.,
Watch how your puppy uses her mouth.,
Interpret your puppy’s rolling on his back.,
Learn about puppy mounting behavior.,
Learn why your puppy stops playing.",How to Love Your Puppy3," Understanding your puppy’s body language will help you communicate with him, and thus love him more. Interpreting his vocalizations is one way to understand his body language. His whines and howls could indicate separation anxiety, especially during his first few days at your home.Your puppy may make a ""grrr"" sound during such competitive games as wrestling or tug of war. This low, throaty sound is commonly a sign of playfulness in puppies.
Puppy owners may mistake a ""grrr"" as an aggressive growl and punish the puppy, even though he was just showing his playful side., Your puppy may show you her teeth — this may be either submissive or aggressive. If this is a submissive action, your puppy will horizontally retract her lips and form wrinkles at the corners of her mouth. An aggressive showing of teeth is usually accompanied by a snarl and a display of the front canines.If your puppy yawns, it may be because she is bored or sleepy. However, her yawn could also let you know that she is anxious or upset.The context of the situation in which she yawns will help you decipher her yawning.

, When your puppy rolls onto his back, he is signaling that he is either relaxed or scared and submissive. If he is feeling relaxed, his body will be loose: mouth open, rear legs flopped to one side, and tail wagging slowly. If he is feeling scared or submissive, he may be holding his head off the ground with his mouth closed.A tucked tail and one front and rear leg raised in the air are also signs that he is feeling scared or submissive., It can be embarrassing if your puppy mounts someone or another dog. However, your puppy’s intentions are likely harmless when he does this. For example, your puppy may mount another dog during play to announce that he is the winner of the game.Your puppy’s mounting of a person usually indicates that he is feeling playful or is excited about something.Rather than punishing your puppy for mounting, try to divert his attention to more desirable play behavior,like playing fetch.

, As much as your puppy loves to play, you may be surprised when she suddenly stops playing. It may be because she has to relieve herself. If this is the case, take her outside and see if she has to go to the bathroom.Your puppy may also stop playing if she becomes tired. Puppies tend to have short bursts of energy, so she may become tired quickly and need to rest.Puppies who tire quickly may have more serious medical problems, such as hypoglycemia or heartworms. If your puppy seems to tire easily, take her to the veterinarian."

Select a high-quality dry dog food for your puppy.,
Transition your puppy to her new diet slowly.,
Do not feed table scraps to your puppy.,
Establish a feeding routine for your puppy.,
Do not overfeed your puppy.,
Give your puppy treats.",How to Love Your Puppy4," Loving your puppy involves feeding him a healthy and balanced diet. Veterinarians and trainers recommend dry kibble for puppies.Canned food is 80 to 85% and is high in fat.Semi-moist food is about 50% water, but usually contains sugar or salt as preservatives.Remember that not all dry food is created equal. Lower-quality dog foods will use cheap ingredients and will have a protein source that is low in digestibility, which could cause digestive problems in your puppy.High-quality dog food will have high-quality ingredients and better digestibility. The more easily your puppy can digest the food, the less he will have to eat and the less waste he will produce.Every puppy is different, so talk with your veterinarian about which dry dog food is best for your puppy., It may be hard to love your puppy if she develops diarrhea soon after you bring her home. To prevent this, keep her on the same food and eating schedule that she was used to from where you purchased her. After several days of this, transition her to the new food over a period of seven to 10 days.For the first few days, the percentage of new food/old food should be 25%/75%. For several days each, increase the percentage to 50%/50%, 75%/25%, and then 100% new food.Slow the transition rate if your puppy experiences digestive upset (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation)., Feeding your puppy table scraps is a way to overindulge him — not a good way to show love. You may inadvertently teach him to beg for food, which is a bad habit. In addition, table scraps have very little nutritional value to your puppy, and could even cause digestive upset.Once your puppy gets a taste for table scraps, he will probably always want them. Because of this, it may be very difficult to stop feeding your puppy table scraps once you start., When you puppy has a set feeding time, it will be easier for her to go to the bathroom on a schedule. This will make house training easier. Depending on your puppy’s age, she will need to eat several times a day (three times if less than six months, twice daily if older than six months).Let your puppy rest for about an hour to an hour and a half after eating (other than taking her outside). This will help prevent digestive upset from physical activity., You may think your puppy is not eating enough, or needs to eat more to help him grow. However, overfeeding him (including forcing him to eat more) can cause him to grow too quickly and develop bone and joint problems.Talk with your veterinarian if you think your puppy is not eating enough.


Although the bag of food can provide helpful feeding instructions, it is best to talk with your veterinarian about how much to feed your puppy to ensure optimal health and growth., Your puppy will love getting treats from you. Treats are also very helpful when training your puppy. Outside of training purposes, you should limit your puppy’s treat intake to about 10% of her daily caloric intake.


Hard treats are good for puppies. They help satisfy her need to chew on something, keep her teeth clean, and can keep her happily entertained."

Focus on the first five ingredients.,
Understand label phrasing.,
Choose a high protein food.,
Identify possible “fillers.” Grains and grain by-products are often used as “fillers” in dog food as they are cheap to add and literally fill a dog’s stomach.,
Watch out for red flag ingredients.,
Look for feeding trial information.,
Check for an AAFCO statement.",How to Buy Dog Food2," The FDA requires that ingredients are listed by weight on the label. So, the most significant items are often listed first, followed by ones in lower quantities. Look for ingredients that you recognize and avoid artificial sounding names. Whole meats, for example, will often be listed first in quality dog foods.In a well-made dog food you will often see a vegetable of some sort in this initial listing as well.

, If the front of the label states that the food contains one primary ingredient, then that food must compose at least 95% of the total content. If the label advertises a combination of various items, then that combination must compose at least 95% of the total content. This is to prevent false advertising.For example, if a dog food’s label states, “Blue Sun Dog Food Is Made With All Beef,” then beef will be listed as 95% of the content on the back as well.
Be aware that dog food manufacturers can get around this rule by labeling a food an “entrée” or “dinner” instead. For example, a beef “entrée” is only required to contain at least 25% beef.

, Look for a specific type of animal protein listed in the early ingredients, such as “lamb,” “chicken,” “beef.” The second tier in quality are the “meat meals,” such as “chicken meal,” which are mixtures of meat and grains. Avoid any food that lists “meat” of “meat byproduct” on the label as these are of suspicious and questionable quality.Protein is important for your dog as it helps maintain overall health and relieves stress on the major organs of the body., These starches do provide energy for your dog, however, they can also signal a low-quality food if used as a replacement for protein sources. Make sure that all grains listed are “whole grains” and preferably organic.Some dog owners avoid purchasing foods with grains out of fear of an allergic reaction by their dog. However, very few dogs are actually allergic to gluten in its various forms., Look out for artificial preservatives, such as BHA. Try to avoid artificial colors as they are loosely linked to cancer. Artificial flavors are unnecessary as well. The actual ingredients should provide real taste instead. Some poor quality dog foods also add sweeteners, such as corn syrup, to mask taste as well., The FDA requires that dog foods contain a statement on their label describing (briefly) how their nutritional information was verified scientifically. Go for foods that include a statement about an organized feeding trial. This means that live dogs ate the food to test its quality., The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) will include a statement on most dog foods specifying that the manufacturer has followed production and nutritional guidelines. It is a good idea to only purchase foods with this label as it provides another layer of protection against recalls and contamination."

Select an age-appropriate food.,
Recognize that price isn’t everything.,
Consult with your veterinarian.,
Make your own homemade dog food.",How to Buy Dog Food3," You will need to choose either puppy or adult dog food. It is very important to buy food for the proper life stage of your dog as the ingredients are tailored to their unique needs. Puppy food, for example, is often more calorically dense to account for the extra energy that puppies expend running all over the place.Be aware that the AAFCO only recognizes those two age designations. Therefore, “senior” dog foods are not required to meet certain extra requirements beyond the norm. They may not be worth the extra money when compared with standard adult food options., It is very tempting to assume that the most expensive food is the best, but this is not always the case. “Gourmet” foods often remove valuable proteins for more “fancy” sounding ingredients to lure customers in. Don’t be fooled by this tactic. Compare the store brand or another bargain brand before splurging.Also, consider buying in bulk in order to save even more.

, Your vet is a great source of information regarding your dog’s diet. They can suggest brands from experience. They can also tailor their suggestions to your dog’s unique health needs and profile. If you want to do the research yourself, ask your vet to suggest a handful of brands that you can then look into., If you feel unsatisfied with the available food options you can always try to make dog food at home. This will allow you to monitor exactly which ingredients go into the final product. You can also make adjustments depending on your dog’s reaction or changing health needs. Search online for recipes and instructions to get started.Be very careful about your ingredient choices when cooking as there are certain foods that are toxic to dogs, such as grapes. You will also want to follow food handling and sanitation guidelines to avoid exposing your dog to a food borne illness, such as salmonella."

Choose foods that have omega-6 fatty acids.,
Talk to your veterinarian about gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).,
Give your dog a supplement.",How to Add Healthy Fatty Acids to an Old Dog's Diet2," In order to maintain the health of its skin and coat, your dog will need to have a diet that includes omega-6 fatty acids. These fatty acids can be found in pork fat, chicken fat, as well as safflower, sunflower, corn and soybean oils. However, you should limit your dog’s ingestion of tallow and lard, which contain omega-6 fatty acids, because they can cause your dog to get overweight.Most commercial dog foods are already high in omega-6 fatty acids.

, As your dog ages, its coat and skin may be less healthy. This is often the result of diminished liver function and a decrease in the production of GLA. If your dog’s coat is patchy, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a GLA supplement for your dog.There are a number of over-the-counter supplements that contain GLA. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian before giving any supplement to your dog.
Your veterinarian should be able to provide you with GLA. You can also find it at most pet stores.

, If your veterinarian recommends a GLA supplement for your dog, you will need to find a way to administer it. Many dogs do not like swallowing pills, so you may need to hide it or mix it up in your dog’s food. You can also disguise the pill inside a treat, such as cheese or peanut butter, and feed it to your dog.


You can buy most supplements over-the-counter. However, you should talk to your veterinarian before giving your dog any medication.
You can find these supplements at your local pet store.

"
"
Recognize that your dog’s dietary needs are very different from your own.,
Watch more behavioral disturbances.,
Add fatty acids when you notice patchy skin.,
Be on the lookout for arthritis.",How to Add Healthy Fatty Acids to an Old Dog's Diet3," Unlike humans, who should only eat a limited amount of saturated fat, dogs do not suffer from coronary artery disease and can eat larger amounts of “bad” fats. This is because dogs have high levels of “good” cholesterol regardless of what types of fat they eat.Therefore, the dietary guidelines that humans must follow concerning “good” and “bad” fats do not apply to your dog.


However, your dog can get overweight if it is fed too much food that is high in fat, which can cause other health problems. You should, therefore, keep your dog on a healthy diet so that it maintains a healthy weight.

, If your dog is not getting enough omega-6 fatty acids, you will likely notice some behavioral changes. Your dog may become lethargic and irritable. This is likely because your dog’s immune system is compromised, causing your dog to be sick. It may also be a symptom of liver and kidney degeneration. Take your dog to the vet if you notice any such behavioral changes., As your dog ages, it may experience certain coat and skin conditions. It may develop a skin allergy or experience decreased liver function, which can diminish the health of its skin and coat. Providing your dog with an omega-6 fatty acid supplement, particularly gamma-linolenic acid, may help your dog’s coat and mitigate certain skin conditions.Be sure to talk to your veterinarian about giving your dog an omega-6 supplement.

, Aging dogs often suffer from arthritis as their joints weaken. Although there is limited clinical evidence, increasing the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in your dog’s diet may strengthen its joints, as well as limit inflammation and the associated pain. Look for dog foods that contain fish, which is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids.Older large dogs can also suffer from hip dysplasia, which an omega-3 fatty acids supplement can help prevent. If your dog has experienced hip dysplasia, increasing omega-3 fatty acids can also speed up the recovery.

Check your dog’s current food.,
Observe your dog.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Incorporate canned pumpkin pulp into your dog's food.,
Steam green beans.,
Serve sweet potatoes.,
Consult your dog’s veterinarian.,
Drop a spoonful of bran flakes, cooked oats, or millet into your dog's meal.,
Add an over-the-counter fiber additive.,
Try a new or different diet.,
Don’t overdo it.",How to Add Fiber to a Dog's Diet," Many foods have adequate levels of fiber already provided. The ‘Guaranteed Analysis’ provided on your pets’ food bag should note the maximum crude fiber concentration. Most pet foods contain about 5% crude fiber, and this is often adequate for the average healthy dog., If your dog is constipated or has diarrhea, this could be something a simple stomach bug, parasites, other gastrointestinal diseases, or strain due to an enlarged prostate or mass impeding the passage of stool.Observe your dog to see if the symptoms persist for more than two days.

, The symptoms of constipation can overlap with those of urinary obstruction, which is very serious. If you see your pet repeatedly straining then a vet check is strongly advised. Ask your vet to include a rectal exam. If the primary issue turns out to be one of diet and digestion, your vet may suggest fiber supplementation.

, A small dog only needs about 1 tbsp. per feeding. A large dog of 50 lbs. (22.67 kg) or more can use 1/4 cup (236.58 ml) per meal.Use discretion when purchasing since canned pumpkin pulp is not the same thing as pumpkin pie mix, which has additives and sugar that aren't healthy for dogs., Fresh green beans are an additional source of fiber for dogs. Prepare a handful by lightly steaming in a microwave, then completely cooling. Finely chop or blend them then incorporate them into your dog's meal.


Raw green beans are less digestible, so your dog won't experience all of the possible nutritional benefits. However, they make a good snack during games and training.

, A single medium-sized sweet potato contains over 3 grams of fiber. To serve one to your dog, peel it first and chop it into small cubes. Put the cubes into a shallow bowl with a small amount of water, cover with plastic wrap, and steam in the microwave until you can easily pierced them with a fork. Mash with a fork, then incorporate 1-3 tbsp. into your dog's main meal.

, Be aware that these and other veggies may also increase other nutrients, including potassium. These may not be beneficial for your pet if they have other or concurrent health problems, such as kidney disease. Your vet can help determine the best vegetables based on any other conditions your pet may have.

, Whole grains are another ideal and inexpensive way to supplement dog meals with fiber. Some of these products may be fortified with vitamins or other supplements, so be sure to examine all nutrition information before using commercially available processed foods.

, You can use Metamucil or other OTC fiber additives for a few days to help your dog recover from an episode of constipation.Sprinkle it over your dog's food for the fastest way to resume regular bowel movements. Use about 1/2 tsp. for small dogs, or up to 2 Tbsp. per meal for very large dogs. Add a small amount of water to blend the fiber.


Use sparingly and for no more than two days to ensure you don't encounter the opposite problem of dog diarrhea.

, Switching to a commercial diet with a higher listed fiber content (or to a veterinary prescription such as Hill's w/d, Royal Canin GI Fiber Response, or Purina's DCO) might be an easier way to supplement additional fiber without extra shopping or preparation steps. You may have to purchase or order prescription diets from your veterinarian, or you may have to obtain a written prescription for the food to purchase it from a pet food retailer.

, 'Fiber' is a term that describes many different polysaccharides and not all fiber is created equally. Different forms of fiber will have variable effects on water absorption, digestion, and fermentation within the intestine. This could lead to undesirable effects, including flatulence, bloating, or diarrhea.If you experience this with your dog, try changing the type of fiber or lowering the amount that you’re adding.


Adding excessive amounts of fiber to the diet for the goal of weight loss can also have dangerous effects by diluting essential nutrients, calories, and decreasing the absorption of some minerals.

Use baby gates.,
Close doors.,
Barricade the area.,
Train your dog to respect boundaries.,
Put up fences.",How to Set Off‐Limit Areas in Your House for Your Dog1," One good way to block off areas you don’t want your dog to get into is to use baby gates. Baby gates can be placed across doorways or at the bottom of stairs to prevent your dog from moving beyond that area.Baby gates may not work for large dogs who can step over them or dogs who can jump over them.;
, Another way to keep your dog out of areas you don’t want them in is to keep doors closed to certain areas of the house. When you are not home or in another part of the house, close the door so the dog cannot enter it.For some dogs, keeping doors shut and not allowing them in certain rooms for a long period of time will train them not to go into the room. This means you may be able to leave the doors open after the dog is trained not to enter those areas.

, If baby gates won’t work and there is no door, find something else to barricade the area with. You may want to use plywood to make a boundary between the area the dog is allowed to go and the area that is off-limits.You may also want to place furniture in strategic places. Place a chair or couch so that the dog’s pathway is barred to the off-limits place.

, If your dog understands basic training commands, such as sit or come, you may choose to train your dog to know which areas of the house are off-limits. Place the dog on a leash and remove all the boundaries in the house. When the dog does not go into the forbidden areas, give them positive reinforcement with pets, treats, and verbal praise. Do this for about a week or two.After your dog has demonstrated that they will not go into the off-limits areas while on a leash, you can take them off the leash. Each time they do not go into the area, give them a treat or praise. If they try to go into the area, gently correct them and place them back on the lease.
Make sure the dog can’t get into any off-limits areas when you are not there.

, You may want to put up fences in your yard. This helps create different kinds of off-limits areas for your dog. You may decide to put fences around your gardens or particular bushes, or you can put up a fence breaking up your yard to include an area where your dog is free to go.Putting up a fence can also help keep your dog from going into other people’s yards or wandering off.

Teach gentle mouthing.",How to Teach a New Dog Good Manners," Consistency is essential when it comes to teaching a dog house rules. Therefore, it's important that everyone is on board with the rules before your new dog sets paw in the house. Even if you are adopting a dog by yourself, you need to be consistent. You can't decide getting on the bed one night is fine and unacceptable the next.For instance, ""No dogs on the furniture,"" is a house rule that everyone needs to agree on. Otherwise, the dog will get confused.
You should also agree on things like feeding times, who's going to walk the dog, and a place for the dog to sleep.
Decide what words you'll use for each command. For instance, you don't want one person to use ""crate"" and another to use ""bed"" for the same command.;
, When you get a new dog from a shelter, you don't know what it knows and what it doesn't. Plus, the rules you want to establish may be different from the last house it lived in, so it's best to just start teaching your rules right away.Don't assume that the dog knows things like toilet training, for instance. Start teaching toilet training the instant the dog gets in the house.
Additionally, start establishing the house rules with your dog. If one of your house rules is don't get on the furniture, begin teaching that to your dog. If your dog gets on the furniture, gently place the dog on the floor and tell it ""no!"" each time you catch it on the furniture.

, It takes most dogs a while to adjust to a new family and environment. It can take several weeks (and in some cases, several months), for the dog's true personality to come out. That may mean that you think your new dog doesn't have certain bad habits, only to notice them coming out later.For instance, you may have a higher-energy dog than you realized in the beginning. In that case, it may need more exercise than you originally anticipated.

, When you're establishing house rules, it's best to keep the dog where you can see it. Try blocking off other rooms with doors or baby gates. If you can't do that, try keeping the dog on a leash for a little while, until you've established a routine.Of course, you need to go out sometimes. Before the dog is crate trained, try putting the dog in a small space, like part of a laundry room. If it's small enough, the dog is not as likely to use the bathroom.
Make sure to remove any dangers to do the dog, including chemicals, plants, and cords the dog could chew on. Also, the area shouldn't have anything in it you don't want broken, such as expensive furniture or knickknacks.

, Take the dog outside every hour to use the bathroom. When the dog goes outside, be sure to praise it enthusiastically, right after it goes. It can also help to use a treat to reinforce the behavior.Watch your dog for signs of wanting to go out. If it squats, circles, sniffs around, or barks at the door, take it outside. If it uses the bathroom outside, give it a treat and praise.
If you catch your dog using the bathroom in the house, make a loud noise, like clapping or yelling to startle it into stopping. Say, ""Outside!"" Take the dog outside. If it continues using the bathroom outside, give it a treat., Start with something moveable, such as a mat with an anti-skid bottom. Using something moveable gives you the option to move it easily around your home or even take it out with you. This trick is important because it can teach your dog to stay in one place when you need it to, such as when you have people coming over to your house. Start by introducing your dog to the mat; just lay the mat down in front of it. If the dog shows interest, use a click and a treat to acknowledge the behavior.A clicker is a dog training tool that provides positive reinforcement of a behavior. You can also use a clicking pen for a similar effect.
Next, give a treat and click if the dog gets on the mat, then another if the dog lays down. Lure the dog off the mat by tossing a treat away. When the dog comes back, give it a click and treat. Repeat this reinforcement. You can also wait until the dog lays down before giving a click and treat.
Start adding in your chosen word. You could use ""mat"" or ""spot,"" whatever you want, as long as you're consistent. Lure the dog away by tossing a treat. As the dog comes back on the mat, say the word you've chosen. Work on this behavior.
Finally, try distracting the dog. You can use a squeaker toy or move away from the mat while the dog is on it. If the dog stays, reward it. If it moves, start again with resetting the dog on the mat. Eventually, add time before you click and treat. After a while, the word will be enough.

, Start with a crate that's big enough so that your dog can stand, sit, and lay down comfortably. Your dog's crate is its home, so it needs to be comfortable inside. A crate is a place where your dog can go to be calm. Place the crate in a busy part of your home, so that your dog still feels like it's part of the family.Put a blanket or cushion in the bottom. Open the door to see if the dog explores on its own. If it doesn't, call it over. Put some treats inside to encourage the dog to crawl in.
Once your dog enters the crate a few times, try feeding the dog in the crate. If your dog won't go all the way in, put the food as far as your dog will go, then eventually move it all the way in during subsequent meals. After a few times, try closing the crate just while your dog eats. If the dog whines, wait until the dog stops to let it out.
Next, try crating your dog when it's not mealtime. Show your dog a treat to get it to go inside. You can use a word to associate with the crate, such as ""crate"" or ""bed."" When it goes inside, give it the reward, and also praise it. Close the door, but stay quietly nearby. Let the dog out in 10 minutes or so. Leave the room for a few minutes. Come back and wait another minute or two, then let the dog out.
Increase how long you leave the dog in the crate over time. Eventually, you can leave them in the crate for short periods while you're gone. You can also try crating your dog overnight, but you may want to start with the crate in your bedroom.

, If you try to run up on the dog and pet it, the dog may take that as a threat. Instead, give the dog a chance to explore, letting it come up to you in its own time. It will come say hello once it gets the lay of the land a bit., Once your dog starts coming to you on its own, it's time to work on touch. Try petting the dog. Make sure the dog can see you coming, and don't move over the head from the front. You can pet the dog's back, for instance, but make sure your dog can see your hand ahead of time.To make your dog more comfortable, try crouching down or sitting on the floor.

, Your dog has places on its body that it doesn't like touched, such as its paws or ears. However, you'll need to be able to touch those places to do things like trim its nails. Being able to touch these areas will also help when the dog goes to the vet, so it's important to teach your dog how to tolerate being touched in those areas. While it's easiest to do in puppies, you can also work with older dogs.Start when the dog is already relaxed near you, and pick a word that you will associate with this activity, such as ""cuddle"" or ""touch.""
Pet the areas the dog likes, such as the head. Use the word you've chosen, and then pet the area. After you've done it, give the dog a treat.
Each time you try this tactic, move closer to an area that your dog has a problem with, such as its paw. If the dog tenses, move back to an area it's comfortable with.
Keeping practicing this tactic in small doses each day to slowly get your dog used to the idea. Once you can touch the dog's paws, work on holding them or touching different areas. You can switch out treats for praises and good pets.

, Introducing your dog to new people may take some patience. When you're in your home, you can have someone come over. Block off an area, so your dog has to be in the same room. Then just have a normal conversation with your friend.The person shouldn't pay any attention to the dog at first. Let the dog investigate. If the dog does, have the person talk calmly to the dog. The person can pet the dog if the dog seems interested, as long as your friend stays gentle and follows the same rules you did when starting out with the dog. You can also give your friend some treats to give to the dog.
In public, it's also a good idea to only let your dog approach other people. Don't force interactions. If you're dog is especially nervous, you can use treats to get them used to the idea of strangers. For instance, when you're on a walk, try giving your dog treats when you see people approaching, keeping the people at a safe distance (one that doesn't make your dog nervous). As your dog gets used to the idea, you can let people get closer, still offering treats to the dog.

, Socializing your dog just means letting it get used to other dogs and people. You can have people over to your house, or you can take your dog to a dog park or another dog-friendly area. Just remember, it's important that you don't force your dog to do anything, as that can backfire. Let your dog interact with other people and dogs at its own pace.Always watch for warning signs of biting or aggression. If your dog is leaning towards aggression, the dog will try to make itself look bigger with ears up, ruffed-up fur, and the tail up. An aggressive dog may bark, growl, or lunge.
A dog that's anxious will try to make itself look smaller by crouching down, putting its tail between its legs, or licking its paws.
Both of these postures (and any combination of the two) could indicate your dog is getting upset. Try not to force your dog to do anything when it's exhibiting these behaviors. Keep other dogs and people away if it's exhibiting these behaviors.

, When walking on a leash, the dog should stay by your side. To work on this behavior, use part of the dog's daily food. Start with a few bits just to get things going. Next, feed the dog parts of the food whenever the dog stays next to you on the walk.If the dog pulls ahead, stop moving. When the dog stops and looks, praise the dog, then give it a piece of kibble.

, Some dogs can bite too hard when playing with humans without even realizing it. However, you can train your dog to be gentle. Start by playing with your dog, letting the dog play mouth on your hands. If the dog bites too hard, give a high-pitched yell or yelp. Let your hand go limp. That signals to the dog that its broken the rules of play.After a few minutes, resume playing again. If your dog bites hard again, repeat the process. Only do it three times in 15 minutes. After that, stop playing.

Choose a sound barrier.,
Try a spray barrier.,
Consider a static barrier.",How to Set Off‐Limit Areas in Your House for Your Dog2," You may want to choose a system that uses sound to create a barrier for your dog. This device will emit a high-pitched sound that is unpleasant to dogs, so it will deter them from getting close to off-limits areas.These sounds will not be heard by most humans.

, Another system you can use is a spray barrier. This type of device will create a barrier by spraying a mist into the air around the boundary of the area that dogs won’t like. This will discourage the dog from entering the area., Static barrier devices are another option to keep dogs from certain areas. This device creates electrical pulses that the dog can feel on the skin. It will tingle unpleasantly, which will help your dog learn not to go into certain areas.Different devices have different levels of static pulses. You can also get them that send the static pulse to a dog collar, or get a device that puts the static pulse in a mat you place near the off-limits area. You can choose one that is right for your pet.
This method may not be right for everyone.

Figure out what areas are off-limits.,
Keep your dog in a common area.,
Expand your dog’s off-limits area if their behavior is consistent.",How to Set Off‐Limit Areas in Your House for Your Dog3," As soon as you bring home your dog, you should decide what rooms they can go into and ones they cannot. You should also decide what other areas are off-limits, such as the couch, the beds, or other furniture.


For example, you may not want to let your dog in your bedroom, but your roommate is okay with the dog going in their bedroom. You both may decide not to let the dog upstairs.

, You should never make a social space where your family gathers off-limits to your dog. Your dog needs companionship and to be around you and your family. Otherwise, there is no purpose of having a pet. Make sure at least the living room or den area is available for your dog.For example, don’t sequester your dog to an empty bedroom, an unused den, or a laundry room when the family is home. You may choose to keep them in a laundry room or kitchen during the day, though.

, Dogs often have smaller areas where they can roam than adult dogs. This is usually due to chewing or not being house trained. As your dog grows and learns not to chew and becomes house trained, you may choose to expand where your dog is allowed.Evaluate your dog’s behavior and determine if you would like to let them in new places. Just remember, be consistent. If you do not want them in your bedroom, don’t let them in for a day or two and then change your mind.

Ask for a command instead when your dog paws.,
Teach your dog to ""shake"" instead of paw.,
Be consistent.",How to Stop a Dog from Pawing1," Dogs often paw as a means to get attention or food. If your dog is pawing, a good way to prevent is to encourage them to engage in other behaviors to gain attention. If your dog knows any tricks or commands, have your dog engage in these behaviors when it paws.For example, your dog may paw when it wants attention. Each time you see your dog pawing, say, ""Sit!"" Do not reward your dog with attention until it sits. This way, your dog will learn to sit quietly and wait for attention instead of pawing.;
, Pawing can also be converted into a trick. If a dog associates the pawing behavior with the command, ""Shake,"" it will eventually learn only to paw when it hears that command.Hold your hand in front of your dog and say ""Shake."" Wait for your dog to paw at your hand and then reward it with a treat and praise. Repeat this several times a day until your dog understands to paw when it hears, ""Shake.""
After your dog learns the ""shake"" command, only reward your dog with attention or food when it paws in response to the command. Eventually, your dog will learn pawing is only appropriate when you ask it to shake.

, Whichever behavior you choose to encourage, be consistent. Dogs learn best with consistent training over time. Make sure to only reward your dog with treats or praise when it engages in the behavior you want instead of pawing. If you notice pawing at any other times, ignore the behavior and do not reward your dog. Most dogs paw because they want attention or food. If you engage with them while they're pawing, they will continue the behavior.For example, if you want your dog to sit when it wants food instead of pawing, do not feed your dog until it sits. If your dog is pawing, patiently command your dog to sit and only give it food when it obeys.

"

Determine what your limits are.,
Start immediately.,
Make sure everyone respects the limits you have set.",How to Set Consistent Limits for a New Dog1," Before you bring the dog home, or as soon as you do, you need to decide what limits you want to set for your dog. This may be not letting it on furniture, keeping it out of the dining room when you are eating, or keeping it out of certain areas. Discuss with your family or roommates what boundaries you agree to set for the dog.Make sure the limits you set are something you can follow through with and will not change your mind about. This helps develop trust and respect between you and the dog. It also helps the dog not get confused.
These must be limits you will enforce. For example, if you don't want the dog on the bed, you can't decide to give in on a cold night or because the dog looks sad. You have to be consistent with your limits.;
, You should set limits for your dog as soon as you bring it home. This establishes the rules immediately so your dog starts to learn what is expected from the beginning. This also eliminates the possibility of the dog adopting bad habits before you start setting limits.This is why it’s important to come up with your limits by the time you bring home your dog. This can help their adjustment to the new home easier.
For example, if you don't want your dog on the furniture, don't let it sit on the couch with you that first night but then refuse to let it on the couch after that. It will confuse the dog.

, If you live with others in your home, you need to make sure that everyone makes your dog aware of their limits. Consistency is the key to making your dog respect the limits in your home. Your family or roommates must respect the limits you have set for the dog.Talk to the others in your home. Make sure they are aware of what the dog is and is not allowed to do.
For example, if you don't want your dog fed from the table, then you must tell others not to give in when the dog starts whining or looks at you with pitiful eyes.
Tell others, ""I do not want my dog to do certain things. This means you cannot allow the dog to do these things when I'm not around. This will confuse it. Please help me reinforce the dog's behavior.""
You may need to discuss your the limits for the dog with children. Explain to them why dogs can't do everything and why they need to respect this. Tell them, ""I know you love our dog, and I do, too. But the dog can't do everything. There are some things it can't do, like eat from the table. This is for the dog's well-being. Please help me by not letting the dog do these things.""

First identify what your training needs are.,
Identify your short and long term goals.,
Identify what you want in a trainer.,
Consider your dog's personality.,
Consider training your dog yourself.,
If hiring a professional or enrolling in a class, try to check out the class ahead of time.,
Select your trainer and make arrangements to begin training.",How to Pick a Dog Trainer," Some people train proactively, getting their dog involved in training before a problem emerges. Others want to teach their dog advanced tricks. And there are plenty of us who first look to training when our dog starts having behavior issues.;
, Do you want a dog that knows basic obedience? Agility? To fix one specific problem? Your training selection should be based in part on your goals. Make sure that the training program can both solve your problem and leave you feeling satisfied.

, Do you want someone who emphasizes positive training? Someone with experience? Someone who specializes in aggression? Pick the personality of the trainer that you'd like and make sure to not sign up with anyone who makes you uncomfortable.

, Is he stubborn? Easy to frighten? Knowing his temperament can help you pick out the right person.

, There's no one he likes better, plus the process will not only improve your bond but it will also improve your status as the dog's leader.

, See how the trainer interacts with the students and their dogs. Make sure it's the kind of interaction you like.

, Make sure you have the training equipment you need. Stick to the plan.

Make your dog wait before going on a walk.,
Keep the lead right out.,
Relax and don't stress.,
Provide slack.,
Keep doing the same thing constantly until the dog gets the message.,
Find some small treats.,
Hold about five broken up parts in your hand.,
Get your dog's attention.,
Start walking slowly.,
Offer a treat for positive walking behavior.,
Repeat this process with patience and confidence.",How to Teach a Dog to Stop Tugging on the Lead," If your dog goes through the front door before you, this may seem harmless and normal but it has put in its head that its priorities come before yours. You are the top of the pack, so you deserve the respect to go through the door before your dog!


If this is the case, whenever your dog pushes through the door before you, hold its leash short and behind you, then step out of the door first. Once you are out of the house, invite your dog out to join you. Following this first step can help hugely with the respect you get from your dog.;
, Once out on your walk, make sure you have the lead at its full length. If you have an extendable leash, it's recommended that you get a plain rope/leather leash that is one length only.

, This is time for you and your dog to bond and exercise together.

, As soon as there is tension on the leash which makes your arm straighten, or the leash itself go straight and tense, stop right where you are. Wait until the lead goes slack and your dog relaxes again.

, Repeating this process can be irritating but by the end of all the hard work, hopefully your dog will have gotten the message and will calm down and pay more attention to the exciting smells and games to play rather than pulling like a steam train.

, They should be ones that are easy to break up and easy for your dog to quickly snack on.

, Gently clench your fist

, Bring your hand (with the treats in it) up to the top of your rib cage/below your chest.

, Keep your dog's attention on the hand containing the treats.

, Each time your dog relaxes and walks by your side, even if its focus is on the treats, reward it with one or two small bits of the treat.

, This is another good way to try to teach your dog to walk on the leash nicely if it doesn't respond to the first option.

Ignore pawing.,
Manage pawing during playtime.,
Reward only pawing that occurs on cue.,
Make sure others know not to encourage pawing.",How to Stop a Dog from Pawing2," Dogs respond to any kind of attention, even negative attention. If your dog is pawing, the best way to discourage the behavior is simply ignoring it. When your dog paws you, freeze completely and avoid making eye contact with the dog. Do not engage with the dog until the behavior stops.When you initially start ignoring your dog, it will probably paw you harder to try to get your attention. Be patient and do not engage with the behavior. Engaging with pawing after your dog becomes more aggressive encourages your dog to paw.
Ignoring bad behavior is much more effective than scolding your dog, as scolding is seen as a form of attention.

, It's natural for dogs to paw during playtime to an extent. However, unwanted and aggressive pawing should be discouraged. If your dog paws you during play, stop playing with your dog for 10 to 30 seconds. Continue playing once your dog has calmed down and their paws are on the floor. Then, resume playing. If you consistently halt playing in response to pawing, your dog will eventually learn not to paw.Also, keep toys low to the ground when playing with your dog. This will prevent your dog from having to paw to get its toys.

, Remember, consistency is key to cut back on any unwanted behavior. Only engage with your dog's pawing when it comes in response to a specific command, like, ""Shake."" Responding to any other type of pawing will encourage unwanted pawing., Many people accidentally reinforce pawing without realizing it. Guests, friends, and relatives may be naturally inclined to pet a dog that's pawing them for attention. If you have new people over, politely let them know you're working on discouraging your dog's pawing. Ask them to refrain from engaging with your dog if it starts pawing."
"
Make certain areas dog-proof.,
Use an electronic collar.,
Use noise correction.,
Provide an elimination area.,
Take your dog to obedience classes.",How to Set Consistent Limits for a New Dog2," Another way to set limits for your dog is to place physical boundaries. This helps the dog see that there are places it cannot get to. Some dogs may eventually learn not to go past the barriers even when you remove them, but many dogs will see no boundary as a free pass into the restricted part of the house.For example, you can place baby gates, chairs, or other barriers in front of doors or stairs so your dog can’t enter those places. You may also just close doors to rooms the dog is not allowed in.
Some dogs may be able to jump over barriers or push them over. In this case, using multiple barriers or buying a higher barrier may help.

, Another method for placing limits on where your dog goes is with an electronic collar. This collar will give a small electric pulse to the dog if it goes into an area that is off-limits. This method works inside the house and out in the yard. Your dog will need to be trained in this type of system so there are clear expectations of his behavior. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the system to ensure safe use.This system uses warning sounds like beeps when the dog gets close to the limit. If the dog starts to cross the boundary line, the collar will give it a small electric pulse.

, Another way to enforce the limits you are placing on your dog is to use loud noises to correct unwanted behaviors. When the dog does the unwanted behavior, do something that will cause a loud noise. Try to make the dog not see you. This helps the dog associate the noise with the unwanted action instead of you.For example, you can use a can filled with coins or marbles. When the dog does something you don’t want it to do, like jump on the couch or venture into a room, you can shake the can, creating a loud noise. You may also toss the can near the dog without touching it. This scares the dog so it doesn’t do the behavior.
If you cannot do this without your dog seeing you, do not do it. You want the dog to have fear of the action, like getting on the couch, and not you.

, Even if your new dog is house-trained, you should treat it as if it is not when you bring it home. Put your dog on a leash and show it where it can eliminate outside the house. You can take it to this area first thing in the morning, before bed, and 15 to 30 minutes after each meal.You may need to keep your dog on a leash when it is with you in the house until you are positive it won’t potty in the house. Never leave a dog on a leash unattended. #*If you cannot be around your dog, place it in a crate or confine it to a room. Be sure to crate train your dog and familiarize it with the crate before using this method. A frightened dog can injure itself in a crate if it is not used to being confined.

, To help make the transition smoother for you and your dog, you should take your dog to a trainer to learn basic commands. This helps your dog learn to obey your commands so if you say “Stay” or “Sit,” it will be able to obey you.Basic commands and obedience helps you be able to reinforce the limits you set with your dog. You can use treats or affection to reinforce the behavior you desire until your dog has mastered the new skill.

Supervise your dog at all times during the first few weeks.,
Be consistent.,
Be firm, not angry.,
Praise the dog for correcting unwanted behavior.",How to Set Consistent Limits for a New Dog3," To help reinforce the limits you have set, make sure your dog is supervised at all times during the first few weeks it is in your home. This helps you correct any behavior that you see and doesn’t let your dog get away with things when you’re not looking.When you are not around your dog, place it in a crate. This helps control your dog’s movements.

, The most important thing about setting limits for your new dog is to be consistent. This means you can’t let the dog get away with things sometimes and punish it for the same thing later. Dogs need to understand what is expected of them. If you set limits, make sure to follow through each time.For example, if you don’t want your dog on the couch or to eat from the table, don’t let it do that sometimes, but then get mad when the dog tries the same action later.
Make sure you don't give in to whining, begging, barking, or sad eyes. You must stay consistent no matter what your dog does to get you to give in.
Don’t give it a ""treat” by lessening the limits. This confuses the dog.

, When correcting unwanted behavior, you should reprimand your dog in a firm voice. However, you should not treat your dog in an angry or frustrated manner. This could frighten the dog, which does not lead to a good relationship filled with respect.When the dog does something unwanted, in a firm voice say, “No!” Don’t yell or scream at the dog.
Refrain from hitting the dog or any other kind of physical violence as punishment.

, The way to enforce the limits you have set is to let your dog know when it has done what you wanted. Whenever it corrects the behavior after you tell it “No,” praise the dog somehow. You may pet it, give it verbal praise in a happy tone of voice, or give it a treat.For example, if the dog gets on the couch, you may tell it “No.” When the dog gets down, praise it for the correct behavior.

"
"
Make sure your dog gets enough exercise.,
Play retrieving games.,
Provide your dog with space to relax.,
Consider taking an obedience class if problems persist.",How to Stop a Dog from Pawing3," Oftentimes, dogs will become nervous and seek out attention if they're not getting enough exercise. This can cause attention-seeking behavior such as pawing. If your dog is pawing a lot, try upping its exercise routine. Play with your dog more often and take it for daily walks.Talk to your vet about how much exercise is safe for your dog, especially if your dog is a senior or if it has underlying health problems.

, Retrieving games are great for dogs with anxiety as they keep your dog focused and active. If your dog has pawing issues, play games like fetch to keep your dog calm.If your dog paws you during a game, pause the game until the pawing stops.

, Dogs that have anxiety issues may not feel like they have space to relax in your home. If your dog is pawing and displaying other nervous behaviors, such as pacing or barking, evaluate your home. Make sure your dog has their own bed and easy access to food and water. Make sure your dog has access to rooms where you hang out frequently, such as the living room, as dogs that feel isolated may engage in attention seeking behaviors., If pawing does not stop with increased exercise, play, and comfort, find obedience classes in your area. Very nervous dogs that are prone to behavioral issues can benefit from professional training.You can find training programs online or ask your vet for a recommendation.

Tell your dog to “sit” and “stay” in a quiet area.,
Present the lure to your dog and say “leave it.” Sit on the floor in front of your dog and present the lure food to them.,
Reward your dog with the treat.,
Test your dog with the lure food uncovered.,
Put your dog on their leash and practice the “leave it” command.,
Bring your dog to a distracting area and practice the “leave it” command.",How to Manage Your Dog's Instinct to Retrieve1," Start by having your dog “sit” and “stay” in an area in your home that is quiet and free of distractions. You should also have a lure food on hand, such as a piece of bread, and a high value treat like a piece of ham or steak.Put the lure in one hand and the treat in the other hand or in your pocket so it’s within reach.;
, When your dog moves towards the lure food, say “leave it” in a calm, clear voice. Place your hand over the lure food with your hand as you say “leave it.”Your dog should stop paying attention to your hand or give up trying to get at the food with your hand over it.

, Once your dog stops paying attention to the lure food, reward them with the treat. You may also say “Good job!” or “Great going!” to your dog to let them know they acted correctly. As your dog enjoys their treat, you should remove the lure food so your dog does not notice it.Repeat the “leave it” command with your dog in the same setting, rewarding them each time they leave the lure food alone under your hand.

, The next phase is to get your dog to leave the lure food when it is not covered by your hand. To do this, place the lure food in front of your dog, within reach of your hand. Then, say “leave it.” Wait for your dog to leave the food. Once they do, reward them with a treat.If your dog does not leave the food, cover the lure food with your hand. Then, wait for your dog to calm down and ignore the lure food. Reward your dog and try the command again.

, Once your dog seems confident with the “leave it” command indoors, you should put on their leash and bring them outside into the yard. Play with your dog on the leash with their favorite toy. Then, present the lure by placing it in front of your dog. Say “leave it” and wait for your dog to back away or ignore the lure food. Then, reward them with a treat.Do not throw the lure food during the training session on the leash, as this will trigger your dog’s retrieval instincts.
If your dog does not leave the lure food and you end up trying to get it out of your dog’s mouth, you may need to backtrack and focus on getting your dog to learn the command indoors not on their leash. Be patient and work with your dog on each phase of the command until they are confident.

, If you feel your dog is following the “leave it” command on their leash, you may up the challenge and try the command in a distracting area. Bring your dog to a dog park, keeping them on their leash, or to an area with people. Use a lure food or practice with items your dog comes across in public, such as trash or food on the ground. Say “leave it” and wait for your dog to ignore the food or step away from it. Then, reward your pup with a treat.If your dog does not follow your “leave it” command in a busy or distracting area, they may not be ready to do the command in public. You may need to backtrack and work on the command with your dog on the leash or indoors until they get comfortable with it.

Choose the right kind of muzzle for your situation.,
Measure your dog for a good fit.,
Reward your dog for showing any interest in the muzzle.,
Use the muzzle as a treat dispenser.,
Smear peanut butter or cream cheese on the muzzle and freeze it.,
Make sure your dog is completely comfortable with (if not excited about) the muzzle before moving to the next part.,
While your dog is eating or licking treats with its nose in the muzzle, lift the strap that goes around the neck.,
Try holding the strap up while the dog eats the treat.,
Wrap the strap around your dog's neck and hold it as if was closed.,
Secure the strap.,
Put the muzzle on whenever you're going to do something that your dog enjoys.,
Gradually increase the time your dog spends wearing the muzzle.",How to Muzzle Train a Dog," There are many different kinds of muzzles available on the market, but the main criteria should be that your dog can sniff, drink, and pant while wearing it. The ability to accept treats through the muzzle is desirable too.


Basket Muzzles: These are the most commonly recommended muzzles for pet owners because they allow the dog to sniff, drink, and pant while wearing them. They also happen to make your dog look like Hannibal Lecter, especially if you get the kind with a wire instead of plastic or leather. Don't let that deter you. If you are going to muzzle your dog in any situation in which it is physically active (even just a walk), use a basket muzzle.
Fabric Muzzles: These look more comfortable (and less Hannibal) but they are only appropriate for short periods (30 minutes or less) and under close supervision because your dog will not be able to drink or regulate its temperature by panting. These are commonly used by veterinarians and groomers. This might be a good muzzle to use while clipping your dog's nails, though keep in mind they might be able to nip or pinch you.
Head Halters: These are mentioned here because many people think they are muzzles, but they are actually not. While they do wrap around the dog's muzzle, they will not prevent a dog from biting anyone or anything.
Police Muzzles: These are extra secure because they are used on police dogs which are trained to attack on command. This kind of muzzle is unnecessary and not recommended for pets.;
, While the ideal situation would be to go to a pet store and have your dog try on various muzzles, if you want to build a positive association, this is not the best way to start things off. If your dog reacts apprehensively to trying on muzzles, a negative association will be made and you'll have a much harder time muzzle training your dog. Instead, take measurements and compare this to a sizing chart provided by the manufacturer of the muzzle. There are usually two measurements needed:


from the tip of the nose to where the dog's own muzzle starts to slope upward toward the forehead
the circumference of your dog's own muzzle at its thickest part

, Put the muzzle on a table or hold it in your hand. Any time your dog looks at it, sniffs it, or shows any interest in it, reward your dog profusely. Give verbal praise, click, and/or give treats.

, Hold the muzzle in your hand, with the opening facing the ceiling. Put your dog's favorite treats (cheese, chopped up hot dog, anything high-value) in the bottom of the muzzle so that in order to get to them, your dog has to stick its nose in the muzzle., Allow your dog to put its nose in the muzzle so it can lick the sweet treat.

, This could take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Be patient.

, Just lift it and bring it back down. How does the dog respond? It might not care at all, or it might be wary. If your dog is wary at all, repeat this one out of every five times you give him treats through the muzzle until he is comfortable.

, Again, see how your dog responds and if wary, practice it sporadically until the caution wears off.

, Don't actually close it. Repeat sporadically until your dog is comfortable with this.

, This is best done with the frozen treat trick, so your dog can keep enjoying the treat while the muzzle is secured on his face. As soon as the treat is gone, remove the muzzle.

, Obviously, the muzzle removes fetch from the equation, but there's still wresting, chasing, and whatever else your dog enjoys that a muzzle doesn't interfere with.

, At first, it should be no longer than a few minutes. Eventually, your dog should be comfortable enough to wear the muzzle for a few hours.

Give it food on a scheduled time.,
Give it treats.,
Give him plenty of love.,
Bathe your dog.,
Be comfortable with your dog.,
Spend quality time with him.,
Take your dog out for a walk.",How to Make a Dog Follow You (Not Your Parents)," Most dogs are known to savage the house for food. If your parents are the owners feeding them every night, your dog will always be next to them waiting for its next meal. If you are the one feeding your dog, he will get more attached to you.;
, Treats are another thing your dog is desperate for, and he will start to notice if one person is giving more treats than another. Don't give your dog too many treats, this is a prize that should be used to praise him after doing something good.

, Dogs love to be petted and loved by their owners. If an owner feeds their dog but ignores them for the rest of the day, the dog will find another person to pet them. Dogs can tell when a human loves them and tries to show it.

, This is another way you can show him your love. They will feel clean and happy, wanting to hang out with you more. Do not wash your dog too much, or your dog will feel smothered and uncomfortable. It is also unhealthy to bathe your dog too much, their coat has it's own natural oils that helps to him healthy.


If your dog does not like being bathed, try making this a fun moment for him by letting him play with his favorite toy, or giving a really special treat after the bath.

, Do not yell at it. If you hurt or yell at your dog, he will run away and be scared of you. The more you yell at your dog the more it will be hesitant towards you. If your dog does something wrong you can just scold him in a stern voice, using always the same word or words, but not shouting.


If you yell at your dog, he will feel threatened and will be distant. If you are nice, your dog will be closer and will be near you more often.

, It doesn't take long to throw a ball or squeeze a toy, but it can make a huge difference in you and your dogs' relationship. By spending half an hour with him every day, you will form a tight bond with your dog. Eventually, he will choose to be near you and not your parents. Even spending 10-15 minutes can change the way your dog acts towards you.

, If you give your dog fresh air and time to run around, he will act fondly of you and recognize that it's you who are doing this for him. If you spend hardly any time with your dog, he can treat you like a stranger, or even ignore you. By taking your dog for a walk or by taking him to the dog park, you are creating fond memories about you.

Encourage your dog to retrieve their toys.,
Get your dog to retrieve treats.,
Create an outdoor space free of items your dog can retrieve.",How to Manage Your Dog's Instinct to Retrieve2," Another way you can control your dog’s retrieval habits is to encourage them to retrieve only their toys and leave other items alone. To do this, you may play with them using their toys and encourage your dog to fetch their toys. Play fetch with your dog indoors and outdoors. This will get them used to retrieving their toys, rather than other items.If your dog does go towards an item they are not supposed to pick up, use the “leave it” command.
You can also try distracting your dog away from the item by holding up their toy and calling their name or saying “come.”
If your dog knows the “no” command, you may also use it to discourage them from picking up items other than their toys.

, You can also get your dog to stop retrieving items they are not supposed to by getting them to focus on treats instead. Carry treats in your pocket while you walk your dog. If they come across an item and start to try to retrieve it, distract them by pulling a treat out of your pocket. Encourage your dog to walk away from the item by holding up the treat and give it to them once they continue on the walk. Often, dogs will react better to being distracted from items rather than yelled at or yanked away from the item.You can also get your dog to focus on treats instead of items by asking, “What do you have there?” or “What’s that?” when your dog starts to pick up an item. Then, take out a treat and offer it to your dog instead.

, If you are still struggling to get your dog to leave items alone and stop retrieving items they shouldn’t, you may need to create an outdoor area that is free of these items. You may have a fenced in yard that does not contain any food, garbage, or other items that your dog may be prone to retrieving. You could then limit your dog to going outside and playing in this area so they do not pick up any items they shouldn’t."

Speak to your vet.,
Work with a certified dog trainer.,
Enroll in an obedience class.",How to Manage Your Dog's Instinct to Retrieve3," If your dog does not seem receptive to training at home, you may want to speak to your vet about their retrieving issue. Set up an appointment with your vet where you can discuss the issue and ask for guidance or advice. Your vet may ask you questions about your dog’s retrieval habits to get a better sense of the issue. Try to answer their questions as clearly and honestly as possible.For example, your vet may ask you, “What types of items does your dog tend to retrieve?” “How often does your dog retrieve these items?” “Do you notice any patterns in your dog’s retrieval habits?”

, You may also decide to work with a certified dog trainer to help your dog learn the “leave it” command and to manage their retrieval habits. Get a referral for a good dog trainer from your vet. You can also ask other pet owners for a referral to a trainer they have worked well with before.When you speak to the dog trainer, make sure they have experience working with dogs on their retrieval habits. You may also ask the trainer for referrals from other clients they have worked with in the past and their resume to ensure they are certified and experienced.

, Another option is to enroll your dog in an obedience class that focuses on managing retrieval habits. You may ask your vet to refer you to a good obedience class or speak to your trainer about a class you can try with your dog.


You may also ask other pet owners for a referral to an obedience class that they have gone to to help manage their dog’s retrieval habits.

Ask your vet about how often your dog should be washed.,
Reserve play and exercise time.,
Don't keep your little gift to yourself!,
If your dog could damage furniture, keep him/her in your largest bathroom, or an empty backroom.,
Write down the routine.",How to Make a Routine for Your Dog," How often will you feed your dog? Vets often recommend once or twice a day but some people feed outdoor/competing dogs as much as three times a day. Ask your vet how much food a day your dog should be given and simply divide these between the number of meals.

Do not overfeed as these will seriously harm your dog's health. Always feed to A set routine as this will keep your dog healthy - and also make it much easier for you to predict when your dog will need a bathroom break.



 

;
, When and how much your dog eats also effects what comes out The following times are a MUST for every dog: let your dog out after finishing every meal, after walks, after excessive play, when you wake up, and when you go to bed. When your dog just needs to let a little extra out, he or she will bend his/her back legs, raise the tail straight in the air, and will curve his/her bottom.

, Your dog, no matter what breed, needs to be bathed once every four months. Regular baths depend on the breed, skin characteristics, fur length, fur coarseness, and sometimes age. You can get special shampoo for your dog at a vet or dog breed club.

After each bath, brush your dog thoroughly, and do not rush. If your dog is an indoor dog with fine hair, a brushing once every day, in the morning, is recommended. Otherwise, occasional brushing won't hurt anybody.







, Dogs need to play and exercise every day - no matter what the weather. Play with your pet by running around, chasing it, tossing a small ball (not small enough to choke on!) to it, or getting a short thick length of rope and playing tug of war. Be friendly while playing. If your dog gets a bit too playful and nips at you, say in a low-pitched tone, ""Fido, no!"". Sound firm but not angry as you don't want to scare your dog, simply to correct the dog's behavior.

If you don't have a back yard then you definitely need to walk your dog for at least an hour a day, every day. Without sufficient exercise dogs tend to be restless and unhappy and far more inclined towards discipline problems.







, If you invite friends over, and they are comfortable with dogs, all of you should play! If you happen to see another dog with his owner on a walk, introduce your self and let the dogs sniff each other, and friendly greetings will be a sure sign that your dog is not in a canine depression.

, Never put your dog in an area with small objects on the floor, a low trash can, or nails coming out of the floor/walls. Even small dogs can knock trashcans over and sniff out some left over food. Nails can be bitten and will damage the teeth and perhaps rip tissue. Small objects can be eaten, without a very promising outcome. Always keep an open area for your dog to enjoy. A small sample carpet on hard wood floors will seem like a special seat just for your dog.

Put a blanket beside your favorite couch, if you don't allow him/her on the furniture. For a bed, you can get a small blanket, rip out the seams, and stuff the inside of the blanket with old clothes or stained pillows. This will make a cozy, inexpensive bed for your pet.







, Get a piece of letter stationery paper and write down your routine. Put it in you wallet, on your refrigerator, or blow it up and put it in a frame in your bedroom. You can also get it monogrammed into a blanket for your dog to sleep on. Get creative!

Teach your dog basic vocal commands.",How to Keep Your Dog Calm Outside His Crate," Decide what sort of behavior your want your dog to exhibit while indoors and work toward correcting behavior that doesn't fit with your expectations. If you are consistent with the boundaries you set, your dog will soon catch on. Do you want him to be completely still and quiet in the house? Is it okay for him to bark when he sees a squirrel outside?


Focus on rewarding positive behavior rather than punishing bad behavior. Give your dog a small treat or a chew toy when he is being calm.
Stick to your own rules by not rough-housing with your dog or riling him up on purpose. Deciding on a whim that it is okay for your dog to act crazy when you usually discourage this will only confuse him.;
, Although this may seem counter-intuitive, it really works. When your dog misbehaves (steals a shoe, barks, or jumps up on you), he is trying to get your attention. By acknowledging him, even in a negative way, you are reinforcing his actions. Try ignoring him when he does something wrong; this means no eye contact, no verbal communication, and no physical contact.Once your dog settles down, reward his calmness with attention. This will teach him that it was only once he relaxed that he got what he wanted from you.
If you encounter a situation you can't ignore (for instance, your dog has your child's favorite doll in his mouth), get something even better to exchange it for (like a piece of meat or a treat). Only give this to him once he lets go of the toy, and do not chase him or engage his behavior., Default behaviors are things your dog does when he doesn't know what else to do. If your dog is hyperactive whenever he's not in his crate, this probably means that his default behavior is to run around, jump, bark, or whatever. Work on transforming his default behavior to something that requires being calm (such as sitting down).This requires frequently rewarding your dog for doing whatever it is that you want his default behavior to be. Use a very small treat as the reward, and give one to him whenever he engages in this behavior on his own.
It is okay if you want your dog's default behavior to be something you can also command him to do; just be sure to make the distinction in your training by not providing the command when reinforcing his default behavior.

, You can help promote calm behavior in your dog by eliminating as many potential temptations as possible from the indoor spaces your dog frequently visits. For example: don't leave shoes lying around if your dog is a shoe-eater; close your child's bedroom door so he can't steal her toys; don't leave unattended food on tables your dog can reach. Testing your dog's willpower will usually turn out badly.In cases where you witness your dog resist temptation (for example, he walks right past that piece of chicken sitting on the dining table), you should take the opportunity to reward and praise your dog.
This is about using common sense; dogs are intuitive, but they are not self-aware. No matter how well-behaved your dog is, you can't expect him to behave perfectly. Help him out where you can!

, A dog that is well-exercised is unlikely to be hyperactive otherwise. However, there is a fine line between exercising your dog and riling him up. Walks are a good way to get rid of pent-up energy, and so are games like fetch. Just make sure you aren't encouraging your dog to go crazy while engaging in these activities.It is important that your dog gets physical exercise every day. How much exercise and how strenuous depends on your dog's age, breed, and health.Visit the American Kennel Club's breed description website to learn about your dog's needs.Your dog should receive regular mental exercise, too. You can even incorporate this into his dinner time by making him work for his food (by putting it in a dispenser or toy designed to release a little at a time).

, A crowded dog park is the ultimate context for over-stimulation. It is best to avoid these places altogether while you are training your dog to be calmer and more obedient. Don't deprive your dog of all canine interactions, though; find a playmate for your dog (preferably that of a friend or family member) that is roughly your dog's age, size, and temperament for him to interact on occasion.Prolonged and intense stimulation, such as is experienced at a dog park, may seem like a great outlet for your dog, but in reality this can wind him up and make it more difficult for him to calm down, even long afterward.
This advice applies to other situations with lots of people and/or dogs, too (such as parades, festivals, concerts, farmer's markets, etc.).

, If you hope to be able to take your dog out in public without him causing a scene, put significant effort into leash training. A leash provides any easy way to test your dog's tendencies (he'll forget he's on a leash whenever it isn't pulled tight) while allowing you to correct bad behavior. This requires lots of time and patience, and works best if you use treats to reinforce good behavior.Make sure your dog is not already overly excited before you go on your walk. Stand quietly and wait for him to stop barking, spinning, jumping, or whatever before you head outside.
Never let the dog pull on the leash. Keep him next to you at all times, and stop walking any time he jolts ahead of you and pulls.
Give him a treat when he's paying attention to you and when he's doing a good job of sticking by your side.
Use verbal commands such as ""heel"" or ""slow"" to signal your dog and reward him when he does what you are asking. Eventually, he will learn what these terms mean and respond accordingly.
Walk at a brisk pace at first to make it less difficult for your excited pooch to match your walking speed.
You can use quick, sharp jerks of the leash to tell your dog when he is behaving inappropriately -- just make sure you don't pull on it, as this could make him think pulling is okay.

, If your dog's wild behavior is the result of anxiety or nervousness (such as during the Fourth of July fireworks), you can calm him down by having him wear a shirt that gently hugs his body. This mild squeeze has a calming effect on animals (humans included) and is similar to being hugged.This will work best if you do not put your dog's Thundershirt on him unless he is feeling scared or anxious.
""Thundershirt"" is the name of a trademarked invention; visit their website for more information about their products. Alternatively, you can purchase a regular pet shirt that fits your dog snugly (but not too tightly); these are easy to find at any pet store or online.

, If you can afford to do so, look into weekly training courses led by professional animal trainers. Many pet stores offer affordable courses for dogs and their owners. The main benefit of taking these classes is exposure to tried and true training methods; this makes this option ideal for new pet owners.


Obedience school sessions can only give you the tools with which to train your dog yourself. Do not think of this as a substitute for doing the work of training; you must work with your dog outside the classroom regularly in order to see results.
If you do not already know of training classes near you, search Craigslist or other online community boards for information about local dog obedience courses.

, Although some experts differ on their opinions of the best way to train a dog, many argue that positive reinforcement is the key to success. To do this, you must use a system of rewards to teach your dog that what he is doing is good. These can be doggy snacks, physical affection, verbal praise (such as exclaiming ""good boy!""), or a combination of these things.For positive reinforcement to work, you must deliver the reward as quickly as possible following the good behavior. If you wait too long between your dog's action and the reward, he won't make the connection between the two.
Many people find that using a clicker (a small device that makes a 'click' sound when squeezed) helps dogs associate their good behavior with rewards. Clicker training manuals and equipment can be found at your local pet store or online.

, There are lots of books out there devoted to the subject of dog training. These range from basic 'starter manuals' to in-depth analyses of pet psychology. In order to keep things as simple as possible for you and your dog, start out with a guide of some sort with tips you can clearly identify and follow.


Be sure to find a book written by an expert on animal behavior. Check the credentials of the author by searching his or her name online.

, If your dog spends all night and most of the day in a crate by himself, he will be poorly socialized, bored, and have lots of pent up energy. Your dog needs to learn what behavior is acceptable and what is not, and he can't do this by being locked up all the time. An over-crated dog is often so relieved when he is let out that he has trouble containing his exuberance.Crates are best used as training tools for puppies. If at all possible, avoid locking your dog in a crate while you are at work or even overnight. With training, your dog's behavior will be good enough that you can trust him in the house unsupervised.
Keep in mind that although a crate can keep your dog from destroying furniture or urinating in the house, it can't keep him from misbehaving altogether. A barking or howling dog is no fun to deal with all the time, and they can still do this from inside a crate.

, These can include ""sit,"" ""down,"" ""stay,"" ""heel,"" or whatever else you want. Teaching your dog to respond to commands establishes you as his leader and reinforces his tendency to want to pay attention to you. The key to making these commands stick is to use rewards and maintain consistency in their use. For example, don't use ""down"" to mean both ""lie down"" and ""don't jump.""Consider using a leash during vocal command training (even in the house). If your dog disobeys you or won't pay attention, a sharp tug on the leash will serve as a correction.
Remember to reward your dog for responding appropriately to your commands (verbal or otherwise), even if this behavior immediately follows a corrective action (such as a leash tug). Otherwise, he will have no reason to obey you!

Increase the amount you feed the mother dog for several weeks.,
Monitor the mother dog's weight.",How to Feed and Hydrate a Mother Dog," Place food near the mother dog so that she doesn't have to leave the puppies to eat. Many new mothers don't want to leave their puppies to eat, so they abstain from eating for too long after giving birth.However, you can allow your dog to wait a little while to eat. Most dogs that give birth wait a few hours to eat. They need to rest and recover a bit from the whelping before attempting to eat.;
, If your mother dog is hesitant to eat dog food right after birthing puppies, you can choose to give it high-calorie foods it can't resist instead.This could be specific treats that you know it loves or adding an egg yolk or lard to its normal food., A dog that has given birth will have lost a lot of fluids during that process. Because of this, you want to get her to drink some water as soon as possible afterword. This will help to avoid dehydration.


If she doesn't want to drink plain water, try giving her a bit of chicken broth to drink. This may be more enticing to the dog than water is.

, A dog that has given birth and is breastfeeding its puppies will need to eat more food than it normally would. In fact, most dogs should be fed twice as much food as normal after they give birth. If you don't give it enough food, it won't be able to recover from whelping and feed its babies.This food should be fed in small meals throughout the day, instead of just a few large meals. This will help your dog digest the food easier.

, Puppy food is high in calories and it is highly digestible. This means that the mother can absorb the nutrients in the food quickly. Feeding the mother dog puppy food also assures that the puppies she is feeding get the proper nutrition.Feed the mother dog the food amount suggested on the puppy food packaging, but make sure to give multiple meals throughout the day or just let the dog graze on the food constantly.
In order to avoid stomach upset, mix the puppy food with the dog's normal food at first. This will help the mother dog to adjust to the puppy food gradually.

, A dog that is breastfeeding needs to drink a lot of liquid in order to produce enough milk. Make sure that the mother dog has constant access to water while she is nursing her young.You should be particularly vigilant about monitoring how much water your dog is drinking if she is being fed a dry diet., Your mother dog will need to increase the amount of milk it produces over several weeks after giving birth. It will be at peak milk production around three weeks after giving birth. At this point it will also need to be eating up to four times as much food as it did before pregnancy.This food should be spread out over at least four meals throughout the day. This will help her to digest this increased amount of food.

, A mother dog that is nursing puppies is at risk of losing too much weight. If she is not taking in enough calories to keep up with the milk production, her body will use reserves that can lead to unhealthy weight loss. In order to avoid this, make sure that your dog has not lost more than ten percent of its original weight before pregnancy.If your dog has lost too much weight you need to increase the fat and protein content of the food you are feeding it, as well as increasing the amount it eats."

Check that the breeder only breeds one or two breeds.,
Wait to see if the breeder encourages you to interact with the puppy’s parents.,
Ask the breeder about how they treat the mothers or bitches.",How to Find a Reputable Dog Breeder2," Finding an ethical, reputable breeder is very important to ensure the health of your new pup. If you contact the breeder, but they are coy about letting you see where the puppies were born and the conditions they are currently living in, this is a possible sign they are running a dirty breeding business or a puppy mill.Create a list of questions to ask during your visit to the breeder, including:How long have you been a dog breeder?
How many types of dogs do you breed at one time?
How often do you clean, feed, and play with the dogs?
Are you a registered dog breeder?
Can you show me proof of the dogs' physical health from a licensed veterinarian?
Can I meet the pup's mother or parents?
Can you provide references from other individuals or families who have purchased dogs from you before?
Can you tell me about any potential genetic issues or problems with the types of dogs you breed?
Can I return for multiple visits with my family before making a purchase?

, The breeder should be willing to show you the areas where the pups and the parents of the pups live.The living areas for the dogs should be clean, spacious and well maintained.
The dogs should be kept in roomy spaces that meet the needs of their particular breed. For example, most small breeds will be housed inside in the home, while sporting breeds will have plenty of outdoor space for exercise.

, The dogs should be lively, clean, healthy, and not shy in front of visitors. But they should also not be aggressive towards you.Note if the breeder is meeting the psychological and physical needs of their dogs by providing toys, exercise, and social interaction. If the breeder is stand offish or cold towards the dogs, this is likely a bad sign.
The puppies should also be raised in the breeder’s home, and the breeder should demonstrate care and attention to the puppies.
A reputable breeder will likely not have a constant supply of puppies, as this would indicate a puppy mill and possibly bad treatment of the animals. They may keep a list of interested buyers for the next available litter and they should be willing to refer you to other responsible breeders or breed clubs if they do not have puppies available., A good breeder should know their breed’s history and health inside and out. It’s difficult for one person to develop strong expertise about many breeds, so a good breeder will usually specialize in a single breed or maybe two.If the breeder advertises ten varieties of dog and all their mixes, they likely are not very reputable., A good breeder will offer to introduce you to the pup’s parents during your visit and be comfortable with letting you interact with the parents and the puppy.The breeder should also encourage several visits so you can take your time deciding on if the puppy is right for you, and should not mind if you ask to bring your family with you to meet the puppy.

, Pregnancy, whelping and nursing puppies can be taxing on the mother dog’s body, so a good breeder will limit the number of times they breed a bitch. Many breeders will only breed a female two or three times in the course of her life."

Be prepared to answer questions from the breeder.",How to Find a Reputable Dog Breeder3," Most reputable breeders will be registered with the American Kennel Club, so they should be willing to show you their credentials and confirm they are a registered breeder., The puppy’s parents and grandparents must be professionally evaluated, including genetic tests, to check that any issues or problems with the breed have been addressed.The breeder should also be comfortable with explaining to you in detail the potential genetic and developmental problems inherent to the breed.They should offer you guidance on how to take care and train the puppy, and be available for assistance with any issues after you take your new puppy home, especially if you’ve never owned a dog before.

, Most reputable breeders will have a strong relationship with several local vets, so they should be able to show you individual records of the vet visits for the puppy.These records ensure the puppy has been checked for diseases and health issues by a licensed veterinarian and has a clean bill of health.
The breeder should also not require you to use a specific vet for the puppy’s check ups.

, A reputable breeder should have references they can give you from other families who have purchased one of their puppies.You can also ask the breeder if they sell puppies to unknown buyers over the Internet. A reputable breeder will only sell their puppies to individuals they have met in person.

, They should allow you plenty of time to read the contract thoroughly and not pressure you into a quick sell.The contract may require you to spay or neuter the dog unless you plan to turn the pup into a show dog. As well, the contract may state you will return the dog to the breeder should you be unable to keep the dog. These are all normal stipulations of a breeder contract., In fact, a reputable breeder should be concerned about who they are selling to, and want to feel comfortable about relinquishing one of their pups into your care. They may ask you why you want a dog, who will be responsible for the pup’s daily care and training, where the dog will spent most of their time, and what “rules” you will have for the puppy.They may also ask you for proof of residency, like your lease or mortgage papers, to ensure you can provide a stable home for the pup.

Consult your veterinarian.",How to Determine the Sex of Puppies," Newborn and young puppies are very delicate. Handle them with care. Puppies can’t see or hear very well before they’re a few weeks old, so picking them up and holding them may make them nervous or fussy.Never pick up a puppy by its tail! Slide your hand under as much of the body as possible to offer the best support as you pick up the puppy.
Handle puppies as little as possible during their first two weeks after birth. Over-handling them could upset the mother dog or harm the puppies.If possible, wait until the puppies are at least 3-4 weeks old before trying to determine their sex. They will have had enough time to bond with their mother and develop a bit by then.;
, Lay the puppy in your hands on its back, with its paws in the air. Make sure you support the puppy’s whole body with your hands so you don’t stress their spine. Don’t squeeze the puppy.It may be easier if you have someone else hold the puppy so you can do the visual inspection.
You can also rest them on their backs on a warm towel spread on a table. This will help keep the puppy warm., Newborn puppies cannot maintain their own body temperature for several weeks after they’re born. They can take a chill very easily. Don’t hold the puppy away from its mother longer than is necessary. 5-10 minutes should be the limit for handling young puppies.Use a heating pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a towel in the puppy’s bed to help keep it warm., If the puppy shows signs of distress, such as squalling or squirming, put the puppy back with its mother immediately. The mother may also become distressed if she isn’t used to you handling her pups. If you notice signs of her getting distressed, such as barking at you, put the puppy back with the mother., You will probably see a “belly button,” or umbilicus. This is usually located almost at the center of the belly, just below the rib cage.If the puppy was born within the last few days, the umbilical cord may still be attached. Once the umbilical cord shrivels and falls off -- which should happen within a few days -- there will be a little scar left behind on the belly. This scar is a slightly brighter color than the surrounding skin and feels a little bit thicker.

, If your puppy is male, there will be another small raised spot or “button” of flesh about an inch or so below the scar. This is the prepuce, or sheath, of the puppy’s penis. The prepuce will have a small hole at the center.The prepuce may have little wispy hairs around it or even on it.
Do not attempt to pull out or unsheathe a male puppy’s penis until the puppy is at least 6 months old. Dogs have an os penis, or “penis bone.” You may damage the penis or penis bone if you attempt to forcibly unsheathe a young male dog’s penis., Male puppies will have testicles, although you may not be able to feel them before they are 8 weeks old.If you can locate the testicles, they will be high up between the puppy’s hind legs.


Depending on your puppy’s size, its testicles will be about the size of a lima bean. By 8 weeks old, the testicles are usually enclosed in the sack-like scrotum.

, Unlike male puppies, female puppies will have smooth bellies (other than their umbilicus scar). Females do not have a prepuce., A puppy’s anus is located directly under its tail. If your puppy is male, you will only be able to see its anus. If your puppy is female, you will see a raised, fleshy area just under the anus. This is the vulva.The vulva of a female puppy is small and leaf-shaped. It has a vertical slit. It is usually located almost directly between the puppy’s hind legs. The vulva may have some wispy hairs on it., Just like humans and other mammals, both male and female dogs have nipples. They will not inform you of a puppy’s sex., Puppies should have their first set of vaccinations at around six weeks old.If you can’t figure out what sex your puppy is, your veterinarian can help you with this during a routine visit.

Visit your vet.",How to Encourage a Mother Dog to Feed Her Litter1," A mother dog and her puppies need a clean, warm, and quiet place to nurse. Make sure you keep the temperature constant, and provide the mother and puppies with plenty of blankets and pillows for warmth. If possible, give the dogs a separate space in the house, partitioned by a door or gate.;
, It is critical that you do not separate a new mother from her litter. The mother should be with the puppies at all times to encourage proper feeding habits and ensure the puppies receive adequate nutrition. Allow the mother time away from the puppies to defecate and urinate, but then return her to her litter., Sometimes a mother dog cannot nurse her litter because she does not have enough milk available. This can sometimes be complicated by dehydration. Try giving the mother dog warm or lukewarm water. You can also give her chicken broth, as the salt may increase her thirst., If it appears as though your mother dog is not nursing her puppies, as she should be, you can gently encourage her to do so. Put the puppies up toward the mother dog’s teats. Allow the puppies to nurse., If the mother dog is reluctant to nurse her litter, or if the puppies are exhibiting signs of malnutrition, you should set up an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. A vet can help diagnose the root of the issues, as well as help you set up a manual feeding plan for the puppies.

Keep an eye on the puppies and monitor the litter to make sure they are nursing properly. Do not, however, get too close to the mother and her puppies as this could cause the mother to exhibit protective or defensive behavior., If your dog’s puppies are constantly crying, it could be an indicator that the puppies are not receiving enough nutrition. Keep an eye on puppies who are constantly crying, as it could be a sign they are not getting enough milk, and you might need to supplement by bottle feeding., Puppies should be rapidly gaining weight. The puppies should double in weight each week. If your dog’s puppies are not gaining weight, it could be a sign they are not consuming enough milk from their mother. In this case, you will want to supplement to ensure they are receiving proper nutrition and gaining weight."

Give the mother dog lots of fresh water.",How to Encourage a Mother Dog to Feed Her Litter3," It is critical that the mother dog has access to enough food while she is nursing her puppies. Nursing mothers need to consume more calories than non-nursing dogs, and, as a result, your dog will be eating more than usual. Read the label carefully on your mother dog’s food. It should include recommended portions for a lactating mother dog.It is acceptable to leave a constant supply of food out for a lactating mother and allow her to eat at will, as opposed to predetermined portions at scheduled mealtimes.

, A nursing mother dog will need to eat a diet of easily digestible, high quality food that is formulated for lactating dogs. The dog food should contain at least 17 percent dietary fat, at least 29 percent protein, and less than 5 percent dietary fiber. This diet will support milk production and puppy growth, optimizing the nursing experience for all.Ask your veterinarian for dog food suggestions for your nursing dog.

, If your dog is nursing a litter of puppies, it is important that she is hydrated at all times. A lactating dog will consume more water than she did while she was not nursing her puppies. It is important that she does so to prevent dehydration, which can cause problems for the mother and her puppies. Make sure you give the mother dog constant access to a large bowl filled with fresh water, and that you refill the bowl frequently."

Look for a red and enlarged area.,
Identify pus build up.,
Look for other signs of infection.,
Consult your vet.,
Drain the abscess.,
Administer antibiotics.,
Tube feed the puppy, if necessary.,
Keep the infected area clean.,
Watch for signs of improvement.",How to Deal with Abscesses on Newly Born Puppies," Redness and enlarged areas of skin are the most common symptom of abscesses. While abscesses may start small and may not cause you much worry, they can quickly grow and threaten the puppy’s life. When considering red and enlarged areas on a puppy, consider if:


If there is pain associated with the red and enlarged area.
The enlarged area feels warm or hot to the touch.
The reddened area grows or worsens over the course of hours or days.
Abscesses may appear as early as the first week after birth.;
, Next to a redness, pus buildup and drainage is the most clear sign of an abscess. Ultimately, pus is the outcome of the puppy’s body fighting bacteria that is focused around a wound. When looking at pus, consider:


If that pus is usually thick and yellowish.
That depending on the severity of the abscess, pus could have some blood mixed into it.
That pus may leak out occasionally.
How the pus could introduce bacteria to other wounds or to other dogs. Thus, make sure to separate the puppy from its littermates., There are a variety of signs of infection associated with abscesses. These signs may not be limited to the specific area around the abscess. They may be present in other parts of the body or may radiate outward from the area of infection. Other signs include:


Lethargy. Any weakness in a puppy is cause for concern and prompt medical attention.
Loss of appetite.
Fever.
Red lines or signs of infection radiating outward from the abscess toward other parts of the body., After identifying an abscess on a newly born puppy, you’ll need to consult your vet for guidance about treatment. Only a trained veterinarian will be able to diagnose and treat abscesses that may threaten the puppy’s life. This is especially true since puppies are very vulnerable during their first days and weeks alive.


Your veterinarian will physically examine the puppy.
The veterinarian may run some diagnostics, such as blood work, on the puppy.
Your veterinarian may also take a swab of the pus and culture it to see the type of bacteria that is causing the abscess., Draining is one of the most common ways of treating abscesses for newborn pups and adult dogs alike. By draining, the vet will allow the pus to vacate the wound. Ultimately, this helps the body to heal. In addition, it relieves pressure and associated pain that the puppy may be suffering.


The veterinarian will take a scalpel and lance the abscess. This means they will make a small incision that will allow the abscess to drain built-up pus.
Draining will reduce the size of the abscess.
Draining may need to be repeated several times over the next couple of days., After draining the abscess, your vet will prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotic are almost always needed to fight the infection that made the abscess possible in the first place.


Antibiotics courses usually run 7 to 10 days.
Antibiotics for puppies generally come in powdered form that you can mix into their formula.
Avoid missing any doses. In addition, administer the proper amount.
Your vet will likely prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic that will focus on fighting staph infections., Very young puppies may need to be tube fed after being treated for their abscess. This is because newborn pups are very susceptible to infection and need sustenance to fight infection.


To tube feed, you’ll need a tube feeding kit that includes a syringe and a 16-inch (41 cm) tube. Your vet will likely supply you with a kit.
Tube feeding must be done for every two to three hours until the puppy has shown visible signs of recovery – and can nurse on its own.
You may tube feed the puppy its mothers milk or formula – depending on what your vet recommends., After initial treatment, you need to make sure that the infected area stays clean. Ultimately, the introduction of new bacteria could result in persistent infection and the death of the new born puppy.


Apply antibiotic ointment as prescribed by your vet.
Change bandages and use disinfectant regularly.
Take steps to make sure the wound is dry.
Prevent the puppy from licking or otherwise irritating the wound. For instance, you may need to use an Elizabethan collar (a large cone-like collar) on puppies who are large enough. For smaller puppies, bandages might be enough to protect the wound., The days after initial treatment are critical in ensuring the puppy’s eventual recover from infection. Thus, you need to be diligent and monitor the puppy’s overall health and, of course, the wound itself. Consider:


The puppy’s general energy level after treatment. The puppy should begin to bounce back as soon as a day after treatment begins. Within 3 or 4 days, the puppy should clearly be on the road to recovery
Continued signs of infection.
If the wound is healing itself. After being drained several times, the wound should no longer fill up with pus and should begin to heal. If the abscess persists after 2 or 3 days, consult your veterinarian again."

Make sure your dog gets a pre-breeding health check.,
Know when your female dog is in heat.,
Avoid breeding your female dog at first heat.,
Make sure your male dog is ready to mate.,
Understand dog intercourse.,
Prevent injuries during the breeding tie.,
Understand some dogs will reject each other.",How to Deal with Common Mating Problems in Dogs1," Before you decide to breed your dog, you should make sure that they are healthy enough to do so. Make an appointment with your vet. Explain that you are planning on breeding your dog, and ask the vet to examine your dog to ensure they are healthy enough for breeding.Try saying, ""Dr. Johnson, I am interested in breeding Fluffy. Can you examine her to make sure that she's healthy enough to have a litter?"";
, Not knowing when your dog is capable of mating is a common problem. When your female dog is in heat, her eggs mature, making her fertile and capable of producing puppies. If your female dog is not in heat, she cannot mate. In order to address this problem, you should be aware of your female dog’s heat cycle. You should look for:Swelling of the vulva
Tendency to mount objects or other dogs
Vaginal discharge

, While it might be tempting to allow your female dog to mate during her first heat, you should avoid it entirely. While a female dog will go into her heat when it is between 6 and 12 months old, the dog is still maturing and should not mate. You should wait to breed your female dog until it is at least 2 years old., While a male puppy might engage in mounting behavior as early as 3-4 weeks of age, a male dog will not produce sperm until much later. You should wait until your male dog is at least 2 years old before you allow it to mate., The breeding tie is the intercourse between a male and a female dog. The male’s penis will enter the female’s vagina. The penis glands will then swell inside the female’s vagina, creating a tie. The tie will last for 10-30 minutes, and during this time the majority of the male’s sperm will be deposited in the female’s vagina.If you have specific questions about dog intercourse, ask your veterinarian when you take your dog in for its next checkup.

, After the male’s penis enters the female’s vagina and creates a breeding tie, it is important that you actively work toward preventing injuries to one or both dogs. You should stay near the dogs during the tie. Work to keep both animals calm, and do not let the female squirm free from the tie as this can injure the animals.Make sure the male dog’s penis has retracted after the tie, as an injured dog will have difficulty breeding in the future.

, A common mating problem is when a dog refuses to mate with another dog. For example, a female dog might refuse a male dog because he is her housemate. Submissive males, on the other hand, might refuse to mate with dominant females. If your dog refuses to mate with a particular dog, try using another mate."

Allow the mother to spend some time with the dead puppies.,
Remove the dead animals.,
Contact your veterinarian.",How to Deal with Puppy Deaths During Birth1," Although it might seem a little morbid to leave the dead animals in with the mother and any surviving pups, removing the dead puppies might agitate the mother. She knows how many puppies she delivered and removing the dead ones may make her frantically start looking for her pups. Instead, leave the dead pups in with the mother for a while. Eventually, she will realize they are dead, allowing you to remove them without causing her distress.Once the dead puppy’s body cools, the mother will likely notice that it is dead.
If the mother is still trying to care for any dead pups after a few days, be sure to remove them even if it causes the mother distress. Parasites from the decaying carcasses can be passed on to the mother and the remaining pups.
If the mother or surviving pups seem ill in any way, remove the dead puppies immediately. You do not want a parasite taking advantage of their weakened immune systems.;
, After you allow the mother some time to notice that the puppies are dead, remove them from the rest of the litter. It may be best to remove the dead animals while the mother is not looking to prevent unnecessary agitation. You should use a paper towel or rubber glove to grab the carcasses so that you do not infect yourself with any parasites from the decomposing animals., Once you remove the dead animals, put them in a freezer bag and place them in the freezer. You should then contact your veterinarian about having the dead animals tested. It is important that you find out if the other litter members are at risk or if the mother has some health issue that may prevent her from breeding again.If you have the placenta, include that with the dead puppies.

Clean your cages and facilities.",How to Create a Responsible Dog Breeding Program," The best way to prepare yourself for a breeding program is to visit and learn from other breeders. Breeders who have been in the business for many years will have a lot of experience they can share with you.


Contact your local kennel club for the names of breeders who are interested in mentoring new breeders.
Call breeders you've met before and ask if they will allow you to tour their facilities. For instance, say ""Hi John, we met a few years ago. I'm interested in breeding Yorkshire terriers, and I was wondering if I could take a look at your facilities and maybe ask you a few questions.""
It is important that other breeders recognize you want to establish a responsible program. When talking to them, include that language. For instance, say ""I want to start a responsible breeding program committed to bettering the breed and producing healthy and well-adjusted dogs.""
Unless you are acquainted with the breeder, avoid contacting people who focus on the same breed you intend to breed. They might see you as competition.;
, A business plan will provide you with the opportunity to research many aspects of the dog breeding business. As a result of this research, you'll be able to compile all of the relevant information you'll need into one document. In the end, this will help you decide whether dog breeding -- and your specific plan -- is viable.


Choose a breed and research it.
Investigate laws and regulations concerning dog breeding in your region. For instance, call your local animal control officer or the police department.
Research the climate and competition for the breed you are interested in breeding. Take a look at local shelters to see if there is an excess of those dogs. In addition, do a internet search to see if there are many breeders in your area that focus on the same breed.
Estimate the amount of money you'll need to start your business. Include facilities (cages, yard space, and more), reserve money for vet bills, reserve money for food, and money for permits and related expenses.
Make sure your insurance will cover you, or see if you can get a small business owner's insurance policy for your new business.
Calculate how much money and how long it would take for you to break even on your expenses given responsible breeding practices., After you've written your business plan, you need to begin the search for facilities to house your breeding program. In the end, the facilities will depend on the scale of your operation, your existing situation, and the region in which you live.


Make sure you have plenty of space. For instance, depending on the breed you pick, you'll likely need large indoor and outdoor runs for the dogs.
Based on your prior research, make sure the location you are going to pick is zoned properly and meets local ordinances. For instance, you may not be able to have a commercial breeding program in a suburban neighborhood.
Locate or be prepared to construct fenced-in runs or other structures. It may be possible for you to convert existing builders. For instance, you may be able to repurpose a barn or old chicken house.
Make sure your facilities are structurally sound and meet kennel club and Humane Society guidelines for the treatment of animals., Spend some time to learn about the history of your breeding stock’s bloodline. Knowing about your dog’s pedigree will help make sure your stock is the best, is healthy, and that your puppies will be attractive adoptees.


If possible, ascertain registration paperwork from a naturally or internationally recognized kennel club or association verifying the pedigree of your dogs. This will also improve the marketability of any puppies your breeding stock produces. Examples of kennel clubs in the United States include the American Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club.
Consider having genetic testing done to verify the pedigree of your breeding stock DNA testing will confirm pure bread status or inform you of the different breeds your dogs are descended from., One of the biggest mistakes that breeders make is to perpetuate certain disorders and congenital medical problems. Responsible breeders make sure to use only the healthiest dogs.


Never breed dogs with conditions that might be inherited. For instance, white boxers that are deaf, or pugs that develop hip dysplasia early in life.
If you don’t know the medical history of a dog, either don’t breed it or contact people who owned the dog’s parents or grandparents.
Consult a veterinarian if you have questions about a dog’s medical condition., The best breeding dogs are dogs with good temperaments that reflect breed-based behavioral standards. Dogs that don’t reflect these standards, or exhibit an aggressive temperament, should never be bred.


For example, per the American Kennel Club, the Afghan hound’s personality characteristics are independent, silly, and sweet. Dogs without these characteristics should not be bread.
Any dogs that demonstrate aggression to other dogs or humans should never be bred., Whether you are an experienced breeder or a novice, there are some basics about the mating process you need to review before creating a responsible breeding program.


Dogs can start mating between 12 months and 24 months. The exact time depends on the breed and size of the dog. Consult your vet or kennel club for more information.
Female dogs go into heat -- the period in which they can conceive -- between 1 and 4 times every year.
The heating cycle lasts about 21 days.
Many breeders recognize the 9th or 10th day of heat as the best time for conception.
Pair the male and female on days 9, 11, and 13 of the female's cycle for the best chance at conception., As the center of your breeding program, your dogs should be treated well and have good living conditions. Without good treatment and living conditions, they may develop problems that interfere with pregnancy. In addition, the moral and ethical imperatives of dog breeding demand you to treat dogs in a humane manner.


Provide good living conditions for your breeding stock. For instance, if your dogs are pets, you should provide them large indoor-outdoor runs and the ability to access open spaces and run freely during a substantial part of the day.
Never breed a dog when she is too young or old. For most breeds, female dogs should not be bred before age 2 or after age 5.
Provide enough time between pregnancies for the dog to recover. Always wait at least one heat for recuperation between pregnancies., Invest serious time and energy into picking good and responsible caretakers for your puppies. Ultimately, a responsible breeder is one who is serious about placing their dogs in good homes.


Interview prospective owners. Ask questions about who will be primary care taker, why they want a certain breed, and if they have enough money to pay for food and vet costs.
Schedule a home visit. Check to see if they have a fenced-in yard, if there are apparent dangers in the home, and if there are other pets present.
Ask for personal and professional references. Prospective owners may submit personal references from friends and family, and professional references from veterinarians and other breeders., Over breeding for profit is one of the hallmarks of irresponsible breeding programs. Overbreeding not only increases the population of dogs that need homes, but may result in lower prices and decreased ability to select only the best homes for your dogs. Make sure to:


Never breed more dogs than you can responsibly care for.
Avoid breeding dogs that that are in overabundance in your area. For instance, if dog shelters and rescue groups have dozens of boxers or treeing walker coonhounds, as a pet lover and a responsible breeder, you should not breed anymore., Devote time early on to making sure the puppies are socialized properly. By socializing the puppies, you’ll be working to make sure they can adjust to their new homes.


After the puppies have had their first vaccines, expose them to other animals. For instance, introduce them to a tame older cat or dog.
Make sure the puppies meet a lot of different people, including children. However, make sure to supervise all interaction between the puppies and children.
When appropriate, take the puppies for a walk or somewhere else outside the house. Getting the puppies used to new environments will ease their transition when they find their forever home., Perhaps the most important thing to do, health wise, is to immunize your dogs regularly. Immunizations are important not just for your bitch and stud, but for the puppies as well.


Your breeding stock – male and female dogs you will mate – should always be up to date on all standard vaccinations. This includes annual and semiannual leptospirosis, distemper, rabies, and bordetella vaccines.
Newborn puppies should have their first round of puppy shots at 6 weeks, their second round at 9 weeks, and their third at 12 weeks.
Common puppy vaccinations include hepatitis, canine distemper, parvovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus cough, and leptospirosis., Health care is the most important aspect of maintaining a healthy breeding program. Without regular vet care, you’ll jeopardize the health and well-being of your mating dogs and puppies.


Take your dogs to the vet every annually or biannually.
Have your pregnant bitches see the vet as often as needed. Make sure to have your vet perform diagnostics like ultrasounds to verify that pregnancy is proceeding normally., One of the major problems associated with large scale breeding programs is lack of cleanliness. An unclean and unsanitary environment can endanger your puppies. In addition, potential clients will be turned off if they view an unsanitary facility.


Remove fecal matter and urine from any enclosures or runs.
Use appropriate disinfectant and use it correctly. For instance, when using bleach, make sure to water it down to one part bleach and thirty-two parts water.
Wash blankets, toys, and other items when they are dirty.
Bathe mature dogs once a month and bathe puppies as needed."

Test your dog for brucellosis.,
Have your male dog tested for prostatic problems.,
Get your female dog tested for hormonal disturbances.,
Consider a reproductive specialist.",How to Deal with Common Mating Problems in Dogs2," If you are having trouble mating your dog, it is possible your dog could be suffering from brucellosis. Brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease that affects dogs. It can cause spontaneous abortion in pregnant dogs, and it can cause sterility in both male and female dogs.Symptoms include lethargy, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty walking, vaginal discharge, and swollen testicles.

, It is not uncommon for male dogs to suffer from prostatic problems. These issues are one of the major contributing causes of infertility in male dogs. Ask your vet to examine your dog for prostatic problems that might affect its ejaculate volume and sperm mobility.Symptoms include difficulty urinating, lethargy, difficulty walking, and bloody discharge from the penis.

, Female dogs often do not produce puppies because of hormonal imbalances and the medical issues associated with such imbalances. Examples include persistent estrus, split heat, and hypothyroidism. Ask your vet to conduct tests to determine if your female dog is suffering from a medical condition resulting from hormonal disturbance., While some mating problems in dogs, such as poor timing, are easily remedied, others require extensive testing or treatment. If your dog is having reproductive issues that cannot be easily solved by you or your vet, consider taking your dog to a reproductive specialist. Veterinary teaching hospitals, for example, often have such specialists."
"
Consider the ethics of breeding dogs.,
Breed for improvement.,
Work to encourage genetic diversity.",How to Deal with Common Mating Problems in Dogs3," Before you decide to allow your dog to mate, you should seriously consider the ethical implications. It is important to understand that there is an overpopulation of dogs, and that every day dogs are euthanized. Instead of producing puppies, consider adopting a shelter dog., If you breed your dog, you should embrace the philosophy of “breed to improve.” This means that you should examine your dog carefully and note its flaws. Then, you should choose a mater that can either balance or entirely eliminate those flaws in offspring.For example, if your dog suffers from arthritis, you should breed her with a dog that does not have arthritis.
If your dog suffers from a breed-specific health problem, such as hip dysplasia, try breeding him with a mate who does not suffer from the same ailment.

, If you choose to breed your dog, you should make an effort to cooperate with other breeders in geographic regions other than your own. This will help facilitate the movement of genes within a breed between locales. This is especially important if you are dealing with a breed whose population is small.For example, you should not breed your dog with a dog that lives in your town. If possible try to make connections with a breeder in another part of your state or country.
Make sure you ask for the genealogical history of any dog you choose to mate with your dog. This can ensure that you are not breeding your dog with a distant (or close!) relative.

Let the veterinarian dispose of them.,
Contact animal control.,
Bury your puppies.",How to Deal with Puppy Deaths During Birth2," If you send the carcasses to the veterinarian for testing, they will dispose of the deceased animals after they perform their tests on them. Depending on their facilities, they may incinerate or bury the animals. You may also request the remains if you want to dispose of the animals yourself.Typically, the vet will dispose of any dead animals for free after performing a necropsy.

, If you do not contact your veterinarian and are unsure about how to dispose the dead animals, call your local animal control. They will help you determine the best way of disposing of the carcasses. You can also take the dead puppies to your local animal services center and see if they will dispose of them for you., In most places, you can bury deceased animals on your own property. If you have small children, you may want to have a small burial ceremony to help them deal with the death. For something as small as a puppy, a shoebox should work as a coffin. You should bury the dead animal at least two feet (61 cm) deep to prevent scavengers from digging it up.Be sure to find out what your local rules and regulations are before burying the deceased animals.
You may also want to explore the option of burying the animals in a pet cemetery.
If you feel particularly attached to the dead puppies, you can also look into having them cremated and keeping their ashes in an urn.

Cope with the grief.,
Explain what happened.,
Comfort your grieving family members.,
Remember your pet.",How to Deal with Puppy Deaths During Birth3," The death of puppies can be a difficult event to manage emotionally. You may experience sadness, anger, or even denial that the puppies passed away. Acknowledging these emotions and expressing them, as opposed to suppressing them and acting as if they are not there, will help you address and eventually deal with your sadness.In order to address your grief, you might consider joining a pet-loss support group. You might also write about your loss in a journal or visit a mental health professional to deal with your grief.

, If you have children, it is important that your talk with them about the death of the puppy or puppies. Explain to them that this is a normal and natural occurrence and that many young animals do not survive infancy. Because your children will likely have been very excited about the arrival of puppies, you should prepare yourself for them to be very sad and disappointed.To avoid your child feeling betrayed, tell them about the death of the puppies right away.
Once you get the necropsy report back from the vet, you may want to let your child know what caused the puppies’ death. Say something like “I know that it’s sad, but this is a natural part of life.”
You might break the news to your children by saying something like “I have some bad news about the puppies” or “There’s something I need to tell you about the puppies.”

, Listen to your child’s questions about the loss of the puppies and be sure to give them answers that are appropriate and do not traumatize them. Let them know that it is okay to be sad and that disappointment is a normal feeling in this situation. Finally, be on the lookout for signs that your child is struggling with the grief. Talk to your child if they have difficulty sleeping, seem constantly sad, or have a hard time in school.Seeing a dead animal for the first time, especially if they are the puppies of your family’s pet dog, may be traumatic for your children. Try to comfort them by saying things like “At least the puppies didn’t experience any pain” or “This is nobody’s fault. These things happen sometimes.”

, Give yourself and your family the opportunity to express their grief and remember your pets through a ceremony or tribute. You can hold a burial ceremony in your backyard or plant a special tree or flower to remember the puppies. You can ask your child to help you in the planning of the ceremony or talk about ways that they would like to pay tribute to the animals."
"
Spay your dog.,
Visit your veterinarian.,
Isolate the mother for three weeks before delivery.",How to Deal with Puppy Deaths During Birth4," The best way to prevent stillborn puppies or death in infancy is to spay your dog. This is particularly true if your dog has lost puppies in previous pregnancies. Unless you are a professional dog breeder, you should have your dog spayed before its first heat, which is usually around 5 to 6 months of age.Young dogs that become pregnant are more likely to miscarry and have stillborn puppies. They are also less likely to be able to properly care for their puppies and meet their nutritional needs.

, If you want to breed your dog, you should visit your veterinarian to make sure that your dog is healthy enough to deliver puppies successfully. Many dogs suffer from genetic problems that make healthy delivery of puppies difficult. If your dog is pregnant, you should set up regular veterinary checkups to make sure that the pregnancy is progressing normally. Although it will not eliminate it, working with a veterinarian will limit the likelihood of stillborn puppies.


You should also contact your veterinarian if any complications arise during your dog’s labor.

, One of the leading causes of stillborn puppies is a herpes infection. If the mother is infected while pregnant, she will likely lose the entire litter. To avoid this, you should isolate the mother from any other dogs for at least the last three weeks of the pregnancy.You should also keep the mother and pups isolated for at least three weeks after the birth.
Transmission occurs by direct contact. This includes sexual contact as well as nosing, sniffing, and licking other dogs.

Remove all soiled items after the birth.,
Fix the mother and her litter a clean, soft bed.,
Replace the bedding daily.",How to Clean a Mother Dog After She Gives Birth1," After the mother dog is finished giving birth, you should remove all the soiled newspaper, blankets, or other material. This material will contain blood, fluid, and tissue from the birth.Removing the soiled items promptly reduces the risk of contamination and infection.;
, After you remove the soiled material in the whelping box, replace it with clean blankets. You may consider placing newspaper down, especially in the first few days because the mother may not leave the puppies, even to go to the bathroom.Make sure the bedding is appropriate for the puppies, as well. It should not have any loose threads or large loops that could wrap around limbs, no holes that the puppies could become trapped under, and nothing so big or plush that it could smother a puppy.

, During the first few weeks, the bedding in the whelping box should be removed and replaced with clean bedding. This should be done multiple times each day. For the first few days, the mother dog may not even leave the box to go to the bathroom, so you should keep an eye on the bedding in case this happens and change it immediately.The mother dog will also be responsible for the elimination of waste in the puppies during the first few weeks, so the puppy’s waste may end up on the bedding, too.
Be sure to stay away from inappropriate bedding material such as wood shavings or sawdust. While these might be absorbent in the case of an accident, they can be dangerous to both mother and puppies. A soft, washable fabric with disposable liner sheets underneath is ideal.

Find a reputable breeder.,
Understand purchase contracts.,
Request a health history report.,
Decide if you want a male, female, or both, for breeding.,
Consider partnering with a breeder.,
Choose a poodle size that meets AKC standard.,
Familiarize yourself with coat colors and consistency.,
Learn the typical behaviors of poodles.,
Spend time with puppies.",How to Choose a Poodle for Breeding," You want to make sure you’ve found a breeder who will not only offer you quality dogs to breed, but who will also provide you helpful tips. Most importantly for you when it comes to breeding your own dogs, having a good relationship with an existing breeder can be extremely helpful in developing an ethical and successful breeding program.


Clean facilities are extremely important. This shows the dogs are well cared for and comfortable, and that the breeder invests time in facility maintenance.
The number of litters a breeder produces per year can also be indicative of whether their breeding programs are ethical. Dogs who are overbred are more likely to die at a younger age, and they often produce sick puppies. Ask the breeder, ""Do you allow the dam to rest for one heat between mating?""
Ask the breeder for specific information including pedigree, how long they've been breeding, and how many litters the dam whose puppy you're considering has had.
Expect honesty when the breeder is answering questions. For any pet buyer, a reputable breeder should want to offer clear, honest information, but for a potential pet owner who also wants to breed dogs, this is extremely important. Misinformation from the original breeder may lead to complications for your breeding program.
If a breeder avoids answering or changes their answers, point this out. Say something like, ""Last time I was here, you said this was her third litter. Today you said second, which is accurate?"";
, This documentation is how the breeder provides accurate information on the poodle’s pedigree and health history. Contracts should also include pricing information, trial period agreements, and return and refund arrangements.


Request at least three generations of pedigree to ensure the dog you choose does not have any of the common inherited diseases in its bloodline.
Know what the fair pricing is before you buy. Poodles can be priced anywhere between $500 and $2500. The cost depends on a number of different elements, including the pedigree of the dog’s parents, any AKC recognition of the puppy you’re buying, and how closely the poodle meets the breed standard.
Before paying for and taking home the poodle of your choice for breeding, ask about the trial period, refund, and return policies. If for some reason, you change your mind about the poodle you’ve chosen, it’s important that you have clearly outlined these agreements to make sure you can get your money back, if you change your mind about the puppy you’ve selected, find a comparable poodle at a better price, or are suddenly able to purchase a puppy you liked better who was previously claimed., This is necessary for both of the parents and the puppy you’re interested in. Knowing the hereditary illnesses that frequently effect poodles and ensuring they have been tested for is essential. These common illnesses and tests


All poodles that are bred should have the CERF test for inherited eye diseases
Make sure your poodle and its parents received testing for von Willderbrand’s disease.
Ensure OFA testing for hip and elbow dysplasia.
All poodles should undergo sebaceous adenitis test for skin disease biannually
Testing for Progressive Retinol Atrophy (PRA) should be completed prior to purchase
Females should be tested for brucellosis, a common disease contracted during mating., If you want to be involved in the fast paced world of poodle breeding without having to deal with the daily work required, owning a male dog may be for you. If you’d rather be involved with the breeding process from start to finish, owning a female dog may be the right choice. You should consider owning a breeding pair, if you have the space and time to devote to care.


If you own a male dog, you’ll only have to be involved in the actual mating process. There’s no need for multiple, often costly veterinary visits. You simply leave the male dog or sire with the female’s owner for a few weeks two or three times a year for mating. Each male poodle receives a stud fee between $500 and $2500.
If you own the female poodle called a dam or bitch, you’ll need to care for the male and female dog during the mating period, and provide full veterinary treatment and at-home care throughout pregnancy for the dam. However, apart from the stud fee between $500 and $2500, the full profit associated with breeding and selling poodles goes to the owner of the dam.
If you own a breeding pair, you’ll be able to keep the full profit of the poodle breeding and sales process, but you’ll also be responsible for the cost of caring for both the male and female dog.
If you reach the point where you’re doing well with a breeding pair, you may want to consider buying another breeding pair to grow your business if you have the time add space to accommodate two additional dogs., If you’ve found a breeder you liked working with to purchase your puppy, ask them about the possibility of partnering. If you’ve chosen a male or female dog, you may want to breed with one of their dogs. If you have a breeding pair, you can ask them for tips or mentorship when it comes to running your breeding program.


When talking to a potential breeding partner, ask, “Are you at all interested in developing a partnership with a new breeder?”
If you already have a breeding program, you can ask the breeder, “Do you have a male or female do who would be available for breeding with my dog?”
You can also consider saying something like, “You run a very ethical breeding program here. May I ask you for recommendations and assistance as I start developing my own breeding program?”, It’s important to know the size and shape of the toy, miniature, or standard poodle you’re interested in and how they fit into the American Kennel Club (or parallel organization in other countries) standards. Regardless of the type of poodle, the height from ground to the tip of the shoulder should be the same as the length from the breastbone to the tailbone.


Toy poodles should be no taller than ten inches at the shoulder.
Miniature poodles are between ten and fifteen inches at the shoulder.
Standard poodles are any poodles more than fifteen inches at the shoulder., Poodles of all sizes have similar coat styles. Naturally, the poodle’s coat is curly, coarse, and dense. The AKC standard also allows for poodle hair to be corded, hanging in long, varying lengths in tightly wound cords. Poodles are available in a variety of colors, including blue, gray, silver, brown, café au lait, apricot, and cream. Regardless of the coat color, the poodle’s coloring should be even and consistent at the hairline., This is a highly intelligent breed of dogs who are very active, carry themselves with dignity, and have a great sense of humor. If you notice any characteristics different from those outlined in the AKC standards or you notice snippy or shy behavior, you may want to look for a different poodle. While dogs that deviate from the standard behavior are not necessarily bad dogs for the right person, it’s important to breed only the best personality characteristics to improve the overall quality of your puppies.


Poodles that respond to new sights and sounds with curiosity are preferred over those who shy away from new stimuli.
Poodles should interact with other dogs in a playful but non-aggressive manner. For instance biting and nipping at the sides or haunches with tale wagging is considered playful. Lunging, growling, and biting the face or neck are aggressive behaviors.
Dogs should allow you to pet them, view their teeth, and pick them up without showing aggression or fear., Make sure to take as much time as you need to get to know a puppy before making the investment. This is important whether you’re selecting a dog for a pet or for breeding. You’re going to need to spend a significant amount of time with the dog, so choose one who will fit into your family and routines.


Visit the poodle puppies at various points before purchasing. Watching how the dogs develop in size and personality will help you better estimate how they will behave in the future.
Take the dog home for a trial period whenever possible. This can usually be written into a purchase agreement. This trial period allows you to get to know how the dog will behave outside of its current environment.
Ask if you can walk the puppy or take it to a dog park. Seeing how a poodle responds to other people and dogs will help you understand how it will behave."

Use a damp cloth to clean the mother.,
Try not to upset the mother.,
Pick up any leftover placenta.",How to Clean a Mother Dog After She Gives Birth2," After the birth, you should use a warm, damp cloth to clean the mother. Wipe all blood, tissue, and fluid from the mother’s fur and skin, wiping back from the vulva. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria and reduces the risk of infection.The mother dog will pass fluid and tissue through the next few weeks. You should continue to clean this up when you see it to keep the mother dog and the puppies free from bacteria.

, When you clean the mother, do it gently. Don’t upset her by being rough with her or cleaning her too harshly. When you wash around the birth area, make sure to be gentle.When you are cleaning the mother, make sure not to take her away from the puppies. Moving away from the puppies can upset her.

, The mother dog will clean the puppies and eat the placenta as she births each puppy. However, if the mother does not have time to do this with every puppy, the placenta may remain on the puppies and in the box. If this happens, gently remove the placenta with a warm, damp towel.Be careful when removing the placenta from the puppies. Use gentle, tender strokes to clean the puppies, and avoid the umbilical area.

Refrain giving the dog a bath for a few days.,
Make sure the mother dog is completely dry before returning to the box.,
Trim the dog’s hair.",How to Clean a Mother Dog After She Gives Birth3," The mother dog will want to spend all of her time with her puppies in the first few weeks. This is especially true for the first few days. The puppies will use their sense of smell to connect to the mother dog during this time. This means you should avoid giving your dog a bath for the first few days.Instead, wait two to five days after the birth to give the mother dog a bath.

, When you give your dog a bath, make sure to dry their underbelly really well with a towel. Let them air dry for a few minutes if possible. This is especially important for long-haired dogs. A wet underbelly can cause the puppies to get chilled, which could lead to a drop in temperature, which can be fatal for puppies.If you have a long-haired dog, you may want to dry their hair using a blowdryer.

, If your dog has long hair, you may want to trim the hair from the underside of her body. This can help the puppies find the nipples and help keep that area clean from any waste or bacteria.You may also want to trim the hair around her bottom before the birth to reduce the mess. If the hair has blood, fluid, or tissue in it from the birth, you may consider just trimming the hair.

Ensure your beagle is not spayed.,
Take her for a check-up.,
Test her temperament.,
Make sure she’s the right age.,
Determine when she has been in heat.",How to Choose a Beagle for Breeding1," When you are looking at a potential female beagle (or dam) to breed, you must first ensure that she has not been spayed. Your first step should be to look for a scar on her lower abdomen. The presence of such a scar indicates that she probably has been spayed. For a more thorough diagnostic test, you should bring your potential dog to see a vet., You’ll want to have your potential dog tested for genetic issues that could be passed down to her puppies. You’ll also want to test for any hereditary diseases. Additionally, testing should include hips, CERF, elbows, CCD, and thyroid. Take your dog to see a vet and rule out any problems., In addition to a clean bill of health, you will want a dog with a good, stable temperament. A local dog trainer or local chapter of the American Temperament Test Society can do a quick test on your dog to see if she is prone to anger or panic.These mood swings can be passed down to your puppies, or may even make breeding difficult.

, According to the American Kennel Club, the female dog (or dam) must be at least 8 months old we she is bred. However, many breeders recommend waiting until she is at least 2 years old. This allows her body to grow and mature before enduring the stress of pregnancy. Females are normally retired from breeding by the age of 7 years old. Once again, if you are not sure about your dog’s age, a vet can give you a ballpark figure., A female, of course, will only breed when in heat. A female dog will go into heat about twice a year. If you can find out from a breeder or previous owner approximately the last time she went into heat, you can determine if she will be ready to breed soon enough for your timeline to allow."

Find a healthy male.,
Ensure that he has not been neutered.,
Test his temperament.,
Look for a compatible weight.,
Look for a compatible size.",How to Choose a Beagle for Breeding2," Just as with your female, you will want to ensure your stud is free from health issues, including genetic and hereditary problems. Bring your potential stud to a vet and have him tested. Testing should also include hips, CERF, elbows, CCD, and thyroid, just like when you brought your female in., Just as with your female dog, you will need to ensure that the male dog you choose has not been fixed. Fortunately, with male dogs, it is a bit easier to tell. Simply look and see if the dog still has his testicles. If you see testicles, the dog has not been neutered and may be a potential mate for your female dog.

, Once again, the temperament of the dog can be passed down to his offspring. Furthermore, an unruly temperament can make a stud difficult to breed with. Bring in a dog trainer or contact a local chapter of the American Temperament Test Society in order to test your stud’s temperament., You will need to find a male that is compatible to your female in terms of weight. It is perfectly fine if the female weighs more than the male (in fact, this is ideal). The male beagle, on the other hand, should never weigh more than 3 pounds more than the female., Beagles are available in 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. These are not considered separate breeds, but merely two distinct sizes of the same breed. Look for a stud that is the same size as your female or a smaller.The American Kennel Club (AKC) does not recognize a “pocket beagle.” This is term used by breeders to try to make extra small puppies seem appealing.

Select a stud dog who can improve the traits of your female.",How to Choose a Beagle for Breeding3," If you are attempting to breed a champion beagle, you must select a female dog from a matrilineal  line you can study. You will want a female with AKC papers and a good pedigree that you can verify., A champion beagle must be able to run in a smooth straight line. Be sure that your female can accomplish this with ease, not making an jerky stops or clumsy movements., A champion dog must be able to follow behind, or to lead, without being overly competitive. Look for this skill and temperament in a dog you seek to breed., A “check” is what happens when a dog gets off the line and tries to fix it again. A champion dog will be able to do this calmly and with focus. This is not usually a skill that can be taught to a dog who doesn’t have a natural aptitude, so it is very important for you to look for this ability in the dog you seek to breed., If your female dog has many positive traits, but also a few shortcomings, you may be able to locate a stud dog who can compliment your female, and improve upon some of these traits in your puppies. Identify any areas where your female dog needs improvement, and look for these as outstanding traits in the stud you choose."

, Does your dog have desirable breed traits? Does it meet breed standard minimums? According to the American Kennel Club a Yorkie should exhibit these traits:The Yorkie's body should be compact and well proportioned.
In addition, a Yorkie's head should be “small and rather flat on top, the skull not too prominent or round, the muzzle not too long, with the bite neither undershot nor overshot and teeth sound. Either scissors bite or level bite is acceptable. The nose is black. Eyes are medium in size and not too prominent; dark in color and sparkling with a sharp, intelligent expression. Eye rims are dark. Ears are small, V-shaped, carried erect and set not too far apart.”, It should appear confident but should be friendly towards people and not fearful. Fearfulness in dogs can be hereditary or a learned trait but you do not want to risk perpetuating a bad hereditary trait., A dog pregnancy could result in complications, which could cost you a lot of money. Possible complications to consider include an emergency C-section or serious medical conditions occurring in the mother. These can include hypocalcemia, metritis, or mastitis.


Are you prepared to raise any unsold puppies? All the puppies in any given litter do not always sell, so you need to be aware that you may be taking on a lifelong financial responsibility for a new puppy.

, Raising puppies is a full-time job. You will need time for daily handling and socializing the puppies, as only puppies that are socialized to humans make good pets.


The time spent playing and bonding with the puppies is in addition to the time it takes to care for them. Feeding and cleaning after puppies is no small job.

, If you are looking to adopt a Yorkie you can breed, you should get the name of a well-respected breeder that has a good track record with successful offspring. Good breeders will encourage you to visit them, have good looking and social dogs and puppies, give the dogs plenty of room to roam, will only breed one type of dog, and will interview you about how you will raise the dog they bred.Contact local Yorkie clubs for a list of local breeders that do not run puppy mills.If there are no well-established breeders in your area, you may need to travel to get a dog that has all the positive breeding traits you want.
When you are interacting with a well-regarded breeder, pay attention to how the person conducts business and how he or she interacts with the dogs. You can learn a lot just from watching how a professional conducts business.
Make sure to assess all aspects of the breeding process. Use a checklist to make sure you have covered your bases, like the one provided by the Humane Society., The external parts of the male Yorkie’s reproductive system are the penis and the scrotum. The scrotum is a pouch that holds the dog's testicles. The sperm, which fertilize the female's egg, are produced in the testes.Male dogs should ideally have two testes, which move from inside the body down into the scrotum during puberty. A mature male's testes are located outside the abdomen because the internal body temperature is too warm for sperm to grow normally. Because of this, dogs with undescended testes (testicles that do not move down into the scrotum) do not make good candidates to breed, as the problem can be inherited. They should be neutered because undescended testicles can cause health problems later.

, Most of the female Yorkie’s reproductive system is located inside her body. The only visible part is the vulva. Inside, the ovaries produce eggs and the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone.After eggs are fertilized by sperm, they attach to the uterine lining and grow into puppies.

, About one month before you breed your Yorkie it should be examined by a veterinarian. The vet should make sure the female is healthy enough to carry a pregnancy to term and that the male is free of diseases and physical problems.

, Track the female's reproductive cycle so that you know when she will go into heat next. In general, a female dog generally goes into heat twice a year.


The heat cycle starts with a preparatory stage, proestrus, when the vulva swells and a light bloody discharge occurs for 7-9 days. After this stage the bleeding slows down and the dog becomes receptive to breeding. This stage is called estrus or standing heat and is the most fertile time for breeding.
Your veterinarian can determine if your dog is in heat by swabbing the inside of her vagina with a cotton swab. By examining the cells on the swab under a microscope the vet can determine if it is the right time for breeding.

, When the female is physically ready to breed, she will bow to him and back into him. The male will usually reciprocate this interest and mount her for breeding. This process usually occurs naturally, without any outside intervention needed., You want to have people lined up who are going to adopt the puppies when they are born. The last thing you want is to be stuck with too many dogs.


Advertise your puppies on local list-servs for Yorkie owners or with your local chapter of national dog organizations.
Make a list of potential buyers. Since you won't know exactly how many puppies your dog will have, you need to basically make a waiting list. Let potential buyers know where they fall on the list, so that they know there is a chance they will not get a puppy in this litter.

Offer advice before and after placing your dog.",How to Create a Sound Reputation As a Dog Breeder," You should never breed a dog unless you have their bloodlines’ medical history. Without having medical history, you may perpetuate genetic flaws, disorders, or other medical problems.


Make sure you have registration paperwork with a nationally or internationally recognized kennel club or association. For instance, the American Kennel Club allows you to register your pure bred dog. If your dog is already registered, they may have your dog’s family breeding history.
Gather information about a dog’s medical or breed history. If you’ve had the dog and its blood line in your family for years, you should already have this information. If you don’t, contact the breeder or person you acquired your dog from for a medical history.;
, You should never breed dogs that have health problems that they can pass on to future generations. The main reason for this is that it is ethically wrong. By irresponsibly breeding dogs with health problems, or not checking to rule out health problems before you breed them, you may be creating a future generation of puppies that will suffer as a result of an inherited disease.


Ensure that each parent in your breeding stock is free from inheritable diseases. For example, you would need to be screening for hip and elbow problems in Labradors and screening Collies for Collie Eye Anomaly. If you are not sure what diseases your breed of dog is susceptible to, talk to your veterinarian and ask about screening options.
Never breed dogs with a history of medical problems. For instance, avoid breeding boxers who develop tumors or pugs that develop hip dysplasia early., Whenever thinking about breeding a dog, you need to make sure to gather all records pertaining to their behavioral history.


Make sure you have personal experience with the dog.
The best dogs to breed are those that conform to the behavior traits most associated with the breed. For instance, herding dogs like collies are generally anxious, protective, and obedient.
The worst dogs to breed are those that demonstrate problematic behavior attributes for their breed or type of dog. For instance, bad traits for collies include: fear-based aggression, separation anxiety, and destructiveness.
Gather information about the behavior of the dogs’ parents or grandparents.
Never breed a dog that has shown aggression toward other dogs or humans., One of the biggest problems with breeders is the penchant to produce more puppies than they can place in good, well-qualified and responsible homes. When this happens, breeders will often lower their prices, standards, or just give away dogs.


Lowering your price or qualifications may result in you placing a dog in a poor home. The dog may suffer abuse, develop bad habits, and contribute to your poor reputation.
Overbreeding places a strain on the mother, which is morally wrong. Reputable breeders will not overbreed because they care about the health and well-being of their dogs, not just their profits. Overbreeding of dogs may also result in overpopulation and an excess of a certain breed in an area. This will lower the price of that breed, hurting your business. In addition, if you overbreed, you will likely develop a poor reputation with your competitors, kennels, and veterinarians., Without following positive habits, you'll put your dogs -- especially your female dogs -- at risk. In addition, you'll gain a reputation as a greedy and unscrupulous breeder.Wait until your dogs reach sexual maturity before breeding them. For most dogs, this is two years.
Provide time between pregnancies. In most cases, this is one heat cycle. Many dog breeds cycle two or three times a year. As a result, you should only breed a female dog once a year -- or twice a year if they cycle a lot.
Never breed a female dog older than five years.
Check with your vet before you breed a dog.
Breeding a female dog more than five times may put the mother dog and puppies at risk.

, The best time to socialize your puppies is when they are between the ages of three and 12 weeks. This is the time when they will be the most likely to accept new people and experiences. As dogs get older, they are less likely to accept new things, so it is important to start the socialization process early.While it is important to start socializing your puppies early, you also do not want to rush things. Make sure that you give your puppies plenty of time to get used to new stimuli. Don’t expose them to too much too quick.For example, before taking your puppies to a busy park with lots of people in it, start by letting them get used to being around a small group of strangers, such as a few friends that they have not met yet. Then, work up to taking them to a public place as they grow more comfortable with new people.

, The more you can expose your puppies to when they are still young, the better. Puppies will grow into more relaxed, well-adjusted dogs if you expose them to as many people, places, and things as you can early on. Some things you should expose the puppies to include:Different types of people.
Other dogs and cats.
Different types of places and things, such as parks, crowds, and people riding bicycles.
Loud noises, such as thunder and passing cars.

, To encourage your puppies as they encounter new people and situations, make sure to provide them with lots of positive reinforcement. This will help them to see the experience as a positive one and be less likely to be frightened of it the next time they encounter it.You can use a combination of praise, petting, and treats to provide positive reinforcement.
Make sure that you are confident when you introduce your puppies to new situations. If you seem nervous, then they may pick up on it and feel nervous as well.

, After your puppies have been vaccinated, you can enroll them in a puppy class to begin getting socialized with other dogs and people. This will give you a structured environment for socializing your puppies with the help of a professional dog trainer.These classes are offered by pet stores and dog trainers.

, Make sure all dogs in your care regularly see a veterinarian, and have been dewormed and vaccinated. Without regular medical care and precautionary measures like deworming and vaccinations, you could be jeopardizing the health of a pregnant dog or newborn puppies. Make sure to:


See a veterinarian regularly while your dog is pregnant.
Have all your dogs immunized on a regular schedule. One of the biggest causes of puppy death is lack of immunizations and healthcare in the weeks and months following birth.
Have all of your puppies and dogs wormed on a regular schedule.
Be sure to get preventative care for the mother and her puppies while they are under your care. This includes all of their recommended deworming and vaccinations.
Follow the recommendations of your vet., Caring for and creating a loving space for your dogs is critical in producing loving dogs that will make great family pets. Thus, you need to go out of your way to create a space that nurtures your dogs.


Treat the pregnant dog well. Love her and show her affection. Affection, like genetics, is passed down from a mother to puppies.
Play with the puppies when it is time to appropriately do so. Make sure to handle them, love them, and get them used to human contact. The more well-adjusted they are, the happier your clients will be., One of the biggest problems with many breeders is the unsanitary nature of their facilities. By keeping an unsanitary environment, you’ll endanger the health and well-being of your dogs and turn off customers who may visit your facilities.


Clean runs and cages daily. Remove fecal matter and urine.
Use safe cleaning solvents that are safe, and use them appropriately. For instance, if you use bleach, make sure to dilute it at a ratio of 1 part bleach for every 32 parts water. In addition, make sure to rinse kennels and other surfaces thoroughly after applying any sort of cleaning solution.
Bathe your dogs at least once a month under normal circumstances., Ultimately, after your dogs, your clientele is the most important aspect of maintaining a good reputation as a breeder. This is because the environment of a home is a huge influence on the character of the dog. If you place your dogs in bad homes, the dogs themselves will develop bad habits.


Ask for references from friends, vets, and other animal care professionals.
Ask questions gauging the preparation and intentions of the family. For instance, ask: “Why are you interested in a dog?” or “Why do you want to adopt this particular breed?” or “Who will be primarily responsible for taking care of the dog?” You’ll be able to make a decent judgement just based off simple questions.
Schedule a home visit so you can see the conditions that any dog you place will live in. Pay special attention to safety, such as the availability of chemicals, people food, or small pieces of plastic out in the open. Identify if the person has a fenced yard? If the person does not, do they intend to walk the dog, let the dog roam, or will they chain it to a tree? Lack of a fence might be a red flag for you., Always make sure to accept your customer’s feedback and accept their calls whenever they have a question or want to offer you feed back.


Whenever a customer calls, you should politely and enthusiastically answer the phone and address any question or problem they might have. If the customer has a problem, start your response with “I’m sorry you are having difficulty,” and then proceed to explain what they should do to remedy the problem.
Create a formal avenue for customer feedback. For example, when you provide them with paper work associated with the adoption, also provide them with a survey card asking them about their perception of you as a breeder., As word of mouth can only get you so far, you need to spend some time formally managing your reputation. Thankfully, technology and the publishing industry makes this fairly easy. Consider:


Craft a website for your breeding business. Your website can be very simple -- just sections for basic information about you and your dogs, photographs of puppies and breeding stock, and maybe even some testimonials from satisfied customers.
Create a small ad or flyer with basic information about your business. Ask other pet care professionals, like vets or kennel owners, to put up your flyer. Publish the ad in local newspapers, if you need extra business.
Don’t hesitate to ask for formal testimonials from clients you know are happy with you as a breeder. Post these on a website or on a wall in your home or office., Perhaps the most important aspect of winning your clients’ appreciation is offering them advice and appropriate information before and after they adopt a dog from you. This way, you’ll make sure that they are on track to succeed as new dog parents.


Provide instructions on how to care for a new puppy. This should include information on food, housetraining, toys, and immunizations.
Let prospective owners know the average costs for dog ownership.
Provide prospective owners with details about the breed-related medical problems, temperament, and life span."

A reputable breeder will only raise one particular type of breed of dog, so identifying your preferences will automatically narrow down your contact choices.You can identify a breed that is a good fit for you by looking at the traits of the group. For example, take into account the breed’s fitness level as well as their particular grooming needs.;
, Ask them if there is a particular breed that they would recommend for you. And, see if they have any recommendations regarding local breeders. Most good breeders will have a strong working relationship with a local vet, in order for their dogs to receive the best of care. This is a great way to find out about those breeders who don’t advertise their services, but do a good job.You might ask, “Do you provide care for any breeders in the area? What type of dogs do they breed and would you recommend them to me?”

, Your local dog club likely keeps a detailed list of breeders operating in their area. Get ahold of your local group by going to the American Kennel Club (AKC website) and searching for the chapter directory. The national AKC can also put you into contact with a breeder referral expert who will assess your needs a provide you with al list of vetted breeders.You can also search for a breeder using the AKC National Puppy Finder registry, located on their main website. This is a system that allows you to find breeder names by entering in your selection criteria, including breed type.

, Owning a purebred dog is great and you can often find these types of dogs in shelters as well. It make take a bit of time and you may need to get an older dog, but adopting can be well worth the effort. You should also consider a mixed breed dog if you are not interested in dog competitions. Mixed breeds are often considered more healthy than their pure counterparts.The AKC actually has a paperwork process that you can follow if you’d like to register an adopted dog as a purebred one for competitive or breeding purposes. Look at the AKC website for additional details.
To find a local shelter in your area, you can go to the Petfinder website. Or, you can enter your city name and “animal adoption” into a search engine.

, Once you’ve got a breeder’s contact information, reach out to them as soon as you can. It may take a few attempts to finally establish contact as breeders are known for being extraordinarily busy and they spend a great deal of time outdoors. If you call, just leave a message with all of your contact details.If you leave a message, it is a good idea to tell the breeder how you found out about them. They may be more likely to call you back quickly if you found them via a professional contact, such as a vet.
In your opening statements, you may also want to make it clear that you are not interested in just any purebred dog, but that you are looking for one that meets particular requirements regarding lineage and care. You might say, “I’m trying to find a Pomeranian breeder who manages the breeding process from start to finish.”

, After you’ve passed the introductory phase, you should head into a conversation about the breeder’s background and professional credentials. Ask if they belong to any dog organizations. Verify that they have a breed specialty and ask how long they’ve been in business.It is also a good idea to ask how long they’ve been in business at the same location. Some bad breeders move their operations multiple times in order to cover up animal cruelty investigations or simply bad reputations.
You can also ask a breeder why they choose to breed dogs instead of simply owning them. Many breeders will express their passion for the breed and their desire to participate in the upkeep of pure bloodlines.

, A good breeder will raise only a handful of litters a year, in order to give their full attention to each puppy. Ask them how many successful placements they’ve made and how they determine the mating pairings. Ask how many puppy they’ve had returned as well for health or behavioral issues.

, A good breeder should be in love with that particular breed of dog and more than willing to tell you anything and everything about its characteristics. You can inquire about the type of grooming care that the breed needs or perhaps even what type of food they would recommend. If you have a family, you might discuss how well the breed does interacting with a number of people in a home setting., You are buying the breed, but you are also buying a single puppy with a unique personality. Talk with the breeder about whether or not they raise the puppies in-house or purchase them elsewhere. The best breeders do everything themselves. In your conversation, the breeder will likely mention a particular litter that they think will fit your needs.If the breeder offers to place you on a waitlist pending the next litter, this is a good thing. It means that your breeder is in demand, but not overbreeding. Agree to be placed on the list, but ask for a time estimate.Most dog breeders will allow you to take home your puppy when it is between 8-12 weeks old. This allows time for socialization., Good dog breeders will always offer specific documentation showing that the puppy you’ll adopt is healthy both in a general sense and genetically. The documentation will be breed-specific and from a regulatory agency, such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals., Your puppy purchase is an investment with long-term consequences and, as such, you should ask the breeder to provide a set of personal and professional references. They may put you into contact with their vet, prior buyers, or even fellow breeders. Make sure to contact these people asap as you go through the buying process., Just as you are curious about them, you should expect that the breeder will want to know a great deal about you. They will likely inquire about your home environment. They may ask about your lifestyle and whether or not you have the time to devote to dog care. Be as honest as you can and give detailed answers to move the process along., You may be lucky and find a local breeder. But, even if your breeder lives a distance away, you should personally visit their facility at least one time, preferably more. Good breeders will welcome this opportunity and will work with you to set arrangements shortly after your first conversation.Keep your travel costs and your schedule in mind when you first contact the breeder. You want to be able to make a quick decision if they offer you a visit.
Some breeders welcome family visits as well. If you are adopting the puppy into a family, this is an important moment to see how the puppy, and breed in general, interacts with your child or partner., From the moment you arrive, try to observe as much as you can about your surroundings. Pay particular attention to the boarding facility itself. Note the cleanliness of the lodgings and their appearance overall. Look to see if there is room for the dogs to play and comfortable areas for them to sleep.No kennel is spotless. A little dirt is to be expected. However, the presence of general refuse, trash, or feces are not signs of a good facility. Check the cleanliness of the food and water bowls., You should be given the opportunity to see the dogs in general, and your potential puppy more specifically. Try to play with the dogs to see how they interact. Look at their overall appearance to get an idea of their health. Do they appear well socialized? Do you see weeping eyes (a sign of sickness)?"

Breeders can tell you firsthand what to expect from the experience, what troubles might arise, and what mistakes you should avoid. The American Shih Tzu Club has several breeder referral volunteers who can be contacted for advice about the breed as well as contact information for Shih Tzu breeders., Raising an average litter requires at least 130 hours of a breeder’s time, and may require days off work and sleepless nights. Make sure that you are ready to commit the time and personal effort required to care for both puppies and their mother throughout the process of breeding; remember that a mother can’t be left alone during the process of whelping (i.e. giving birth), and that newborn puppies require daily care and checking. Feeding and socializing the puppies, cleaning, paperwork, and interviewing buyers will all require long periods of your time as well., Before going into dog breeding, you should know that it is not a money-making endeavor. Good breeders prioritize the good of the breed and the welfare of their puppies over profit - as such, the process may not offer a large return. Costs include food, health care and vaccinations, facilities, documents for proof of quality, advertising, and stud fees (if applicable)., First time breeders don’t have established reputations or references and run the risk of not selling their puppies. Ask yourself what you will do if your puppies don’t sell, and if you are willing to care for them on a long-term basis if they don’t. While unscrupulous breeders often get rid of puppies that don’t sell, or sell them to laboratories or other undesirable buyers, good breeders will accept the liability. You should also be prepared, financially and mentally, for the possibility of having unhealthy puppies in your litter., You must make sure that both the female (dam) and male (sire) are healthy and genetically fit for breeding, and that their vaccinations are current. Testing should be done for conditions that the Shih Tzu breed is prone to, such as heritable eye diseases, Hip Dysplasia, Renal Dysplasia, thyroid disorders, and hearing loss. Once a dog is cleared of one of these conditions, it can be registered with the appropriate registry (e.g. once a dog is tested and cleared of heritable eye diseases, it can be registered with the the local Canine Eye Registry).>


The female Shih Tzu should get a thorough pre-breeding physical examination by a veterinarian about a month before breeding begins., The best time for your female Shih Tzu to be bred is between her second heat cycle and the age of 7; because of health risks, dogs older than 7 should not be bred. Female Shih Tzus stay in heat (i.e. the period in a dog’s reproductive cycle when she is receptive to mating) for approximately 16 days, but are usually not receptive to males on the first day of this period.If a female is not ready to mate, she will run from or avoid a male; if she is ready, she will stay and move her tail to the side to signal her readiness.

, Put up flyers, take out a classified ad, or look online for possible studs. Remember that, as a general rule, a male should be smaller than the female Shih Tzu it breeds with by a pound or two. It should also complement your female Shih Tzu in terms of attributes and qualities, and offer genetic strengths that will result in strong, quality offspring (e.g. a good coat)., Before breeding occurs, you should work out a contract with the stud's owner outlining obligations, fees, and payment. Stud fees can run between $250-$1000, depending on the quality of the male. but some contracts will outline other forms of payment to the stud's owner (e.g. the pick of the litter in lieu of cash payment). Both parties should sign and keep a copy of the contract., Given that females are more comfortable in new environments than males, you should bring the female to the stud, and not vice versa. Depending on the details of your agreement with the stud's owner, you can either go back for breeding visits as scheduled, or leave the female in the custody of the stud owner during the breeding period. Make sure that all such terms are outlined before the process begins., The average gestation time for a Shih Tzu is between 59 to 65 days from the date of breeding. While signs of pregnancy may be misleading (e.g. increased appetite, weight gain), a veterinarian can confirm pregnancy around day 28. The veterinarian can also advise you about how to care for and feed your pregnant Shih Tzu., Prepare for the birth of the puppies by making a whelping box (i.e. a place for your Shih Tzu to give birth). This could be a cardboard box with low edges, a wooden box, or any other box that is wide enough to accomodate the female and the puppies, once they are born. Introduce the whelping box early enough for your Shih Tzu to get used to it before giving birth; line it with towels to make it more comfortable., Approximately 24 hours before whelping, the female's temperature will drop. As the time to give birth approaches, she will begin to demonstrate more signs of discomfort (panting, seeming restless). For Shih Tzus, whelping generally lasts 3-8 hours, depending on the number of puppies and the strength of contractions.Dogs are generally able to give birth without assistance, but you should be present to do the following (when, and if, needed):Removing the placental membrane or cutting the umbilical cord in the event that the mother does not do it on her own
Count the placentas delivered to make sure that no placentas have been retained
Call the veterinarian in the event of an emergency (e.g. two hours or more between delivery of puppies in the litter, a common issue for small dogs like Shih Tzus)

, Puppies should be weighed every day to make sure they're growing, and that they are healthy. Make sure that all puppies are nursing properly, and that they're kept warm; a heating pad or heating lamp can be used, if necessary. Once puppies are weaned from their mother, they will need to be fed; at this point, it is wise to start socializing the puppies to improve their temperament and get them accustomed to canine and human interactions.

, After giving birth, the female will require some extra attention. After whelping, she will need three to four times more food than her regular diet in order to nourish her puppies. Be sure that she consumes calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D to avoid eclampsia., Register your litter with the American Kennel Club shortly after whelping. This will demonstrate to potential buyers that you're a responsible breeder, and it will establish each individual puppy as an important part of the betterment of their breed. New owners of these puppies will have access to the group's events, services, and information., The price of Shih Tzu puppies can range tremendously, so you should set a price for yours and stick to it. Prices is based on whether or not the puppies have already been vaccinated, the prices of other local breeders, and your reputation as a breeder. Being consistent about your prices will give you credibility as a serious breeder., You should put a lot of thought and effort into choosing new owners for your Shih Tzu puppies, and make sure that potential owners are making the right choice for their lifestyles. Shih Tzus are excellent companion dogs who do not require a lot of exercise, but require daily grooming; if buyers are looking for a more playful and energetic breed, or if you simply do not think a Shih Tzu is what they want, do not sell to them. Good breeders are responsible for the well-being of their puppies long after they are sold."

Some dog breeds, like pugs, are particularly sensitive to extremes in temperature. You should never leave a dog unattended outdoors for prolonged periods of time, especially if the weather is going to be very hot or very cold. Humidity and wind chill can also endanger a pet. All dogs are sensitive to humidity because they pant to cool themselves, and if the air is very humid their bodies will overheat very quickly.Check the weather and the humidity/wind chill levels before leaving your dog outside.Add the air temperature (in Fahrenheit) plus the humidity level, and if that number is higher than 150 your dog is at risk of heat stroke. For example, if it's 77 degrees Fahrenheit with 80 percent humidity, the total (157) is high enough that your dog should stay indoors.If the temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius), you should keep your dog indoors.Wind chill can quickly kill dogs left outdoors, regardless of what the air temperature is.Bring your dog indoors if the air temperature or the wind chill drops below freezing in your area.Short-haired dog breeds are generally more uncomfortable in cold weather, while long-haired dog breeds are generally more uncomfortable in hot weather.
As a general rule, if you're too warm or cold while exposed to the elements outdoors, your dog will be too.;
, Dogs need constant access to fresh, clean drinking water. In hot weather, dogs will need to drink even more water. You can help keep your dog cooler in hot weather by adding ice to the water bowl., Dogs need relief from the elements, and if you don't let your dog indoors that relief will have to be provided outside. Your dog will also need a place to retreat to if it starts to rain or snow, or if your pet simply wants to feel safe and protected.Dog houses don't protect dogs on hot days. If anything, the confining space actually makes your dog even hotter.
Shade from overhead trees is ideal. If you don't have trees in your yard, you can hang tarps across part of the yard to give your dog a breezy, shaded spot.
Your dog should also have a covered area to retreat to if it rains. A small dog house or some other type of shelter would be ideal for this situation.
Make sure your dog's shelter blocks out the wind if you plan on leaving your dog outdoors during the winter.Your dog should have a raised bed so it is not lying on the ground, whether it's hot out or cold. You may want to consider an insulated doghouse as well to protect against heat and cold., Dogs need exercise every day in order to stay physically and mentally fit. If your dog is not getting enough exercise, leaving it outdoors in the yard will lead to bored, restless behavior. That behavior is often destructive and undesirable.You may assume that being outside in the yard is its own form of exercise, but to your dog, it may feel like abandonment.Never leave your dog in the yard without first giving it some type of exercise.
Make sure your dog gets at least two long walks each day that leave your pet tired and panting. This will help ensure that your dog isn't bored or restless in the yard.

, In addition to exercise, dogs need time to play. It's good for their minds and bodies, as the physical exhaustion of play is usually mixed with solving puzzles, hunting, or chasing.Try leaving chew toys in the yard, as well as toys that can be filled with food. Kong toys, for example, will keep your dog occupied and make your pet feel like it's working to earn its food.

, Leaving a dog unattended in the yard is generally considered safe if it's for brief periods of time. However, every dog is different, and some dogs may have intense anxiety about being left alone. This can lead to undesirable behavior issues like digging, chewing, fighting the fence, and incessant barking.Remember that dogs are pack animals. They need companionship, and if you leave them alone outside all the time they may experience psychological trauma.If your dog is alone for prolonged periods of time, it will get bored and create destructive ""jobs"" to relieve that boredom.
To ensure your dog is safe and is not engaging in any behavioral problems, keep unsupervised outdoor time to a minimum.

, The safest way to keep a dog on your property is by having a fenced-in yard. Even if your yard is currently fenced-in, there's always a risk that your dog could potentially jump over the fence or dig underneath it to escape.Make sure your fence is tall enough that your dog won't be able to jump over it. Ask your vet or a qualified dog trainer how high your dog (based on breed, body size, etc.) can realistically jump.
Check your fence for weaknesses. A strong dog could easily break through a weak fence or squeeze through a small gap.
If you don't want to fence in your whole yard, consider building a dog run. You can buy and connect chain link fence sections, then put a roof over the run so your dog will have shade and won't be able to jump out.

, Though a tethered line may seem ideal for outdoor time, especially for dogs that dig or jump, it's actually quite dangerous. Dogs can easily injure themselves by getting tangled up in a rope, leash, or chain, which is why it's so important to supervise your dog at all times.Accidental strangulation is a significant risk when dogs are left tied up alone for prolonged periods of time.
Dog left tied up or chained in the yard frequently have built-up energy and aggression. These dogs may take out that aggression on people, including family members.
Some states, counties, and cities actually have laws against tethering dogs.Keeping your dog tied or chained could result in fines and may end with your dog being taken from your home.

, Many people falsely assume that a dog can be safely left outdoors with an electronic fence in place. However, electronic fences are actually quite unsafe for dogs. Dogs often run through the fence barrier to chase animals or flee from fireworks and are reluctant to cross back into the yard, leaving them wandering the streets aimlessly.The shock from an electronic fence can be quite painful. It can lead to burns and even cardiac problems.
Just because your dog is confined to the yard, that doesn't mean your dog is safe. Other aggressive dogs can easily cross into your yard and attack your dog, while dog thieves can easily steal your pet right out of your yard.

, Barking is a common problem when dogs are left alone in the yard. Some dogs bark out of fear, some bark to get attention, some think they're protecting the home, and others bark compulsively. When dogs are left alone outdoors they often become confused or bored and develop new tasks (like barking incessantly) to release their energy and pass the time.Sometimes dogs bark in the yard to ""defend"" their territory. If your dog is engaging in territorial barking, you may need to put up a plastic film or a spray-based glass coating so your dog can't see passersby on the street.Training can help break your dog out of some barking habits. It's generally recommended that you avoid using anti-bark collars, as these essentially punish the dog.
Some dogs will simply bark incessantly if left alone in the yard. If this is the case, your dog is likely unhappy being alone in the yard, and the best solution is to keep your pet indoors., Dogs may escape a yard out of fear and anxiety or simply out of boredom. However, to your dog, escaping the yard isn't bad behavior; most dogs just see it as a fun, compelling thing to do. Electronic fences and tethering are common solutions for escape tactics, but these options are actually very dangerous (and potentially fatal) for dogs. If your dog compulsively escapes your yard, you may need to keep it indoors.Check the height of your fence to see if your dog could jump over it. You should also check the bottom of the fence for any gaps your dog may be able to squeeze under.
Repair broken fences or gaps in the fence. An ideal fence would be a 6-foot privacy fence, but you can also build a securely-fenced dog run anywhere in your yard.If your dog tends to dig, line the fence with rocks or dig a trench and fill it with cement. This can help prevent your dog from getting under the fence.
Have your dog spayed or neutered. Dogs that have been spayed/neutered are less likely to run away during heat cycles and less likely to chase or fight other animals.The best way to prevent your dog from escaping out of your yard is to keep your pet indoors as much as possible. This will make it feel like part of the family and will ensure that your dog has limited chances to escape and wander.

, Some dogs try to escape when left alone because they are afraid of abandonment.Other dogs flee because they're afraid of something in your neighborhood. In the case of fear, you'll need to determine what your dog is afraid of and gradually expose your pet to that thing. If your dog has separation anxiety, you'll need to work with a trainer or veterinarian to address your pet's behavior.Keep your dog indoors if you can't avoid whatever frightening stimulus is making your dog fearful. You can also provide a relaxing ""safe place"" where your dog can retreat and hide from unpleasant stimuli.
Leaving articles of clothing that smell like you may help calm an anxious dog. Try leaving a shirt or blanket that you've worn/used but have not yet washed and see if it soothes your dog.
Anti-anxiety medications are available for dogs. Talk to your vet if you think your dog has severe separation anxiety.
The best way to prevent running away out of fear and anxiety is to keep your dog supervised at all times. If you can't be there, leave your dog with a trusted friend or at a doggie daycare facility while you're gone.

Making temporary blockades around bedroom furniture such as beds and dressers can keep your puppy from hiding in a space it shouldn’t.Fashion blockades out of a wooden board, cardboard, or other objects such as large pillows and even wadded fabric. Placing other pieces of furniture in front of access points can also blockade open spaces.
Put a blockade between a box spring or mattress and the floor. This can keep your puppy from getting under your bed and not coming out. Close any small spaces exposed by dressers or side tables.;
, In addition to bedding, many people keep electronics such as TVs, stereos, or devices in their bedrooms. Hiding any potentially dangerous cords and wires can minimize the risk of injury or even death.Check for wires hanging from electronics including TVs, DVD players, stereos, lamps, and telephones. Take all cords, including power strips, off of the floor and keep them out of sight. You can do this by hiding them behind furniture or putting them on top of tables. Running cords through a cable-managing tube is another great option to hide them.Consider putting a cover over electrical outlets, unplugging electronics, and getting rid of frayed wires. This can minimize the risk of electrocution by chewing.

, Puppies are curious and love to play. Your puppy may see toys or other knick-knacks in your bedroom as chew toys. Small pieces are easy to swallow and choke your puppy. It can also knock over small items, possibly causing injury.Store toys in a closed closet or in a bin that your puppy can’t reach. Place small knick-knacks, such as figurines or hair ties, in a spot that your puppy can’t reach by jumping or pulling fabric.

, Many bedrooms have heating or cooling devices to keep you comfortable through the night. But these can also present a danger to a puppy. Cover and secure any heating and air vents or fans to minimize the risk that your puppy burns itself or gets too cold.Purchase your temperature control units with covers that you can get at pet stores and large retailers.

, You may have plants in your room to give it a bit more atmosphere. Many plant species are poisonous to puppies and dogs. In addition, your puppy may try jumping from nearby spaces to hanging plants. Move any potentially poisonous or hanging plants to a place your puppy can’t access. Some poisonous plants for puppies include:Aloe
Holly
Calla Lily
Ivy
Carnations
Gardenia
Sweet pea
Tulip

, Your clothing may have strings and/or embellishments that can serious injury to your puppy’s intestines. Put clothing items on hangers in closed closets and dressers. This can keep your puppy from accessing them and minimize the risk of injury from eating clothing.Keep your closets and dresser drawers closed at all times. This can keep a curious puppy from ingesting potentially harmful clothing items.

, Even items that don’t seem dangerous, such as shoes or clothes, can injure a puppy if ingested. Keeping your laundry in a tall and closed can keep your puppy from eating something that could harm it. It can also save special items of yours.Keep the laundry basket off the floor if possible. If not, use a tall and closed hamper if possible. You can also store the laundry basket in a closed closet., Puppies may see shoes as chew toys. This may not seem particularly dangerous, but pieces can break off shoes, choking your puppy or harming its intestines. Keep your shoes in containers, on a shoe rack, or in a closed closet so your puppy can’t access them., In addition to clothing, shoes, and other larger items, small or undetectable hazards such as buttons, strings, or toy parts may be in your bedroom. These can also be a choking hazard for a puppy. Cleaning your room regularly and spot cleaning daily can prevent your puppy from ingesting potentially hazardous items.Vacuum your bedroom at least once a week to ensure that you get any invisible items such as strings or buttons.
Pick up any clothing, toys, or other small items and put them in a place your puppy can’t reach them.

, Many people have a bathroom that connects to their bedroom. This can also present your puppy with all kind of potentially harmful items, including a spot to grab a “drink.” Securing your en suite bathroom can minimize the risk of injury or even death.Put cleaners, chemicals or medication in cabinets with childproof latches or on shelves your puppy can’t reach.
Cover your garbage can so your puppy can’t access chemicals, medications, or items such as feminine hygiene products. Consider putting the trash bin inside a latched cabinet.
Close the toilet lid to minimize the risk of your puppy falling in, drowning, or drinking water with chemicals. Consider placing childproof latch on the toilet to keep your puppy safe.

, The best way to ensure you’ve puppy proofed your bedroom is to check it from the vantage point of your puppy. Look over each area of your bedroom and note if you see any potential problems. Ask yourself questions including the following as you inspect each area:Is there anything to eat, drink or chew here?
How can I get at forbidden items?
Can I hide or get stuck in this space?
What items might fall, strangle, electrocute, or harm me?

, Every bedroom has a variety of nooks and crannies and potential items that could harm your puppy. After you identify spots that might injure your puppy, fix or remedy them as soon as possible. This can minimize the risk of injury and even death for your puppy.


Invest in items such as closed hampers, hangers, or outlet covers. This may cost you a bit of money, but could save you from expensive vet bills in the long run.

, After fixing potential problems in your bedroom, you may still have questions. Talking to your about your concerns can help you figure out additional ways to puppy proof your bedroom. Ask your vet about training and what alternatives to bedroom items your puppy may like. Take your puppy to the vet if it accidentally ingests something it shouldn’t from your bedroom. For example, “Hi Dr. Merker, Baloo got into my closet and ate some glitter from a shirt of mine. Can you have a look to see if he’s ok? Also, how can I keep Baloo from digging and prying my closet open?” Your doctor can treat any injuries and suggest ways to prevent further harm to your puppy.

, Dogs and puppies that are trained are less likely to get into things they shouldn’t. Start training your puppy as soon as you get it. This can ensure that your puppy doesn’t destroy anything of yours and protect it from potential harm.Consider using a professional trainer or taking your puppy to training classes if you don’t have enough time to consistently train your puppy.

Consider the pros and cons of breeding your dogs.",How to Breed Scottish Cocker Spaniels1," There are two ways that cocker spaniels are bred. The first way to use one purebred cocker spaniel parent and one purebred Scottish terrier parent. This will put the genetics of your puppy at roughly 50% of each breed. Another popular way is called multigenerational breeding; this is where the parents themselves are both Scottish cockers. While they may be the product of multiple generations of breeding, they may not have a perfect ratio of cocker spaniel to Scottish terrier.You can also breed one purebred parent to one multigenerational parent to help strengthen certain breed characteristics in your dog’s pedigree.
With mixes, it is very difficult to tell the temperament, markings, or characteristics of the puppies, as there is an equal chance that they will inherit something from one ancestral breed or the other. Look to the parents themselves as an example of what the puppies might turn out like.;
, If you do not have a male dog, you can hire one from a breeder. You can look for other Scottish cocker breeders, or you can find one who breeds either cocker spaniels or Scottish terriers. If you are looking for a purebred stud, contact a local kennel club. They can refer you to a registered breeder.


Stud fees can cost hundreds of dollars, especially if the stud is a purebred.Always make sure to have a written contract between you and the breeder beforehand. The stud’s owner may ask for a fee. You may also be asked to show proof that your dog is not carrying any diseases., Artificial insemination is not uncommon in breeding dogs. If you are having trouble locating a stud, you can ask your vet about buying sperm from a semen bank. This frozen semen will be sent to your vet, who will then impregnate your dog at the proper time in her heat cycle. Many of these semen banks have been genetically tested to ensure that you are receiving the proper breed of dog.Artificial insemination is expensive, however., A vet can help you decide if your dog is ready to mate and help you determine when they are going into heat. They can also provide genetic tests on both parents. Breeding puppies, even in mixed breeds, can bring the risk of genetic disorders in the litter. While mixed breeds do have a lower incidence of these genetic problems, they are vulnerable to any disorder common in either parent.


Cocker spaniels are prone to certain eye conditions, such as glaucoma, Retinal Pigment Epithelial Dystrophy, and Progressive Retinal Atrophy. They may also have hip dysplasia or chronic pancreatitis.Scotties are known for a blood clotting disease known as von Willebrand’s disease and neurological issues such as cerebellar abiotrophy., While your dog may not be pregnant yet, one of the most important things that you can do is start locating homes for the puppies right away. If you are struggling to find people willing to take the puppies, you may want to reconsider breeding Scottish cockers until you are able to find enough interested homes. Do not just assume that adopters will appear when the puppies are born., Puppies are cute, and it can be extremely rewarding to help bring new little lives into the world. There are not many Scottish cocker breeders currently, and by breeding a litter, you can help others find the perfect dog. That said, there are many dogs currently living in shelters. Adopting can save both money and a life.Before you breed, consider the following:


Can you afford the medical costs associated with a canine pregnancy?
Are you able to supervise the puppies around the clock for the first eight weeks of their life?
Do you have potential homes for all of the puppies?
What will you do with a puppy if an adoption falls through?
Is your dog healthy enough to mate or carry puppies?

Wait for the female to go in heat.,
Mate the dogs.,
Ask the vet for a pregnancy test.,
Give your dog a well-rounded diet.,
Designate a whelping box.,
Get an x-ray done.",How to Breed Scottish Cocker Spaniels2," Heat is the period when your female dog is ready to mate. You may notice that your dog is urinating more than usual or that they are leaving behind a bloody discharge. This is a sign that they have started their heat cycle. Do not mate your dog right away. You should wait until you notice the dog going into the second stage of their cycle. This is marked by:


Swelling or enlarged vulva
Discharge turning from red to clear or brown
The dog’s tail moving to the side, instead of tucked under their body
The dog giving off a distinct smell meant to attract malesIf you are uncertain when your dog is ready to mate, the vet can perform either a vaginal smear or a progesterone test to let you know the best window for mating., Leave the dogs together. After the male mounts the female, you may notice that the two does are stuck together. This is called “tying,” and it is a sign that their mating is complete. Do not attempt to separate the dogs, as this can injure them. They will separate naturally within half an hour.If you have a hired a stud, you should take the female dog to the stud to mate, as male dogs may not mate in an unfamiliar environment., About 30 days after the mating, you can bring your dog into the vet for a pregnancy test. The vet may do an ultrasound, blood test, or abdominal palpitation to screen for pregnancy. Always have the dog’s pregnancy verified by a vet, as dogs can sometimes fake pregnancy., There is no special diet for pregnant dogs. Your dog will eat roughly the same amount of food for the first half of the pregnancy. After the fourth or fifth week, you can start slowly increasing their meals until they are eating about 25-50% more food than their normal diet. You can use commercial dog food, as long as it has all of the proper nutrients. A good dog food contains at least 29% protein and 17% fat.In the last twenty days of pregnancy, you may want to switch to puppy food to help your dog digest their meals.Small dogs, like Scottish cockers, may prefer wet or canned food during their pregnancy., When your dog is ready to give birth, she will want a dry, warm, and safe area. A whelping box is a special bed where your dog can give birth and raise her puppies. Whelping boxes can be purchased, or you can build your own. Find a quiet and warm area to place the box.


Show your dog the box. You may even want to place blankets inside. Do this early on so that your dog is familiar with it.
Dogs without a whelping box may choose an area of the house to give in birth in, such as a closet.
You may want to set up a heat lamp in one corner of the whelping box. This will keep the puppies warm, especially after delivery., X-rays can help your vet determine how many puppies are to be expected. While this the best way to know the litter size, it can only be done late in the pregnancy. Cocker spaniels may have litters of between four and eight puppies while Scottish terriers tend to have between four and six.You can have x-rays done around day 45 of the pregnancy, but you may have a more accurate litter size if you wait until at least day 56."
"
Watch the mother for signs of labor.,
Supervise the delivery.,
Call your vet.",How to Breed Scottish Cocker Spaniels3," Dogs typically give birth after 60 days. You will know when your dog is ready as she will begin to make a nest in her whelping box with blankets and toys. Take the dog’s temperature every few hours. The temperature will drop to below 100 °F (38 °C) roughly twenty-four hours before the delivery. When your dog’s cervix dilates, she is ready to give birth.Once you notice nesting behavior, you may want to line the whelping box with newspaper. Once the birth is over, you can toss out the newspaper and replace it with blankets., In most cases, you will not need to do anything to help your dog give birth. Do watch the birth carefully in case something does go wrong. In some cases, you may be able to step in and solve the problem.


Puppies are born inside membrane sacs. The mother removes these by licking them. If your dog does not remove the sac, you should try opening it yourself within a few minutes of its birth. Break the membrane around the puppy’s head with your hands, and peel it back. Rub away any fluids or mucus around the puppy’s mouth and nose.
If the mother still won’t lick the puppy, rub the puppy gently in a towel to help it breathe.
Count the puppies and the placentas. There should be one placenta for every puppy. If there isn’t, it may be stuck in your dog. Call your vet.If the mother does not chew off the umbilical cord, you can tie it off and cut it yourself, either using scissors or tearing it with your hands., Keep your vet’s number on hand should there be any problem with the dog’s delivery. You may even want to have the number of an emergency vet if yours is unavailable. You should call the vet if:


Your dog has contractions for over 30 minutes without whelping a puppy
The dog does not give birth within 24 hours of her temperature dropping
The dog’s pregnancy lasts longer than seventy days
Hours pass without the dog giving birth to all of her puppiesPuppies become stuck in the birth canal
There are stillborn puppies in the litter"
"
Adjust the mother’s diet.,
Vaccinate the puppies.,
Wean the puppies.,
Give the puppies to their new homes.",How to Breed Scottish Cocker Spaniels4," The mother may have no appetite during the first two days after the birth. As she continues to lactate, her appetite will increase. Slowly increase her daily meals. After three weeks, you may be feeding her four times a day to ensure that she has enough energy to feed her puppies.Some recommend feeding the mother an additional 25% of her normal food for every puppy that she is feeding., Puppies should get their first shots between six and eight weeks of age. Three shots (Distemper, Measles, and Parainfluenza) are needed, but a fourth (Bordetella) is often recommended as well., The puppies will be ready to wean from their mother’s milk at around three or four weeks of age. You can start offering them puppy food at this time. You might even mix a little bit of puppy food into a puppy milk replacer.This should make up about 10% of your puppies’ diet at first. Slowly increase their intake of food over the next few weeks. Your puppies should be eating solid food only by six weeks., Around eight weeks of age, it will be time to take the puppies away from their mother. Contact the new owners, and let them know that their new puppy is ready to take home.

If you already have a puppy, place it in a safe place during the puppy proofing.,
Keep all doors and windows closed.,
Your puppy shouldn't be left unsupervised inside nor outside.,
Keep puppies off balconies, upper porches, and/or high decks.,
Store cleaning supplies, detergent, bleach, paint, fertilizer, insect/rodent poisons, disinfectants, and other such hazardous chemicals away from the reach of the mischievous jaws of your puppy.

,
Look for loose items on the floor.,
Be careful with shoes.",How to Puppy Proof Your Home,";
, It's also best to keep doors and windows screened securely. This can help prevent your puppy for making an unnecessary trips or falls.

, If left alone puppies will wander and most likely fall into the hands of mischief.

, A fall from a place like those can result in serious injury or even death.

,, Pick them up so your puppy won't. Also try to secure any items within a puppies reach, such as a book on a chair.

, Some puppies will chew up or play with them. Put them away temporarily, then train your puppy not to do so.

"
"
Exercise your dog on a daily basis.,
Provide your dog with stimulating, challenging toys.,
Confine your dog to an area without furniture.",How to Protect Furniture from Dogs1," Exercise will stimulate your dog mentally and physically; allowing your dog to burn energy that may otherwise be directed toward chewing furniture.


The amount of exercise your dog should receive will vary on the breed and size of your dog. Most dogs will require between 30 and 60 minutes of continuous exercise that can include walking, playing fetch, running, or tug-of-war.
Consult with your dog's veterinarian to find out exactly how much daily exercise your dog should receive based on their size and breed.
If you are unable to exercise your dog on a daily basis, hire a dog-walker or pet-sitter that can perform this task for you.;
, Your dog should have a variety of toys for different types of activities.


Purchase toys to help keep your dog active; such as tennis balls they can chase, rope toys they can swing or toss around, or toys and bones made of materials that are difficult to chew, like nylon.
Purchase specific toys that may comfort your dog if they are feeling lonely while you are away from home. Examples of comfort toys are soft, stuffed, plush toys or items that carry your scent that you don't mind your dog having; such as an old, unwashed t-shirt you no longer want.
Buy toys specifically designed for hiding dog treats inside of them. These toys can be used as a distraction for your dog if you ever see them start to chew on your furniture.

,


Place your dog in an enclosed yard with a fence, or in a dog run; each of which will allow your dog to roam freely without damaging any valuable items or furniture.
You can also place your dog and their toys in a room without furniture to prevent them from causing any damage.

"
"
Apply unpleasant flavors to furniture your dog has chewed.,
Scold your dog when you catch them on your furniture.",How to Protect Furniture from Dogs2," This may prevent your dog from continuing to chew on your furniture in the future.


Use foods or seasonings that will not be toxic to your dog, such as hot sauce or cayenne pepper.
If you have furniture that will stain from food products, such as a sofa, you can purchase a commercial, furniture-safe, anti-chewing spray from a retail store that specializes in pet products.

, This will help your dog understand that they are misbehaving.


Say ""No"" in a firm manner to your dog at the same moment you see them jumping onto or chewing your furniture. This will convey to them that their behavior needs to stop immediately.
Provide your dog with one of their toys immediately after scolding them, then praise them when they begin playing with or chewing the toy. This will help your dog understand which behavior you find more acceptable.

"
"
Ask guests to keep food away from your dog.,
Keep toxic foods off the menu.,
Never feed a dog from the table.,
Keep cooked bones away from dogs.,
Keep drinks away from dogs.",How to Protect Your Dog at a Backyard Barbecue1," Keeping inappropriate food away from your dog may depend on other people following the rules. Ask guests to keep plates out of reach of your dog and to not feed the dog any of their food on purpose.If you tell them the damage it could do to your dog's system, they should respect your request and follow the rules.
If you are still worried about guests feeding your dog, put out a dog-safe treat they can feed it. This could be little bits of your dog's kibble or commercial dog treats, whatever your dog will respond to while still being healthy for it.;
, It is best to avoid having items at your barbecue that could injure or kill your dog if it accidentally eats them. While most human foods can give your dog digestive distress if it eats them, there are some foods that are very toxic to dogs and could kill it. These include:Chocolate
Grapes
Raisins
Onions
Products sweetened with xylitol

, Dog's digestive systems are not meant to process the same foods as human digestive systems are. Dogs also need a consistent diet to avoid digestive problems. In order to avoid digestive problems, it's best to never feed your dog from your plate, so that it doesn't even know that is an option and won't beg.Some foods humans love to eat at a barbecue, such as corn on the cob, can lodge in a dog's intestines if your dog is able to get its paws on them.
Other foods, such as meaty scraps, as simply bad for your dog's health if given in large quantities.

, While it may seem natural to throw your dog a bone after you are done with it, cooked bones are actually very dangerous to give to dogs. Cooked bones can easily splinter and lodge in your dogs body, which may puncture body systems and require life-saving surgery to remove.


If you must give your dog a bone, make it a raw one. Raw bones do not splinter the way that cooked bones do. However, you still need to supervise your dog while it chews on a raw bone, in case of choking., Your dog doesn't just want to eat your barbecued meats, it also probably wants to drink your beer or wine. However, it is important to keep alcohol out of the reach of your dog because the basic ingredients of most alcoholic beverages are actually toxic to dogs.Both raisins and grapes, the key ingredient in wine, are toxic to dogs. In addition, hops, a primary ingredient in beer, are also toxic to dogs.
In addition, dogs are simply not meant to ingest alcohol. They have not built up a tolerance to it over time and, in general, they have much smaller bodies than humans and their systems don't process it well.

Direct your dog to stay away from the grill.,
Don't leave the grill unattended.,
Don't use charcoal briquettes.If you use a gas grill, there is nothing to dump out after grilling that could be attractive to a dog.,
Consider putting your dog away while the grill is going.",How to Protect Your Dog at a Backyard Barbecue2," If you have a well-trained dog, you can simply direct it to stay away from the grill with a command. This will probably be hard for a dog that is food motivated, as the smells coming from the grill will be enticing. However, if you know your dog well and you are confident in its training, then a command may be all you need to do.


The exact command you use will vary. Some people will use a ""stay"" command to keep the dog in place. Others will have more specific commands to direct the dog's behavior.

, While you may be distracted by conversation or getting another drink, your dog will be attracted to the smells coming from the grill.To keep your dog safe, you need to always have someone at the grill. This is the most effective way to keep a loose dog away from a hot grill.


Telling a dog to get away from the grill or shooing it off may get tiring for you or the person at the grill. If you plan on a long session of grilling, you may want to find a better solution.

, Briquettes, however, can be very attractive, and very dangerous, to a dog.


Even if the briquettes are no longer warm when they are ingested by your dog, they can get stuck in your dog's digestive system and they may require surgery to remove.

, In order to keep your dog away from the grill, you may need to keep it contained while you are grilling. This may mean putting it in the house or tying it up away from the grill. Whatever you need to do to make sure it doesn't burn itself on the grill.


Avoiding a potentially hazardous situation altogether is usually the best solution. If you are worried about your dogs health and safety at a barbecue, then perhaps you should just leave it safely at home.

Teach your dog to swim.,
Show your dog how to get out of the pool.,
Place a fence around the pool.,
Avoid using floating pool covers.,
Take special precautions with at-risk dogs.",How to Protect Your Dog Around Backyard Pools1," Not every dog knows how to swim. Many owners assume that their dogs know how to swim so they don’t worry about them around pools. Dogs may be inexperienced and not know how to swim. They also may panic and not swim correctly. Both of these things can lead to drowning.To help your dog learn how to swim, get them familiar with water by getting in the water with them. You can hold up your dog’s hind section to help them learn how to start using their back legs.
You may also choose to get your dog professional swimming lessons from a trainer.;
, Many pets drown in pools because they fall in and don’t know how to get back out. You should help your dog learn where the steps are so they can climb out if they need to.You may want to put something near the steps, like a plant or a light, so your dog can easily find the steps and know where they need to be.
You may consider putting a ramp or pet stairs into your pool.

, One way to keep your dog safe from the pool when you are not around is to put a fence around the pool. The fence can keep your dog out of the pool, along with other neighborhood pets or wild animals who venture into your yard.The fence should surround the pool and be secure enough that your dog won’t be able to jump over it, dig under it, or break through it.

, When putting a cover on your pool, use a safety cover instead of a floating cover. Though the pool may be covered, the dog may accidentally fall into it when chasing something. They also may think that the cover is hard enough for them to walk on.If a dog steps on a floating cover, they could be unable to find their way out of the cover. They may also fall under the cover, which would trap them and lead to drowning.

, Some dogs are at a higher risk of falling in the pool and drowning than others. This includes dogs that are obese, older, or small. Toys breeds may be too small to use the steps, so they may need a special ramps to help them get out of the pool.Dogs that are blind may not be able to see the edge of the pool, so they may accidentally fall in, especially at night. You should make sure your protect your dog from the pool if they are blind.

"
"
Use dog life vests.,
Avoid dog toys in the pool.,
Rinse your dog after they swim.",How to Protect Your Dog Around Backyard Pools2," If your dog doesn’t know how to swim, or you have an older or obese dog that might get tired, you should put them in dog life vests when they are playing around the pool. This helps your dog stay safe in the event that they fall into the water.You can buy dog life vests at any pet store.

, You should skip the dog toys in and around the pool. If your dog is running after toys around the pool, they can hurt their paws or fall into the pool. If your dog is in the pool, they may chip a tooth by grabbing the toy and biting the cement edge instead.Dog toys increase the likelihood that your dog will swallow pool water full of unhealthy chemicals.

, Chlorine and chemicals are not healthy for your dog. They can cause the coat and skin to dry out. If the dog remains damp for too long, they can get hot spots in vulnerable areas, like around their ears or under the collar.Rinse your dog with a garden hose or in the bathtub after they have been in the pool. Use a clean towel to dry them off afterwards.

Sit down with your family to discuss the issue of adopting a pet.,
Create a chart that displays everyone's name and the job they will have when the animal arrives, i.e.,
Discuss what breed of animal your family should purchase.,
Do some research on where or who you will buy the dog from.,
Take a look at the conditions you live in.,
Clean your house from top to bottom.,
Decide on how you will house-train your dog.,
Establish rules in which your family and the dog will have to abide by.,
You are now ready to purchase a new dog.,
Once your new dog has received a ""grand tour"" of your house, take the pet to the local pet store to purchase supplies, i.e.",How to Prepare Your Household for a New Dog," Emphasize on the many responsibilities that everyone will have to take on to make this successful. If any, remind your children that they will also have to help care for the new pet.;
, exercising, feeding, training, etc. Take into consideration how much time your family is willing to relinquish to the caring for this pet.

, Keep any allergies in mind. For example, if your family wants a dog, and your child has a mild allergy to dog dander, consider acquiring a poodle or a poodle mix because poodles don't shed.

, Decide if you will adopt one from a shelter or a breeder. Breeders can be more expensive, but purebred dogs can be more predictable when it comes to temperament than a mutt from a shelter. However, if you adopt from a shelter, you are rescuing an animal from possibly harsh, undesirable conditions.

, Do you live in an apartment in a city, or do you have a house with a yard? Is your house clean or relatively unorganized? Where would the animal eat and sleep? Decide on where supplies will be located ahead of time to avoid confusion. Decide where the dog will exercise too. No matter how big or small, exercise is a big component to a dog's healthy lifestyle.

, Take any valuable objects and place them in secure storage containers that are out of reach. If you are buying a small dog, you will need to devise a plan to block small areas in which an animal can get to, but you cannot, i.e. under dressers or beds.

, One very effective way is crate training. Buy a metal crate suitable for the size of your dog. Put it in the area in which your dog will ""live"" the most, i.e. the living room or your bedroom. Place blankets and toys in the bottom to entertain your dog and create a sense of home and security. You want the crate to become a positive thing, not negative. Crate training is based on the idea that by nature, dogs do not relieve themselves in the area in which they eat and sleep. When it is time to go to sleep, lock the dog in the crate. Do the same when you leave the house. It may seem cruel, but the dog will soon learn that the crate is not a place to go to the bathroom, but to sleep and relax. If the dog ever does accidentally go to the bathroom in your house or in their crate, call their attention to the stain. Say ""No."" firmly, and take them outside, even if they do not need to ""go"" anymore. The dog will make the connection that the crate is the place to sleep and the yard is the place to go to the bathroom. Make sure you devise a way for the dog to alert you that it needs to go to the bathroom, i.e. the dog nudges a bell on the door, or they scratch the door. Chances are the dog will figure out a way to alert you of this in a way that you can both understand. Eventually, you will remove the crate and replace it with a dog pillow or a blanket. This will serve as the dog's bed.

, Think about where you want your dog to be and what places are off limits. For example, will your dog be allowed on the couch (once it's crate trained, of course)? Will he or she be allowed on the second floor, if any? Make sure that your family agrees on these terms to minimize any confusions for you and the dog.

, Keep in mind that this day will be very stressful for the dog and to have your family keep calm and collected as the dog enters. Don't be surprised if your dog resists you when you try to pull him or her into the house. Have each family member slowly and calmly approach the dog with their fist extended so the dog can sniff them. If that goes well, have them pet the animal softly on the head.

, food, toys, leashes, etc. Ask a pet store employee to help you with your decisions if you are a first-time dog owner.

Check the yard for pests.,
Get rid of standing water.,
Invite birds and bats to your yard.",How to Protect Dogs from Poisonous Insects1," Regularly check the yard for signs of pets, such as anthills and wasp nests. Try to treat or remove these as soon as possible, or at the very least, keep your dog away from these areas. Paying attention to where dangers are can help you keep your dog safe.Look for medium-sized papery nests or smaller nests made out of mud. These nests are usually types of hornets. They can build in cracks in your house, as well as in cavities and hollows around your yard.Ants make hills on the ground, usually.
Other bugs that can be poisonous to your dog include fleas (as they can give your dog tapeworms), ticks, spiders, kissing bugs, and botflies.;
, Standing water is the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. The more mosquitoes there are around, the more likely your dog is to get bitten. Look for hidden spots of standing water around your home, such as flower pots, drainage pipes, low-lying areas, and even dips in roofs.Make sure any trash cans or pots have drainage holes in the bottom.
Fill in holes in your yard or garden with soil or sand, so water can pool there.Also, keep your pool clean. A pool can also be a breeding ground for insects like mosquitoes. Making sure it stays clean, covered, and chlorinated can help cut down on this problem. Be aware, though, that bugs can also use the standing water on top of a cover for breeding or drinking., Birds and bats are predators for most insects, so having more in your yard will help reduce the insect population. You can put out bird seed, for instance, to help increase bird visitation to your yard, or purchase bat houses to encourage bats to hang out there."
"
Pay attention to your dog’s paws.,
Avoid letting your dog drink from the pool.,
Watch for signs of heat stroke.",How to Protect Your Dog Around Backyard Pools3," The concrete around pools can injure your dog’s paws. If your dog runs around the pool while your family is in it, they may cut their paws on sharp and uneven stones, rocks, or the hard concrete. They may also burn their paws on the hot concrete.Your dog may also wear down their nails on the hard surface around the pool, and they can injure their paws on the pool steps by jumping into the pool.

, Try to keep your dog from drinking too much from the pool. This can cause them to get sick. You can’t keep your dog from swallowing some water, but discourage them drinking from the pool by placing fresh, cool water near the pool for them., During the summer, dogs may play in pools with their owners, or they may play around the yard while their family enjoys the pool. Being active and outside in the hot sun all day can put your dog at a higher risk for heat stroke. Signs of heat stroke include:Excessive or loud panting
A bright red tongue and red gums
Drooling excessively
Thick saliva
Extreme thirst
Skin around muzzle or neck doesn't snap back when pinched
Increased heart rate
Vomiting
If you suspect your dog has heat stroke, take them to the vet.

Look at the entire plant.,
Take very careful note of the leaf structure and leaflet arrangement of poison hemlock.,
Note the time of year this species tends to grow and flower.,
Compare with other similar species.,
Fence off your yard.,
Keep your dog leashed outdoors.,
Teach them to drop something.,
Watch out for signs of hemlock ingestion.,
Take a poisoned dog to the vet immediately.,
Do not touch hemlock bare-handed.,
Pull up hemlock with gloved hands.,
Apply herbicides to specific sites.",How to Protect Your Dog from Poison Hemlock," Poison hemlock is quite tall, growing to at least 3 feet (0.91 m) to over 8 feet (2.4 m) tall. Flowering plants have several (8 to 15) umbrella-like flowering heads branching up from the main stem. Each of these flowering heads (called inflorescences) are comprised of many flowers making up an inverted-umbrella like form. This type of inflorescence is called an ""umbel.""


The formation of an umbel as an inflorescence is typical of many other plants of the Carrot, Parsnip or Parsley Family Apiaceae, which include poisonous and non-poisonous plants ranging from the garden carrot, parsnip and dill plants, to the poisonous Giant Hogweed and similar species water hemlock (Cicuta maculata), the latter being a North American native species found in similar areas as Poison Hemlock.
The entire plant will consist of the stem, leaves, and the roots. For a quick ID, the leaves are sufficient to make a positive ID of what this poisonous forb actually is.
Note the stalks. Poison hemlock typically has reddish-purple splotches all down the stalk to the base of the plant, some to the point where there is a reddish-purple line running down from the base of the inflorescence (flowering head) to the base of the plant. These plants also have a whitish powdery substance on the stems that can be easily rubbed off when you run your (gloved) finger over it.

Some water hemlock plants also have these purplish blotches or spots on the stem, but not all do, and often they are not as noticeable as in poison hemlock. This is more of a common characteristic with Poison Hemlock. Water hemlock also lacks the whitish powder on the stems.

;
, Many people have made the erroneous mis-identification of poison hemlock simply by failing to study the leaves, and have confused it with other plants in the same family that may or may not be poisonous.



Conium maculatum has leaves arranged alternately on the stem, with stipules (long clasps) on the stalk of the stem that decrease further up the stem. Leaves are shiny green, triangular, large (12 inches (30 cm) long and about 4 inches (10 cm) wide), and highly divided about three or four times.These leaves are what botanists would call ""pinnately compound."" This means that each leaf is made up of several leaflet pairs arranged on opposite sides of the main leaf stalk. Each leaflet is segmented and around 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) to 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) long.
Leaf veins terminate at the toothed tips of each leaf.


In comparison, Cicuta maculata (water hemlock) has leaves that are much less divided, and smaller in size. They are still pinnate, about 3 to 4 times (some only 2 times), but leaflets are narrowly lance-shaped (lanceolate).

, It grows in the spring and tends to flower in early summer. Seeds are produced in July to August.

, Poison hemlock can be easily confused with water hemlock, cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), water parsnip (Sium suave), and wild carrot (Daucus carota).


Water hemlock (poisonous) is generally shorter, leaves less divided, and lacking purplish splotches. Leaves are purplish at the base. Less umbels grow up from the stem. Cut stems release an orange sap, which is highly poisonous. Roots are tuberous and chambered when they are cut open.
Cow parsley (or Wild chervil; non-poisonous) has leaves very similar to poison hemlock, except they are quite fine and fern-like. Young stems lack purplish blotches. Mature plants have richly purple to reddish-brown stems, including stems of leaves.
Water parsnip (non-poisonous) has leaves only once pinnate. This plant is very easily confused with water hemlock because it grows in the same habitat, grows to the same height, and has the same flower head. The leaves, however, are the identifying feature that differentiate it from water hemlock.
Wild carrot (non-poisonous; also called Queen Anne's Lace) has hairy stems (poison and water hemlocks do not), and a tapered white root like a carrot, which is edible. Some of these plants has a single red flower in the middle. The leaves are lace-like, finely-dissected and hairy. As the flower matures, it folds in on itself to the shape of a bird's nest.

, If there are any frequently wet parts of your land, be sure to monitor for hemlock each spring and summer. For even greater safety, fence off an area you know is free of danger to keep your dog from eating something poisonous or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren’t supervising.If you live in a rural area, or near a body of water of forest, a fence is especially helpful in keeping your dog from being poisoned.

, Your dog should always be monitored when off your property. The best way to keep them safe is by keeping them leashed, aside from specific contexts, such as playing fetch together somewhere safe.On walks, opt for a short leash. Short leashes are safer for multiple reasons, and can help prevent your dog from getting into anything poisonous.
Whenever you are outside together, always keep an eye on your dog.

, Choose a command, such as ""drop,"" to instruct your dog to put down something they've picked up. Not only will this help you control your dog's behavior generally, it will assist you in keeping them safe. If and when your dog picks up something you're ensure of, use the command to get it out of their mouth as quickly as possible.


To begin training your dog to drop something, start with a chew toy in one hand and a treat in the other. Once they latch onto the toy and take it, give the command to ""drop"" and hold the treat in front of their nose. If they release it, praise the dog and feed them a treat. Pick up the toy and repeat the process.

, Signs often appear quickly, with death often occurring in as little as one hour. The plant is dangerous to many species, but is especially life-threatening for your dog. Look for drooling, difficulty breathing, and dilated pupils. Their heartbeat may become irregular, they may become physically weak, and may even began to twitch or have seizures.Water hemlock is especially likely to cause seizures, and poisoning by water hemlock can show symptoms in as little as fifteen minutes.

, Get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you believe they may have eaten something poisonous. While organizations such as the ASPCA have helplines you can find online, you will likely be charged for a consultation by phone. It’s often better to simply get your dog to someone that can help care for them as soon as possible.Your dog’s behavior will also likely be affected. Watch out for uncharacteristic agitation or nervousness.

, Hemlock are dangerous to people and other animals, as well as dogs. Even a small amount can literally kill a horse. In fact, your dog does not need to ingest the plant for it to put them at risk. Accordingly, it's best to remove the plant when you find it, though it is important to do so carefully., Remove any plants that pose a danger to your dog. Wear gloves, long sleeves, and full face protection. Pull or dig the plants up from the ground, to remove their taproot system. The younger the plant, the easier this will be.It will be easier to remove the plants when the ground is moist. Consider watering the ground a short time before attempting to remove them.
Dispose of the plants safely. Place any plants you uproot directly into a plastic bag to be tied and placed in a bin for waste removal. Do not put them in your compost. Make sure the plants are entirely inaccessible to your dog, other pets, or people.

, Use glyphosate, most commonly found in Roundup, to kill sprouts as they emerge. If the plant develops a bit but you still catch it in early spring, the herbicides 2,4-D, 2,4-DB and MCPA will still be effective in killing the plant. Since poison hemlock produces a large number of seeds, you may need to re-apply herbicide as new sprouts emerge. Read all herbicide labels carefully and follow directions.Wear gloves, long sleeves, and respiratory and eye protection while applying herbicide.

Repair screens.,
Look for other holes.,
Turn off the light.,
Pick up the clutter.,
Take away sources of food and water.,
Try sprays, fogs, or traps with caution.",How to Protect Dogs from Poisonous Insects2," Screen doors or window screens with holes are a perfect place for poisonous pests to get in your house. Repair any holes you find to keep pests out. You can use something as simple as duct tape to repair a hole. If you don't have screens at all, consider investing in some., Bugs don't just enter the house through holes in screens. They will find any hole or crack to burrow their way in. Check especially around doors and windows, and then fill in any holes or cracks you find.You can use things like silicone or plaster to fill in holes. Even duct tape will work in a pinch.

, If you have lights near your entrances and doors, that's a big attraction for insects. They will congregate around your doors and enter as you come in or go out. Try putting your lights on a motion sensor, so that they only come on when you're trying to go inside.While spiders don't like the light, they will show up to eat the other insects.

, Clutter gives pests places to hide. Spiders, especially, are good hiders, and they love to hole up wherever they can. If you can clean out some of the clutter, you'll be able to reduce the possibility of poisonous pests in your house.Also, work on keeping your house clean. Vacuuming and dusting can help keep your home free of pests. It can help to clean more regularly around where your pet frequents, as your dog can bring pests into the house from outside., One way pests are attracted to your house is through sources of food or water. Try to keep crumbs out of your kitchen, for instance, as that can draw in pests. In addition, try to fix water leaks in fixtures like faucets and pipes, as bugs are also drawn to water sources., If you do get pests, you can use common pest removal techniques such as fogging or spraying your house. However, make sure you move your dog out of the house before you spray or fog. If you use traps, put them where your dog can't get to them.Be cautious when using foggers. Make sure you calculate the space correctly, multiplying the length of the room by the height and width to get the volume of the room. If you use too much, it can build up and cause an explosion.You can house sprays at home improvement stores, but you can also call in a professional to spray your home. They'll know what to look for, plus they'll know what's safe to use around your dog.

Give your dog heartworm medication.,
Use a dog-friendly bug spray.,
Try a natural solution.",How to Protect Dogs from Poisonous Insects3," You can get heartworm medications from your vet. Basically, you give them to your dog on a regular schedule, such as once a month, to help prevent your dog from contracting heartworms. Heartworm medications come in both topical and oral forms, and some last as long as half a year.Dogs can contract heartworms from mosquitoes, so it's important to offer this protection.

, Most pet stores sell insect repellents that are safe for dogs. You can use these to protect your dog. These repellents help mainly with ticks and fleas, but some also protect against other insects. Check the package to see which ones the spray protects against., Another option for keeping insects away from your pet is lavender essential oil. This oil repels a number of insects, including fleas, ticks, flies, and mosquitoes. Try using a special collar that has a carrier for the oil, where you can place a drop that your dog can't get to.Lemon eucalyptus oil has also been proven to be effective against mosquitoes, and it is safe for your pet.Skip DEET and other human products. Human products are not formulated for dogs, and they can cause health problems, including stomach problems, skin issues, and even seizures. Plus, your dog may like try to lick the product off, making the problem worse."

Keep your dog out of spider-prone areas.,
Avoid being outside at sunset and sunrise.,
Don't let your dog hunt rodents.,
Shake out bedding for your dog first.",How to Protect Dogs from Poisonous Insects4," While you can't keep your dog completely away from spiders, you can help by keeping them out of areas you know have a lot of spiders, such as your garage, your attic, or your basement. That way, your dog won't go nosing around and get bitten., Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. You can help protect your pet and yourself by staying inside during these times, reducing your dog's chances of being bitten by mosquitoes., Of course, it's difficult to keep a determined hunter from chasing rodents and other animals, but if you can do it, it's a good idea. Rodents can attract or carry insects that are harmful to your pet, such as bot flies.One way you can reduce your dog's chances of hunting rodents is to take your dog out on a leash when it has to go to the bathroom, particularly if you know you have rodents in the area.
You can also set out traps for rodents in your yard, but make sure they are safe for your dog.

, If you are getting out a blanket or other type of bedding for you dog, make sure you shake it out before giving it to the dog. Spiders love to hide in folds of fabric, so you want to get those out before your dog can be bitten.Don't forget to wash the bedding regularly to help reduce pests.

Check for vulnerable spots.,
Fix any gaps.,
Prevent digging.,
Consider the height.,
Add an extension.,
Add or replace a fence.",How to Prepare Your Yard for a Dog1," It is absolutely important to make sure that you have a secure yard to keep your dog on your property. Check the fence around your yard for weak spots that your dog might be able to chew through or dig under, such as holes or dents. For wooden fences, inspect the quality of the wood to ensure that fence posts aren't weak enough to loosen (e.g. from termite damage.)In terms of sturdiness, aluminum, vinyl or wrought iron are the best types of fences to opt for.;
, Repair your fence by fixing any gaps that might allow your dog to escape. When fixing a picket fence, for instance, this might mean replacing a wooden fence post. It could also mean patching a chain link fence., To prevent your dog from digging under the fence, lay chicken wire or standard 2"" by 4"" chain link fencing under your fence, at a 90 degree angle to it. The extra fencing should extend 2-3 feet into the yard, where you can then bury it underground or weigh it down with large rocks. Alternatively, you can lay a cement footer around the base of the fence to solidify it in the ground., Ideally, a fence should be at least 6 feet tall to keep in all dogs - shorter fences can be adequate for smaller dogs, but 6 feet is the best number to play it safe. Be sure to monitor your dog outdoors to note if it has a tendency to jump. Remember that the fence should not only keep your dog in the yard, but also keep other, potentially dangerous animals out of it., To prevent your dog from jumping out of the yard, or an unwanted animal from getting in, consider adding an extension to your fence. The height of the extension is not important as long as it tilts inward at a 45 degree angle, which will thwart escape or entry. Visit a hardware store for pricing or call a local fence installation professional for a quote or more information., If your yard does not have a fence, or if your fence isn't solid or high enough to contain your dog, consider having a new one installed. Note that this will either be a large investment of your time or money - building your own fence is an ambitious project, but paying professionals to install it will cost several thousand dollars on average. Note that chain link fencing is the cheapest option either way, at about $16 a foot."

Provide water for your dog at all times.,
Refill and clean your dogs water bowl once a day.,
Bring water along on walks and trips.",How to Outfit Your Dog for Summer Outings1," Dogs need a lot of water to keep them hydrated and it is the most important thing they need in their life to keep them happy and cool.
, Keeping your dogs water bacteria-free is the best option and gives them a fresh supply of water., Be prepared when going on an outing with your dog as they will get thirsty and dehydrated. Bring along a folding water bowl and a bottle of water for your dog to drink from. If you're planning an all-day or several day hike, purchase a backpack with built-in water bladders for your dog.

Clear your yard of chemicals.,
Sweep your yard for poisonous plants.,
Prevent fleas and ticks.",How to Prepare Your Yard for a Dog2," To prepare your yard for a dog, remove all garden poisons, insecticide, and fertilizers. These chemical-based products can cause gastrointestinal irritation, drooling, seizures, and even death if ingested. Opt for natural, non-harmful options instead (e.g. canola oil to repel instincts and caffeinated coffee to kill slugs.), There are a number of common plants that, when ingested, can be fatal to dogs. Visit the Pet Poison Helpline's website at http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/poisons/ for a list of substances that are poisonous to dogs, as well as the signs of poisoning to look for. Some plants to watch out for are:Azalea
Daffodil
Hyacinth
Oleander

, It is important to make sure your yard is flea and tick free to keep your pet healthy and prevent it from bringing them into the house. Keep grass trimmed and neat (since ticks thrive in tall grass) and keep the yard swept and free of clutter. Remove any garbage cans from the yard that would attract rodents, which may also carry fleas and ticks.Eliminating clutter will also help to keep snakes that could be harmful to your pet away from the yard.

Give it shelter.,
Make it a ""potty area"".,
Give your dog access to water.",How to Prepare Your Yard for a Dog3," If you let your dog spend long periods of time in the yard, you must provide it with some protection from the weather (i.e. shelter from the heat on a scorching, sunny day.) If your yard doesn't have a lot of trees or shade, build a dog house to protect your pet and provide it with an outdoor den. You can also purchase a dog house at hardware stores or department stores., To keep your yard clean and friendly for the whole family, designate a specific ""potty area"" for your dog to relieve itself in. This area will essentially be a boxed-in area filled with layers of small pebbles and gravel, and fiberglass screening; the pebbles and gravel allow for easy drainage when hosed down. To train your dog to relieve itself in this area, lead it there on its leash, prompt it to go, and then reward it with treats and play when it does., To stay cool, hydrated, and healthy, it is important that your dog has access to water when it's outdoors. Consider installing an outdoor fountain, which would be both a fun decorative element for your yard and a source of refreshment for your pet. You can also consider building a small pond for your dog to enjoy, particularly on hot summer days. Make sure that the pond is shallow enough for your dog to go in and out of safely and easily."

Be careful when leaving pets alone.,
Keep an eye on your dog when he's playing in the front yard by himself.,
Do not ignore your dog's barks.,
Keep your pet on a leash.,
Be cautious around suspicious strangers.,
Never leave your dog tied outside a store.,
When leaving a pet alone in a car, be sure the windows and doors are locked securely.,
Avoid bragging to strangers.",How to Prevent Your Dog from Being Stolen," A microchip can be inserted under your dog's skin. It is painless and holds data that can identify your dog and it's owner. Along with this, you should provide your dog with an identification tag for its collar. It is possible that a stranger could find your dog and not know how to contact you, so they keep the dog. However, you should not put the dog's name on the tag, as a stranger could learn it's name and call the dog to them.;
, This means taking clear shots of the head, the sides and back of the dog. Take close-ups of any patterns or unusual features that might help to identify the dog in the event it goes missing. Keep these images in a specially marked folder on your computer just in case they're needed quickly; this saves you from having to search through all the standard candid shots of your pet, when you'll likely be panicked.

, Make sure your fencing/ yard does not have any holes the dog can get through/ squeeze through. If they are a digger, take the necessary precautions to ensure they will not dig under the fence.

, You shouldn't leave your dog outside when you are not home, unless he is in a secure kennel. Not only could he be stolen, but he could escape.

, If there is a possibility someone could lean over the fence and pinch him, it might be a better idea to only let him play alone in the backyard. However, even then the dog may not be safe and you should ensure that it is very difficult for an outsider to get into your backyard, by using fencing, padlocks, etc.


If your yard (and hence your dog) is visible from the street, then the dog may be a target of theft.

, If your dog is barking a lot for no known reason, check it out. It could be that there is a stranger trying to dog nap your dog.

, While going for a walk, you should always keep your pet on a leash. Even a well trained dog could run after an animal. Not only could he be stolen, but hit by a car, injured, etc. You should always make sure you can see your dog.

, If a stranger seems oddly interested in your dog, you should not brag to them about it being a purebred, well trained dog, show dog, etc. Do not allow a stranger to carry your dog, or walk your dog where you can't see it. It is okay to let a stranger pet your dog, but if the person acts suspicious or want to try carrying or walking your dog, kindly decline and say you have to go.

, Even if you'll just be gone for a few minutes, you should not leave your dog tied outside a building, especially on a busier street. It is easy for a stranger to take the dog and drive away.

, Do not leave your dog alone in a convertible or the back of a truck, he could easily escape or be stolen.


Never leave a dog alone in a hot car, or on a hot day. The heat will kill the dog quickly (hyperthermia). Equally, never leave a dog alone in freezing temperatures either, as the dog can freeze to death in a car (hypothermia).

, Sure, you love your dog but telling unknown people how valuable your dog is in monetary terms is dangerous. By all means say you love going on walks with the little critter but don't give away personally identifying information, make deep emotional attachment statements or share the financial value of the dog with people you don't know. Each of these makes both you and your dog vulnerable to an unscrupulous person.

Talk to your vet.",How to Make Your Home Safe for Your Dog," Chances are that your dog is spending a lot of quality time with you and your family in the living and/ or dining rooms. Checking for and removing any potentially dangerous items such as cords, toys, or other knick-knacks can prevent injury and even death.


Look for dangling wires from electronics such as TVs, DVD players, stereos, lamps, and telephones and put them in a place that is out of reach to your dog. You may want to consider covering electrical outlets and unplug items you are not using to prevent electrocution through chewing. Consider getting rid of frayed wires, which can also electrocute your dog.Keep spaces clear of children’s toys or knick-knacks, including items such as sewing tools. Your dog may see these as chew toys and ingest small parts that could choke her. She could also knock them over and cause injury to herself.
Cover all of the heating and air vents to prevent your dog from burning herself or getting too cold. Most home and pet stores offer different covers you can use.Move potentially poisonous plants to spaces your dog can’t access. This includes hanging plants onto which your dog can jump from nearby spaces.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a list of plants that are toxic to dogs that you can consult.Vacuum the space regularly to remove any small or undetectable hazards such as buttons, string, or toy parts that can choke your dog.;
, Even seemingly non-hazardous items such as shoes or sweaters can harm your dog if ingested. Whether or not your dog sleeps with you at night or simply has access during the day, keep your bedroom organized and free of tempting “treats.”Make sure any laundry is in a basket or other covered container. Hang and store clothing in closets and dressers that your dog can’t access. Clothing items often have string and embellishments such as drawstrings, buttons, and appliques that can cause serious harm to your dog’s intestines.
Store shoes in containers, a closet, or a shoe rack on the back of a door. Dogs often see shoes as chew toys and pieces can break off and choke your dog.Remove or cover any wires in the bedroom just as you would in other rooms.
See if there are any medications or other items such as lotion that your dog can access and which may harm her.Check to make sure you haven’t accidentally closed your dog in a closet or drawer whenever you open it., The kitchen can be a wonderful playground for a curious—and hungry—dog. Storing potentially harmful foods and chemicals and closing off containers and spaces can go far in keeping your dog safe.


Make sure your garbage can is secured with a lid that your dog can’t remove. An open garbage can provide your dog with otherwise forbidden food but can also expose her to other hazards such as bones from food or chemicals.
Keep food stored in airtight containers and in cabinets to which your dog can’t gain access. Put wrapped food in cabinets, too. Although the food may not be harmful to your dog, the wrapper could be.
Put any cleaners, medications, or other chemicals on high shelves so that your dog can’t access them. If this isn’t possible, consider putting childproof latches on lower cabinets so your dog can’t pry them open.Clean up any food that falls on the ground when cooking or eating. Make sure to vacuum and mop the floor regularly to remove potentially harmful substances or foods.
Make sure that sharp objects such as knives are stored in a drawer or cabinet that your dog can’t access.
Consider unplugging any kitchen appliances that you are not using. For example, you could unplug the toaster or microwave so that your dog can’t chew on the cords., Just like your kitchen, the bathroom can also present your dog with a playground and a place to grab a “drink.” Check your bathroom spaces for chemicals or potentially harmful items such as old towels, which can prevent injury and death.


Store any cleaners, chemicals or medicines either on high shelves or in cabinets that you’ve secured with childproof latches.
Use a garbage can that is covered to keep your dog from getting at chemicals, medications, or other items such as feminine hygiene products. You can also put the garbage can inside a latched cabinet with a cover.
Keep the toilet lid closed at all times to prevent your dog from falling in, drowning, or drinking water that may have chemicals in it. You can also use a childproof latch on the toilet to keep your dog safe., No matter if you have a designated laundry room or keep the washer and dryer in another space, it’s important to keep laundry areas organized. Storing detergents and putting away dirty clothes can keep your dog from ingesting potentially harmful substances.


Make sure clothes are in a designated hamper or closet where you dog can’t access them. Remember that seemingly harmless items such as string, buttons, or embellishments can harm your dog.
Put laundry detergent, fabric softener, dryer sheets and other chemicals on a high shelf or in a latched cabinet so that your dog can’t eat or drink them.
Make sure your dog hasn’t jumped into the dryer or washer each time you use them., In addition to bigger rooms, you should also check smaller areas of your home. Figure out if there are potential hazards in them that you should remove or cover. Some additional spaces you may want to check are:


Stairs, by making sure they are free of objects and safe for elderly or small dogs to climb
Closets and cupboards, which may store articles of clothing or chemicals., If your dog goes inside and outside, or simply stays outside, it’s important that she have a safe shelter from the elements at any time of year. Dogs are very sensitive to temperature and they experience the same discomfort in extremes that humans do. Providing a heated space in the winter and a shaded spot in the summer can go a long way in keeping your dog safe and healthy., Attached or stand-alone garages can also present dangers to your dog in the form of items such as sharp tools, chemicals, and even your car. Organizing your garage and putting potentially harmful objects in places your dog can’t reach can help prevent accidents or death.


Store chemicals in secure containers and place them on either high shelves or behind secure doors. This is especially important with antifreeze, which has a smell and taste that attracts dogs. One lick of antifreeze can kill a dog.
Make sure to clean the floor regularly, especially if you’ve been using antifreeze.
Store sharp objects, tools, and cords in a place your dog can’t access.
Consider keeping electronics or electric objects such as saws or screwdrivers unplugged to prevent the risk of electrocution or other injury.
Check under or bang on the hood of your car to make sure your dog hasn’t crawled inside for warmth., You and your dog can get a lot of enjoyment out of a garden. But it can also present dangers to your dog in the form of plants, pesticides, and parasites. Caring for your garden while thinking of your dog’s needs can keep her safe while she is outside.


Make sure your garden doesn’t have any plants that are poisonous to your dog. Some of the most beautiful flowers including daffodils and azaleas are toxic to dogs.Consult the ASPCA’s extensive database of toxic plants for dogs if you are unsure if a plant is potentially poisonous.Chemical fertilizers and insecticides can also be harmful or fatal if ingested by your dog. Consider organic gardening instead of chemicals to maintain your yard. You can consult your local county extension office for information on how to garden organically.
Parasites such as fleas, ticks, and worms can harm your dog. The easiest way to prevent them from harming your dog is by getting a broad range flea and tick or heartworm medication. Be aware that most heartworm medications can prevent other worm and flea and tick infestations.Keep your dog inside when mowing the lawn or trimming the hedges.

, Depending on where you live, consider enclosing your yard with a physical or invisible fence. This can keep your dog from running onto a busy street or protect her from other dogs or predators.


Consider your area and needs when deciding on a physical or invisible fence. If you live in a rural area with a lot of wildlife, a physical fence may be a better choice because it can keep out predators such as bears, cougars, and wolves. More suburban areas may be better with invisible fences. These don’t change the appearance of your home and still keep your dog from straying outside of your yard., Although most dogs can swim, they can still drown in pools. Putting a fence around your pool can prevent this or other injuries she may get from toys or falling objects. If you cannot afford to install a fence or gate around your pool, consider getting a hard cover for it, which may deter her from jumping in the pool., The best way to make sure you’ve effectively secured your home is by getting down to your dog’s level and putting yourself in her place. Check each area and space inside and outside your home and see if there are any problems you need to address. Ask yourself some of the following questions as you inspect each area:


What can I eat, drink or chew in this space?
Can I climb or use “ladders” to access forbidden items?
Can I get stuck in this space?
What items can fall on, strangle, electrocute, suffocate or otherwise injure me?, Because there are so many nooks and crannies in any person’s home, you may identify spots that could harm to your dog during your four-legged inspection. Take the appropriate steps to fix or remedy these spots as soon as you can. This can prevent injury to your dog and even death.

, You may still have questions after an inspection or dog-proofing session. In these cases, talk to your vet about how best to approach each situation. For example, you may occasionally give your dog table food as a treat. Ask your if what you give the dog can harm her and find out if there are alternatives she may like.


Get your dog to the vet if she does accidentally injure herself or ingest a chemical. Your doctor may be able to treat the problem and suggest ways to avoid injuries in the future."

While table food in general is not good for pets, certain leftovers should be treated with more precaution than others.Foods like onions, coffee grounds, onion powder, tomato, potato, rhubarb, macadamia nuts, and anything with mold should be kept away from pets.
If you throw out bones after a meal, do so only in a secure garbage can. If possible, throw the bones away in an outdoor garbage can away from your pets. Dogs and cats can choke on bones.;
, Cats and dogs may occasionally try to get into cabinets and drawers in your kitchen to take food. Keep doors securely closed. Consider using a rubber band or a child safety device to prevent your dog or cat from opening these drawers., Cats may sometimes play with disposable razors by batting them around the floor. This can result in your cat getting cut by the blades. You should put razors in a safe place out of reach from your cats. Keep them on a high shelf or in a secured drawer., You should opt for a garbage can you can securely close. You can also keep a garbage in a drawer under the sink that you can lock. It can be very dangerous for your pet to ingest potentially hazardous substances from the garbage., Chocolate is toxic to both dogs and cats. If you store chocolate in your kitchen it's especially important to keep it out of reach from dogs and cats. Store chocolate on high shelves or in doors you can lock or keep closed in other ways."

Use toys to motivate your puppy.",How to Get an Uninterested Puppy Excited for Training," Puppies tend to have more energy than their adult counterparts, though their energy levels vary depending on factors like their breed, age, and health. If your puppy seems to be significantly more distracted or disinterested in training than they usually are, you’ll need to eliminate any potential health factors. Your puppy might be lethargic, uninterested in food, or over-stimulated.If you have any concerns about your puppy’s health, take them to the veterinarian as soon as you are able to. While most puppy boredom is a result of their environment, better safe than sorry applies here.;
, Like children, puppies learn the best in controlled environments. When you are getting ready to train your puppy, you should select an area that is relatively quiet and comfortable. For instance, you may decide to train your puppy indoors in your living room. This room should be quiet, free from visual and auditory distraction like the TV. It should just be the two of you. If you have other pets or small children, keep them outside of the room and dedicate this time to training your new puppy.While you won’t be able to control for every factor, it is better to train in a quieter and more secluded environment early on. As your puppy becomes more confident in their training, you can start introducing other stimuli. This will challenge your puppy to pay attention and not be distracted.

, Puppies, like small children, have short attention spans and are unable to stay focused on tasks for very long. The younger the puppy, the shorter their attention span. An 8-week puppy can only be expected to train for 3-5 minutes a few times a day, while a 4 month old puppy can train for 10-15 minutes a few times a day.Remember that every dog is different, and that some puppies will respond to training more quickly than others.Training is a process that will go on throughout your puppy’s lifetime. As your puppy ages and reaches adolescence, usually around 6 months of age, their training capacity will change and grow, and your schedule should reflect these changes., During these training sessions, you also need to be in the right frame of mind. If you are angry, frustrated, or feel rushed, your puppy will pick up on your cues and won’t engage in training. You should be calm and neutral during these training sessions, so your positive reactions will be understood clearly as praise.


When you are stressed, your puppy will pick up on your cues. They may become fearful or unwilling to participate in training when they sense you are displeased with the situation., Training is an important aspect of your relationship with your puppy. However, you need to be cognizant of the limitations of training. Your puppy is young and they are not able to participate in training the same way an older well-trained dog would be. They can learn basic commands, like sit and stay, but will struggle to follow more advanced commands like tricks, because of their mental capacity.Keep your expectations in mind if you find yourself starting to get frustrated at your less interested puppy.


Sometimes, you may need to pause the training session for your own benefit. It is better to revisit the training session at a later time than for you to get angry that your puppy isn’t cooperating like you think they should be., During training sessions, your puppy might seem uninterested or hesitant to participate if they feel like they don’t know what to expect. This can cause stress and lead to them avoiding future training sessions. Being consistent in your tone, mood, and approach to training will help your puppy associate training with a positive activity. In turn, your puppy will become more interested in training for future sessions.If you live in a household with other people, make sure that everyone is on the same page about training. Multiple trainers can confuse a puppy but you also want the dog to respond to each person’s commands. Consistency is key in this scenario.

, While most people assume that all dogs are inherently food-motivated, this may not be the case with your pup. Some breeds, like Labradors and beagles, are very food-motivated and will do anything for a treat. Other breeds are pickier with their treats, like herders and terriers, and will only respond to treats that they find truly appealing. Use high reward treats to motivate puppies who seem disinterested in training.High reward treats are special treats that your puppy doesn’t get often, like a cube of steak or chicken, where a regular treat would be a piece of their kibble or regular food., Even the most food-motivated dogs will not respond to treats when they’re full. While you shouldn’t starve your puppy, they’ll be more interested in training and the prospect of treats when they’re a little hungry than they would be if they just finished a big meal. A puppy that is a little hungry will be much more willing to work for treats than a full puppy will be.Feeding your puppy on a consistent schedule is also very helpful for other training endeavors, like for housebreaking. Wait at least two hours after feeding to train your puppy, or train right before meal time.

, Puppies, and dogs in general, do not have the same perception of time as people do. They do not understand delayed gratification and need immediate rewards to reinforce good behavior. This can be challenging at times, but it is important to be consistent. Reward them with a treat or praise as soon as they complete the command that you have just given.


For example, when you are teaching the sit command, it is important to reward the puppy while they are still sitting rather than when they stand back up again. If you wait until they are standing again, they will think that you are rewarding them for standing rather than for sitting and following the command. This is why you need to have treats handy during your training and be quick to give verbal praise., Puppies, especially working breeds, want to please their owners. Verbal praise, like “good job” and “good girl” when they follow your commands will help to cement the good behavior into their minds. Puppies that aren’t interested in training will most likely be more excited and motivated by food, but verbal praise is a good way to complement your training and to make training sessions positive environments.You should use praise the same way as you use treats, as an immediate reward for good behavior. Be sure that you offer the praise as soon as the puppy completes the command.

, Some dogs are more toy-motivated than they are food or praise driven. This means that they’d rather focus their attention on a favorite ball or plush toy than on a treat. You can incorporate toys into your training routine by holding on to their favorite toy while you give commands. This ensures that their attention is focused on you and they are willing to follow your commands for a chance to play with the toy.You may find that your dog is more motivated by toys one day and treats another. This is fine, just be prepared to switch up your positive reinforcement methods to ensure your puppy stays excited and focused.

Start out in a safe, quiet space.,
Carry around food.,
Start near the dog.,
Adjust your direction based on your dog’s actions.,
Practice often.",How to Get Your Dog to Follow You1," When you are first training your dog to follow you, make sure that you do it in an enclosed area, such as a fenced in yard. Also, make sure to do what you can to reduce distractions for your dog. Train him during a quiet time of day to ensure that his full attention will be on you.

If you don’t have an enclosed backyard, then make sure your dog is on a leash. You can also use a leash in your backyard to help keep your dog’s attention on you.;
, One way you may be able to get your dog to follow you is by using food or treats. Start with a handful of kibble or small treats. Make sure your dog knows that you have food in your hand. Let them smell the food in your hand. Then, walk away from them.


If they don't follow you, use the food to lure them to you. Stop every few feet and hold out some kibble or treats to entice them to come closer and follow you.
Make sure to give your dog lots of positive reinforcement by praising them for following your instructions.

, You can get your dog to follow you by training them to obey the “follow” command. Start by standing near your dog. Command your dog using the keyword, and then immediately walk away. Don’t wait for them to follow you or you will confuse the dog.Choose a word or phrase to use, such as “follow” or “come along.”
Use a treat to reward the dog for responding to the command. If they follow you after hearing the command word, give them a reward. This will reinforce the behavior.

, Make sure to reinforce the “follow” command by keeping your dog in a position to follow you. You should remain in front of the dog at all times. Never let the dog get ahead of you, stop, or go off to the side.For example, if the dog slows down or stops, move ahead more quickly to encourage your dog to be near you.
If your dog gets ahead of you, stop and turn to walk in the opposite direction. Call your dog again.
If your dog goes to the right, you should go left and call your dog to follow you.

, Training your dog to follow you takes time. Your dog won’t learn it immediately. Depending on the dog, it may take weeks or months to fully train to follow you, especially if the dog is new to you. Don’t get discouraged if they don’t learn automatically. Keep reinforcing the behavior.Continue using treats to get your dog to follow you and to call them to you. Eventually, the behavior will be learned and your dog will follow you.
Remember to offer your dog lots of over the top praise to make training sessions a positive experience for them.

Take your dog for a walk beforehand.,
Bring treats.,
Give your dog chew toys.,
Bring a portable water bowl.",How to Get a Dog to Behave in Restaurants1," A tired dog is a well behaved dog. Before you bring your dog to a restaurant, take it for a long walk, to the dog park, or play a tiring game of fetch with your dog. This way, all of your dog’s energy will be depleted and it will be less likely to act up.Take your dog out for at least 30 minutes, if not an hour. However, the amount of exercise or play time your dog needs to become tired will depend on its breed, age, and health.;
, The availability of food at a restaurant may cause your dog to become restless or beg for food. However, bringing treats along with you can help curb any temptations. Therefore, make sure to bring enough treats with you to keep your dog distracted.Make sure to only give your dog treats when it is behaving. In other words, make sure you do not give it treats while it is begging for food. First ask your dog to sit, and then reward it with a treat.

, Chew toys, food puzzles, and/or treat-dispensing toys are a great way to distract a restless dog. Therefore, make sure to bring plenty of these along with you to keep your dog busy if it becomes restless or overwhelmed.For example, Bully Sticks, Kongs, and Adventure Boxes are great high-value treats that will keep your dog busy for at least 10 to 20 minutes.
Refusing to lick or chew its favorite chew toy is a sign of nervousness. If your dog continues to show signs of anxiety, then ask the server to box up your food and leave.

, Your dog might become restless or anxious if it is thirsty. Bring a portable water bowl along with you to ensure that your dog is hydrated. Ask a server to bring a glass of water and pour the water into your dog’s bowl. Make sure to replenish the bowl as needed, especially on hot days.Place your dog’s bowl under the table to prevent it from being knocked over by servers' and guests’ feet.

Cover electrical outlets.,
Keep wires out of reach.,
Secure bookshelves.,
Be careful with hanging cords from blinds.,
Secure heavy objects.",How to Protect Dogs and Cats from Household Dangers2," If your dog or cat licks an uncovered electrical outlet, this poses a health risk. It can cause electrical shock. You can purchase outlet covers at a local department store. Keep these in place when outlets are not in use., Some dogs and cats may chew through electrical wires, which can cause electrical shock. Try to keep wires off the floor if possible or keep them behind furniture to prevent access. You can also purchase plastic or vinyl strips and use these to cover wire.If you have many different wires, try taping together and pushing them into an out-of-reach place in your home.

, Bookshelves can be knocked over, which can be very dangerous if they fall on a cat or a dog. Other top-heavy furniture can also topple over on a pet, so make sure such furniture is secure.You can use strips designed to keep furniture stable during an earthquake to secure things like bookshelves to the wall. If you live in an area where earthquakes are a common occurrence, such strips may typically be sold with furniture. You can also purchase these strips online.

, Cats and dogs may play with the dangling strings from hanging cords. If tangled around your pet's neck, your pet can choke. Tie the cords together so they're kept out of reach of pets. Make sure not to tie the cords in a loop, as this also poses a choking hazard., Make sure you place heavy objects, like vases or sculptures, on a flat surface where they are unlikely to fall. If an object is placed in an unstable position or on a wobbly surface, this can pose a risk for a household pets. Pets can be hurt if such an object falls on them.Very young animals, like puppies or kittens, may be more likely to get into things. It may be best to put heavy objects away altogether until a younger pet gets older and less curious.

Do not keep poisonous plants in your home.,
Keep string products out of reach.,
Place medications out of reach.,
Keep your pet away from poisons and insecticides.,
Be careful with holiday decorations.",How to Protect Dogs and Cats from Household Dangers3," There are many common household plants that are safe for dogs and cats. However, certain plants are toxic to animals. Plants such as azalea, dieffenbachia, lilies, mistletoe and philodendron are poisonous to pets.Websites like the Humane Society and ASPCA website can give you complete guides to which plants are toxic. Always consult such sources before bringing a new plant into your home.

, String can be dangerous to pets when ingested. Products like rubber bands, ribbons, shoe strings, yarn, and other shoe-like materials should not be left out around pets. These especially pose a risk for cats, who may play with and swallow such objects. This can lead to intestinal blockage, which is potentially fatal., Medications can be deadly to pets if swallowed. They should always be kept out of reach from pets. Keep your medications in high drawers you can close securely.Never give medications designed for humans to a pet.
Do not rely on childproof locks to keep a dog or cat out of medications. An animal can easily chew through such bottles.

, If you need to treat a pest problem in your home, choose poisons and insecticides carefully. Read labels closely to find advice for using such products safely around pets. In general, things like roach traps and other poisons should be kept out of reach of household pets.When possible, opt for non-chemical and humane pest control measures. These are generally safer for household pets.

, Around the holidays, there are often extra threats to household pets. Be careful when decorating. Keep the health and safety of your pets in mind.Holiday lights pose a particularly strong risk of choking. These should be kept out of reach of dogs and cats.

Place your dog on a long leash.,
Command the dog to come to you.,
Reward your dog for coming to you.,
Increase the distance as the dog learns.",How to Get Your Dog to Follow You2," You can help teach your dog to follow you by teaching them to come when called. Start by placing the dog on a long rope or leash. This rope or leash should be long enough so that the dog can run around and play with some freedom.You may want to get a cheap rope or lead from a hardware or home improvement store since most leashes are too short.

, With your dog on the lead, use the ""come"" command. If they don't come towards you when you give the command, correct them softly. Pull the dog towards you gently by reeling the rope in slowly. Make sure to use the command of ""come"" again while pulling them towards you.

, Make your dog want to come to you when called by using positive reinforcement. When the dog obeys, present them with a treat, praise, or a toy.Avoid punishing the dog, yelling at them, or hitting them for not obeying. This will make your dog not want to come to you.
Give your dog lots and lots of praise! Praising them for following your instructions will help to motivate them to continue with training and make training a positive experience for them.

, At first, start this exercise with the dog close to you. You should be far enough away that the dog has to walk towards you, but not so far that they are on the other side of the yard. When the dog masters coming to you at this point, expand the distance between the two of you slowly.Continue expanding the distance between you and the dog until the dog gets to the length of the rope or lead.

Teach your dog to bark on cue.,
Induce your dog to bark.,
Introduce the quiet command.,
Reward silence.",How to Get a Dog to Behave in Restaurants2," Barking is unacceptable behavior for dogs at restaurants, including dog-friendly restaurants. Before bringing your dog to a restaurant, make sure it knows the “quiet” command. To teach your dog the quiet command you will first need to teach it to bark on cue., Make your dog bark by either making a barking sound, or by doing something that sets off the barking, like ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door. While your dog is barking, say a cue word, like “speak” and give your dog a treat.To reinforce the speak command, use a distinctive hand signal that will cue the command, for example, like waiving your hand or a pointer finger in the air.
Say, “speak,” again until your dog begins to bark. Reward it for barking by giving it a treat.
Repeat this step until your dog understands the “speak” command.

, Once your dog can reliably bark on command, introduce the “quiet” command. In a calm environment with little distractions, firmly tell your dog to “speak.” Your dog should begin barking. When your dog begins to bark say, “quiet,” with a distinctive hand gesture. When your dog stops barking, wait a couple seconds, then give it a treat.If your dog keeps barking, wait until it stops barking, reward it with a treat. Remember to wait a couple seconds before giving it a treat so it can associate the correct behavior with the treat.
Add a second or two of silence every day before you give it a treat. Try to work your way up to 10 seconds of silence before giving it a treat.

, Reinforce the idea that silence is a desirable trait by actively seeking out your dog and rewarding it for being silent throughout the day. Try to do this once or twice a day.For example, if your dog is silently sitting by your feet, reward it with affection and/or treats for being good. While petting your dog you can say, “That’s a good girl (or boy),” and give it a treat.

Make sure your dog knows basic commands.,
Keep your dog on a short leash.,
Choose a quiet location.",How to Get a Dog to Behave in Restaurants3," Teaching your dog the basic commands like sit, stay, and come will help you control your dog's behavior at any restaurant. If your dog does not know these commands, it is recommended that you teach your dog these commands yourself, or place it in a basic obedience class before bringing it to a restaurant.Find a basic obedience class at your local pet store, or ask your veterinarian for recommendations.

, While you are at the restaurant it is important that you keep your dog on a short leash, for example, a leash that does not exceed four feet. You will be able to control your dog better with a short leash. A short leash will prevent your dog from bothering other guests and from retrieving fallen food scraps from other tables.Do not attach the leash to the table. Instead, attach the leash to your chair or to your belt loop.

, If you know that your dog is restless, or is easily tempted by food, people, or other dogs, then choose a quiet place to sit in the restaurant. Choose a spot that is off in the corner and away from high traffic areas. This way, your dog will be less tempted by external stimuli, and you will be able to keep your dog's behavior under control."

Observe the development of new skills and behaviors.",How to Find the Right Trainer for Your Dog," Think about about your specific needs. Depending on the kind of learning you want your dog to experience, you will have very different needs for a trainer. Some trainers specialize in improving the behavior of adult fear aggressive dogs, whereas others are better with open minded puppies.


For instance, perhaps you need to tame a fearful or aggressive dog, or your dog has ongoing difficulty with separation anxiety. These issues require a professional with specialized training in these areas that can give your dog one-on-one attention.
You may need to train a new dog or a puppy, which should inform the type of trainer you choose. A dog training facility that holds group puppy classes would be a good place to start.;
, Consider which of your friends or family members has the most experience with dog training. Ask them to have coffee with you and share their dog training experiences. Perhaps they will have general tips or specific recommendations on good dog trainers for your needs.You can say, ""Bob, your dog is a pleasure to be around. Did you work with a trainer that you would recommend?""

, Go to the dog park and observe interactions between dogs and their owners. When the owner makes a request or issues a command to their dog, look at how the dog responds. First, see whether the dog obeys the command or not. Second, consider how the dog obeys the command. Look for signs that the dog has been trained with punitive or positive methods:If the dog responds to the request with their tail between their legs and their eyes averted, they may have been trained with punitive methods. This is not a sign of good dog training.
If the dog responds with their tail and their ears pointed up and with a cheerful demeanor, it is a sign that positive reward training was used. This is a sign of good dog training.

, Look around at the dogs in your life or in your neighborhood. If a friend comes over with their dog and it looks well behaved, ask who trained it. And if you are at the park and see an especially well behaved dog, ask the individual where they went for dog training.If they look like they would be open for conversation, try asking: “Excuse me, sir, I notice that your dog is especially well behaved. I am actually looking for a dog trainer right now, so I was wondering if you could share with me which trainer you used. Thanks so much for your time.”

, Although veterinarians are not necessarily specialists in dog training, they are often well connected to dog behaviorists and trainers. They may be able to give you a good recommendation for a trainer that meets your needs., Compile the list of dog trainers you have found by talking to friends, family members, your veterinarian and observing well behaved dogs. Now that you have a shortlist of possible candidates in your area, you can begin figuring out which trainers would be most appropriate for you.

, There is no universally acknowledged standardization for dog trainers. However, there are a variety of certifications for behaviorists of various kinds as well as independent dog trainer certifications, which require varying levels of education and experience. Requirements range from a doctoral degree and five years of clinical experience to trainers who have passed exams and a minimum of three hundred hours of training experience. Ask potential trainers about their training and experience:Veterinary behaviorists are vets themselves who have finished a two-year residency with a board-certified veterinarian. They are certified with the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB).
Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists have a PhD and five years of clinical experience.
Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists have a Master’s degree and clinical experience.
Applied Animal Behaviorists have graduate level education in a field related to animal behavior.
Trainers certified with the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers have 300 hours of experience, passed a 250 question exam, and must undergo recertification every three years.
Trainers certified by the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC) have finished three years and 1,500 hours of consulting work as well as 500 hours of dog training related education.
Many titles are used such as dog psychologist or behavior specialist but these do not necessarily mean anything if there is no related certification., You should ask the potential dog trainers whether they use humane training methods that rely on positive reinforcement. Also, ask whether punitive techniques like shock collars, choking, shaking, tugging, yelling or alpha rolling are used. If the trainer uses punitive techniques, you may want to look elsewhere because these are no longer considered humane., You should find out their previous experience working with your specific breed and size of dog. Also, you should inquire into whether they have worked with dogs with similar behavioral issues and personality. Consider asking:“Have you ever trained large mixed breed dogs like mine?”
“Have you ever trained fear aggressive dogs that are very difficult like mine?”
“Do you know much about small, shy dogs?”
“Do you prior experience with English cocker spaniels?”
“What is your background when it comes to training labradoodles?”

, You should inquire into the type of training equipment that they use such as collars, leashes, harnesses, toys, clickers and other tools. You may want to ask whether they use a slip or choke collar, especially since these are controversial tools and, if not used properly, can injure a dog. See if they use newer, safety collars or even classic collars which tend to be safe.Safety collars eliminate the risk of choking, since they release if there is too much pressure.
Buckle collars are great for everyday use. They connect with a buckle.
Head halters are used when a dog has a hard time with obedient walking with a regular collar.
E-collars are used to control a dog in an enclosed area.
If your dog tends to pull you when you walk, you might ask whether they front-clip harnesses which can help solve this problem., Food treats can be used very effectively to train dogs, since they are a reward that dogs are born to love. However, food treats can also be used as bribery during the training process, which will initiate a pattern that can be difficult to break once established. Ask the trainer how they get dogs to do the work prior to seeing the reward, since the key is for the food treat to be invisible until the reward is offered.


“How do you use food treats to train dogs?”
“Do you ever use bribes?”
“How do you use food as a reward in the training process? Can you give an example?”

, You want to find out if they rely solely on food treats or if other rewards are used such as toys, snuggle time or praise. A good trainer will use different types of rewards, so find out what the trainer has up their sleeve for reward based training., Once you have had a good conversation with the trainer and determine that they use positive reinforcement, appropriate rewards and have a solid level of education and experience, you may want to observe their work. Ask if you can observe one of their dog training classes or individual sessions. When observing the trainer with the dogs, consider whether the trainer uses solid teaching techniques, shows care and attention to the dogs and seems knowledgeable., Inquire into the cost of individual training sessions for your dog as well as kennel school programs. Depending on the education and experience level of the trainer, the price will vary significantly. Based on this inquiry, determine which trainer you can afford.


Individual training costs in the range of $30-$100 per hour.
Dogs with behavioral issues will cost at least $100 per hour.
You can purchase packages of dog training sessions, with prices ranging from #240-$600 for six sessions.
Kennel schools for four to six weeks cost in the range of $1000-$2500.Try not to choose a dog trainer on cost alone. An expensive trainer may be well-worth the cost when it comes to results and potentially save you money in the long run.

, See how your dog responds to the trainer. If you notice your dog is scared, they may not be the right trainer for your dog. However, if your dog looks excited, cheerful, wags their tail or shows other positive signs, you may have found the right trainer for your dog.

, Review your list of potential dog trainers and consider which candidates are best suited for training your dog. You should consider their education, experience, background with your breed, humane training methods and use of food and training equipment. You may also want to consider convenience or, in other words, whether they can train your dog at your home or whether you have to drive to a distant location. Then, consider the list of candidates based on affordability. Choose the best suited dog trainer that you can afford.

, You should consider whether the trainer is actually teaching your dog what you want your dog to learn. If the dog trainer is teaching your dog appropriate content that relates to your goals for them, it is likely a good fit. If they are not teaching your dog the skills and behavior changes you are looking for, you may need to find a new trainer., You should consider the quality and amount of attention that your dog trainer gives you and your dog. If the dog trainer is very talented but too busy to give quality attention to training your dog, misses or reschedules appointments, perhaps it is time to change trainers. However, if the trainer is busy but still manages to devote quality attention to your dog, you may want to stick with them., You should assess whether the trainer is using the positive training methods and tools they advertised. Watch them train your dog and see if they are using appropriate rewards, quality training tools like leashes and dog toys or clickers. Consider the following factors in your decision:If they are using choke collars or prongs to punish your dog, you should find a new trainer.
If they are describing your dog as being “dominant,” you should inquire further to find out whether the trainer is using punitive techniques. The word “dominant” to describe your dog may indicate a misdiagnosis and could be associated with punitive, old school training approaches.
If they use the term “pack leader,” they may be an old school trainer using punitive techniques. You may want to look elsewhere.
If they are using any kind of physical punishment to train your dog, you may want to look for a new trainer.

, You should track the development of your dog’s new skills and behaviors. Consider whether or not you are happy with your dog’s overall development and specifically in relation to the skills being taught by the trainer.If your dog is learning to sit with the dog trainer, you should practice this behavior at home. See if your dog has learned to comply with the request to sit. If they have been practicing this behavior for months with the trainer and still won’t do it at home, perhaps you should find a new trainer.

Take your dog to obedience classes.",How to Get Your Dog to Follow You3," Your dog may not follow you because the two of you don’t share an attachment. To help bond with your dog, you should actively spend more time with them. This helps your dog learn that you love and care for it.You can play games with your dog, like chase, fetch, or tug-of-war. You may also want to place your dog’s bed near you in your bedroom.
Feeding time is a great way to bond with your dog. It helps your dog understand that you are the one taking care of them and meeting their basic needs.

, Another way to get your dog to follow you is to give them some type of positive reinforcement. This helps them to associate you with positive things, like verbal praise, pets, treats, or some other special treatment.This type of treatment will help your dog think that following you will result in some type of reward, which can lead to them following you more.
Remember to give your dog plenty of praise for following your instructions.

, Another way to get your dog to follow you is to engage in physical activity with them. Take your dog for a walk, take them on a hike, or go for a run. This will help you and your dog bond, which will increase your dog’s need to be near you and follow you.You may even let your dog run or walk behind you on a leash to practice following you.
For older dogs, you can go on short, slow walks. You may also play with a toy in the yard, like tossing the ball a little bit in front of you.

, If you have a puppy, you can use hide-and-seek to help them develop a stronger desire to be near you. Puppies want to be near their owners, so if your puppy wanders off instead of following you, hide. Your puppy will start to search for you. Praise the dog when they find you with a treat, verbal praise, or pets., If you are unable to teach your dog to follow you on your own, you may want to take them to see a trainer. In a class, you and your dog can work on basic commands, including follow.Training also strengthens the bond between you and your dog. The stronger the bond between the two of you, the more likely they will follow you.

Set up a fenced-off outdoor space for your dog.,
Avoid crowded areas if your dog is prone to barking.",How to Keep Your Dog Under Control Outside1," If your dog tends to bark at people or other animals when they are outside, you may want to teach them the “quiet” command. This command can encourage your dog to stop barking and calm down.You can teach your dog the “quiet” command by saying “quiet” in a normal tone and making eye contact with your dog. Hold a treat in your hand when you do it and only give your dog the treat once they stop barking.
You may need to practice this command several times with your dog so they understand that when you say “quiet” that means, stop barking. Do not yell or shout at your dog when you are trying to get them to be quiet as this often just makes them more alarmed and prone to barking.;
, You can also get your dog to quiet down and stop barking by using a distracting activity. You may distract your dog by giving them their favorite toy or by engaging them in another activity, like having them “sit” or “stay.”


Make sure you have a toy with you when you take your dog for a walk, as you can then use it to distract your dog if they start to bark at a person or another animal.

, You can keep your dog from barking by creating an outdoor space that is fenced off just for them. You may have this space in your backyard or on another spot on your property. Make sure the area has a fence that is high enough to block your dog’s view so they are not tempted to bark at people or other animals walking by.You may allow your dog to go off leash when they are in the fenced area. If you do so, make sure the area is secure and they cannot get out to bark or bother anyone.

, If you know your dog is prone to bad behavior when they are around big crowds or a lot of other dogs, such as barking, you may stay away from these situations. Though it is important to socialize your dog and have them interact with other people and other pets, you may limit these sorts of interactions. Keep your dog on a leash when you are in crowded areas with them and try to take them to less crowded areas if they tend to misbehave around too many people.You may also limit your dog’s interactions to only a few dogs that they like or seem to get along with. For example, maybe there is a dog in the neighborhood they seem to get along with. You may then suggest a play date or go for a walk with the other dog so your dog can still be social, but the activity is controlled.

Without an established pack leader, your dog will feel the need to take over this role himself, which can cause the behavioral problems.If you take on the role of pack leader, you can reduce your dog's anxiety and nervousness. Your dog will also be less likely to act out, potentially harming you or others. Fortunately, you can make changes to the social structure of your household no matter how old or young your dog is.;
, To better communicate, realize that your dog tends to live in the present much more than you do. This means your dog is much more comfortable with learning new things or new situations, regardless of any trouble he may have had with them in the past. If you start to think in the present too, you'll understand your dog better.Since dogs don't communicate the same way as humans do, understand that you don't need to show affection just by touching or feeding your dog. Understand that you can discipline or praise your dog by simply glancing at your dog. Know that your eyes and energy can convey a wide range of messages.

, Since pack leaders take the best resting and sleeping spots, you should control your dog's use of things like couches, chairs, and beds. Your dog should look to you before entering these areas. If your dog usually decides when to use these areas, then the boundaries are not clear within your pack. Make pack rules clearer by removing your dog from these areas.You should also set boundaries by only responding to calm behavior. For example, teach your dog that he will only get his food if he's relaxed, not jumping up on you begging to be fed.Occasionally, you can let your dog join you on a reserved space if you really want him to. However, you shouldn't let him sleep in your bed with you. This will confuse him about who officially controls the bed area.
Be firm with the boundaries you set. For example, if you never allow your dog to play in a certain room, offer him alternative spaces to play and make sure he never plays in an off-limits area.

, Don't forget that playtime is important for your dog's mental stability and your relationship with your dog. Part of your job as pack leader is guiding your dog through life by being a confident, loving, tough, and fair leader. Remember that as pack leader, you decide when it's time to play and when playtime is over. Your dog should look for your permission to begin playing.For example, your dog might quickly glance in your direction or bring his favorite toy to your lap. Then, you can decide whether it's okay to pay or not. If your dog respects you as pack leader, he will realize that you may not say it's alright to play., In the wild, pack leaders enforce rules and boundaries with a calm and assertive energy. Pack leaders don't bully or use violence to show their authority, and neither should you. While it's easy to become frustrated with your dog if he continually breaks rules, never lose your patience.Remember, your dog can sense changes in your attitude and energy better than other humans can. This makes it especially important to stay calm during emotional situations.

, In the wild, the pack leader decides who gets to eat, when they get to eat, and how much they can have. You too should control your dog's food, but make sure water is always available. If your dog shows aggressive behavior or is protective of his food dish, it's because he doesn't see you as the leader. To avoid food aggression, occasionally pick up your dog's food dish while he's eating and return it to him later. This shows him that you control his food and he'll respect you as pack leader.Have the mindset that everything belongs to you and you're only loaning things to your dog, like food, food bowls, toys, dog beds and crates. You should be able to move, clean, or handle any of these without your dog getting upset., One way to prove yourself as pack leader is to always walk through doorways or gates ahead of your dog when entering or leaving your home. This shows your dog your dog that you're in charge and he can be confident with you as his leader.


This trust and confidence in you helps reduce the likelihood that there will be any separation anxiety in situations where you leave your home without your dog., As an alpha figure, set the rules for an enjoyable walk with your dog on his leash. Don't allow your dog to walk in front of your or pull and tug on the leash. Instead, have your dog walk beside or behind you. To do this, you should walk your dog with a standard, 6-foot, non-retractable leash. Hold the leash so that there's only enough room for your dog to stay by your side without being able to move in front of you.


As pack leader, you should always be the frontrunner in any walk. This will signal to your dog that you're in control., As pack leader, you're responsible for raising a good canine citizen. Teach your dog basic commands including, ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" and ""lie down."" Your dog should eventually learn to respond quickly and correctly to your commands. To encourage your dog, use positive reinforcement techniques, by rewarding your dog with treats, affection and positive words, such as ""good dog."" Commands show your dog that you're in charge, help you keep your dog's behavior in line, and teach your dog how to be a well-rounded member of your pack.


You can start training puppies at 1 to 2 months old and even old dogs can learn new tricks.
If positive training techniques don't work, try another training method that doesn't involve strong discipline during training., It's your job as pack leader to make sure your dog stays active and healthy, allowing the pack to thrive. Take your dog one or two 20 to 30 minute walks a day. This can keep your dog mentally and physically healthy.If your dog is inactive, he can become restless and bored. This can lead to unwanted behavior, like chewing, or barking.

, As a leader, you need to be consistent and clear with your rules. Occasionally bending rules only confuses your dog and sends the message that you're not a reliable leader. Your goal is to always remain strong and fair in your dog's eyes and show him that you are the best choice for a trustworthy pack leader. Repetition and consistency are best ways your dog will learn.For example, if you reprimand your dog for begging at the dinner table today and then feed him scraps from the same dinner table tomorrow, you are not being clear and consistent with your pack rules. This can plant a seed of doubt in your dog's mind that you may not be a very strong leader.

, Your dog will likely act up at some point and as pack leader, you'll need to put him in his place. To do so, immediately deal with the misbehavior; don't wait even a few minutes. Calmly and in a firm voice, give your dog a basic command. Your goal is to reassert your authority and remove him from the bad behavior.For example, if your dog jumps up on other people, calmly and firmly tell him to ""sit."" If he still misbehaves, remove him from the area, withdrawing your attention.

Teach your dog hunting specific commands.",How to Do Short Training Sessions with Your Hunting Dog," Hunting dogs and their owners need to have a special bond that is built on mutual trust and respect. In the beginning, you’ll need to start building this bond by spending time with your dog. Pet your pup to make it happy. Show your dog some affection by petting it and spending time with it. Let the dog know it is your companion.Take the dog with you places and put a bed for it in your bedroom to sleep in at night.;
, Establish a regular feeding routine for your dog. If your dog learns to rely on you for its meals, it will trust you in other aspects of its life as well. This means that your dog will listen to you more effectively and follow commands, which is a very important skill for hunting dogs to learn.Feed your dog once in the morning and once in the evening, following the advice of your veterinarian.

, Your dog needs plenty of exercise, especially if you want it to develop into a good hunting dog. Strengthen your bond with your dog by taking it for walks. This will let the two of you spend more time together while also teaching your dog to follow commands – like walking on a leash and following your lead. These skills will be important in the field, so you need to help your hunting dog master them early on.Most hunting dogs need about 30 minutes of exercise every day, depending on the breed.

, Let your dog familiarize itself with the great outdoors by taking it outside on short excursions. Let it smell the foliage and run around off leash (if you can allow your dog to safely run off leash). This will help your dog get used to being outside like it will be when you take it on hunting trips later.Try to take your dog specifically to places you intend to hunt so it can get accustomed to the landscape. This will help your dog be less distracted once you actually take it hunting.

, When you take a dog hunting, your dog may have to run through some creeks, rivers, or streams – or even swim out into a lake. To help your dog feel comfortable with this, you should encourage it to encounter water from an early age. Teach your dog to swim by taking it to places you can help it learn to swim. Try it at a swimming pool.Don’t push your dog too hard at first. You may need to pick it up and carry it across the water the first few times. Let your dog go at the pace it wants.

, Help your dog learn how to go off-leash by training it, teaching it to come, teaching it to stay, and by using positive reinforcement.You’ll need your dog to be trained to go off-leash if you want it to work for you as a hunting dog.

, Gather a really drippy treat, like a small slab of raw meat, lunchmeat, or cheese dipped in water. Do not dip meat in water as this will dilute the smell. Let the dog smell the treat and figure out that it wants to eat it.


Eventually, you’ll be able to transition to using dry treats. But you’ll probably need to start off with wet treats to entice the dog even more., Have someone hold the pup at the far end of your lawn or a large field. Put a long string on the drippy treat. Standing next to the person, let the dog smell the treat. Drag the treat along the ground – around obstacles and under bushes or crops. Make sure the dog can still smell the treat, but have the person holding the leash keeping the dog put.Be careful not to let the dog catch the treat yet; you want to make your dog practice following the scent.

, Leave the treat on the ground at the end of the trail, but make sure you remove the string. Come back to the dog and unleash it. Let your dog follow the scent trail until it finds the treat.Once the dog finds the treat, reward and praise it accordingly.

, Do this in many short sessions, gradually moving to dry treats as the dog gets better. Frequency is more important than length of the training, as the dog will soon see the pattern and begin to expect, then know, what to do next.Focus on short, but frequent, training sessions that will help your dog learn how to react and what you expect from it.

, When your pup is very young, try to make as much noise around it as possible. Start slow so as not to scare your pup and build your way up to louder noises. You want your dog to grow up being accustomed to a variety of loud noises, voices, and sounds.Once you are ready to start training your dog in the field, start bring the gun with you on walks. Then move forward to firing some shots while the dog is far away in the field looking for birds.
Continue this practice while you keep getting closer and closer to the dog.
Begin with a quieter handgun (like a .22 pistol) and then work your way up to a louder shotgun.
Make sure your dog sees your guns on a regular basis before you start training it for hunting. You don’t want the first association the dog has with the gun to be the loud noise it makes.

, To start the transition from treats to animals, you’ll need to spend some time practicing with your dog. Hide some birds in the open field and let your dog track them on its own. Allow your dog to bite and play with the bird the first few times so that it gets used to the sensation of the bird in its mouth.Once your dog has started getting used to the procedure, you can incorporate some gun shots in to the tracking routines so that your dog begins to associate the sound of the gun with the hunt for the birds (or other animals).

, One of the most important commands to teach a hunting dog is the “hold” command. This means that the dog should hold the prey in its mouth until you come to physically remove it.Begin teaching your dog while it is right next to you. Tell your dog to “hold” until you are satisfied. Keep moving farther and farther away each time you practice. The dog should only stop holding when you have reached its location and have taken the prey out of its mouth yourself.
Once he has mastered this command, you can switch to “release” which will indicate to your dog that you want it to drop the prey out of its mouth.
Be sure to use positive reinforcement while teaching this command.

Tell your dog to get ""down"" if they jump on others.,
Teach your dog the “sit and stay” command.,
Get your dog to “go to their place.” The command “go to place” can also be good to teach your dog if you want them to go to a designated spot outside to calm down.,
Make sure your dog understands the ""come"" command.",How to Keep Your Dog Under Control Outside2," If you notice your dog tends to jump up on people when you take them outside for a walk, you should use the “down” command. Teach your dog not to jump up on other people or other animals by using this command.If you notice your dog jumping on someone else, tell the person to calmly turn their back on your dog. Then say, “down” to your dog, lightly tugging on their leash. Once they get down, reward them with a treat.

, This basic command can help your dog stay calm and in one place if they get distracted or riled up outside. You may start by teaching your dog this command indoors and then try having your dog do it during their walks. This way, you can use it on your dog if they start to get too excited while on a walk or when around other dogs.To teach your dog to “sit and stay,” hold a treat in your hand. Then, tell your dog to sit. You may need to lightly tap their butt towards the ground so they know to sit. Once they sit, say “Good job!” and give them the treat.
Another way to teach the dog ""sit"" is to hold a treat above their head where they can see it. Slowly move the treat over their head towards their back. As you do this, say ""sit."" Usually, dogs will try to follow the treat with their eyes. As the treat passes over their back, they will naturally sit so they can see it. Reward the dog once they sit.
Then, hold another treat in your hand and say, “stay.” Only give your dog the treat if they stay in the seated position. Once they have sat and stayed for 10 to 20 seconds, say “Good job” and give them the treat.

, You may use this command if you plan to let your dog off their leash in your backyard or in a fenced-off area.To get your dog to follow the “go to place” command, lay out a mat or a towel on the ground outside. Then, hold out a treat and say, “go to the place” while pointing at the mat or towel. Once your dog goes to the mat or towel, say “sit” and “stay.” Give your dog the treat as a reward.
You may need to reinforce this command by having your dog practice it several times, rewarding them with a treat every time they do it correctly. With enough practice, your dog should respond correctly to this command, indoors and outdoors.

, If you are worried about your dog chasing after birds, squirrels, or other critters when you are outside with them, you should teach them the “come” command. Tell your dog to “come” if they start to stray away from you on their leash. Reward them with a treat once they return to you. Over time, they should follow the command without a treat as a reward.You can also deter your dog from chasing something they shouldn’t by taking out one of their toys and playing with them. If you notice your dog staring at a squirrel in the yard, for example, distract them by throwing the toy at them and engaging them in play.

You can teach your dog this command when they are on their leash. Use one of your dog’s toys as the “leave it” object.Hold your dog on the leash and hold a treat in your other hand. Throw your dog’s toy a few feet away from them. When your dog goes for it, lightly tug on the leash and say “leave it.” Once your dog backs off, reward them with a treat.
You may need to practice this command several times with your dog until they obey the “leave it” command.

, If you are worried about your dog wandering off to eat garbage or other things on the ground, keep them on their leash during their walks. Walking your dog on a leash is good training and will ensure they stay within your control. Use a high quality leash that is at least six feet long.You may clip the leash to your waist so you can control your dog as they walk. Your dog should then walk to the side of you and at your pace. You can tug lightly on the leash if your dog gets out of hand or if they do not obey a command.

, Dogs often dig up dirt and soil when they are under-stimulated or bored. You can prevent your dog from digging in your yard by making sure they get enough exercise every day. Take your dog for a walk twice a day and make sure you play with them often. Tiring out your dog is one way of encouraging them to leave the dirt in the yard alone.You should also provide interesting, engaging toys for your dog, such as a Kong stuffed with treats. Having fun toys to play with can discourage your dog from digging up soil.
Sometimes dog will dig at the ground on hot days so they can lie in the cool dirt. If you notice your dog doing this, bring them inside to where it is cooler or set up an area for them outside in the shade.

Don't sacrifice quality for cost.",How to Find Low Cost Dog Training3," Government agencies dedicated to regulating and licensing dog trainers do not exist. Therefore, your top priority when looking into programs is to assess the trainer’s experience and qualifications. Find out how many years of experience they have training, and how they were educated.The trainer should have at least one to two years of work experience training dogs.
Determine if the trainer worked as an apprentice, has some kind of certification from a dog training program, or has a degree from a college or university in animal behavior.Additionally, ask the trainer if they can provide you with their clients’ contact information so you can assess the quality of their program.

, Pick a dog trainer that uses humane training techniques. Humane training techniques are techniques that encourage appropriate behavior through positive reinforcement, such as food, play, attention, or praise.Training techniques should never include yelling, shaking the scruff, choking, hitting, tugging on the leash, forcing the dog on its back, and other actions that inflict pain or frighten the dog.Ask the trainer if you can sit-in on one of their training classes before you sign up.

, Assess the size of the classes. The classes should be small classes that allow the trainer to provide individual attention and guidance for you and your dog. Also, make sure there are separate classes for puppies and adult dogs.Instructors should also provide handouts that outline the trainer’s lesson plans and methods of training.
Instructors should encourage other family members to participate in training, as well.
All dogs should be required to have their basic vaccinations before entering a program.

, If you find a low-cost training program, but are unsure about its quality, keep searching. People who place their dogs in a low-quality training program usually find themselves in a situation where they have to spend more money on re-training their dog.If you are uncomfortable asking the trainer questions, or the trainer does not communicate effectively, keep searching for other programs.
If your dog does not respond well to a certain method, the trainer should be willing to use other methods to train your dog. If not, choose a different program.

Use positive reinforcement.,
Ignore undesirable behavior.,
Be consistent.,
Make training fun.,
Avoid yelling at your dog.,
Never abuse your dog.,
Use only non-abusive negative punishments.,
Improve communication with clicker training.",How to Choose a Training Program for Your Dog1," It is extremely important that whatever training program you choose relies primarily on positive reinforcement to teach your dog desirable behavior. Whether training your dog on your own, with family members, or through a professional, training techniques must always be humane.Examples of positive reinforcement include rewarding appropriate behavior with treats, attention, play, and/or verbal praise.
Positive reinforcement is only one component of a category of training methods called operant conditioning. Operant conditioning focuses on manipulating your dog’s environment, so that good behaviors are reinforced with favorable consequences, and bad behaviors are punished with negative consequences.The methods outlined in the following steps make up the most common, effective, and ethical training programs.;
, Before your dog is trained, they will likely engage in inappropriate behavior. The best way to respond to lapses in good behavior is often to ignore it, which trains your dog to stop what they are doing via positive punishment. Meanwhile, be sure that positive reinforcement is withheld into the dog engages in the behavior you want to see.For example, if your dog is begging for food, neither yell at them nor give them anything. Simply ignore them. Instead, train them to lay down away from the table during meals, and reward them with a treat when they do so.
Another example of positive punishment is turning away whenever your dog jumps up. By ignoring this undesirable behavior, you're teaching your dog not to do it anymore.

, Consistency is extremely important to any training regimen. For instance, you and others that spend time around your dog encourage and disallow the same behaviors. If you are training your dog not to sit on the couch, but other family members do allow them to, they will be confused.Whether training your dog at home or having them trained professionally, talk to everyone in your household about the commands the dog is learning, and the importance of consistently following the training guidelines you share with them.
The importance of consistency holds no matter what training program you choose. Variation from whatever training program you're working on with your dog may even confuse your dog about what behaviors are encouraged.

, The more that you and your dog enjoy training sessions, the more productive they will be. Games, praising, and hugging are some of the most effective training techniques to use in your program.One easy way to associate training with fun is by always giving a command before your dog gets to do something they enjoy. For instance, have your dog sit before they are fed, go out for a walk, or before a stranger is allowed to pet them.

, Yelling should never be used a part of a training program. While it may temporarily stop an inappropriate behavior, it will not teach them that the behavior is inappropriate. Of course, You will want to use different tones with your dog for praising, directing, and disciplining your dog.In disciplinary situations, use short, loud commands to indicate that your dog should do something immediately. For instance, say something like “Down Boy!” or “Spot, No!”.
In emergency situations only, you can use a forceful voice to get your dog’s attention and interrupt a potentially dangerous scenario.

, The training process can be frustrating, especially when your dog makes progress but reverts to negative behavior momentarily. However, you must never abuse your dog. Not only is abuse unethical, it can also confuse your dog and make training harder for both you and your pet.


Never hit or shake your dog. Further, do not tug or jerk on their leash violently. Finally, forcing the dog onto their back, sometimes called alpha-rolling, is not recommended.
Avoid using painful training aids, like prong, choke, and pinch collars. These may result in long lasting behavioral issues, including fear and aggression.A a general rule of thumb, you should never do anything to intentionally frighten or cause pain to your dog.

, Negative punishments are another category of operant conditioning training techniques that can be effective. A negative punishment de-incentivizes a behavior by taking away something that your dog likes, such as a toy.For instance, while training your dog to play catch, they may try to jump up and grab the item you are throwing. You can hold the item out of the reach, in a location that they will clearly not be able to get it. This may indicate to them that you want them to stop.
While techniques that rely on negative punishment may work for some training situations, they are generally not as effective of other training methods, such as those based on positive reinforcement.
Remember, punishments of any type should only be used in contexts where you can safely and ethically convey to your dog that they are doing something they should not be doing. Physical punishments, like hitting, swatting, or rubbing your dog’s nose in messes, are abusive and should be avoided.

, Clicker training has become increasingly popular as a way to help you tell your dog that they did something you wanted them to do. It is based on behavioral psychology, and can add to the effectiveness of positive reinforcement training methods.Get a clicker designed for clicker training online or from a pet supplies store. As soon as your dog accomplishes an commanded task, such as fetching some thing you had made them wait to retrieve, use the clicker to send an auditory message and then reward them with a treat. Over time, they will learn that the clicker is a positive sign, and the click itself becomes a way to positively reinforce desired behavior.

Use eye contact with the dog to establish dominance.,
Try leash training with the dog.,
Use a crate to train your dog.,
Try clicker training on your dog.,
Get help from people trained in how to handle dogs.",How to Control Your Dog," In this way, you establish to the dog that you’re the boss, and the boss gets to decide whether the dog gets the reward or not.


Try a food-oriented treat, like a dog bone, a biscuit, or little pieces of cut up hot dog. Figure out which food your dog responds best to because this will vary among animals.
Some dogs respond more to positive reinforcements that aren’t food, such as toys, a rub to the belly, or a quick walk. Figure out what works for your own dog.
It’s important not to use negative reinforcements with the dog that could harm the dog. Physical force and cruelty can be illegal, and they also won’t work well with a dog. Dogs respond to love and to reward, not screaming and bullying.;
, It’s critical that your dog knows what to expect. You can’t expect a dog to see you as being in control if you constantly vary your expectations. Constantly varying rules seems weak to a dog.


Make sure you’re not the only person in the house following the rules and reward regimen, or the dog will get confused. Don’t give the dog mixed signals.
You have to be patient and understand it could take some time to train your dog properly. It’s easiest to do when the dog is young, but, either way, it will take some time. Use repetitive commands (like telling the dog to “sit,” and use them several times a day.)
The dog needs to know there is no “free lunch."" The dog should not receive food, for example, before obeying a command. Give the dog clear and consistent structure. , Even when praising your dog, let your dog sense your dominance. You can do this by placing your hands firmly on the dog and hugging the dog. Do not praise him in a timid way. Show your strength, kindly.The dog should learn to obey you on the first command. If you end up repeating yourself endlessly, the dog will not perceive this as firmness or strength, and you will lose control of the dog.
Always follow through on commands that you give a dog. If you waver or make exceptions, the dog is going to learn that you aren’t that firm after all. Losing patience and control with the dog actually signals weakness.

, Some human behaviors can encourage a dog to think that he’s the alpha in the house.


Make the dog wait for food after the humans have eaten, and do not feed the dog off the table.Control all aspects of the dog’s feeding habits. The dog eats when you say he eats. The dog eats when you release him to eat even a bite. The dog must work to earn his food.Control the dog’s toys too. The dog only gets a toy or two out a day, and you choose them. The dog should watch you control the items, putting them away and bringing them out. If the dog tries to guard the toy, the dog loses the toy for a day.

, If you are truly the alpha in the situation, you don’t walk around a dog whose big body is snoozing in the hall.


The dog must treat you like a parent, not a sibling. Remain in control, and calm, but stay dominant. Walk through the dog by gently shuffling your feet until he gets up and moves out of the way.
Sometimes silence can be most dominating to a dog. Use the verbal commands when you really need them. Be calm at all times.Calmly and silently, stay in command. Make sure that you control access to doorways. You are in charge of the house. The dog is not.
Don't let the dog wildly jump on you when you get home. Greet the dog last, and ignore the dog if the dog jumps up and down.

, This is a way that dogs achieve a sense of power. They should not be on the sofa top, looking down at you, for example. This means it’s not a great idea to allow a dog to sleep in your bed. That’s because the dog associates the most comfortable sleeping place with hierarchy. If you must have a dog in bed, make the dog sleep at the foot of your bed rather than, say, on your pillow. Better yet: Give the dog a bed on the floor instead.Don’t wrestle with the dog on the floor in a playful manner because the dog will believe the human is equal or lesser if the human is down at its level., Dogs don’t necessarily know what human words mean, but they do understand the sounds and tone.


If you are happy with the dog, let the dog know so by varying the tone of your voice and making your pitch higher. However, when you want to command the dog to do something or indicate your disapproval when the dog doesn’t obey, lower the pitch of your voice.
Use hand gestures in addition to verbal commands to make your point.

, Dogs use eye contact to determine who has control. If you avert your gaze first, you lose.


Averting your guess will reinforce the dog’s dominance. Do not have staring contests with the dog, though. Just firmly look in the dog’s eyes when you give the dog a command.You never want to be in a situation where the dog occupies a higher position than you and you're averting your eyes. That's a recipe for losing control - fast.

, One way to control a dog is to take the dog for long walks on a leash. Make sure that you establish control this way when you do, or it defeats the purpose.


Keep the dog on a short leash, and stay ahead of the dog or at its side. You’re the person who leads, not the dog. Don’t let the dog run wildly off leash when it’s not trained, either. The dog has to learn that the human is in charge. Stop the dog several times during walks with commands.
Try playing “red light, green light” with the dog. Walk the dog on a leash. When the dog runs or walks ahead to the point of pulling at the end of the leash, say red light, and stop completely. Wait. When the dog stops pulling, call him back to you. When he comes back, say, “sit” and give him a treat when he does. Resume walking.Use treats to reward your dog for walking beside you and try walking fast. Every few seconds that the dog remains at your side walking, pop a treat in the dog’s mouth. The dog gets no treats if the dog moves too far ahead, to the side, or behind. The dog won’t have as many opportunities to pull away..

, Choose a crate the dog can stand up and move around in a bit. You can use the crate to reinforce training methods that will show the dog you are in control.Put a new toy or treat in the crate, and leave the door open. Wait until the dog goes in the crate to get it. Pet and reward the dog when the dog comes out. Repeat the process. Shut the door to the crate, and don’t open the door until he has been quiet for a few minutes.Make a schedule and stick to it. When you open the crate, take the dog outside to go to the bathroom immediately. The dog will learn over time that going to the bathroom is something that can only be done in a certain spot.

, You can use a small dog clicker to control your dog. You can purchase these at many pet stores. The clicker is a small plastic box you hold in your hand. You press it, making a clicking sound, when you want your dog to do something.When the dog follows the command, reward the dog with a treat. Eventually, the dog will consider the clicker as almost a language. The dog will learn that following your commands – the click – will result in a positive reward.

, If your dog has become very aggressive and is exhibiting danger signs - like growling or guarding resources - it's critical that you act fast.


Contact your local veterinarian, and ask for references to credible dog trainers or dog training classes. Know when you need help.
If the dog is a danger to children or others, you need to contact the Humane Society right away. It's wrong to put others in danger because you can't control your dog.

Ask people for a referral.,
Use a certified dog trainer directory.,
Visit the trainer’s website.,
Research the trainer.,
Check the dog trainer’s certifications.",How to Find and Choose a Dog Trainer2," If you want more information about the trainer and their training methods, ask for references from previous clients. Most successful trainers will not have a problem providing you with references from satisfied clients., Many dog organizations provide directories of certified dog trainers. You can use these directories to start your search for a good dog trainer. You can search by state or country and zip code to find a trainer in your area.For example, you can try searching through the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or The Association of Professional Dog Trainers.

, Before you take your dog to the trainer, you should check out their website, Facebook, pamphlet, or other information. Does the website or pamphlet look professional? Browse through and see what the trainer offers on the website.


Look for a section where the trainer outlines their beliefs on training and dogs. Do their ideas match yours?
Read all the available information on the website. Ask yourself if what you see presented there makes you feel comfortable with the idea of letting your dog train with them. Does the information make you want to contact the trainer?

, While you are looking on their website, Facebook, at the pamphlet, or at any other material, see what details they give you about their experience. Where have they worked and trained? How long have they been doing this? Who have they worked with in the past? Do they specialize in breed or certain behaviors? These details are important when choosing a trainer.


After looking at their website, search for the trainer’s name or the business name online. Look for reviews, message boards, forums, or any other postings that mention the trainer or the business. Do people say positive or negative things about them?

, There are no licensing requirements for dog trainers. This means you may end up with a trainer who has no certifications, training, or education related to dog training. However, many dog trainers will have independent certifications. These are the trainers you want to look for.The Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers have a certification program that requires a certain level of experience and an exam to be certified. For example, they have to have at least 300 hours of recent training experience and must pass a long exam covering a variety of topics.The International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants is another organization that certifies trainers. To receive this certification, you may have three years experience with 1500 hours of working in animal behavior consulting.

Choose a trainer who interacts with people.,
Observe a class.,
Avoid punishment-based training models.",How to Find and Choose a Dog Trainer3," If you have researched the trainer, you should schedule a meeting. This can either be via a phone call or in person. Have a list of questions ready to ask the trainer when you talk to them to evaluate their skills and abilities. For example, you may ask:How long have you been training dogs? Where did you receive your training?
What methods do you use? How do you correct negative behavior? What rewards do you use?
What training/behavior seminars have you attended recently?
May I observe a lesson/group classes before signing up?
What type of training program would you propose to help me with my dog's behavior?
Do you have insurance?

, One of the best ways to find a good dog trainer in your area is to ask people to refer you to someone. Start by asking friends, family members, and colleagues. Your vet can be a valuable resource and provide you with names of great trainers. You may also want to ask around at the dog park.Even when you get an enthusiastic reference to a trainer, make sure to check out the trainer and talk to them first. Just because the trainer worked for someone else’s dog doesn’t mean it will necessarily work for yours.

, Good trainers work to help you improve your relationship with your dog by helping you establish trust. A good trainer will encourage understanding and respect between you and the dog, not fear.The training methods should be humane and dog-friendly.
A good trainer will use positive reinforcement through food, treats, attention, toys, play, or praise. Negative behaviors will be dealt with through ignoring the dog and withholding rewards.

, The trainer you choose should have good people skills. You are the one who is going to be training the dog, so you need a good relationship with the trainer. The trainer should be involved with each dog and owner during a training session or class, listen to what you have to say, and be interested in your dog.Good trainers will want your dog’s full history. They want to know about their background and behaviors so they can help you correct behavior and establish a stronger relationship.
Your trainer should also want to teach the entire family. They know you are not the only person in your dog’s life and will want to include everyone so your dog can be successful.

, Before you sign up with a trainer, ask if you can observe a class. Respectable trainers will have no problem with you going to a class and watching what they do. This can give you a more accurate sense of how the trainer conducts themselves.Watch the dogs and the humans. Are they having fun? Are the dogs under control or is it chaos?
Watch the way the instructor handles overly excited dogs, shy dogs, or slightly aggressive dogs.
Notice how instructors help dogs and owners who are struggling. Ask how the instructor helps them to ensure success.
Pay attention to the way the trainer interacts with the students. Do they help each one and give each dog and owner attention?

, While training helps you establish you as your dog’s leader, you want to look for training method red flags. Any trainer who uses punishment-based models or models based on dominance and submission are not trainers you want to take your dog to.You do not want a trainer who uses shock collars, choke collars, or physical punishment if a dog does something wrong.
Watch for language that reinforces these ideas, like “negative reinforcement,” “dominant,” or “alpha.”

Let the dog explore.,
Feed your dog in the crate.,
Attempt longer crating periods.",How to Crate Train a Small Dog2," Take the door off of the crate (or prop open the door, if this isn't possible) and allow the dog to explore it freely. If your dog does not approach the crate on its own, try encouraging it in a soothing voice. Drop treats near the entrance to the crate, or toss treats and toys inside to encourage your dog to go in. Be patient and allow your pet to explore at its own pace., If your dog is comfortable enough to enter the crate, begin feeding it regular meals in there to increase positive associations. Place your dog's food dish towards the back of the crate; if your dog has not fully explored the crate yet, place its dish near the front instead. Do this a few times, then close the door while your small dog eats; open the door as soon as it finishes its meal.If the dog cries or whines, shorten this time period and open the door sooner; if your dog seems comfortable, prolong the time to ten minutes after it finishes eating.

, If your dog gets comfortable with the process of eating in its crate, start practicing longer crating periods. Draw it towards the crate with a treat and soothing words; encourage it to enter, then close the door behind it and feed it the treat, offering lots of praise. Sit by the crate for 5-10 minutes, then leave the room and wait another few minutes before returning to let your dog out. Repeat this process several times a day, increasing crating time gradually."
"
Leave the house.,
Crate your dog at night.,
Prepare for company.,
Travel with the crate.",How to Crate Train a Small Dog3," If your small dog can stay in its crate for 30 minutes without getting anxious or scared, try leaving it crated while you leave the house for a short period of time. Crate the dog between 5-20 minutes before you step out, and try to be discreet about getting ready to go. Keep your departure and arrival home easy going to avoid making your dog hyper. Continue the process of crating your dog while you are home as well to prevent associations of loneliness or abandonment with the crate., Start nighttime crating with the crate in your bedroom; this way, you can let your small dog out if it whines to go to the bathroom. Lead the dog into the crate with praise and a treat, as already established, and close the door. Once your dog is comfortable spending the night in its crate, you can move it to a better location, or choose to keep your pet near you.It may be difficult to distinguish whether your dog is whining because it needs to relieve itself, or because it wants to be let out. In the case of the latter, avoid reacting negatively or positively; letting your dog out (for any reason other than to eliminate) will encourage it to whine in the future.

, If you are expecting guests who are uncomfortable around your dog, put your dog in its crate before they arrive. If this is not the case, simply have the crate ready in the event that your dog gets overexcited – if this happens, calmly bring it to its crate, and place treats and toys inside to make things more comfortable. Note that this should not be a punishment – dogs pick up on the behavior of people around them, so even well-behaved dogs can become rambunctious around a lively group of guests. Bringing your dog to its den is simply allowing it the opportunity to calm down and prevent problem behaviours., Crate training is important in preparing your dog to be transported, which will occur at various junctures in its life (e.g. trips to the veterinarian’s office). Make a point of taking practice trips with your dog in its crate; this will ensure that your dog doesn’t associate being transported with events that may cause it stress, exclusively. Dogs who have never been crated are more likely to be anxious during such trips and uncomfortable being confined."
"
Take your dog outside as soon as you let it out of the crate.,
Keep the crate.,
Seek help if needed.",How to Crate Train a Small Dog4," To discourage your dog from relieving itself in its crate, try to take it out to eliminate as soon as possible after long crating periods. This will build your small dog's confidence that its needs will be met if it cooperates. This should not be difficult, as dogs have as a natural instinct a reluctance to soil their sleeping area., If your dog has developed an affinity for its crate during training, consider keeping it as a fixture in the house. Remove the door and place it in a more discrete area, if preferable. Given the size of your small dog's plastic crate, it can be moved easily from one room to the next, and used as a carrier for car rides., If you have exhausted all efforts in trying to crate train your dog, reach out to a professional for help. Search online for listings of dog trainers in your area; visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT) website to search for trainers by zip code.Be sure to ask potential trainers about their credentials, methods, and services before you hire them, and don’t hesitate to ask for references. Some key questions to pose to them are:”What are your credentials?”
”What services do you offer?”
”Do you assist owners with crate training?”
”Do you have a list of clients I can contact for references?”

Start training as early as possible.,
Emphasize obedience training.,
Focus on the basics.,
Play nice for the first year.,
Play with your dog before training sessions.,
Keep training sessions short and focused.",How to Choose a Training Program for Your Dog2," By the time your puppy is three months old, they’ve essentially reached the equivalent of their teenage years. In other words, they grow up fast. As they develop the ability to interact with the world around them, they will also become increasingly interested in doing so.Some breeds are easier to train than others. Dogs that were bred to hunt or herd, like Border Collies, will learn faster than dogs that were bred to guard livestock, like bulldogs. However, when it comes to basic training, the harder-to-train breeds should only take a month longer with good training practices.It’s especially important to start potty training early. Keep in mind that small breeds may take longer to potty train than large breeds due to their smaller bladders., Setting limits and introducing your puppy to basic commands is the best way to prepare your dog to begin a more comprehensive training program. Teaching a puppy to sit and stay, however, may be harder than you anticipate.To teach your dog to sit, say “sit” while you guide them into a sitting position by placing one hand on their chest and another behind their back legs. Once they are sitting, reward them with a treat. This is an example of positive reinforcement, which can be applied to many different obedience commands.Stay patient and consistent. The importance of teaching these commands is coupled with the importance of teaching your puppy to listen. Once these commands are consistently followed, your dog is not only able to begin further training, but the process will become much easier.

, Aside from a command to sit and stay, there are other important basic components that every training program should include. For instance, a command to “lie down” can be useful during meals or while traveling in a vehicle. “Stand” can be useful during grooming and vet visits, and “come” is vital before you ever allow your dog off leash.Leash training is also important, but will likely require that your dog is used to being trained. As such, you likely want to teach a few more basic commands before beginning leash training, especially if you’re training a puppy.

, Especially if you have a male puppy, it is important to play gently between four and ten months of age. High amounts of testosterone will lead to boundary-pushing other types of aggressive behavior. As such, positive reinforcement and non-aggressive play are especially important during this period.As you play, your puppy is learning. Avoid games that may encourage them to be aggressive at a young age.
For instance, hold off on wrestling and tug-of-war until they’re a bit older. These may convey that pulling and jumping are generally accepted behaviors, which can lead to training challenges later on.

, Puppies have notoriously high energy levels, and this can prevent them from focusing during training sessions. To burn off some of that energy, take your puppy out to play before you begin each training session. Try playing fetch, tug-of-war, or taking your puppy for a walk.Experiment with a new game each week to see which games your dog enjoys the most.
Don’t forget to give your puppy a bathroom break before you begin your training session.

, The younger your dog is, the shorter their attention span will be. Instead of giving your dog one long training session, give them multiple shorter sessions throughout the day. Training sessions should last between one and ten minutes.Try to end the session before your dog loses focus.

This means that you want to breed your pug in order to produce more happy, healthy pug specimens.
You should not breed pugs if you just want to make money or profit in any other way.;
, Breeding pugs is not a solitary practice. Once your pug produces puppies, the puppies will need some place to go. To ensure that your breeding can go off without a hitch, try to line up homes for the pug puppies ahead of time. You will need to screen possible owners to ensure that they will create a good home for the pug.


If you have the room, money, and space, you can plan to keep the puppies as long as you want or until you find them a home after they are born. Keep in mind that this cost includes vaccinations, dewormings, parasite controls, and spaying/neutering.
You can never be sure of how many puppies your pug will have, but make sure you have a decent number of homes, between five to seven, already lined up.
This preparation will ensure the puppies don’t end up a burden to you and keeps them out of shelters., Before you start breeding your pug, you need to make sure you understand what goes into pug pregnancy. You will need to know how to cope with a pregnant pug. This includes how long they stay pregnant, what kind of care she will need when pregnant, and any emergencies that may arise.


You also need to know how to handle the birth process as well.
You should also make sure you have a veterinarian you trust and that you can call in case there is an emergency., Your pug needs to have a pleasant and enjoyable temperament. The pug you plan to breed with yours should also be well behaved and even tempered. This will ensure their puppies will be good, strong pets.


If your dog has any emotional or temperament issues, you should rethink breeding him or her. You only want to breed the best pugs you can., Before you breed your pug, you need to have him tested to determine his genetic background. This will test your dog’s bloodline to ensure there are only good qualities in his or her bloodline. If your pug is a registered as a purebred, you can obtain your dog’s bloodline from the American Kennel Club or other registering authority.


You need to be sure your pug and the pug you are planning to breed with are not directly related in order to prevent any possible genetic defects caused by inbreeding., Your pug should be in fine physical shape in order to be bred. This means your pug should be free from any genetic health problems that could be passed down from him or her to the puppies. Take your pug to the veterinarian to get checked out. Common pug diseases that would deter you from breeding your pug include:


Luxating patellas, also known as 'wobbly kneecaps', which is the excess movement of the kneecap sideways that can cause the hind leg to lock in an extended position.
Hip dysplasia, which is when the hips are poorly formed so they do not move smoothly in the hip joint, causing the the dog to have a weak back end and lead to early arthritis
Entropion, which is an inwards turning of the eyelids where the hairs rub on the surface of the eye and cause constant irritation
Hemivertebra, which is a malformation of the spine bones that causes a physical deformity of the spine
Cleft palate, which is a separation of the palate of the mouth area, often corrected by surgery at a young age, Before your pug is mated or bred, you need to ensure he or she is up to date on all necessary vaccinations. This is especially important for your female pug because most vaccines cannot be given during pregnancy.


Your pug must have the immunity provided by vaccination so she can pass some of these antibodies on to her puppies via her milk, which will give the puppies a low level of protection at a time when their immune systems are weak and developing.
She should also be up to date with all her parasite treatments as well, including everything from heartworm to roundworms.
All these things are also important for female pugs because pregnancy suppresses the immune system. This means that any parasite could take advantage of her weakened immunity and breed, which could impact her health and as well as the unborn puppies.

, Your pug should be at a healthy weight in order to be healthy enough to breed. To check your pug’s weight, run your fingers along his or her rib cage. With a gently pressure, you should be able to easily feel the ribs with no rolls of fat in the way.


Your pug should also have a defined waistline if you look from the side and above. However, there should be enough fat cover that the bones of the hips and pelvis do not stick through., When deciding to breed your female pug, you should make sure she is at least 18 months old. This means she should have gone through at least three heat cycles, which will allow her the right amount of time to fully grow and mature. This will make sure that she can handle the rigors of pregnancy and giving birth. The male pug should be around 12 to 15 months, since this is how long it would take him to reach full sexual maturity.Female pugs should not be bred if they are older than six years old. By this age, she is approaching the dog equivalent of retirement age, which means that the strain of pregnancy could cause organ damage.
Also, as a general rule, once your pug is bred, she should not have another litters within the following season, so make sure to give her a break in between. Female pugs should also not have more than four litters during her life., If you don’t have both a female and male pug, you can find your pug a stud, or breed-ready male dog, through different sources. You can buying the services of a male pug, find another local breeder, or find an owner willing to help you out. Make sure you ask to see the male pug’s pedigree and see if he is registered with the Kennel Club, which will allow the puppies to be registered as purebred.


The Kennel Club does not keep a register of stud dogs, so any information you retain about the male pug has to be done on your own.
Make sure you meet the male pug before you agree to breeding to ensure that he has a good temperament and physical appearance. , The only time a pug can get pregnant is during her heat. Your female pug will come into heat about twice a year, or roughly once every six months. Her heat period will last about three to four weeks. She will undergo physical changes and her behavior may change some during heat. Male dogs will also be more drawn to her during this time.


The best way to know for sure if your pug is in heat is to look at her genital area. During her heat, she will have a swollen vulva and release a bloody discharge., Your female pug cannot get pregnant during the whole heat cycle. She can only get pregnant when she is ovulating. This time tends to be approximately day 11 through 14 of her heat cycle.


This is the time when she wants to have the male’s company as well.
The range of ovulation can vary depending on the dog., If you don’t want to wait around to check for her heat or guess when she is ovulating, you can have your vet test your pug’s heat cycle so you know exactly when it starts. This will give you the best chance for her to fall pregnant because you will know exactly when she needs to breed.


The vet may swab her vulva and analyze the cells under a microscope slide to tell exactly what stage of heat she is in and if it's a good time to mate her.
You can also get an ovulation blood test, which analyzes the levels of hormones in her bloodstream and detect when she is ovulating based on the rise in hormones., During the entire heat cycle, your female pug will be attractive to all male dogs. When she is outside, make sure you keep a close eye on her to ensure that another male dog does not come and mate with her without you knowing about it.


This is especially important if you let your dog free in a fenced in yard. Male dogs are known to jump fences to get to females in heat.

, Once you determine when your female pug is ovulating, have the male pug brought it. When you introduce them, make sure you keep them on a lead. This will keep them safe in case they don’t like each other, making sure you can separate them quickly. Once they meet, they should take to one another.


The female will not allow the male pug near her until she is ready to breed, but if you have timed it right, this will not be a problem.
Never forcibly restrain the female pug to get her to submit to the male pug. If the timing is right, she will be a willing participant., You will be able to tell if the breeding was successful around 28 days after the pugs mated. You can do this through a blood test that will show the change in her hormones.


Your vet can also perform an ultrasound scan a week earlier to check to see if she is pregnant.
You will also notice a physical change to your pug if she is pregnant, with a slightly protruding belly and nipples on her stomach seeming larger than normal around week two or three after mating.
By four weeks after mating, her belly will be obvious., Your pug should be kept healthy during her pregnancy. She needs to eat right and more often, where she may eat about twice what she did before. Do not limit her food during this time. She will only eat the amount of food necessary to keep her and her puppies healthy.


Also make sure she has plenty of time to rest, since she will be more tired than normal. However, you should still walk her every day, though at a slower pace than before. This should only change if your vet put on exercise restrictions.
Pugs are pregnant for an average of 63 days, but anywhere from 60 to 65 days is normal.
Make sure you have a whelping/birthing box for your pug, which should be big enough for her and any of the puppies and contain a blanket that smells like her., When the puppies are born, you need to watch them carefully during their first few weeks. They need be be clean, warm, continually fed, and gain weight at a healthy rate. This means they should gain about 10% of their weight a day for the first two weeks.


Around four weeks, give them a larger area to go around it because they will be more active.Take them to the vet to get their checkups at seven to eight weeks.
Once the dogs are twelve weeks old, you can send them to their new homes."

There are too many backyard breeders trying to jump in and breed dogs with almost no experience or understanding of this unique breed. They see the prices they sell for and try to get in and fill their pockets with money. The sad part about this is the end result is not good for the bulldog.;
, Many bulldogs suffer from breathing difficulties because of a combination of flat faces, large tongues, and small windpipes. If either of the mating pair of bulldogs has had to have surgery in order to open up their nostrils, trim back parts of their soft palates, or remove their tonsils, do not breed them. The genetics for a crowded throat will be passed onto the pups and will perpetuate these distressing problems.


Even if your bulldogs haven’t required surgery, you should still avoid breeding them if they struggle to breathe.
Especially do not breed the female during summer months if she has breathing troubles. The hot weather will compound the issue during pregnancy and cause the bitch undue distress.

, Evidence suggests that the character of the mother is passed onto her puppies. If she is excessively nervous or she is aggressive, her puppies are likely to have similar non ideal behavior patterns. The best bitch to breed from is a calm, friendly, and gentle dog.A calmer female will also make a better mother who is less likely to be snappy or insecure when it comes to her puppies., It is vital to ensure that she has healthy skin and is free from skin parasites. A form of mange caused by the demodex mite can be made much worse by the stress of pregnancy, and she could lose her fur and develop a rhino-like skin. In addition, the demodex mite can be transferred to the pups at whelping, which means they are born with the mite and will go on to have poor coats and skin. Not only is this undesirable but it can make the pups harder to sell, so you are more likely to be left with them on your hands., One full month before you want to breed your English bulldogs, you should have your veterinarian perform a full physical examination of the female. Ensure that she is up to date on all vaccinations, that she’s free of any worms, and that she does not test positive for brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can cause spontaneous abortion.You should also have the veterinarian perform a genetic screening. Even healthy bulldogs can still pass on undesirable genetic traits. Responsible breeding should always seek to weed out traits that can lead to health complications associated with the breed.The stud (male bulldog) you choose should also be tested for brucellosis., Your bulldog will have her first heat sometime after six months of age, but you should never breed a bitch before her second heat, which she will have every six months after her first one., Heat cycles can vary in duration and length between cycles. In general, you can expect your bitch to go into heat around once every six months and for the season to last roughly three weeks. However, you still need to know the ideal time to mate the dogs while she is in heat.

, The initial portion of the bitch’s heat cycle is called proestrus. During this period, her vulva will appear swollen, and you will notice bloody vaginal discharge. However, she will not allow the stud to mate with her during this period so don’t try.Treat this simply as a signal to be ready to breed in the coming weeks.


On average, this part of the heat cycle will last around nine days., If you would prefer to identify when the female ovulates more specifically, you can see your vet for a couple of different test options. These options include:Slide cytology - This is a painless procedure where the vet harvests a sample of cells form the bitch's vulva, smears them onto a microscope slide, and examines them under the microscope. The sample is obtained simply by rolling a cotton bud over the mucous membrane of the vulva. A certain cell type will be more prevalent just prior to ovulation.
Blood testing - The most common test looks at blood levels of the hormone progestogen. Testing starts about five days into the heat and once the blood levels reach 2.5 ng/ml, the bitch should be mated three days later (by which time the levels should be around 5 ng /ml when ovulation occurs). If necessary, repeat tests are run every two to three days to pick up this rise in hormone levels., The next part of the female’s heat cycle is called estrus. This is the ideal time to mate the dogs. The female dog will now return the attention of the stud and will often stand to be mated. If you rub the base of her tail she may hold the tail to one side and present her backside to you as if ready to be mated.Ovulation usually occurs within forty-eight hours of the bitch starting estrus. This ideal mating time can last anywhere from five to nine days., Due to their short legs and stout bodies, many English bulldogs have trouble mating naturally. If you’ve noticed that the stud has clear problems mounting the female, then ask your veterinarian about artificial insemination. The technique for artificial insemination requires the depositing of semen (taken directly from the dog) into the bitch's vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus by syringe.The correct temperature of the semen is vital, and there is no guarantee. Methods include fresh semen, cooled extended and frozen semen.

, The average length of pregnancy is 65-67 days but can vary by as much as a week either way.You have different options for properly diagnosing the pregnancy starting several weeks after the hopeful conception. These options include:Ultrasound - Ultrasound exams can detect pregnancy from around day twenty-three. This involves clipping a little fur from the bitch's belly and lubricating the area with water soluble gel. The vet places the probe against the belly and can often pick up the jellybean-like fluid swelling in the uterus that is the early pregnancy.
Palpation - It is usually possible for a veterinarian to feel distinct lumps in the uterus representing individual embryos between days 28-35 of the pregnancy. Before and after that, it can be hard to identify a pregnant uterus easily.
Blood testing - The levels of progesterone in a pregnant bitch will continue to rise instead of subsiding. Starting after twenty-eight days, a veterinarian can predict the difference Progesterone levels can be used to confirm pregnancy at or after day 28 after mating. If between pregnancy and residual levels of progesterone from the heat cycle.
Radiography - If other options have proven inconclusive for any reason, then your vet can use an x-ray machine to verify pregnancy starting around day forty-five of the pregnancy.

, For most of the pregnancy, the female should maintain the same well-balanced, high-quality diet as prior to the pregnancy. Once she begins putting on weight (around the final five weeks of the pregnancy), then adjust her diet according to the weight gain. This can mean up to 35-50 percent more daily food in the final days before whelping.Introduce the increased food in the form of more frequent, smaller meals rather than simply adding more food at standard mealtimes., Problems with whelping are so common with English bulldogs that it's usually appropriate to plan an elective C-section. In fact, your veterinarian should provide a full examination of your bitch to clear her for free-whelping (natural birth) before you even consider foregoing a C-section. Consult with your vet about the ideal date to perform the C-section based on when you mated the bulldogs and schedule the procedure well in advance.


Also, check in advance that your vet will perform an elective C-section.

, You should start getting your bulldog accustomed to a whelping box several weeks before the expected due date of the litter. Provide a roomy box with low sides. Line it with plenty of newspaper and provide a small shelf that the puppies can roll under to avoid getting rolled on by the mother.Place the box in an environment that is warm, dry, quiet, still, and away from other dogs.
It is entirely normal for the female to begin nesting in the lined newspaper as she becomes accustomed to the whelping box. Even if you have planned a C-section with your vet, it is beneficial to allow the female to nest in a whelping box.

, You should keep several other items on hand to prepare for when your bulldog goes into labor. Have a heat lamp or heating pad with a low setting, feeding bottles and puppy-suitable artificial milk (in case the mother rejects the puppies), and lots of clean towels and bedding. You should also keep clean scissors if you need to cut the umbilical cords, unwaxed dental floss to tie off the puppies’ umbilical cords, and iodine to clean each puppy’s abdomen after the cord is cut., If your vet refers emergencies to an emergency clinic, make sure you know where it is and how to call if you need help. If your veterinary hospital staff covers its own emergencies it is still important to know the procedure for contacting someone before the need arises. Providing a safe environment for the puppies is important.

, First stage labor lasts an average of twenty-four hours and involves the bitch being restless, unable to settle, and going off her food. She may lie down and look at her flanks and then get up again., Second-stage labor is the pushing phase of labor when the pups should be born. Her water will break, and she will lie down and strain hard, pushing with her flanks, in order to try and expel the puppy. If she labors hard for two hours and no puppy appears, call the veterinarian.The mother may rest after the delivery of each puppy. 20-30 minutes is acceptable. If you know she has lots of puppies and she rests for longer than half an hour, call the vet.
Bulldogs have large heads, and it is common for a puppy's head not to fit through the birth canal and get stuck. The only way to free the puppy is a C-section, which needs actioning urgently. If the bitch takes longer than an hour between pups call the vet.
Keep count of both the number of puppies as well as placentas to ensure that the mother delivers everything she needs to during the pregnancy. There should be a placenta for each and every puppy.
Keep your vet’s phone number as well as that of your local emergency pet clinic close by during the entire process., Each puppy will come out in a placental membrane that the mother should tear open before she severs the umbilical cord. After this, she should begin licking the puppy to stimulate its breathing.If she neglects to perform these actions, then you’ll need to do it to save the puppy.


The membrane has enough oxygen for a few minutes, so you don’t have to act immediately, but pay close attention. If you must do it, tear the sac close to the puppy’s head and peel it until you can easily remove the puppy.Fish any mucus or other fluids from the puppy’s mouth and nose, and then rub the puppy with a warm clean towel to stimulate breathing and circulation., Use the unwaxed dental floss to tie off the umbilical cord roughly two inches from the puppy’s abdomen, and iodine along the cut to help avoid the puppy developing any infections., Puppies should nurse from the mother very shortly after birth. Suckling at this point provides the puppies colostrum, which is like milk, but it also contains antibodies from the mother to help the puppies prevent any infections as their own immune systems develop., Newborn pups cannot yet control their body temperatures, so you must provide a warm environment. Keep the space 85-90°F for the first five days.After the first five days, you can slowly reduce the space to 80°F at day ten and then down to 75°F by the end of the puppies’ fourth week., Canine mastitis is always a possibility for nursing mothers in the first several weeks after whelping. The breasts should be warm and enlarged, but with canine mastitis, you may notice that they are red, dark, hot, or produce a painful reaction in the mother.Consult a vet immediately if this is the case.

, She may not eat much for several days after whelping. Once she starts eating again, ensure that you’re providing a diet high in calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D. This will prevent the possibility of eclampsia.If you’re giving her a high-quality diet, then the necessary amounts should already be present in her current food.
Symptoms of eclampsia include nervousness, an unsteady gait, muscle spasms, and whimpering. A vet can easily intervene with the condition as long as you properly notice it and seek care for the mother., If the mother rejects any of the puppies, then you will have to hand feed them. Consult your vet for a commercial puppy formula and follow the instructions closely for the recommended feeding amounts and times for the pup.Do not simply try to use cow’s milk because this makes a very poor substitute, and the puppy will not receive the necessary nutrition from it."

Stop when your dog gets confused.",How to Avoid Confusing a Dog During Training," You’ll only confuse yourself and your dog if you begin training with unrealistic expectations about what and how much you can do in a single training session. Set a goal for successfully practicing one command per session, and remember that this new command will require consistent repetition in different places and situations in order to truly master the behavior.


Make sure you’re not trying to teach your dog tricks or behaviors for which they don’t have the proper foundation, and also that you’re not trying to pack too many lessons and commands into one training session.
Obedience classes are perhaps the most efficient method of training your dog, but even these should be approached with moderate expectations. Just because you’re paying for expertise, you shouldn’t expect your dog to come out of an eight-week course looking and acting like a K-9 unit pro.;
, Keeping an irregular or insufficiently frequent training schedule is sure to cause confusion for your learning pup. You’ll make much better progress if you practice every day or every other day, rather than sporadically doing so whenever you get a chance.It can help to use a training calendar or checklist to keep track of your dog’s curriculum. Compare notes with your personal or professional planner to make sure you can allot a portion of most days to concerted training and practice.
Once you’ve gotten the hang of the basics, you should work these commands into daily life and routine. Have your dog sit and stay before each meal time, or have it heel when walking out to get the paper in the morning.

, Your dog will become confused and frustrated if you continue a session for too long, but you’ll have similar problems if you end your session before making any progress. Avoid these common timing problems by setting time-independent goals: conclude a session not after a certain amount of time, but after a certain level of success is reached.For example, if you're working on the 'Stay' command, stop the session after your dog successfully stays for five seconds two or three times in a row. This will get your dog used to being rewarded for success and keep it interested in training.

, If you always practice commands and training in one place, your dog can easily begin to associate this location exclusively with the new behaviors you’re teaching it. It will become confused when you expect the same performance in an entirely new setting, so make sure you mix up your training locations and show your dog that you expect obedience everywhere.For example, train one day in the living room, but move out to the backyard the next day. Eventually you should practice in other, public areas like the dog park.

, If you’ve only ever asked your dog to obey commands in the quiet privacy of your living room, you can’t expect it to perform the same way under different conditions. Other dogs, cars, honking horns, and loud strangers’ voices are just some of the many factors which will confuse and throw off your dog’s behavior if you keep them isolated.


Starting off, you should only train in highly controlled areas where you can keep distractions to a minimum. As your dog progresses, start adding distractions gradually so that it gets used to performing in less controlled environments.Remember never to train your dog before mealtime. Being hungry is a serious distraction which will shorten your dog’s attention span and make it frustrated., Rather than telling your dog ‘no’ when it does something bad, reward it when it does the right things. Just reproaching your dog for bad behavior can be confusing because, while you’ve indicated what you don’t like, you haven’t shown the dog what you do want it to do.Reversing this habit and giving positive feedback gives your dog concrete, specific guidance about how you want it to behave, so try making this the fundamental principle of your training.


For example, have your dog sit before you open the door or before feeding, and then give it a treat. This reward helps encourage the positive behaviors of not darting out the door when it’s opened and having good mealtime manners.Make sure your treats are small, easily consumed, and healthy. It can be a good idea to use individual kernels of your dog’s normal dry food so that you don’t develop any bad snacking behaviors., If you wait more than a few seconds to reward a trick or obeyed command, your dog won’t know which behavior it's getting a treat for. You need to make sure, then, that you give the treat right away, while the dog is still doing the right behavior.For example if you are training a dog to lay down and stay, but you only reward it when it gets up, you are confusing the dog about what behavior—laying down or getting up—you actually want it to do.

, Be consistent about how you say a command—for example, don't say ""Lay"" sometimes and other times ""Lay down""—and also how often you deliver the command. Repeating a command too many times will confuse a dog as to when it it expected to act or follow the command you're repeating.Some experts recommend using what’s called a verbal marker—a verbal cue or other sound like a click or short word—along with treats as a method of positive reinforcement. This is because you can give this marker more quickly than you can deliver a treat, so the reward is more instantaneous and more closely linked to the right, praiseworthy behavior.If you find verbal clicking or speaking too taxing, you can buy a small clicker device which makes a clicking noise when you press on it. Your dog will learn to associate this distinct sound with positive reinforcement and praise, and you don't have to worry about confusing it with different words and tones of voice., Rewarding positive behavior can be an incremental process: for some more complicated commands, you’ll need to break the behavior up into smaller steps and give treats at each interval. For example, to teach a dog roll over, you should first have it lie down, then lie on its side, and only then to roll over.

, Your dog will become confused about its place in the family if you treat it like a person, and these blurred lines will make training difficult and frustrating for both of you. Keeping healthy boundaries that show your dog that it’s lower on the pecking order than you are will help avoid confusion and conflict.For example, avoid picking your dog up too frequently or constantly letting it up on the couch or bed beside you. If your dog sees the difference between canine and human status, it will be more likely to follow your instructions when training.

, Forcefully reprimanding your dog may produce results in the short term, but ultimately you’re just confusing it. Your harsh words and forceful actions scare your dog and corrode trust between the two of you, so make sure you never resort to this kind of punishment when training your pup.Even when you have to say 'no' or be firm about something, try to keep your tone of voice low and calm. Overly emotional or harsh tones will probably make your dog stop what it's doing, but it's actually responding to the tone of your voice and not understanding what bad behavior it shouldn't be doing., Even if you’re following all the rules and being a good, consistent trainer, your dog will occasionally get confused. When this happens, your dog will start barking or lunging excitedly while ignoring you and your commands. Responding to these signals poorly and continuing training as before will just make the problem worse, so stop in your tracks when your dog displays these signs. Drop a few treats on the ground, take a deep breath, and relax until the air is cleared and you can begin afresh.If this keeps happening, you’re probably attempting a command which is too sophisticated or advanced for your dog. Try breaking it into smaller steps or moving to a simpler command so that you don’t keep repeating the same mistakes.

The Humane Society can provide you with positive and ethical recommendations for effective online trainers and courses. The Humane Society also offers their own courses for professionals as well as dog owners.If you are unsure where to start, try contacting the Humane Society by phone or email. Ask questions like, “I’m trying to find an online training course for my dog, do you have any recommendations?” or “Which online training course would you recommend for novice trainers?”;
, Your vet will likely have recommendations about online trainers and courses. Consulting your vet will also help determine what training courses might be most effective in dealing with a particular behavior or treating a medical issue.


Ask your vet questions like, “What type of training would you recommend for my dog?” or “Are there any courses that I should avoid?”

, Asking other dog owners for training recommendations is an effective way of getting first hand accounts and responses to online training. Ask other dog owners for recommendations on trainers or which types of training to avoid online.


Reach out to other dog owners online if you don’t know any who have gone through an online training course. There are many blogs and websites devoted to reviewing online trainers and courses, like E-Training for Dogs.Ask questions like, “Which online dog training course did you enroll in?” “How effective was the training?” or “Where did you find your online training course?”

, There are many different types of training courses available, from learning training basics to dog park etiquette. Select a course based on what you would like your dog to learn or what behaviors you would like to change. The more basic the course the more general it will be. If you would like your dog to learn more complex skills, like tracking, you will likely need to start with an elementary course first to introduce your dog to the fundamentals of training. Be sure to consult with your trainer about course caps and registration as the caps and registration times vary from course to course.Online training courses also come in pre-recorded videos as well as live webinars. Be sure to check the course description or contact your trainer to decide which framework might be best for you and your dog.Contact your trainer to ask about course availability and skill level.
Look for course examples on your trainer’s website, or look at other online dog training websites to get an idea of what classes are offered online., Most online trainers and courses will have other’s references easily available on their website. If they do not, ask your trainer to provide you with a few references of past customers. Look for customer reviews about the effectiveness, difficulty, time commitment, and cost of the training. Try using dog training resources, like canine journal, to read reviews of online trainers and courses.Most dog trainers rely on references to establish a good reputation. If your trainer or training course does not have any references this might be a sign of a course or trainer to avoid.

, Positive reinforcement is a training method that involves withholding treats or rewards from your dog until they behave accordingly. Positive reinforcement is generally the most versatile method as it can also help dog’s learn less conventional behaviors, like operating a switch. A trainer who uses positive reinforcement will also be less likely to use fear as a means of training your dog.Avoid trainers who use physical punishment or fear as apart of their training practices., Finding a trainer who listens well and delegates training will help you get the most out of your dog training. Online trainers should be able to provide you with feedback on your training techniques and the progress of your dog’s behavior. Seek out trainers who do not attempt to control the training process but rather empower you to fully train your dog.Remember, you are the one who will be doing the training. Your trainer is there to guide you and provide you with information.

, Live webinar training courses are courses that are regularly scheduled to be streamed live. Enroll in a live webinar course if you more hands-on training that allows for direct communication and response with both the trainer and other dog owners enrolled in the course.


Webinars will also require your schedule to be regular, meaning that you won’t be able to train at anytime you would like.

, Enrolling in training courses that rely on videos will allow you flexibility and the opportunity to choose the pace at which you train your dog. Videos can be re-watched over and over at anytime, which can provide you with the flexibility you need to fully engage in your dog’s training.


Remember that courses that rely on videos will often mean that you will be corresponding with your trainer, which means their responses or directions may not be as immediate as a webinar.

, No good trainer will promise or guarantee you a specific outcome after training. Training your dog is a process and much of it depends on your consistency as well as the dog’s age and behavioral history. If you are suspicious of your trainer’s claims look on their website for client references.


Some guarantees might include promising that your dog’s bad behavior will never resurface, like “I 100% guarantee that your dog will never leash-pull again.”

Take your time reviewing the specific breed characteristics of the dachshund.Ask the breeders you speak with to recommend one or more books that might be good for your research. Also check out the books available on the American Kennel Club’s website for some good options.Review the websites of other dachshund breeders and ask questions if you have any.
Review the websites of dog associations and kennel clubs.
Dachshunds are unfortunately known to have spine problems due to the length of their bodies. Jumping onto furniture or into the car can cause shock of the disks in their vertebrae. And when carrying a dachshund, it’s important to lift both their front and their back end so their spine isn’t stressed., The Dachshund Club of America is the national club for the dachshund breed. Membership is available to people who are serious about the dachshund breed and are in good standing with the American Kennel Club (AKC).If you have never owned a dachshund before, or if you have not previously been a member of the AKC, you’ll need to do these things first.
The Club’s website has a lot of great resources to help you better understand everything you ever wanted to know about dachshunds.

, Attending dog shows is a great way to gain a better understanding of the breeding business. You can also watch competitions between dachshunds to get a better understanding of the standards and characteristics judges look for in the breed for competition purposes.Dog shows are a great place to network. You’ll not only meet other breeders, but trainers and owners and other folks in the business who may be able to provide you with good advice.
Dogs shows are also a great place to hear the gossip. You’ll learn who is big in the business and who isn’t; what things are appreciated by the industry, and what things are avoided.

, Breeding dogs isn’t only about multiplying the number of dogs in existence, and then getting those dogs sold to the highest bidder. Breeding dogs is about earning a good reputation for producing healthy and problem-free dogs. In order to ensure you’re in it for the right reasons, document your own personal breeding goals and what standards you’ll aim for and/or improve upon.These goals and standards should become your personal breeding philosophy. This philosophy should be something you look back on every time you have to make a decision to ensure that decision will meet your overall goals and build your long-term reputation.

, Breeding dogs is an expensive endeavour. There is no guarantee that every litter will be healthy enough to sell for a profit. And there’s no way to predict when severe health problems may occur that will cost you thousands of dollars in veterinarian bills. Therefore, part of your research should be into the costs you will need to cover for a breeding operation.Ask other breeders about the costs they’ve invested in their business and any advice they have on where costs can be saved, if possible.
Make sure you determine your start-up costs as well as your ongoing costs. You may need to accumulate a significant amount of money to start your breeding operation, and you may find it could take years to make back those costs in profits (if ever).
Don’t start a breeding business until you’re sure you can cover all potential costs.
Understand that being a dachshund breeder is a full-time job and you need to take into account where your income will come from outside of your kennel business., When the time comes, learn everything you can about the bloodlines of the dachshunds you plan to purchase for breeding purposes. Speak to the kennels, breeders, and owners of the dachshund bloodlines you're considering. Ask to personally see other members of the bloodline and ask about their awards, etc.To be a successful breeder, you need to know everything about every dog in the bloodline for four generations.Note that pedigrees only confirm that the specific dog has been registered with the American Kennel Club. A pedigree doesn’t have anything to do with quality or standards.

, Most municipal zoning bylaws have limits as to how many dogs or cats are allowed on the premises at one time. If you are operating an official breeding kennel, you won’t be able to bend those rules. Make sure you conduct research within your municipal or city government to ensure you are allowed to have a breeding kennel on your property, and/or what other permits or licenses you require., Dachshund breeders will have special veterinarian requirements that other dog owners will not have. You may need to conduct research within your area in order to find a vet who is not only experienced with dog breeding operations, but possibly even experienced with the dachshund breed.You may want to meet with your vet before you start your kennel, as they may also be able to give you some good advice.

, The first and most important dachshund you’ll need to obtain is a female of absolute top quality. This female should be of a quality that could be put in a show, or has already been in and won a show. It is likely that to purchase this female, you will need to spend a significant amount of money.Note that a female dog being bred is called a “dam” or “bitch.” A male dog being bred is called a “sire” or “dog.”, There are many ways you can breed your female dachshund. You can purchase an intact male who is also of high-quality to be bred with the female you purchased. Or, you can arrange to a stud contract with another breeder. Regardless of which method you choose, select a male dachshund that complements your female dachshund.Two important factors to consider when picking both male and female dachshunds are: temperament and health. Both factors are mainly genetic, so the temperament and health of the parents will predict the temperament and health of the puppies.
A stud contract is a deal made with a breeder who has an intact male dachshund who is ready to be bred. You and the other breeder make a deal as to when and where the two dogs will get together to be bred, and arrange for payment either in cash and/or in kind (e.g. puppies).
Female dogs are usually brought to where the male dog is located for breeding. As a breeder with a female dachshund, this could be an added expense you will need to consider.

, Both the male and female dachshund need to be in excellent physical and mental health before being bred. This means that they should both have regular vet check-ups, blood tests, exercise, and excellent nutrition. Approximately one month before you plan to breed your female, you should take her for a complete vet exam.During the exam, your vet should make sure your female dachshund has all her vaccines up-to-date. Your female dachshund should also be checked for parasites and treated for those parasites if they’re present.

, Female dogs experience something called estrus, also known as being in heat, when they are ready to reproduce. Dogs can be ready to reproduce as early as six months of age, and they normally have two estrus cycles every year. However, it is very unusual to breed a female dog on her first estrus. It is also unusual to breed a female dog during consecutive estruses.A typical six month cycle includes proestrus (which last 4 to 9 days), estrus (which lasts 4 to 13 days), and metestrus and anestrus (which together last the rest of the six months).
For estimating purposes, your female dachshund will probably be in season for 21 days — 7 days to come into heat, 7 days actually in heat, and another 7 days going out of heat.
Conception should happen within the “in heat” or “estrus” period of the cycle. But to be safe, the female should be considered ready for the full 21 days (or 3 weeks) she's in season.
Note that the American Kennel Club (AKC) will not allow puppies to be registered if the female dog is less than 8 months old or more than 12 years old. Or if the male dog is less than 7 months old or more than 12 years old., Within two weeks of her getting pregnant, a dachshund will start to develop larger nipples. When this is noticed, she should be taken to the vet for a check-up. At this time, the vet will be able to confirm that she is pregnant and make sure she’s healthy.During this first check-up, discuss with your vet an exam schedule for your female dachshund for the rest of her pregnancy.

, A dachshund’s pregnancy will last (on average) between 63 to 65 days (or about 9 weeks). Around the 6th week of pregnancy, pregnant dachshunds should start being fed 50% more food than normal.A pregnant dachshund’s nutrition needs to be balanced throughout her pregnancy. In order to ensure the best possible nutrition, develop a diet for your pregnant dachshund with your veterinarian.
Note that some dogs won’t start to look like they’re pregnant until the last week of pregnancy.

, Approximately 24 hours before the puppies are born, the pregnant dachshund may lose an interest in food. Eventually she’ll have contractions 30 minutes apart and she’ll push out a ‘water sac’ that’s filled with clear liquid. Once this sac has come out, puppies should be born within an hour.Once your dachshund goes into labour, let your vet know.
The first puppy will always be the hardest for her to push out. Don’t panic if she’s pushing hard and moaning a little.
If the first puppy isn’t born within an hour of the sac coming out, ask your vet for advice on next steps. Your vet may recommend bringing the dog into the clinic for a c-section.
Female dachshunds, like most other animals, instinctively know what to do when their young are born. Most of the time, you’ll be able to let her take care of things. If, however, she doesn’t clean off a newly born puppy fairly quickly (within a few seconds), you’ll need to do this for her so the puppy can breathe.
If you need to cut the umbilical cord, cut it 1 inch (or 2.5 cm) from the puppy. Use a sharp and clean pair of scissors to make the cut, preferably medical scissors if you have them.
Female dachshunds don’t have to eat the afterbirth of each puppy, so you can remove and discard that when needed.
It is not unusual for anywhere between minutes and hours to pass before another puppy is born. As long as the female dachshund isn’t in distress, there’s no need to worry.
Make sure the dachshund has both food and water available throughout labour so she doesn’t have to go far to reenergize.
Record the time each puppy is born, and try to weigh each puppy immediately after birth and record the weight as well.

, Once the puppies are born, you can register the litter with the AKC. The AKC offers online registration via their website, or you can submit a paper application via mail. Once registered, you will receive a litter kit from the AKC shortly thereafter.As a breeder, it is vital that you register your puppies with the AKC. This registration demonstrates you are a responsible and caring breeder.

, Puppies will normally start to be weaned from their mother’s milk around 2 to 4 weeks of age. It is best to develop a weaning plan with your veterinarian, especially if this is one of your first litters. In general, puppies are normally given puppy formula, sometimes mixed with puppy food or rice cereal, to get them interested in something other than feeding from their mother. The amount and type of puppy food given is slowly increased over time until they’re no longer feeding from mom.The weaning process needs to be slow in order to ensure the puppies don’t experience any stomach upset or digestive problems.

, Chances are you will not be able to sell the majority of your puppies in your local area. The market for pure-bred dogs of any one kind will be limited in most areas, which means you’ll have to look for buyers from across the country, and possibly even in other countries.In order for people to know you have one or more puppies for sale, you’ll need to actively advertise in such a way as to cover a large area.
In addition to advertising widely, you’ll also need to be prepared to go through the process of finding the best home for your puppies while you’re at a distance. This might mean lots of long-distance phone bills or even going to visit potential buyers.
One of the best ways to advertise near and far is to create and maintain a good website. Unless you’re very experienced as website maintenance, you may need to hire someone to create and maintain the website for you.

, A responsible breeder does not just sell a puppy to a new owner because the owner has the money to buy the puppy. A responsible breeder will make sure the new owner is aware of all the pros and cons of owning a dachshund and is prepared for the long-term responsibility of a dog. The screening process should consist of an interview with the owners, a possible home visit, and reference checks. Some potential screening questions may include:Why do you want a dog? Why do you want a dachshund?
Who will hold the primary responsibility for the dog? What type of experience does this person have with dogs?
How much time to you plan to spend with the dog? How much training (and what type of training) do you plan to give the dog? How often do you plan to exercise the dog?
Does the home have children or other pets? Will the children be participating in the care of the dog?
Do you understand the financial responsibilities associated with dog ownership? Are you comfortable being able to commit the financial resources needed?
Will you promise to call me (the breeder) immediately if you have any questions or concerns, especially if you are considering removing the dog from your household?

, Your breeding stock are the dachshunds who display excellent qualities and meet the breed standards that you will continue to breed. Ideally, this stock should not consist of any dachshunds that are below the standards or have problems or issues. When you identify a dachshund in your stock that has a problem or an issue, you need to be prepared to remove it from the breeding stock.This usually means you’ll have the specific dachshund spayed or neutered so it cannot reproduce.
You may decide to keep the spayed or neutered dachshund as a pet, or you may decide to sell it to someone who isn’t concerned about breed standards and who does not want to breed dogs.

, Most breeders have very strict rules about which of their puppies can be bred in the future, and which puppies must be spayed or neutered when adopted. These rules are in place to help ensure the continuing quality of the breed. If you sell any puppies that are not good enough to be considered breeders, make sure you have a contract with the new owners that specifically states the dog must be spayed or neutered within a certain period of time.Ideally, you could get the puppy spayed or neutered before you sell it, but this may add to your personal expenses.
Alternatively, you should also have contracts for owners who purchase breeding puppies to ensure they follow your rules with regards to when and if the puppy can be bred. For example, if the puppy becomes unhealthy or develops an issue as it ages, the contract should forbid the dog from being used for breeding.

, Every puppy you produce through your breeding operation should be kept track of in the long run. This is especially important if any of those puppies eventually become show dogs. Being able to say that you had one or more offspring win certain awards and shows will help with your reputation as a quality breeder.You can even make it part of the adoption contract that the new owners must provide updates every so often so you can keep track of what each dog is doing or has done.

, You don’t need to run a rescue yourself, although that is certainly not out of the realm of possibilities. At the very least, you should be involved with dachshund rescues in some way. Remember, you’re in the breeding business because you love the dachshund breed and you are dedicated to its continued improvement. This includes making sure dachshunds that come from less reputable breeders or puppy mills are taken care of and found good homes where they will be spayed or neutered., Whether the new owner wants to return the puppy, or the new owner does something not agreed upon within the contract, you need to be prepared to take back any puppy you’ve sold. Once you breed dachshunds, they are your responsibility forever. You do not get to remove yourself from responsibility just because you sold a puppy to another person.Taking back a puppy due to the violation of contract terms may be as simple as calling the new owner and telling them you’re taking the puppy back. But it can also be difficult enough that you may need to involve a lawyer.

Enroll your dog in a group class.,
Enroll puppies in classes for their age group.,
Consider private training sessions.,
Ensure a professional trainer is well qualified.,
Talk to a professional trainer beforehand.,
Expect costs to vary widely.,
Consider day training.",How to Choose a Training Program for Your Dog3," Professional training can be a great way to improve your dog’s behavior. Group classes have many advantages, and are often more than sufficient to help teach a dog basic commands, as well as proper behavior around other dogs.The best choice for an initial group training class, especially if your dog is largely untrained, is a group obedience class.

, Young puppies benefit from socialization with other dogs immensely. While dogs of any age can benefit from group training, this is especially true for puppies. If your dog is between two and five months old, group puppy classes are ideal.Hold off on group classes until your puppy has received their full set of vaccinations. Talk to your vet to see what vaccinations your puppy needs.

, If you’re looking to correct a specific behavioral problem through training, a private training with a professional is a good option. Issues that can be corrected with training include over-protectiveness of food or toys, poor behavior on a leash, separation anxiety, and aggressiveness.Make sure any professional trainer working with your dog on these issues is trained specifically in behavioral therapy for dogs.
Other issues, like potty-training, excessive barking, and chewing can often be corrected in group classes.

, Don’t simply sign your dog up for a class wherever. Always ensure that anyone training and caring for your dog does so with compassion and genuine interest in improving the dog’s behavior. Never assume that membership in a dog trainer association means that someone is fully qualified to train your dog, especially in terms of behavioral therapy.Look for professional trainers through recommendations. Ask your vet, your local humane society, or your dog groomer about experienced trainers near you.

, Important things to consider are how much experience a trainer has, as well as the training methods they employ. These are both good things to ask a prospective trainer. Further, ask about talking to others who have completed a program.For instance, “Do you have an references of people who have completed the same class or program with their dog?”
If you’re considering a group class, ask if you can sit in on a class before signing up your dog. Look for signs that the trainer enjoys what they are doing and only ever treats both dogs and people with patience and respect.

, Depending on where you live, what types of training your dog needs, and the type of class you're looking for, prices can range from affordable to extremely expensive. Generally, private lessons are priced per-session, while group lessons charge for a several-week course.


Check with your local shelter to see if they offer subsidized training programs. They are especially likely to offer low costs classes to a dog you have adopted from their shelter.
Some pet supplies stores will also host classes. For instance, Petsmart offers specific and general classes for individual dogs ranging from puppy obedience to advanced trick training. The cost for most of these classes is $119.Veterinary clinics or community groups, like 4-H in the US, often offer classes as well.

, One option is having your dog trained by a professional while you’re at work, or booking your dog for a short stay in a overnight program for intensive training. Day training is great if you already have someone else watch your dog during the day. By leaving them with a trainer, they can work together on specific issues, like coming when called or interacting positively with other dogs.Board-and-train programs can be especially helpful to correct significant behavior issues. However, these programs are often expensive, and require you to keep up with training guidelines provided by the program to maintain the dog’s improved behavior.

Contact a breeder that specializes in breeding Chihuahuas. If you are looking to adopt a Chihuahua you can breed, you should get it from a well-established and humane breeder that has solid documentation of its lineage.Make sure your potential dog is in good physical and mental shape. This means it needs to adhere to the breed standards for size and shape, as well as being well tempered and social.
Contact your local Chihuahua clubs, as well as national organizations, for a list of breeders that use good breeding stock and have a good track record.
Make sure to go only to a respectable breeder. Good breeders will allow you to visit them, have happy and healthy looking dogs and puppies, have a lot of room for the dogs to roam, have a specialty breed they specialize in, and will show concern and interest in how you will care for and raise their dogs.When you are interacting with a well-regarded breeder, pay attention to how the person conducts business and how he or she interacts with the dogs. You can learn a lot just from watching how a professional conducts business.
The Humane Society has a good checklist to use when assessing a breeder.In some cases you can pay to hire a stud, a male dog that is hired out to impregnate female dogs.This means that you may only need to adopt one dog, most likely the female.;
, You need to figure out if it is ready and capable of reproduction. A female Chihuahua should not be used for breeding until she weighs at least 4 pounds and she has had a few heat cycles, as she will not be physically mature enough to handle a pregnancy until after that age.A male Chihuahua will generally have viable sperm when he is over a year of age but he is at his prime breeding age from 1 ½ to 5 years of age.

, Does your dog have desirable breed traits? Does it meet breed standard minimums? According to the Chihuahua Club of America, the Chihuahua should be a “compact little dog with terrier-like qualities of temperament” and should be a “well-proportioned little dog not to exceed six pounds.”The head should be “a well-rounded “apple dome” skull” with “full, round” eyes “but not protruding.” The ears are “large, erect type ears, held more upright when alert, but flaring to the sides at a 45 degree angle when in repose.”

, Does the dog have any abnormalities that may be passed along to its offspring? Many defects, such as a mismatched jaw, can be heritable traits.The Chihuahua breed is also prone to a few serious health problems. Dogs with these problems should not be used for breeding, as their offspring have a higher likelihood of developing these problems. These include:Collapsing trachea
Luxating patellas (kneecaps)
Hydrocephalus (water on the brain)Atlantoaxial instability (neck instability)
Dental problems, including deformed teeth or jaw problems. Their small mouths can mean dental problems that wouldn’t cause an issue in larger dogs.

, Do you have the financial resources to pay for any potential complications during the pregnancy and delivery and with the puppies? Things to consider are the possibility of an emergency Cesarean section surgery and the mother becoming potentially deathly ill with pregnancy related conditions like hypocalcemia, metritis, or mastitis.


Is there a market in your area to sell the puppies? Marketing starts well before the puppies are born. Contact local dog clubs to connect with potential buyers.
Are you prepared to keep any unsold puppies and raise them alongside the parents? Sometimes it can be hard to sell all the puppies in a litter.

, Do you have the time to devote to the proper care of your dog and the puppies, including daily handling of the puppies to properly socialize them to humans? Puppies that are handled daily are used to humans and make good pets. Puppies that don’t have much interaction with humans or who are handled roughly by humans can be fearful of humans and don’t make good pets.

, The visible parts of the male Chihuahua’s reproductive system are the penis and the scrotum. The scrotum is a pouch of skin outside the abdomen that holds the testicles outside the belly. The testes produce the sperm, which fertilize the egg.The testes also produce the male sex hormones, including testosterone which gives the male dog its sex characteristics.
There are normally two testes, which descend into the scrotum during puberty. They are located outside the abdomen as body temperature is too warm for sperm to develop normally. Therefore, dogs with undescended testes or only one testes do not make good candidates to breed. These dogs should be neutered, as a testicle retained inside the abdomen can cause health problems later in life. A responsible breeder won’t breed a male dog with this problem, as it can be passed onto its offspring and perpetuate health issues.

, For the most part, the female Chihuahua’s reproductive system is located inside the abdomen. The only visible part is the vulva. The ovaries are the female gonads, which produce eggs and the female sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.After eggs are fertilized by sperm they latch onto the uterus’ lining and develop into puppies. When the puppies are ready to be birthed, the cervix opens and the puppies are pushed out through the vagina and out the vulva.

, Before you breed your Chihuahua it should have a thorough veterinary examination about one month prior to breeding.This is to make sure the female is healthy enough to carry a litter of puppies or that the male is free from any defect or disease.

, Because you waited for 2 years before breeding your female Chihuahua, you should have an idea of the next time she will come into heat. A female generally comes into heat twice a year, however each dog is different.During the start of the heat cycle there is a preparatory stage, proestrus, when the female’s vulva swells and she has a light bloody discharge for 7-9 days, although this will vary.
After this stage the bleeding slows and the female becomes receptive to breeding. This is estrus, also called standing heat. The most fertile time for breeding will be at the end or just after standing heat occurs.
Your Chihuahua’s veterinarian can determine the stage of heat the female dog is in through swabbing the inside the vagina with a cotton swab and then examining the cells under a microscope. This will help you time the breeding with the male. A serum progesterone test using a sample of blood to measure hormone progesterone levels in the blood can also help to determine ovulation time.

, When the female is receptive to breeding she will act interested in the male by bowing to him and backing into him. The male will usually reciprocate this interest and mount her for breeding. As long as the dogs are in a quiet place no help is usually needed with this process.During the dog mating process, part the male dog’s penis will swell while it is in the female’s vagina which also swells. This is what is called a tie, where the penis is “trapped” inside the female. This lasts for around 10 minutes and is a desirable sign of a successful mating, although a pregnancy can also occur without a tie.

, Many breeders will mate the dogs every other day, for a total of 2-3 times, to assure the best chance of a pregnancy. After a successful mating the female Chihuahua’s body will prepare her pregnancy which lasts on average around 63 days.

Determine whether or not to use artificial insemination.,
Evaluate the male dog for suitability for breeding.Only dogs that are healthy and meet breed specifications for conformation and type should be bred.,
Evaluate the female dog for suitability for breeding.,
Collect the male dog's semen.Once the male dog has been deemed acceptable for breeding his semen will need to be collected.,
Have the semen evaluated.,
Chill or freeze semen that it not used immediately.,
Make sure the female dog is in the correct stage of her estrus cycle.,
Insert the semen into the female dog's vagina.Insemination is fairly straight forward once the semen is collected and the female dog is in estrus.,
Keep the dog standing after the semen is inserted.",How to Artificially Inseminate a Dog," Dog breeders use artificial insemination for a variety of reasons. Some breeds suffer from a diminished gene pool, especially if the country has a small number of breeding dogs.If the male and female dog are separated by great distances it may be cheaper to AI than to pay for transportation for the dog and their handler.


Artificial insemination can also make the semen from a desirable male dog more widely available.;
, This helps assure that the offspring will be healthy and display the desired breed traits.


In addition to a general health examination, a breeding soundness examination is done to make sure the male dog’s reproductive tract is healthy and sound.

, Much like the male, the female dog needs to be examined to make sure she is healthy for breeding and that she meets breed standards. A female dog that is in ill health or who has reproductive problems could have problems getting pregnant, even with AI, or could suffer severe health problems due to a pregnancy.

, Male dogs will become aroused in the presence of a female dog in heat, which is the prime time her body emits pheromones or chemicals that excite the males. When he attempts to mount, or breed, with the female the penis is redirected into an artificial vagina into which he ejaculates.


In some cases a female at the correct stage of heat is not available. Frozen cotton swabs that were wiped in the vagina of a female dog at the peak of heat can be thawed and swiped on the tail end of any dog, which causes the male dog to respond.
In some cases semen can be collected and stored before a dog dies to be made available after his death; in others injury may make it impossible for a male dog to breed naturally yet he may still be able to produce semen.

, After the semen is collected, the sperm cells in it will be examined under a microscope to make sure they are normal.This means that there will be sufficient numbers, shape, and activity.

, Chilled semen is used within 24 hours or else it will need to be frozen. Semen is stored in liquid nitrogen containers at subzero temperatures. This way semen can be used years later.


The best success rate comes from use of fresh semen. With chilled semen the success rate drops to 59-80% and with frozen it falls to 52-60%., Unlike the male, she needs to be in the receptive stage of her heat cycle in order to breed successfully. Females typically come into heat twice a year.


Each heat cycle has a preparatory proestrus stage, where the female’s vulva (visible to the outside) swells and she bleeds or spots blood for seven to nine days. The uterus (womb) is being prepared to make a suitable environment for the embryos to develop into puppies.After this, the bleeding slows and she becomes receptive to breeding. This stage is called estrus. This is also called standing heat, because it is the period when the female will stand to mated with the male dog. It is only during this stage that she will be able to become pregnant. The most fertile time will be at the end or just after standing heat occurs.
Veterinarians can determine the stage of heat the female dog is in by collecting swabs inside the vagina and examining the cells.The swabs will collect cells which have distinctive shapes and sizes depending on the stage of estrus. This is especially helpful in those female dogs that don’t swell or bleed much.

, The female is stood on the examination table with her back legs slightly extended beyond the pelvis. A pipette is used to deposit the semen inside the vagina near the cervix.


The insertion of the pipette takes special skill as the female dog’s vagina is quite long. The pipette is withdrawn and discarded.

, She should be kept standing for 10 minutes after depositing the semen. She should not sit or urinate, or the semen may run out.


After 10 minutes she can walk around normally, but jumping and urinating should be avoided for about an hour.

Perhaps you want puppies, or maybe your pit bull is a purebred. Breeding a dog can be expensive. You will have to take good care of your pregnant female, pay for multiple vet visits, and supervise the puppies during their first weeks of life. Make sure that you are dedicated to the idea before you begin.


Pit bulls are one of the most commonly surrendered dogs. In some areas, they can compose up to 40% of the homeless dog population, and many of these dogs are euthanized in shelters. Adopting a pit bull can not only be a cost effective option for many people but it can also save a life.;
, Some areas have breed-specific laws that outlaw the ownership or breeding of pit bulls. Even if pit bulls are allowed in your town, you may be required to muzzle them while out. Look up your local laws, and make sure that you comply with them., There are several different breeds of dogs collectively known as pit bulls. If you want a particular breed of pit bull, you should make sure that both parents are of that breed. If you do not do this, you may have a mixed litter. The most common breeds of pit bulls include:


American Pit Bull Terriers
American Staffordshire Terriers
Staffordshire Bull Terriers
You may want to check that the parents are registered with the American Kennel Club. This will ensure that the parents are purebred and that they really belong to their breed. It will also increase the value of the puppies if you are planning on selling them.

, Even if your dog has no outward problems, recessive genetic disorders can arise during breeding. You should have both the female and male dogs genetically tested to look for any potential diseases that could arise. While pit bulls are not known to have many problems, they can face the following issues:


Hip Dysplasia
Elbow Dysplasia
Autoimmune Thyroiditis
NCL-A (Cerebellar Ataxia)
Eye problems
Heart problems, Before you begin the mating process, you should find homes for the puppies first. Realize that you might have a litter of seven to ten puppies, and each will need a home. If you start looking for homes early, you can find a replacement home should a potential adopter back out.You can advertise online, through a local kennel club, or through your vet.

, If you do not have a male pit bull, you can hire a stud from another breeder. You will have to pay stud fees and negotiate a contract with the owner beforehand. The stud can physically mate with your female dog, or he can be used for artificial insemination.


Local kennel clubs can put you in touch with reputable breeders. Always make sure that you are hiring from a reputable, responsible breeder.
Ask to see the dog, and verify its temperament first. Make sure it has no aggression or behavioral problems.
If you are looking to breed purebred puppies, be sure to ask for proof of the stud’s pedigree up front.
Always make sure to have a written contract between you and the breeder beforehand.
The owner of the stud may request that your dog is tested for disease first., Before you try to mate the dogs, you should have the dogs examined by a vet. Talk to your vet about your plans to breed the pit bulls. The vet will be able to examine the dog for common problems and let you know if the dogs are ready to mate.


If you are hiring a stud, you should ask the stud’s owner to take the stud to a vet. Ask for documentation showing the stud’s health, including any potential health or behavioral problems that could pass onto the puppies.
The vet can also provide personalized advice on your dog’s diet, health, and exercise over the course of the pregnancy.

, Female pit bulls tend to go into heat twice a year, and each one will last about three weeks.During this, you will notice that her vulva is swelling and discharging liquid. Your pit bull cannot mate until about two weeks into this cycle. At this point, you may notice that:


Her discharge is turning from a bloody red to clear or brownish.
She is beginning to show interest in mating.
She is releasing a smell that will attract male dogs
Her tail moves to the side to make room for a male dog., Leave the female and male pit bulls together. You may notice the male mounting the female. The male will begin to thrust, and then remain attached to the female for between ten and thirty minutes. Do not attempt to separate the dogs at this point. This is a natural part of the mating process.If you have hired a stud, you may find it to be easier to take the female to the male. This is because the male may be less likely to mate in an unfamiliar environment than a female in heat.

, If you are having difficulty mating pit bulls, you may want to check the progesterone levels of the female. Progesterone is a hormone that is released when the pit bull is ready to mate. This test can help you find the proper timing for breeding or it can diagnose a problem that might interfere with breeding. Ask your vet if you can have your dog tested., Dogs can be artificially inseminated too. You can use a stud that you have personally chosen, or you can use semen from a sperm bank that has been frozen. Ask your vet if they offer reproductive services for dogs or if they can refer you to someone who can provide you this service.If you are using frozen semen, you may want to check that it has been DNA certified by a kennel club.
Artificial insemination can cost hundreds of dollars. Freezing and storing semen may incur additional costs., You may notice a growing appetite, larger nipples, or an increase in weight in your pit bull. These are not surefire signs of pregnancy, however. The only way to be absolutely certain that a dog is pregnant is to have her checked out by a vet. Typically, a blood test or ultrasound will be performed. This test can typically be done between 28 and 32 days after the dog has mated.A false pregnancy is one in which the pit bull displays the typical pregnancy behaviors but is not pregnant. If you suspect your pit bull is pregnant, take her to a vet and have her tested. A false pregnancy may be the sign of another problem.

, You do not necessarily have to feed your dog significantly more during pregnancy. Instead, make sure that she is receiving a well-rounded diet with adequate amounts of calcium and phosphorus.


In the last few weeks of pregnancy, gradually increase your pit bull’s food by 15 to 20%.You can feed your dog a store-bought dog food. Read the nutritional information, and make sure that it is at least 29% protein and 17% fat.
Check that her food contains calcium and phosphorus to promote lactation. It should have between 1-1.8% calcium and .8-1.6% phosphorus., A whelping box is a special bed that your dog will give birth in. You can buy a whelping box from a pet store or online. You can also build your own. Place the box in a warm, dry area, where the dog can rest quietly after giving birth.


You should line this box with newspaper when your dog is preparing to give birth. These can be changed easily when soiled. After birth, you can replace it with bath mats or blankets.Once the whelping box is ready, you should lead your dog to the box. Do this early in the pregnancy so that your dog grows comfortable and used to it. This will allow the dog to naturally select the whelping box when giving birth.

, There are a few different ways to estimate the dog’s litter size during pregnancy. While none of these are completely accurate, they can help you prepare for the number of puppies you may have at the end of your dog’s pregnancy. Ask your vet about:



Abdominal Palpitation: beginning at around day 28 of the pregnancy, your vet may start to feel your pit bull’s stomach to see how many sacs are in her uterus. This is easier earlier in the pregnancy than later.

Radiography: your vet will use X-rays to count how many fetal skeletons are in your dog’s uterus. This is the most effective way of determining litter size. It can be done around day 45 of the pregnancy.

Ultrasound: your vet will use sound waves to determine if your pit bull is pregnant, although it may not be able to accurately determine the litter size. It can be done around day 30., A few days before your pit bull is ready to give birth, she will start to build a nest in her whelping box. Start taking the dog’s temperature. You may notice a drop to below 100 °F (38 °C). Within twenty-four hours of this change, the dog’s cervix may dilate. This means she is ready to give birth.


In most cases, your pit bull will need no assistance in giving birth. That said, you should supervise the birth closely in case a problem arises.

, When the puppies are born, they will be inside membrane sacs. Your pit bull should begin licking them. This will help the puppies breathe while removing their sacs. You should try to make sure that there is one sac and placenta for every puppy. If there isn’t, there may be a placenta stuck in your dog. Call your vet if this happens.If your pit bull does not remove the sack, you should open it yourself. With your fingers, gently break the membrane near the puppy’s head, and peel it backwards. Remove any fluids from around the puppy’s mouth and nose. You can rub the puppy with a towel to help it breathe.

, You should be alert for any problems that might arise during your dog’s delivery. Have the vet’s number handy just in case something goes wrong. You may even want to have an emergency number in case the puppies are born during off hours. Call your vet if:


Thirty minutes of contractions happen without a puppy appearing
The dog does not go into labor within twenty-four hours of her temperature dropping
The dog has been pregnant more than seventy days
The dog appears to be in extreme pain
Hours pass without the dog giving birth to all of her puppies

, During the first day or two, the mother may not want to eat much. That said, her appetite will return. By three weeks, the mother may be eating up to four times her normal diet. It is important that the mother eats frequently. Break up her food into four meals throughout the day., Between six and eight weeks, the puppies will need their first round of shots. You may decide to get them their shots before sending them to their new homes. Be sure to remind the new owners that the puppies will require more shots at ten weeks. Shots needed at six weeks vaccinate against:


Distemper
Measles
Parainfluenza
Bordetella, The puppies will be ready to wean from their mother’s milk at around three or four weeks of age. Mix a puppy milk replacer with an equal amount of water. With your finger, wet their mouth with this mix. After a few days, you can crumble puppy food into this mixture. Your puppies should be eating solid food only by six weeks old., It is important to socialize pit bull puppies while they are young. This can prevent aggression later in life. Whether it is deserved or not, pit bulls do have a reputation of being an aggressive breed, but that does not mean that your puppies will turn out that way. You can prevent aggressive behavior through training and handling.Hold, play, and interact with the puppies often.
Separate puppies if they are fighting, mounting, or biting.
Introduce the puppies to strangers often., Once the puppies are weaned, they will be ready to go to their new homes. This will typically be around eight weeks of age. Contact the new owners, and make sure that each puppy has a home to go to.


Do not abandon un-adopted puppies at a shelter. Shelters are already overwhelmed with pit bulls, and your puppy may be euthanized.

Before you start competing with your dog in junior handling, you need to practice.,
The first thing you need to do is to stack your dog.,
You can also free stand your dog, when they are more trained.,
Another thing you have to learn are the show patterns.,
The golden rule of junior handling is to never cross between the dog and the judge.,
Talk softly to the dog all the time while you are in the ring.,
You need to be smartly dressed for handling.,
Wear your ring number on a show clip, on your arm, or clipped on with a safety pin.,
You will enter the ring with the other competitors and stand in a line with the dog stacked in front of you.,
The steward will ask the first person to go to the front and stack their dog.,
When the last person is doing their pattern, you need to stack your dog.

,
If you are lucky enough to be placed, go where the steward designates, and stand your dog.,
Soon you will gain confidence and will enter larger shows.

",How to Show and Handle a Dog as a Junior," You could go to your local ring craft class, especially if they have a special time for junior handlers. If there is none in the area then you can practice at home.

, If your dog is a small breed, (all toy breeds, small terrier, dachshunds, small spaniels e.g. cocker) then you will need to practice stacking your dog on a table, starting with a lower one so the dog gets used to it. If you have a larger dog (e.g. Doberman, Labradors, retrievers) then you need to stack the dog on the floor. How you stack the dog depends on what type it is. Generally speaking the front legs are level and straight down from the shoulders, the back hocks should be perpendicular to the floor. Look at a picture of your breed standing and try to make sure your dog stands like that.

, Many good show dogs get into a show stand themselves, but it's fine if you tweak their legs a bit!

, These are the straight up-and-down (pretty self explanatory) the triangle, the T, the L and the figure eight. The first two are the most commonly asked especially at companion shows. A good book which contains the patterns and every thing you need to know is ""Junior Handling the White Way"" by Marina White.

, Therefore, if the judge moves to where you are standing behind the judge then you must move around to the front. This is important when executing all patterns. You must be careful with turns. This becomes easier with practice. Go in the garden with your dog and place a flower pot somewhere to practice the turns and ask family and friends to move around you while you stand your dog

, This shows you can communicate with it. However, do not shout or be silly. Not only will you look stupid but you will disturb the other dogs in the ring.

, Jeans, trainers, or T-shirts do not look professional. Wear colors which contrast with the color of the dog's coat. An example is wearing cream trousers to show a Doberman(black and tan). A jacket of the same color presents nice, simple, elongated, eye appeal. Girls should tie their hair back.

,;
, The dog's side faces forward and its head positioned next to your right hand. Now is when the dog should be stacked. The judge will maybe ask everyone to move their dog around in a circle. Make sure to always leave enough room between the dog in front and you-three feet is a good goal. Move your dog at the right pace-you will need to trot a large dog so wait for the dog in front to go round a bit before you start.

, If you are new to the sport do not go first but watch what the exhibitors in front of you do. When the dog in front of you starts moving, it is time for you to set your dog up for the judge. The judge will look over your dog and ask you to do a pattern. When you return to him stand your dog again, say ""Thank you"" to the judge, and go to the back of the line

,, You will then be given a rosette. If you do not win, don't lose heart, but say thank you to the judge and congratulate the winner. Always remember there will be another show and winning one isn't really a big deal in the general scheme of things.

Choose a dog of the same breed.,
Choose both dogs carefully.,
Work only with respected breeders.",How to Avoid Crossbreeding As a Dog Breeder1," To avoid crossbreeding, the main thing you have to do is to breed your dog with a dog of the same breed. Both dogs must be purebreds and have no other breed mixed into their bloodline in the past.This can be determined through pedigree papers presented to you by the breeder.
For example, if you have a dachshund, only breed your dog with another dachshund. If you breed them with a chihuahua or yorkie, you will have a crossbreed.;
, When you are deciding to breed purebred dogs, you need to choose each dog carefully. Odds are, you probably own one purebred dog. If you are sure the dog is a purebred, you should look for another purebred dog to mate them with.Research the dogs carefully before you decide to choose them as the mating partner. If you make a hasty decision, you could miss something and end up crossbreeding your dogs.
When you are looking for a dog to mate with your dog, don't take the breeder's or owner's word for it. Instead, go see the dog, ask for their papers, and check their pedigree.

, As you look for a potential mate for your dog, make sure to only work with responsible and respected dog breeders. Responsible breeders will have papers, pedigrees, and registrations for their dogs. Good breeders will also only specialize in one, maybe two, breeds of dogs. They will also be recommended by the local kennel clubs or vets.Ask the breeder questions about the breed. If they are a respectable breeder, they will be experts in the breed.
Find out how many litters the breeder does in a year. Most breeders only produce one to two litters per year. If there are more, it may be a ""puppy mill"" instead of a respectable breeder.Choosing a good breeder ensures that you are getting a purebred dog instead of a crossbreed that looks like a purebred.

Create a written sales agreement.",How to Be a Responsible Breeder of French Bulldog Puppies," If you are looking to breed, you should start by obtaining a healthy bitch (female) puppy from a reputable breeder. The French Bulldog Club of America (FBDCA) has a registry of vetted breeder who are pledged to adhere to the breed standard and a rigorous code of ethics.You want to choose a female who has parents that are registered with the American Kennel Club, have health certifications that show they’re free from genetic defects, and come with established pedigrees so that you’re sure of their quality lineage.;
, Generally, you will seek out the services of a male dog rather than owning one yourself. You can search for a good sire at dog shows, with reputable breeders, and in breed publications where studs are advertised.Choose a male with characteristics that you’d like to combine with your female. For instance, he might have a desirable color that complements your female or traits that would address one of her deficiencies, such as a small skull.
Always ask for photos, an official pedigree, and health certifications when considering a stud. It’s also important to inquire about the litters that they’ve sired so that you can assess if they breed well.
Never breed dogs that are closely related to avoid genetic defects; however, dogs that are distantly related (for instance, they have a shared great uncle) often produce well together.

, You can always negotiate, but the stud’s owner will generally lay out the initial terms for when, where, and how their dog will mate with yours. Figure out if you will use natural or artificial insemination, where the mating will take place, and how much the stud’s owner will charge for his services., Take her for a veterinary check-up before she comes into season to improve her chances of a healthy pregnancy. She should have had her canine distemper and parvovirus vaccinations within the last 12 months and be covered for the time of her pregnancy. Check to be sure that she is free of intestinal worms, heartworms, and other diseases or parasites that could affect her puppies.It’s also a good idea to start giving your bitch prenatal supplements, including folic acid, iodine, and vitamin E.

, You will need to know when your bitch is in season in order to effectively breed her. You can tell that she’s in heat when she starts spotting and displaying irritable behavior. About five days into her season, start bringing her to the vet to test to see if she’s ovulating.There’s usually a two to three day window when she’ll be at peak fertility. Vets can use vaginal smears and progesterone testing to confirm when she’s ready to mate. Then, you just need to make sure that your stud is ready to perform his duty.

, As soon as your vet confirms that your bitch is ovulating, it’s time to do the breeding. You can arrange to do this in person with monitored natural intercourse or through artificial insemination with the help of a vet. To enhance the chances of pregnancy, inseminate your bitch two times on two different days, doing so either on consecutive days or waiting a day in between.If you choose to do the former, arrange whether you’ll go to the stud or whether he’ll come to you. Make sure that their breeding is closely monitored to prevent any potential aggression. Many breeders do not favor natural breeding because of the risks of violence and infection.
If you choose to go for artificial insemination, have the stud’s chilled semen sent to your vet.
Be sure to keep track of the breeding days so that you can better estimate your female’s due date.

, The pregnancy will generally take around 60 – 68 days. During that time, keep your expectant dog clean, well-hydrated, and well-nourished. Be sure that she’s eating a complete and balanced food that’s high in protein and fat, plus fortified with vitamins and minerals, especially folic acid and calcium for the sake of embryonic development.Keep the mother on her regular amount of food in the first half of the pregnancy as weight gain at this stage can increase the risk of whelping difficulties.
Some breeders recommend feeding the mother half an ounce of raw liver (pork, beef, or venison) each day in addition to their kibble. Some breeders also suggest switching the mother over from adult to puppy food around the fifth week of their pregnancy and through nursing to ensure they’re getting the vitamins and minerals necessary for puppy development.Sometimes mothers get morning sickness and aren’t inclined to eat. If you find that’s the case, tempt her with something she likes to eat. Bland foods like chicken and rice are often safe bets.

, It’s often hard to tell if your female has a litter on board or not. Inseminations are generally only 70% successful, and she won’t start showing until seven weeks, if at all. You can determine if she’s pregnant by going to the vet.The vet can use a Relaxin blood test from 25+ days, a sonogram from 28+ days, and an xray from 45+ days from the first day of breeding to confirm if your bitch is pregnant.
Even if you think she’s not pregnant, always be sure to check. Sometimes small litters are difficult to detect.

, Natural birth is difficult for French Bulldogs because of the pups’ large heads and the mother’s small pelvis and labored breathing. More than 80% of French Bulldogs cannot or should not give birth naturally due to the risk of puppy fatalities and of maternal uterine damage, infections, and death. Keep track of when your bitch is due, and have an experienced vet on-call who is ready to deliver the litter by caesarean section.French Bulldogs puppies generally gestate for between 59 – 63 days from the time of breeding. You can generally gauge the onset of labor by the mother’s behavior (discomfort, agitation, lack of appetite, and/or nesting behavior) and by taking her rectal temperature. If you notice it drops by at least a degree, that’s a good sign that she has gone into labor.After the c-section, be sure to monitor the incision for discharge or infections. If you notice any discharge, clean it with hydrogen peroxide. If it continues or you notice significant redness and swelling, take her to the vet immediately. Note that other spotting and discharge is normal for a dog for a few days after birth., Due to the trauma of the birthing process for French Bulldogs, it’s important not to put bitches through too many pregnancies. Stick to 2-4 litters per mother, and stop breeding her immediately if pregnancy is compromising her health or if she’s producing stock with defects., It should be a rectangular box with walls high enough to keep the puppies in. The recommended dimensions are 32” x 16” and at least 12” in height. It should also have soft, clean bedding and a source of heat.Keep the box protected from any disturbances, especially quarantined away from other dogs or animals.
The bedding should be soft and uneven, such as an egg-crate foam with towels on top. This will prevent your puppies from developing flat chests or splayed legs.
Use an adjustable heat lamp to keep your puppies warm. The climate in the box should be kept around 95°F (53°C) during the first week, 85°F (29.4°C) the second, and at 75°F (23.9°C) from then on. Be sure to adjust the temperature according to the puppies’ behavior. If all of them are huddled under the lamp, turn it up. If all of them are huddled on the opposite side from the lamp, turn it down.

, Put the litter in the whelping box with their mother and keep constant watch over them for the first few hours to ensure that your bitch is prepared to assume her motherly duties. Sometimes moms can be aggressive, even towards their own offspring. As soon as you see her relax and start cleaning her pups and allowing them to feed, you can be sure that she has acknowledged them as her babies., Immediately after they’re born, puppies need to feed every two to four hours. Sometimes they can be slow on the uptake. If they’re not finding their mom’s nipple, squeeze it and lead them to the drop of milk.


If they’re still unable to feed naturally or the mother is not producing enough milk, bottle feed the puppies with a high-quality puppy formula like Esbilac.

, French Bulldog pups aren’t born knowing how to pee and poo. Their mom will generally stimulate these behaviors by licking their genitals and anus after each mealtime. If they do not, you will have to simulate her motherly duty.Use a cotton ball dipped in warm water to rub the appropriate places after the puppies have fed.

, Start weaning the litter off of breast milk as soon as their teeth begin to appear, around four weeks. Take them from liquid to solid food slowly, eventually removing their mother during feeding times to ensure that they don’t go for her milk.Start by bowl feeding them with a high-quality puppy formula like Esbilac. Then, mix in some finely ground, high-quality puppy kibble to create a mushy gruel. Gradually add more finely ground dry puppy food with each meal, increasing its thickness until they’re ready for plain dry food.
Introduce dry food alongside mush to encourage puppies to start eating it by choice. They should be able to eat kibble by the time they’re six weeks.

, Ideally, you’ll hand over each puppy when it’s between eight and 10 weeks old. This is old enough for your puppy to be healthy and well-socialized but still young enough to not have attachment problems that would make it more difficult to adjust to a new home., The vet should have checked the puppies immediately after the c-section to ensure they were all healthy and free from obvious defects. After that, take the puppies in to start their vaccination cycle at six weeks.The whole litter should have a “5 in 1” vaccination (for canine distemper, hepatitis, coronavirus, parainfluenza, and parvovirus) every three weeks until they’re 16 weeks old. They should also have a rabies vaccine at 12+ weeks.
The new owners will generally take care of many of these; just be sure that they know they need to register the puppy with a vet right away and continue the cycle of vaccines and parasite control.

, As soon as they’re born, fill out a form that provides information about the parents, and the AKC will send you individual registration forms for each pup. AKC registration will show prospective buyers that you have certified purebred dogs for sale.You can do this via mail or online. Expect a two to six week turnaround time.

, Show your puppies with their mother in the facility where they were raised. Be able to produce pedigrees and health certifications for both parents that show they have been screened for common defects, and provide health guarantees for your puppies.French Bulldogs are susceptible to multiple genetic disorders. Responsible breeders will have their parent dogs screened for common defects, including brachycephalic airway syndrome, spinal malformations, hip and reproductive issues, and be able to produce independent certification from a vet that their stock tested negative.
The parents’ health screening results should also be registered in the Canine Health Information Center database so that owners can look it up for verification.
It’s also a good idea to become a registered breeder with the French Bulldog Club of America to gain referrals and show that you adhere to a strict code of ethics with regards to breeding.

, Discuss the French Bulldog’s needs and temperament with prospective buyers, and inquire about their desires and lifestyle to ensure that they align. Visit their home to make sure that it’s a good environment for the puppy. Make sure that they're ready to be committed pet owners.

, Signing a contract to seal the deal will establish you as a credible and transparent breeder while protecting the interests of you, the owner(s), and the puppy.Make sure that the document includes contact information for both parties, the names and American Kennel Club registration numbers for both parents, a description of the puppy, and a health guarantee clause that stipulates that a puppy can be returned for a full refund if any health issues are found upon an immediate veterinary screening.
Many breeders also include a clause specifying that a puppy must be returned to them if the owners are no longer able to care for it.

Research the pedigree.,
Get a DNA test.,
Choose dogs that are registered.,
Make sure your female only mates with one dog.",How to Avoid Crossbreeding As a Dog Breeder2," Never take someone’s word that a dog is purebred, even if it looks like a purebred dog. You should research the dog’s ancestors and bloodlines. You can start by looking at the dog’s pedigree.A pedigree is a document that shows the dog's ancestors and bloodlines to prove that it is a purebred.You can order digital or hard copies of your dog’s pedigree from the kennel club they are registered with.

, Another way to ensure that both dogs are purebred before breeding is to do a DNA test. You can start by getting a DNA test from the American or British Kennel Club. However, these tests are only to verify the parentage of the dogs to ensure they are from the proper bloodline.If you want to determine what breed one of the dogs is or if the line has been crossbred, you can order at-home DNA kits to determine the breed. They are available from companies such as Wisdom Panel and DNA My Dog., Only purebred dogs can be registered through the American or British Kennel Clubs. To be registered, the breeders must prove through pedigrees and DNA analysis that the dog is from a line of purebred dogs.By choosing a dog that is registered through one of these organizations, you can be confident the dog has no mixed blood.

, A female who mates with different male dogs around the same time can have puppies in the same litter by different fathers. If your dog has mated with two different breeds, your litter may contain both purebred and crossbred puppies.To ensure this doesn’t happen, either let your female dog only mate with one male dog, or make sure she mates with dogs that are purebred.

Know what crossbreeding is.,
Recognize the concerns for crossbreeding.,
Identify the benefits of crossbreeding.,
Evaluate why you are breeding dogs.",How to Avoid Crossbreeding As a Dog Breeder3," Before you breed dogs, you should understand what crossbreeding is. Purebred dogs have only been bred with other dogs of the same breed. There is no other breed in their bloodlines. Purebred dogs can be registered with kennel clubs.Crossbreeding is when two dogs of different pedigree breeds mate and produce offspring. This produces a crossbreed dog with the DNA of two different breeds. Some people call crossbreeds “hybrids” while others call them “designer dogs.” Dogs such as Labradoodles, Goldendoodles, and Puggles have been crossbred.

, When two dogs of different breeds mate, they mix the blood lines, eliminating the purebred status for the litter. Since many people are adamant about purebred dogs, and only purebred dogs can be registered with kennel clubs, many people work hard to make sure crossbreeding doesn’t occur.Crossbreeding changes the look of the dogs. If two purebred dogs of different breeds mate, the puppies will have a combined look of both breeds, changing the appearance.
Some crossbreeding combinations can cause problems when the mother dog gives birth. If a small female gets pregnant by a large male, she could give birth to puppies too big for her, which could cause problems.

, Some breed experts believe that crossbreeding should occur instead of pure breeding. Crossbred dogs usually have mild temperaments, unlike the fussy temperaments of purebred dogs. They also have a unique appearance due to the two breeds of their genetic makeup.Crossbred dogs also are generally healthier than purebred dogs. Because purebred dogs pass down sets of defective genes from both the mother and father, they are more likely to develop health problems. Crossbred dogs only get one set of those genes, making the health problems less likely.

, Responsible breeding occurs when you have experience with dogs of a particular breed. This can take years. If you train dogs or take them to competitions, you probably are experienced enough to breed dogs. If you want to breed dogs to make money, you should reconsider. This is not a good reason to breed dogs.


Make sure you have a good reason for breeding, like continuing the line of an exceptional show dog that aligns with the breed standards. Many people who breed for profit lower the quality of the breed. This also leads to more dogs in shelters and contributes to the overpopulation of dogs."

, To run a successful fun dog show you’ll need lots of reliable people to help you. Assign everyone a job and make sure everyone knows their role.

, Make sure that you are allowed to hold a public event here. Also decide what to do if it rains. Is it indoors? Will it get muddy? Is there somewhere to do agility if you are holding that event? Make sure that once you have your venue, book it with plenty of time to organize everything else.


Village/school halls with access to a playing field are good choices. Marquees are another option but expensive. You will also most likely need good parking facilities for spectators and competitors. Also make sure you toilet facilities.
If you have a second ring for Agility/ Obstacle course or Obedience, then a notice of that ring’s purpose should be displayed on a prominent notice board.
The ring should be large enough for the contestants to stand along 2 sides and maybe partway down the third side. For a 6 class novelty type show, you should consider a ring of some 20 meters (65.6 ft) by 20 meters (65.6 ft). If the contestants are stood along 4 sides then the ring is too small for purpose - so make it bigger next year. Spectators should be able to sit along at least 2 sides of the ring, if not 3.

, More serious shows use qualified and experienced judges. Fun dog shows are just that and taken less seriously by all concerned. With either however you need to plan out a good show programme with the right number of classes etc.

, If you are stuck for ideas you can look up classes. Here are some ideas:

Dog The Judge Would Most Like To Take Home

, Owners are invited to let their dogs have a try-out at various challenges such as walking along planks, over hurdles or in and out of sticks etc. These competitions are usually just a bit of fun and an added attraction to your fundraising event.You may however like to consider inviting your local dog agility club. These clubs are often keen to demonstrate the skills of their pets and regularly feature in all sorts of summer fundraising events. A run through of their routines can make a great attraction at your event.

, Some shows give rosettes to the first four places, whilst some shows have rosettes down to 6th place. You do not have to award six places in every class. You could also do certificates. Remember do order these early and in plentiful supply. Cups are also a good option.

, Every show will have its own style of Entry form. Ideally, the form should be A4 size with the entrant keeping the top half - which has venue, class list, class fee, sponsors, etc. The volunteer booking in the entries should write the classes entered on to the kept section, or on to the back of the ring number cards as they are issued. The bottom half should be submitted at the entry point, and include:


Name, age and breed of dog
Owners contact details
Classes being entered
Total entry fee paid
Dog Club membership number (If a DC event)
You may also want to have forms for the judge to fill to say who came where. This is especially important if you are holding a best of show class.

, You can also hold little raffles, tombolas, etc.

, Make sure have either professional judges, or volunteers willing to do it. Either way they should have experience with dogs.

, Make posters, put notices in newsagents’ windows or on council notice boards, use local newspapers and radio stations, and advertise on Facebook. Make noise and get the word out there. You will want to do this anywhere from a month before to a couple of weeks before, depending on how much publicity you want.

, Depending on how early you are allowed at the venue, you may need to get a wiggle on. Lots of volunteers are useful. If you are running an agility course you will need to set up, plan and number a course.

, Think about the venue and activities that you’ve chosen. Is there anything that could put a dog or owner at risk?


Vets — you should have a vet on hand should a dog need medical attention. You could ask a local vet to be a judge.

, Enjoy it!

Think about what you are getting into.,
Plan out your costs.,
Decide and evaluate your reason for breeding.,
Get serious.",How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show1," Are you doing this on impulse? This is a very large commitment, and Old English Sheepdogs are not for first-time owners, let alone for first-time breeders. Hopefully, you've had lots of experience with other breeds and breeding dogs in the past, or this is going to be a fun, yet hard challenge for you.

, Owning, breeding, showing, traveling, vet bills, etc cost A LOT of money. Make a chart based on weekly, monthly, and yearly costs for owning one dog, and decide if you really can afford even more. Talk to breeders for information on costs, and travel to a dog show to see if you really want to make this commitment.

, If you want to breed conformation show-line dogs, you should probably get your bitch/stud from a champion-line breeder, knowing the commitment it takes to grooming, showing, and traveling to shows. Not to mention a grooming workshop for your breed, or expenses for trips to the groomer before a show. If you want to breed for herding, you should purchase your bitch/stud from a working line breeding kennel, yet knowing the commitment it takes to training, traveling, grooming, etc. of having a working sheepdog. You would also need to travel to your nearest open sheepdog classes to keep your herding dog entertained.

, Nobody cares for you to be just a ""pet"" breeder. You can be a show breeder and have pet-quality puppies that aren't fit for the ring, but you should always try to have nice, sound, healthy puppies for working or show stock. Please, none of this ""just pets"" stuff. These are working animals that need a job to stay entertained and healthy.

Assess the body of the dog.,
Inspect the dog’s face.,
Check the appearance of the coat.",How to Identify a Show Worthy Maltese1," The standard body of a Maltese is compact. Typically, the distance from the withers (shoulders) to the root (base) of the tail should be the same as the distance from the withers to the ground. The dog's chest should be slightly deep and the loins should be tight and slightly tucked under.The dog's neck should hold the head in a high position, almost as if the dog is holding its head back a little.
The tail should be curled over the dog’s hind end. The tail should also be plumed.
The front feet can be slightly turned out, but turned out back feet are not permitted.
The Maltese pup’s paw pads should be completely black.;
, The face of a dog is one of the most important aspects of a show dog, especially when it is being closely scrutinized by a judge during a competition. A Maltese dog should have a slightly rounded head on top with drop ears and a medium length snout.The dog should have a black nose, with its eyes a deep brown or black.
The skin around the eyes should be dark.

, The coat should be pure white. But it can be common to see cream, tan, or lemon ears. These colors should be seen nowhere else on the coat. It is preferable not even to have these pigments on the ears, although it is still permitted if they are light and barely noticeable.The coat should be silky and thin, never greasy.
Maltese dogs can also have red fur on their feet, but this is not permitted in most show competitions.

ALWAYS find a reputable breeder.,
Make sure the breeder scans her sires and dams for health problems found in the breed!",How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show2," Look around to find a breeder. The best places to spot one are in Dog Fancy classifieds, Dog World classifieds, AKC Gazette, or www.akc.org where you can find the breeder classifieds. Also, a GREAT place to spot your breeder is at your local kennel club's dog show. Internet listings are not the best, as many of the dogs come from puppy mills. Also, NEVER buy your dog from a pet store, as they always come from puppy mills with multitudes of health problems. Find a breeder that specializes in the area you would like to specialize in, whether it is herding, agility, obedience, or conformation.;
, This is the MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF BREEDING- DO NOT BUY FROM ANYONE WHO DOES NOT PERFORM HEALTH SCANS ON THEIR DOGS! You should do this also when breeding your future dogs.

"
"
Prepare yourself for a new puppy, and possibly MANY more in the future.

,
Take a grooming course for your breed.,
Puppy-proof the house.,
Buy your supplies.,
Set up a vet appointment in advance.",How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show3,", If you are going to breed the Old English Sheepdog, you are going to need your dogs to be well groomed and presentable. You will usually be able to find courses from your local kennel club, or from the breeder you are choosing to get your dog from.

, Make sure your house is safe for your puppy. Make sure electric cords are out of the ""chewing zone"", all plastic bits and paper are out of ""choking zone"", and that you have baby gates put up in places that are off limits to pooches.

, There are many pages on wikiHow that will tell you what supplies that you need for your new puppy. Buy all your necessities for your new puppy that you will be bringing home.

, Set up a vet appointment BEFORE you get your puppy so that you do not have to wait over a month for Fido to get its last set of puppy booster shots. The date should be the day after you get your poochie. Your breeder (if local) will probably give you a preferred vet, but do your research and find the best veterinarian in your area.

"
"
Look for obedience.,
Monitor for temperament.,
Meet the parents.",How to Identify a Show Worthy Maltese2," One of the most important traits for a Maltese show dog to possess is obedience. This trainability should be at least somewhat obvious, even as a young puppy. Notice if the dog listens to you when you speak to it and if it seems to adapt its behavior based on previous learning experiences.Try telling the dog “no” to a behavior you don’t want it to do. If the dog seems to understand, or at least try to, then this is a good sign for trainability.

, Personality is one of the things these dogs are known for. The dog you are showing should be fearless. They are sweet dogs that are not at all aggressive. The personality needs to be playful. Any Maltese without these traits is not show worthy.You want a Maltese dog that is comfortable around people and not afraid of a crowd. Your dog should not be aggressive or shy.

, If you are purchasing a puppy, meet the parents of the litter. If you cannot meet the father, at least see the mom. By observing the behaviors of the parents, you should be able to get an idea about the temperament of your puppy.Behavioral characteristics in dogs are often shared genetically – so a dog that is mild-mannered is likely to give birth to puppies with similar mild-mannered temperaments. And vice versa with disobedient or aggressive behaviors.
This is also a great way to get an estimate about the ultimate size your Maltese puppy will grow to.

"
"
Acquire registration papers.,
Maintain weight requirements.,
Get the necessary training.,
Aim for success.",How to Identify a Show Worthy Maltese3," All Maltese dogs entered in shows must be registered as purebreds. In most cases, you should have been given your dog’s registration papers directly from the breeder when you acquired the dog. Most U.S. competition shows require AKC registration, so be sure to verify that.In some competitions, other types of registrations are partially acceptable. For example, CKS and APRI registered dogs are often allowed to participate in most events at shows, only excluding the Conformation event.
If you don’t have any papers for your purebred Maltese dog (and you can’t get any from the breeder), you can contact the AKC to see what they can do to help you. In some cases, accreditation can be given with photo evidence and written statements by witnesses who claim that the dog is a purebred.

, Check to see whether the dog complies with size breed standards according to the AKC. The AKC requires a Maltese to be under seven pounds (3.2 kg), but four to six pounds (1.8 - 2.7 kg) is preferable.You could also check with another relevant body, such as the Kennel Club. In some cases, the show entity will have its own rules regarding breed-specific weight requirements.

, Many dog competition shows require a certain amount of training to prove that your dog is ready for entry in a real competition show. This training involves obedience tests and command tests.To get your Maltese to a point where it is ready to succeed in a dog show, you’ll need to focus on obedience training. This means practicing commands, establishing your position as the dominant leader, rewarding your dog when it behaves correctly, leash training, and teaching your dog some simple commands. Once your dog masters some easy commands (like “sit,” “stay,” and “come”), you can move to more complicated tasks like fetching, following you without a leash, and rolling over.
Some shows also require entry into a preliminary competition at an unofficial dog show called “Matches.” These events are still hosted by kennel clubs and help dogs become more socialized and accustomed to the show atmosphere.

, A successful Maltese show dog must have a willingness to perform, which often translates into a demanding, pushy attitude. Winning show dogs often want to be the center of attention with their owners.A dog who loves to perform, even under pressure, will be able to succeed in the stressful show environment when other dogs may break due to the stress of the situation.

"
Use the collar and leash you’ll use during the show.,
Decide what needs improvement.,
Correct one aspect at a time.,
Do not tease or bait your dog.,
Reward your dog.,
Train your dog early.",How to Improve Your Dog's Show Ring Gait1," If you use one type of collar and leash during training and a totally different type of leash and collar during the show, your puppy might get confused. To avoid this, use the same collar and leash during the show that you’ll be using in the show ring.If you need to make a change to your dog’s collar or leash due to show rules or for any other reason, do so during training.;
, A dog’s show ring gait is comprised of several discrete elements. Identify whether your dog’s straight-line movement, left and right turns, amble, or trot need work.Your dog’s gait might also need to be adjusted based on its relation to the leash. If your dog pulls the leash too tightly, it will not walk properly.

, If your dog’s show ring gait needs several corrections – for instance, perhaps your dog’s speed and distance from you are wrong – only take on one correction at a time. Adjusting your dog’s show ring gait in even one way can be difficult. Therefore, the best approach is to take only one thing at a time. After your dog has corrected one aspect of its show ring gait, begin adding other elements that you want it to correct., Waving food around in front of your dog or getting your dog wound up will not help your training process. You should be teaching your dog that the clicker is the reward, not the treat itself., When your dog assumes a show-ring appropriate gait, reward it in two ways. First, click the clicker or whatever clicker substitute you’ve adopted for training purposes. Second, administer a treat. The treat you use is up to you. Your dog might, for instance, enjoy a cube of cheese or a slice of ham., Younger dogs have an easier time correcting their show ring gait than older dogs. When improving your dog’s show ring gait, begin as early as possible."
"
Visit the breeder's litter.,
Ask the breeder's advice.,
Choose your puppy.,
Bring your puppy home.",How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show4," After you've found your breeder, schedule a time where you can see their newest or upcoming litter.

, Ask the breeder which puppy would be likely to do the best in herding, breeding, showing, etc. Breeders will always try to help you find the best puppy, as they are committed to making their breed the best as possible.

, Make sure your puppy is healthy, strong, playful, and a little curious. Never get a sick puppy. Signs of a sick puppy are:


Discharge coming out of the nose, or eyes.
Stinky/Waxy/Red ears
Signs of diarrhea
Weak limbs

, Bring your puppy home. You should preferably pick the puppy up at the breeder's, even if it is a long drive. This will save the puppy the stress of shipping on a plane, which causes trauma, and sometimes even death.

"

Enroll your puppy in a basic obedience course.,
Schedule puppy play-dates!,
Bring your puppy with you to places.,
Introduce your puppy to livestock (if it will be herding).,
Introduce your puppy to cats and other small critters- you don't want any eaten ones showing up on your doorstep!,
Start grooming early.",How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show5," Make sure it is a ""puppy only"" class, and that the instructor uses POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT only. This class should meet weekly. An easy obedience course like this will help your puppy learn how to react in a new environment, and how to react with other dogs and people. Eventually, you can enroll your puppy in higher obedience courses so that you can maybe even compete, although this is not necessary.

, Call your friends up and schedule a puppy play date with their dog and your puppy. Make sure that their dog is current on all vaccinations. This will help your puppy learn to play and interact with other dogs in a non-threatening environment.

, First, you need to make sure that it has all its shots, or it could pick up a disease. Bring your puppy with you to pick your kids up from school, when you go to work (if it is okay with your boss), and maybe even to a couple of dog shows. This will help your puppy feel easier in new environments, and to enjoy car rides.

, You need to introduce your puppy to livestock at a young age so that it will not panic when you start training.

, (this is optional).

, I don't know any groomer/breeder/handler/trainer who wouldn't stress this! Introduce your puppy to all grooming tools at a young age so that it will enjoy it in the years to come. Groom it gently each day for 10 minute intervals.

"
"
Enroll your puppy in a ringcraft class.,
Bring your puppy to herding class although his instincts may not have kicked in yet, bring your puppy to herding class so it can at least get used to the livestock.

,
As mentioned above, you NEED to enroll your puppy in a basic obedience course!

,
If you choose to do agility with your sheepdog, enroll it in a PUPPY class so that they will not have stress on their joints.

,
Enroll your puppy in any class that you would like that is not mentioned, whether it be animal acting, schutzhund (although sheepdogs don't excel in it particularly), freestyle disc, or fly ball.

Most kennel clubs have strict requirements about the number of years an applicant has spent in the dog show circuit or as a breeder before they can become a judge.


A breed type is the standard established for the ideal type of that breed. It can cover the colorings of the dog, coat type, height, weight, body structure, and ears.
Most dog shows are conformation shows, also known as breed shows. In these shows, the judge is an expert in a specific dog breed and will examine several purebred dogs to see how well these participants conform to the established breed type.In smaller shows, there may be only one judge that evaluates all of the dog breeds. In larger shows, there may be multiple judges or judges that evaluate only specific breeds.;
, Pay careful attention as you observe the judges, the dogs that are being shown, as well as the handlers and breeders that participate in the show.


You will see that even with a very detailed breed standard, judges may have to make subjective judgment calls when there are several exemplary breed examples.
You will also have the opportunity to see many different breeds and to become more knowledgeable about the different breed standards.
This is a great way to become more familiar with the dog show circuit. You will also come into contact with other breeders and aspiring judges who can help you in your pursuit to become a dog show judge.

, You should register with the kennel club that you’d like to eventually become a judge with. Judges are generally affiliated with the club that runs the show and must be licensed through this organization. For example, a judge licensed through the American Kennel Club would judge at American Kennel Club shows.


Most kennel clubs are national organizations, so research clubs that are in your country.Each club will have very different requirements. It is essential that you research the organization that you choose carefully to ensure that you have met their requirements before applying to become a judge.
If you want to work with a specific breed, research the organization to ensure that they show those breeds. Most large organizations, like the UK’s Kennel Club, will show almost all standard breeds.

, Your local and national clubs will put on different events throughout the year. These are usually showings of different dogs. By participating in these, you have the opportunity to meet other breeders, judges, and dog lovers.

, In order to begin the dog breeding process, you will need to be in contact with breeders who are willing to breed with your dogs. Keep in close contact with breeders, as they can be helpful and also provide tips and support in your path to becoming a dog show judge.


Participating in events and activities that the club puts on is a good way to meet and build relationships with other breeders.

, The road to becoming a dog show judge is a long one. You should expect to spend upwards of ten years before you reach your goal. You will need to undergo years of training, breeding dogs, working at shows, and applying for positions in order to be accepted.


Base your timeline off of the organization that you want to work with. For example, the default application to be a judge with the American Kennel Club is a 12-5-4 program. This means you must spend 12 years exhibiting a specific breed of dog that you want to judge. You must have bred 5 litters and 4 champions.If you want to judge with the UK Kennel Club, you will need to be nominated to be awarded a Challenge Certificate. Among other requirements, you must pass several assessments and exams that address your knowledge of a specific breed and to have been a steward for 12 days at shows., A steward assists judges during dog shows by ensuring that the show goes smoothly, completing paperwork, and that the dogs are well cared for. You can volunteer as a steward at any time during your membership with your kennel club, and it is a good way to gain experience.The AKC requires that aspiring judges be a steward at six shows and to participate during six judging assignments in order to apply.
Volunteer as a steward in any dog shows that are in your area to gain experience, even if they aren’t specifically for your chosen organization.

, The breed standards cover the ideal appearance of a dog. You will need to have an expert level knowledge of the dog breed that you want to judge in order to become a judge. You will need to select the dog breed that you will breed and exhibit before your judge application process.


The American Kennel Club Study Guides are very comprehensive collections that will be helpful to you as you begin to breed dogs and to become a judge.Guides cover breed history, breed standard, give information about the breed's parent national parent club and regional clubs. They also list experienced breeders and exhibitors who may be willing to share their knowledge with new breed enthusiasts.
Most judges are experts in a few different dog breeds, but you must be knowledgeable about the majority of dog breeds in order to judge at smaller shows.

, Once you have determined the type of dog that you want to breed and to judge, you need to begin the breeding process. Most kennel clubs will require that you breed a certain amount of litters and a certain number of champion dogs in order to be considered as a judge.


You will need to have a dam, which is a female that you can breed, and a sire, which is a male that will breed with the female.
You want both dogs to be in the top 10% of their breed. This means that the dogs are great specimens of the breed and meet nearly, if not all, the breed characteristics that are laid out in the breed standard.Breeding dogs is an expensive endeavor. You may need to pay another breeder to allow their male to breed with your female, you will need to purchase supplies to keep a female in your home, and you must be prepared to raise puppies for at least 8 weeks.
Find an established breeder that is willing to be your mentor and find a veterinarian that you can consult throughout the process.
Once the female becomes pregnant, you will need to take care of her during her pregnancy until the puppies come.

, When you have a litter of puppies, you will be able to determine whether any of these puppies are of show dog quality. There are puppy divisions of many dog shows where you can begin to exhibit your dogs.Bring the puppies to a veterinarian so they can undergo genetic testing. You will need to make sure that the puppies are not at risk for genetic diseases and conditions, and to ensure that they are purebred.

, You must register your new puppies with your club organization in order to begin to show the dogs.Having documentation that you have bred successful litters of puppies will be essential during your judging application. For organizations like the AKC, you will need to breed 5 litters of the same breed to qualify with the 12-5-4 process.
You may need to produce many litters in order to have 4 championship dogs.
Breeding dogs is a time intensive and costly process. You should expect to spend multiple years during this stage of the judge application process.

, Many organizations require that their judges have experience showing dogs that they have bred. Once you have your first litter and have registered them with the kennel club, you can begin to exhibit the dogs.


There are puppy divisions of dog shows that you can exhibit puppies at, or you can wait until the dogs are several months old so they can participate in different show categories.If you are unfamiliar with how to show your dog, you can attend a class taught by your kennel club or hire a professional handler to show your dog for you., Most organizations will require that you have bred several successful litters of purebred dogs in order to qualify to become a judge. Once you have begun the breeding process, you will need to repeat it until you have met organization requirements.

, This application should be completed and returned to your organization at the onset of your application process. It primarily signals your intent to become a dog show judge.Be prepared to share documentation during your initial application, such as proof that you have bred specific numbers of litters.
There are typically fees associated with your initial application, but these will range depending on your organization. For example, the AKC charges $30 USD initially. The United Kennel Club, another United States organization, charges $25 USD.This initial application will cover your basic background information and will ask questions about your breeding and dog show experience.

, Once you have submitted your initial judging application and the organization approves it, you can begin the organization-specific training to become a dog show judge.


Training may take place over weeks or months, be in person or online. It depends on your organization and the breed that you have selected to judge.
For organizations like the AKC, new breed judges are required to attend an institute before requesting regular (full) status as a judge, but no less than 2 years before submitting the initial application.
The Canine College is a great online source of information for aspiring dog judges and breed enthusiasts., If your organization requires, you may need to take and pass exams about breed standards, organization rules, dog anatomy, and the judging selection process.


For example, the United Kennel Club requires you to pass two written exams on breed standards and UKC rules.
You will need to commit to learning and studying the history of the breed, the exact breed standard, the judging process, your organization's rules, dog anatomy, and to be familiar with any changes in the dog show world.

, Some organizations require that you interview with evaluators in order to progress through the application process. These interviews may take place before or after you attend judge training.


These are often in person interviews where an evaluator will judge your knowledge on your selected breed. They may ask you to judge a few dogs to examine your judging process and to evaluate how accurate you are with conforming to breed standards.
Often, these evaluators act as liaisons between applicants and the organization., Once you have completed the necessary training, exams, and interviews that the organization requires, you can submit your final judge application.


Gather documentation that proves that you have completed the required steps, like training and exams, to submit along with your application.
The judge application will be similar to the first application that you submitted at the beginning of the process that signaled your intent to become a judge. It will be used by the judge selection committee to determine that you have met all of the organization’s requirements.
If your application is not accepted, you may be able to request an appeal from the judging committee. You can also wait and gain more experience before applying again., If your application has been approved, you will need to register with your organization as a new judge. This will establish you as a provisional judge that is able to begin judging at events.


Many organizations will publish the names and biographies of new judges, so dog show coordinators are aware that there are new judges available., For some organizations, like the American Kennel Club, you may need to judge a certain number of shows as a provisional judge before you can receive your regular judging status.


Once you have judged a certain number of events, the AKC requires you to judge 5 events, you can apply for full judging status.This is the final step in the application process. Once you have been accepted as a regular judge, you are now able to begin your career as an official dog show judge with your kennel club.

Enroll your dog in classes.,
Obtain a clicker.,
Find a partner.",How to Improve Your Dog's Show Ring Gait2," Once you know exactly how you want your dog’s show ring gait improved, you will be able to take corrective action. The best way to improve your dog’s show ring gait is to sign it up for classes. Contact your local kennel club about enrolling your dog in classes to improve show ring gait. If they don’t offer classes, ask a club representative if they know of a local trainer or club that does offer classes.If you continue to struggle trying to find classes for your dog, check online or use your yellow pages to find an instructor.

, A clicker is a small device, available at most pet stores, to help your dog associate good behavior with a reward. However, it is not necessary to use a clicker manufactured for the specific purpose of dog training. You could instead use a whistle, a bell, or any other noisemaker. The important thing is to keep the clicker or clicker substitute consistent throughout training, otherwise your dog could be confused., It is easier to engage in clicker training if you give your dog a treat while another person utilizes the clicker, or vice versa. Ask a family member or friend to help you improve your dog’s show ring gait. Alternately, locate someone else who is also interested in improving their dog’s show ring gait. That way, you and the other person can take turns helping each other improve your dogs’ show ring gaits.With a partner, one of you can stand in a central position observing from a distance with a clicker, while the other one can walk along the dog holding its leash and administering treats when as needed.
If you don’t want to work with a partner, just hold the clicker in one hand and the treats in your other hand.

"
"
Teach your dog to follow along your left side.,
Leash the dog.,
Correct your dog’s gait as you go.,
Repeat as needed.,
Keep your training sessions short.",How to Improve Your Dog's Show Ring Gait3," With your dog off-leash, hold a treat in your left hand. Look behind your left shoulder as you walk. When you see your dog following you, click and give it a treat. Ensure as you give it a treat that its head remains up and facing forward., Once your dog successfully learns to walk along your left side, and understands why it is being rewarded, put your dog on a leash. The leash should be held in such a way that it does not drag on the ground between you and your dog. Hold the clicker and leash in your left hand and the treats in your right. Continue the training as before, rewarding only proper form with treats and clicks., If your dog is trained incorrectly, it will only cause another problem that will require retraining later. If you notice your dog not perfectly adhering to your gait-correction training, take immediate action to correct it. For instance, if your dog is veering off course or running rather than walking, say “Oops!” or “Uh-oh!” in a friendly way. Return with the dog to your starting point and try again.Do not reward your dog for pulling or veering off course.

, Improving your dog’s show ring gait is a process. Your dog’s show ring gait will not improve with just one or two training sessions. For some dogs, improvement will take longer than it might for others. But for all dogs, you will need to invest a significant amount of time in the training process.Use random intervals between training sessions, otherwise your dog might come to associate performing an appropriate gait with a certain time (for instance, right when they wake up).
For instance, if you wish to teach your dog to keep its head up to improve its show ring gait, perform a head-up exercise with your dog, then again 15 minutes later, then again five minutes after that.

, Do not push yourself or your dog too hard when training. Working in sessions of five minutes or less several times per day should be sufficient to improve your dog’s show ring gait."

Being a dog show handler is about much more than showing dogs in the ring in front of judges. It's a job that means a lot of time on road and a lot of time on your feet. You will need excellent knowledge and enthusiasm for every aspect of showing and caring for pure breed dogs.


Once you have a good roster of clients you may be competing in 100 or 200 shows per year.Each show requires a great deal of preparation and organization to ensure all the dogs are in top shape.;
, Before you go about trying to develop a career as a dog show handler you need to evaluate your skills and weaknesses against the requirements for a successful handler. Remember you need to be able to work well with people as well as dogs, so strong interpersonal and communication skills are a must. You will be part of a team with the owners and the dogs, so you need to work well with other people.Being a handler can be a physically demanding job so you need to be in good shape and enjoy spending a lot of time outdoors, even if it's wet.
You have to be passionate about the presentation and grooming of the dog as well as its physical fitness., A great way to learn about how dogs are shown and try to pick up some expert knowledge is to spend lots of time watching professionals at as many dog shows as you can make it to. Arrive early and stay late to observe how the handlers work in and out of the ring, as well as how they conduct themselves around the show. Things such as dress and manner are important parts of showing dogs so the more exposure you have to that environment the better., To get to know more people interested in dog shows and become involved in your local dog community you should join your local kennel club. You will learn great tips from people with experience and knowledge as well learning when and where you can go to shows to develop your skills and watch other handlers.You can search for your local club through the American Kennel Club online, or just use a search engine.

, Starting up as a dog show handler is not a minor investment, so you should take some time to draw up some figures that detail the kind of costs you will face at the outset. It's good to do this early so you can begin saving up some money and looking out for good deals on key items while you go about developing your skills and making contacts. The kind of equipment you will need includes:


A good van or other vehicle suitable for transporting dogs.
Dog crates, crate fans, crate pads and cooling mats.
Grooming tables and professional standard grooming equipment such as scissors, dryers, combs, brushes and shampoos.
As you develop your business you will need to provide kennels and exercise space., The easiest way to get experience in handling and showing dogs is to practice with your own dog. If you don't have one, you will need to buy a registered purebred puppy that has a demonstrably good lineage from a good breeder if you want to show it. Having your own dog to work with will help you practice whenever you can to improve your handling and learn about showing dogs.


Start by enrolling your puppy in obedience classes with an experienced handler, and then progress to the presentation and grooming techniques needed for shows.Show your puppy at your local kennel club shows and pay attention to feedback and judging.

, A great way to learn about the job while gaining valuable skills, experience and contacts, is to get a job as a handler's assistant. Successful handlers who work with a number of dogs will often hire an assistant to take care of preparation work, grooming, conditioning and training. Working as an assistant will give you a much clearer picture of the day-to-day working life of a handler.If you develop a good relationship with the handler she could act as mentor and help you develop your own handling skills.
You can ask the handler for feedback and advice on your handling work.

, Another good way to get more practical experience with handling dogs is to participate in the American Kennel Club's Junior Showmanship classes and events at licensed dog shows.The classes are open to those between 9 and 18 years old and are divided into three age groups: junior, intermediate, and senior. The classes are also divided into novice and open classes. Once you have gained enough points, you can graduate into open classes.


These classes give you a good introduction to handling and experience of competition and judging.
You will also get to know other people your age interested dog handling and can share tips and experiences.
You must enter a dog that is eligible to compete in obedience trials or dog shows. The dog must belong to you, your family, or a member of your household.
Look up a local show near you and go to see how it all works before you join up., You do not require any official certification or training to become a dog handler.You can gain a lot of experience working as an assistant or participating in junior classes, but you should seek out professional instruction to hone your handling whenever possible. If you are working with a registered handler you can apply to the American Kennel Club's apprentice program.


This program gives you the chance to develop your skills in all aspects of dog handling and care.
This can be an accelerated route to the prestigious Registered Handler Program.The Professional Handlers Association also run a well-respected apprentice scheme., Once you have all the necessary skills to show dogs you need to work on developing your client base. Word of mouth and reputation are crucial in the dog show world, so begin to network at shows and events and raise your profile among owners and other handlers.Create a website and use social media to raise awareness of your business and attract new clients.
Doing well in competition is arguably the best way to raise your profile and gain clients.

, If you want to grow your business and take on multiple dogs who you will have to care for out of competition, you will need to develop a good setup of kennels, grooming and exercise space for all of the dogs you are working with.This can be expensive, but is essential if you want to increase the number of clients you have.


Boarding expenses will be charged to the client, so will need to understand the costs and make sure your prices are appropriate., Once you have gained significant experience as a handler, anywhere between five and ten years, you can go one step further and apply for official recognition of your status as an elite handler. You can apply for this with the American Kennel Club's Registered Handlers Program and the Professional Handlers Association. Having recognition from these two bodies with give you added prestige as a handler, and may enable you to charge a higher rate.The Registered Handlers Program requires seven years of experience, and you must sign a code of ethics.The Professional Handlers Association requires ten years of involvement with show dogs, including at least five as a handler., If you find that you are becoming a successful handler with a number of dogs and a hectic schedule of shows to attend, you might consider hiring an assistant to help with the grooming and preparation, or to assist with the administration and finances. If you started out as a handler's assistant it could be very satisfying to help the next generation of trainers to get started in the business and learn the ropes from you.

Buy a purebred puppy.,
Make sure your dog contributes to the breed standard.,
Learn the ins and outs of dog shows.,
Enter your dog into local a local conformation show.,
Aim for points.",How to Breed Show Dogs1," You should purchase a purebred puppy from a reputable, AKC-registered breeder. Note that a good breeder will ask you a lot of questions, and make the effort to ensure that their puppy is going to a suitable home. Make sure to:


visit the breeder
ask detailed questions
see the condition of the litter’s mother
request proof of health for mother and puppies
ask for references;
, An important part of show dog breeding is understanding breed standards, as established by the American Kennel Club. The true purpose of dog shows (also known as conformation shows) is to evaluate breeding stock. Dogs are judged based on established criteria for what is considered the best of the breed; to better understand the best attributes of your dog’s breed:attend dog shows
read books, articles, and other reputable source material about breed standards
look up your dog’s specific breed on the American Kennel Club’s website: www.akc.org

, Whether you learn by attending local dog shows, watching them on television, or reading about them, it is a good idea to get informed before you participate. Dog breeds are generally grouped into seven categories, based on the jobs they were initially bred for – “sporting,” “hounds,” “working,” “terrier,” “toy,” “non-sporting,” and “herding.” Show dogs are also grouped into different classes at shows – “puppy,” “twelve-to-eighteen months,” “novice,” “bred by exhibitor,” “American-bred,” and “open.” There are a series of different ribbons presented to participants that judges choose as the best of a class (e.g. a blue ribbon is awarded for first place in any regular class).Many AKC clubs offer conformation handling classes for owners wishing to show their dogs. The classes show owners how to present their purebred dog to judges at a conformation show. Local AKC clubs offering these courses will be listed on the American Kennel Club website.

, If your dog meets breed standards, is older than 6 months, and is not spayed or neutered, you can enter it into a conformation show. If you do not feel ready for this step yet, consider entering your dog into a match show first; match shows are informal shows where dogs and owners can socialize and get accustomed to the procedures for official conformation shows. Alternatively, you can hire a professional handler to present your dog to judges at the conformation show, for a fee that should be established upfront before the show.The American Kennel Club Registered Handlers Program promotes professional handlers who meet a specific criterion of responsibility and knowledge., Most dogs entered in conformation shows are competing for championship points, which are essentially credits earned towards championship status. Dog shows are essentially a process of elimination leading to one dog being named “Best in Show” at the end of it; other dogs are able to earn points along the way. Either way, you dog’s participation signals that it is an AKC-registered purebred, whose parents and ancestors are also purebred."

Don’t leave your pets’ food outside.,
Keep trash tightly bagged and canned.,
Plant marigolds.",How to Keep Stray Dogs Away from Backyard1," A sure way to attract stray dogs to your yard is to leave your own pets’ food outside where strays can smell and get to it. Most strays will be hungry and looking for food. If you feed your pets outside, make sure you bring leftover food in to the house once your pets are finished.;
, Strays might also look for food by digging through your trash. Bag all of the trash that you take outside and make sure your garbage cans’ lids are replaced tightly after you put bags of trash in them.


Garbage cans that have locking handles are probably your best bet, because they also prevent strays from trying to pop off garbage can lids that are less secure.

, Dogs dislike the smell of marigolds, so planting some in your yard or garden can encourage strays to stay away from your yard. Marigolds also repel certain types of bugs and pests, so planting them can pull the double duty of repelling stray dogs as well as other critters."
"
Find a mentor.,
Make sure the female is ready for breeding.,
Find a suitable stud.,
Ensure the dogs' health.,
Breed the dogs.",How to Breed Show Dogs2," Show dog breeding is a very precise tradition, and the people who participate tend to be very committed to it. Find a mentor who can show you the ropes, share their experiences, and walk you through the different aspects of breeding show dogs. People entering into this new world often find mentors in the breeders they buy their puppy from; good breeders look after their puppies well after their sale, which means that a long-term relationship with the puppy’s new owner is often developed., The best time for your female to start breeding is between her second heat cycle and the age of 7; because of health risks, dogs older than 7 should not be bred. The female will make it clear whether or not she’s ready for breeding by how she reacts to the male – if she is not ready, she will avoid him, and if she is ready, she will move her tail to the side to communicate her consent.

, Show dog breeding requires a general understanding of genetics and a desire to better the breed. You can search for studs in the classifieds of dog breeding magazines, online, or by putting up flyers in your area. Look for a stud that is certified healthy, and that offers genetic attributes that will complement your female. Work out a stud contract with the stud’s owner, outlining the details of breeding times, fees, payment, expectations, and guarantees., Both dogs should be tested for genetic disorders, parasites, and possible infections. The female should receive a full pre-breeding exam from a veterinarian about a month before breeding to ensure her health and readiness to breed. Both dogs should be up to date on their vaccinations., It is usually best to bring the female to the male for breeding, as females handle new environments better. Depending on your stud contract agreements, you can either bring the female for multiple visits, leave her in the custody of the stud owner for the duration of the breeding period, or stay with your dog throughout the process to observe. Though the process should come naturally to dogs, some assistance from the owners might be needed.For instance, dogs usually remain “tied” after mating, staying together for anywhere from 2-30 minutes. This process is integral to conception, but if your dog is new to breeding, it might get nervous and try to pull away. In this instance, stepping in to reassure your dog can rescue the breeding attempt.

Install a fence.,
Install a sonic dog repellent device.,
Set up a motion-activated sprayer.,
Spray the edge of your yard with vinegar.,
Sprinkle black pepper or cayenne pepper on your property.",How to Keep Stray Dogs Away from Backyard2," The best way to create a barrier to your yard is to put up a fence. Most strays won’t jump a fence to get into your yard (although some might) and it also prevents your own animals from getting loose or coming into contact with unknown animals. The size of your fence will depend a lot on the size of the strays wandering into your yard, as well as the size of your own animals.


If you’re not crazy about the idea of looking at a fence all day, or if it’s just simply not a financial possibility for you, you can also try liquid fence. Liquid fence is a spray that you can purchase for just over ten dollars at most home improvement stores. The scents in the spray repel dogs and can therefore create a barrier to your yard without the cost of installing an actual fence., A sonic repellent device works by emitting high-frequency sounds that dogs can hear but humans can’t. Some versions are motion activated so when a stray dog (or other animal) wanders into your yard, the device emits a sound that will drive the strays away.Keep in mind that this is not a good choice if you have dogs or other pets of your own. If you let them into the yard, they’ll set off the device and have to deal with those high-pitched sounds themselves.

, Like a motion-activated sonic device, a motion-activated sprayer will turn on when strays enter your yard. Spraying dogs with water is a eco-friendly option for keeping strays out of your yard.If you have pets (or kids) of your own, keep in mind that they’ll get sprayed, too, so you might want to try a different option if this is an issue for you.

, Dogs are repelled by the smell of vinegar, so spraying the edge of your yard with white or apple cider vinegar can help create a barrier that keeps strays out. Just pour some vinegar into a spray bottle and walk the perimeter of your yard, spraying the grass as you go.Keep in mind that depending on the size of your yard, you’ll be able to smell the vinegar after you spray it. You might not want to use this method right before you’re going to be using your yard.

, Sprinkling small amounts of black or cayenne pepper in your yard will make it less appealing to strays. Dogs use their keen sense of smell and taste to assess most situations. If they come across a patch of black or cayenne pepper, and either sniff or lick at it, they'll learn to stay away from your yard. Use very small amounts of pepper for this. However annoying strays are, you don’t want to cause permanent damage to them by leaving out huge mounds of pepper that can burn their noses or mouths.

"
"
Avoid confrontation.,
Call Animal Control or ASPCA.,
Use a trap.,
Call the dog’s owners.",How to Keep Stray Dogs Away from Backyard3," If a stray dog does get into your yard, avoid confronting it. Don’t try to chase it out of your yard on your own, and do not try to touch it. Strays are likely to carry diseases and can be more aggressive than domesticated dogs., If a stray does get into your yard, call your local animal shelter or police department’s animal control unit. Animal control officers and animal shelter employees are specially trained to deal with stray and/or aggressive animals. They can remove the stray from your yard without any injury to themselves or the strays.

, If Animal Control can’t get to your home right away, you can purchase a trap that you bait with food. If a stray wanders back into your yard, and ends up in the trap, you can keep the stray contained until an Animal Control officer or someone from an animal shelter can come get the stray.These traps are generally pretty humane and won’t injure the strays in any way.

, Sometimes strays aren’t homeless dogs at all – they’re just free-roaming dogs that might be owned by your neighbors. See if you can figure out who the owner is – you might be able to see the owner’s phone number on the dog’s collar or you might recognize the dog. Once you know who the dog belongs to, contact the owner and let them know that their dog is frequently in your yard and ask them if they can keep their pet better contained.

Monitor your dog’s pregnancy.,
Be present for the birth.,
Take care of your female.,
Monitor the puppies’ health.",How to Breed Show Dogs3," A veterinarian can confirm your dog’s pregnancy around day 28 of a typically 63-day gestation period. Your vet can advise you on breed-specific care for your pregnant dog. Start setting up a whelping box (i.e. a box for your dog to give birth in) a few weeks before the expected due date to ensure that your dog is comfortable with the spot. In general, make sure that your female remains comfortable and healthy during her gestation period., Approximately 24 hours before whelping begins, the female will begin to show symptoms – her temperature will drop and she will usually stop eating and drinking. When whelping begins, she will show signs of distress (e.g. whining, visible restlessness). While dogs are generally capable of giving birth without assistance, it is best if you are present to monitor the situation and call a veterinarian in case of emergencies., After whelping occurs, monitor your female closely. Make sure she receives adequate Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorous in order to avoid post-natal eclampsia. She will also need two or three times more food to provide sufficient nutrition for her puppies when nursing. Experts recommend giving the female a period of rest and regeneration instead of breeding her again at her next possible breeding cycle., You should check and weigh the litter every day to make sure they are healthy and developing properly. Keep the puppies warm (with a heating pad or heat lamp, if necessary) and make sure that they are nursing properly. Once the puppies are weaned, you will have to feed them and begin to socialize them."
"
Register the litter.,
Screen potential owners.,
Encourage new owners to register with the AKC.",How to Breed Show Dogs4," A few days after whelping, you should register your litter with the American Kennel Club. This will allow you to provide new owners you buy your puppies with a registration application, and establish you as a responsible breeder. You can register your litter online at http://www.akc.org/register/?pre=breeder&activity=litter, or print out a form and mail it in., An integral part of breeding puppies is finding good owners for them by interviewing potential buyers and choosing the right person, or family, to give one of your puppies a good home. Look for people who are knowledgeable about your dogs’ breed, and who have the time and means to provide a dog with the best care possible. An ideal candidate would be someone who is passionate enough about the breed to participate in dog shows, allowing one of your puppies to reach its full, show dog potential. Screen potential owners with questions like:


”Why did you choose this specific breed of dog?”
”Who will be the dog’s primary caretaker?
”How much time can you devote to exercise, obedience training, and feeding a dog?”

, Convincing your puppies’ buyers to register them with the AKC is a step towards ensuring that your litter grow into show dogs. While the AKC funds many initiatives devoted to canine health, safety, and rescue, it also sanctions more than 20,000 competitive dog events each year. Dog shows shows can be a fun, educational experience for pets and owners alike, but a dog must be registered with the AKC to participate.

Observe your dog while he is in the yard.,
See if your dog is jumping the fence.,
Watch to see if your dog climbs up the fence.,
Determine if your dog is digging his way out.,
Watch for other methods of escape.,
Inspect your fence often and make repairs as needed.",How to Keep a Dog in the Yard1," Figure out how your dog is getting out of your yard, sit by a window and watch him while he is outside. Try not to let him see you or he may not reveal his escape route. As you watch, pay attention to where your dog goes and what he does. This should give you clues about his preferred method of escape.Common methods of escape include:


Jumping over the fence.
Climbing the fence.
Digging and going under the fence.
Slipping through a weak spot in the fence.
Undoing the latch on the fence gate.;
, If the fence is too low or there is an object the dog can climb on, he may be able to jump over the fence. In this case, try raising the height of the entire fence. Make sure that you also remove anything that he can use to climb over the fence, such as lawn chairs and tables.

, Some dogs will climb a fence to get out of a yard. If your dog is climbing the fence, then making the fence higher might not solve the problem. You may also need to create and internal overhang to stop your dog from going over when he gets to the top. These overhangs are similar to the ones you see in zoo enclosures., Some dogs will dig away the soft dirt at the bottom of a fence and escape that way.If your dog is digging his way out, then there are several things that you can do to stop him from escaping from the yard. Some thing you can try include:Laying chain link fence over the ground at the base of the fence.
Setting large heavy rocks or bricks along the base of the fence.
Extending the fence downwards with chicken wire that is buried under the ground. If you use this method, make sure to turn under any sharp edges so your dog cannot cut or harm himself as he digs.

, Make sure that the gate is shut and latched before you let your dog out into the yard. Remind all of your household members to do the same. If the latch is weak and your dog can push it open with ease, then consider installing a new latch.


Some dogs know how to undo the latch on a gate and can let themselves out when they please. If your dog is using this method of escape, then you can add a padlock to the gate or put something on the other side of it to prevent her from opening it.

, To ensure that your yard is secure, check it often and look for weaknesses such as rotten wooden slats or gaps in the wire mesh.


Check for loose boards as well by pressing on the fence as you walk the perimeter. If you notice any weaknesses, then repair these right away.

"

Consider adding an airlock.,
Keep your dog on leash or lead.,
Look into an electric fence.",How to Keep a Dog in the Yard2," Many dog parks and pet care facilities have an air lock, or second gate that dogs must get through before they can get out. This ensures that a dog cannot take off running if he happens to make it through the first gate.If your dog tends to unlatch or push open one of your gates, then you may want to install a small portion of fencing and a second gate so that you can stop him and bring him back into the yard if he get out of the first gate.

, If your yard is not fenced in, then take your dog out on a leash or put her on a lead when she is out in the yard. Some people attach leads to lines that extend the length of the yard so that the dog can run. No matter how you keep your dog in the yard, make sure that you monitor your dog and do not leave her out for too long.


If you have a big dog that tends to pull on her leash, then try using a front-clip harness to help you maintain control of her. Front-clip harnesses help to keep your dog focused on you and stops her from pulling.

, Some people use electric shock collars with an invisible fence system to prevent their dogs from going beyond the yard's boundaries. These collars work by emitting a sound and then delivering a shock if your dog goes beyond a certain point in your yard. The shock levels range from a mild sensation that is similar to a tickle to a painful jolt.There are moral and welfare issues to consider before using an electric fence. Used incorrectly, they can cause the dog to be unduly fearful and/or cause physical harm to the dog. Also, a court of law does not regard an electric fence as a suitable barrier, and if your dog bites a person who comes onto your property or escapes off it, you will be held culpable because there wasn't an adequate barrier in place.


An electric shock collar might be a good option if you do not have a fence.
Never use an electric shock collar as a training device.
Check your dog's neck often if you use an electric shock collar. They can cause redness and irritation.

Spay or neuter your dog.,
Exercise your dog every day.,
Provide lots of mental stimulation.,
Supervise your dog at all times when she is outside.,
Train your dog.,
Create a safe space for your dog.",How to Keep a Dog in the Yard3," Entire dogs (dogs that have not been spayed or neutered) are at the mercy of their hormones. Entire male dogs have high levels of testosterone and this makes them keen to find a female dog in heat and mate with her. Male dogs can detect this scent from miles away and may escape to seek out the scent.Female dogs may also be more likely to wander when they are in heat.


Talk to your dog’s veterinarian about spaying or neutering your dog.
Spay or neuter your dog at a young age to prevent behaviors from becoming too ingrained in your dog., Healthy dogs that do not get enough exercise may put their energy into things like escaping from the yard.Try to take your dog out for two 30 minute walks per day.


If you get tired before your dog does, then consider teaching her to fetch a ball or play frisbee. That way she will get plenty of exercise and you can just sit and throw the ball or frisbee to her.

, Being shut in a yard for long periods of time can cause your dog to become bored and make him want to escape. To keep your dog mentally stimulated, vary his toys and give him toys that will challenge his mind.


Change out his toys every day so that he doesn't become too familiar with his toys and become bored with them.
You can also try giving your dog toys that have treats inside, such as a stuffed Kong toy. This will give him a mental challenge and he will be rewarded with a treat when he figures it out.

, If your dog is an escape artist, then you will need to keep a close watch on her at all times. When you cannot watch her, keep her inside the house.


If you are often gone for long periods of time, such as while you are at work or out shopping, consider hiring a dog walker to come by and check on your dog or take her for a walk.

, Regular training sessions can also help you to keep your dog mentally stimulated and make it more likely that she will respond to your commands if you catch her in the act of escaping.


Keep training session short and regular. Two five to 10 minute sessions per day is a good place to start.
Use positive reinforcement. Give your dog treats and praise when she responds to a command. Do not punish your dog if she disobeys you.
Start with basic commands. After your dog has a good grasp of sit, stay, and recall, then you can start teaching her more complex commands such as “come away.”

, Some dogs will try to escape if they become fearful. For example, if your dog hears a sound that makes him anxious, then he might flee from the yard in fear. If this happens often, then give your dog a safe place to hide when he feels scared.


Try providing your dog with an outdoor crate or kennel, or give your dog access to the indoors via a doggy door."

After identifying the hazards, you can make a plan for keeping your blind dog safe.Potential hazards include:


Sharp furniture edges
Sharp corners
Stairs
Slippery floors;
, Your dog has gotten used to your furniture being arranged in a certain way. Now that your dog is blind, prevent it from bumping into furniture and possibly injuring itself by keeping the furniture arrangement the same.Despite being blind, your dog will be able to navigate around the furniture amazingly well.


If possible, avoid purchasing new furniture. This may confuse your dog and cause it to feel lost or disoriented in your home.

, When your dog could see, it could easily avoid items in its path. Now that your dog has lost its vision, it may step on these items and injure itself. To keep your dog safe, clear the walkways of anything your dog could step on, including toys, shoes, and boxes.Keeping the walkways clear will be very important if you have young children. Their toys could cause injury if your dog steps on, or trips over, them.

, Furniture such as coffee tables and TV stands can have sharp edges that could hurt your dog. Rather than move the furniture, cover up the sharp edges with a few layers of bubble wrap.Secure the bubble wrap with tape to keep it from sliding or slipping off the edges.

, Stairs can be very dangerous for blind dogs. When your dog begins adjusting to being blind, block access to your stairs by placing baby gates at the bottom and top of the stairs.As your dog navigates your home more easily, remove the gates and closely supervise your dog as it uses the stairs., Non-slip strips will help your dog safely move up and down the stairs.When your blind dog can move more safely around your home, purchase these strips at your local home improvement store. Position the strips along the length of each stair.


Cut the strips if they are too long for your stairs.
Continue to supervise your dog when it is using the stairs.

, When a dog becomes blind, its sense of smell increases. To alert your dog to unsafe areas, such as stairs, spray this area with a certain scent (scented oil, perfume).When your dog recognizes the scent, it will know to be more cautious in that area.


To help your dog associate the scent with possible danger, consider guiding your dog to that danger area and letting it sniff the scent.

, In addition to using smell, your blind dog can use touch to help it safely navigate your home. Put floor mats at the top and bottom of your home’s stairs.If you have hardwood floors, place carpet runners on the floor to keep your dog from slipping.Carpet runners are available at home improvement stores.
Consider putting real or artificial plants in dangerous areas.When your dog brushes by the plant, it will know it's in a dangerous area.

Created textured pathways.,
Block access to large water sources.,
Trim long branches.,
Walk your dog with a leash or harness.,
Put an ‘I’m Blind’ bandana on your dog.",How to Keep a Blind Dog Safe2," Your blind dog will need to be safe when it is outside. Textured walkways can alert your dog to dangerous areas. For example, if you have a tree with long branches or bushes with thorns, create a pebbled walkway in these areas. Other materials to use for textured pathways include mulch and sand.If you have steps from your front or back doors, place floor mats at the bottom and top of the stairs for your dog. Putting non-slip strips on the stairs would also be a good idea.

, A pool or fishing pond are major safety hazards for a blind dog. The dog could fall into the water and not know how to get back out. If you have a pool or fishing pond, put a fence around that area.If you are unable to make the fence yourself, consider hiring a company that can install the fence for you.

, Branches at your dog’s eye level could injure your dog’s eyes or scratch its skin. Identify and trim back any branches that could injure your dog., Although your blind dog can learn to navigate its environment pretty well, walking your dog on a leash or harness is essential to keeping it safe when it’s outside.If you use a leash, use a short leash to prevent your dog from tripping over it.A harness will put less pressure on your dog’s neck., When your dog is blind, it will not be able to pick up on another dog’s body language.This could be dangerous if the other dog becomes aggressive (showing teeth, lunging).When you walk your dog, put an ‘I’m blind’ bandana around its neck so other dog owners will know your dog is blind."
"
Use keywords.,
Be patient with your dog.,
Interact with your dog as if it wasn’t blind.",How to Keep a Blind Dog Safe3," Whether your dog is outside or inside, use certain keywords to let it know when it’s near something dangerous. For example, say ‘watch’ when your dog is near a set of stairs or a body of water.If you’re comfortable with your dog using the stairs, use ‘step up’ and ‘step down’ to guide it on each stair.Consider using specific keywords, such as ‘tree,’ ‘pool,’ or ‘stairs’ to alert your dog to certain dangerous areas.
Help your dog learn the keywords. For example, say ‘tree’ when your dog is near a tree. Reward your dog when it stops moving and doesn’t move any closer to the tree.

, It may take your dog up to several months to adjust to being blind.During this time, it may occasionally bump into furniture or stumble on the stairs. As your dog adjusts to its blindness, be patient and make your home as safe as you can for your dog.

, Blindness in dogs can be distressing for dog owners. Unfortunately, if you feel stressed or anxious about the blindness, your dog will pick up on those negative emotions.Stay positive and upbeat with your dog, as if it wasn’t blind, so it can more easily adjust to its vision loss.

Put a collar and tag on your dog.,
Make sure your yard is completely fenced.,
Keep the dog on leash outside.",How to Keep a Deaf Dog Safe1," A collar and tag can help you get your dog back if it accidentally gets loose. The tag should have the dog's name and your contact info on it, but it should also state that the dog is deaf.Stating that the dog is deaf on the collar tag will allow anyone that finds your dog to better understand your dog and the situation. Having your dog microchipped with your contact information is a smart idea.;
, Your dog should only be allowed off leash in a completely enclosed area. Unlike with a well-trained hearing dog, even with a well-trained deaf dog it can be hard to get it to come back if it gets loose. This is simply because it cannot hear auditory commands.Even in an enclosed yard consider putting a bell on your dog. Putting a bell on your dog will allow you to keep tabs on it in the event that it gets loose. Using an invisible fence system with a vibrating collar is a humane and sensitive way to help your dog understand the boundaries of the yard.

, In general, it's not a good idea to let a deaf dog off leash in an unenclosed area. Even if the dog is well trained, it will not be able to hear you if you call for it. In addition, it will not be able to hear possible hazards, such as cars, coming towards it.There are some owners of deaf dogs that do let their dogs off leash eventually, once the dogs are highly trained and behave reliably. If you feel comfortable doing this, it is advisable to keep the dog within your eyesight at all times.

Store the kids’ toys out of your dog’s reach.,
Do not give your dog the kids’ old toys.,
Create separate play areas for your kids and your dog.",How to Keep Kids’ Toys Away from Dogs1," Kids’ toys are a favorite target for dogs. If you don’t want your dog playing with your kids’ toys, store them in an area where your dog can’t get to them.For example, place the toys in a storage bin in a closet. You could also place them on a shelf that your dog would not be able to reach.


Wherever you store the toys, make sure your kids can still find and access them.;
, When your kids have outgrown their toys, you may be tempted to give your dog those toys. However, this could be a problem if your dog is possessive with toys. If your kid wants the toy back, your dog could show aggressive behavior (growling, baring teeth, biting) when your kid reaches for the toy.The aggressive behavior is a sign of ‘resource guarding.' Your dog would consider the toy as its precious resource that shouldn't be taken away.Rather than giving your dog the kids’ old toys, donate them if they are in good shape. Discard them if they are worn or damaged.
Your dog and your kids should have their own sets of toys.

, If your kids play with their toys around your dog, your dog may try to take the toys away from your kids. To prevent this from happening, have your kids play in a separate room from your dog. When your kids are finished playing, have them put up their toys so your dog cannot get to the toys.


If your dog and kids are in the same room, consider telling your dog to lie down and stay in an area of the room away from your kids.
You could also put up a baby gate to separate your dog from your kids as they play."

Select a non-busy appointment time.,
Get your dog comfortable with car travel.,
Take your dog for a walk.,
Check the waiting room before entering.,
Muzzle your dog.,
Sit away from other dogs.,
Keep a firm, close hold on your dog’s leash.,
Turn your dog toward you.,
Block physical contact between your dog and other dogs.,
Keep your dog busy.,
Exit your vet’s office safely.,
Do not let your puppy walk outside.,
Carry your small dog or puppy in a crate.,
Wait with your dog outside.",How to Keep Your Dog and Other Dogs Safe at the Vet," At your vet’s office, there may be certain days, or certain times of day, that are very busy. If your dog’s appointment is at a busy time, your dog may be in the waiting room with a lot of other dogs, which could present a safety issue. By making an appointment for a slower time of day, your dog would be around fewer dogs.


When you call to make your appointment, ask the receptionist when the office is not very busy.
A non-busy time would also allow you to get in and out of your vet’s office more quickly.If you have a puppy, try to schedule the appointment for the first part of the day, when the floor and other surfaces will be the most clean.This will protect your puppy’s immune system, especially if your puppy has not yet received all of its vaccinations.;
, A car ride can be an anxious time for your dog, especially if your dog associates car rides with only vet visits. To help your dog feel less anxious in the car, go for car rides for other activities, like running errands or going to the dog park. When your dog starts enjoying car rides, the rides to the vet's office won't be so anxiety-inducing for your dog.


If your dog gets sick or anxious in the car, talk to your vet. Medications are available to reduce anxiety and prevent car sickness in dogs.Transporting your dog in a crate could make car rides easier and calmer for your dog. Put your dog’s favorite blanket and toys in the crate to keep your dog busy and calm during the ride.

, If your dog gets anxious before vet visits, take it for a walk, either before leaving home or once you arrive at the vet’s office. A walk will help your dog release some nervous energy and be more calm.If you choose to wait outside before your appointment, use this time to walk your dog.

, When you arrive at the vet’s office, keep your dog in the car and briefly walk into the waiting room. If you see a lot of other dogs in the waiting room, consider waiting outside until your appointment time. You could have the receptionist call you to let you know when the vet is ready to see your dog.By waiting outside, you would keep your dog safe from other dogs that may be aggressive or otherwise not behaving well.

, If your dog is aggressive towards other dogs, putting a muzzle on your dog before entering the waiting room would be a good idea. Temporary use of a muzzle would help keep your dog and other dogs safe. The Baskerville (basket) muzzle is the most comfortable, since its design makes it easy for dogs to breathe.Soft muzzles, which are made of nylon, fabric, or leather, are also available. However, they are less comfortable than basket muzzles and make it difficult for a dog to pant.Talk to your vet if you are not sure which type of muzzle would be best for your dog.

Train your dog to wear a muzzle before the vet visit. This way, by the time you will actually need to use it at the vet’s office, your dog will already be comfortable with it.

, When you enter the waiting room, choose a seat away from other dogs.The more distance you can put between your dog and other dogs, the safer each dog will be. Be aware that, if the waiting room is small, you may have to sit closer to other dogs.

, The waiting room of a vet’s office is not the place to let your dog roam around. While you wait for your appointment, shorten the lead on your dog’s leash so your dog stays close to you at all times. This will help you keep better control of your dog.If you have a retractable leash, lock the leash into a short position before entering the waiting room.
If other dog owners are not keeping close holds on their dogs, these dogs may approach your dog. This encounter could be a safety issue. Try to distance yourself from dogs who are not staying close to their owners.

, After you have chosen a seat, position your dog so that its face is toward you. This will prevent your dog from making eye contact with other dogs.This eye contact could indicate the start of aggressive behavior, which would make your dog and the other dogs less safe.

, This will be important if the waiting room is small and/or already full with other dogs and dog owners. To block contact, try to keep part of your body between your dog and another dog.If this is not possible, it may be better to wait outside or stand away from the other dogs.

, With your dog facing you, keep your dog’s focus on you rather than on other dogs. Practice different commands, such as sit and lie down. Reward your dog after it follows each command.The commands and treats will keep your dog happily occupied until it’s time for the appointment.


Along with treats, give your dog lots of verbal praise for focusing on you and following commands.Speak in a soft, calm voice so you do not excite or agitate other dogs in the waiting room.
You could also pet your dog while it is facing you.

, Even if the waiting room is not busy before your appointment, it could be full of dogs afterwards. At the end of your dog’s exam, check the waiting room (or ask the staff to do so). If the waiting room is busy, consider waiting in the exam room until your dog’s medications are ready and the bill is finalized. The less time you spend in the waiting room after the appointment, the safer your dog and other dogs will be., If your puppy is not fully vaccinated, it could pick up diseases from walking where other dogs have urinated and defecated outside the vet’s office.Rather than let your puppy sniff around outside, take your puppy directly into the waiting room.


Since puppies need to empty their bladders frequently, take your puppy outside right before you leave for the vet’s office.
If you have an older dog that is sick, do not let it sniff around outside. An older dog’s immune system may be very weak, increasing the likelihood of illness.

, Holding your dog in your arms is not recommended, since it could bite or scratch you if it becomes agitated. If your dog is small, keep it in a crate until you are in the exam room. This will keep your dog safe from other dogs.In addition, staying in the crate will help shield your dog from diseases that other dogs may have.

, Some dog diseases, such as canine distemper, can be spread when a dog coughs infected particles into the air. If your dog is coughing, it may be best to wait with your dog outside until it is time for the appointment. This will help prevent the spread of disease from your dog to other dogs.


Other highly contagious diseases in dogs are the canine flu and parvovirus. Canine flu is spread through respiratory secretions (coughs, sneezes) and contaminated surfaces. Parvovirus can be spread through direct contact with an infected dog and contaminated feces.If your dog is seriously ill, the receptionist may suggest that you wait with your dog outside to prevent the possible spread of disease.

Eliminate hazards.,
Learn how to interact with the dog.,
Learn how to get the dog's attention.,
Consider using a vibrating collar.",How to Keep a Deaf Dog Safe2," There are many hazards to deaf dogs outdoors. However, there are also some hazards to them inside their own homes. Above all, keep all items that your dog may be attracted to but that are not good for it out of reach. This includes cleaning chemicals and foods that are toxic to dogs, among other things.


You may not be able to get a deaf dog to stop bad behavior as quickly as you can get a hearing dog to stop. This means that if you see your deaf dog eating something it shouldn't, for example, you may need to physically remove the item from your dog instead of being able to give it a verbal command to let the item go.

, Deaf dogs can become snappy and defensive if they are startled and are not trained to be used to unexpected touch. Because of this, you need to interact with them differently than you would with a hearing dog. You will need to use vibration, movement, and light to communicate with the dog.For example, in order to wake your dog up, try standing nearby and allowing the dog to smell you before you touch it. If that doesn't work, you should make vibrations on the floor near it. Never touch it unexpectedly in a sensitive area.
Create your own sign language system and teach it to your dog. Even if you only have a sign for sit, stay, and lay down, it will make communication and interaction easier with your dog.
Also work on desensitizing the dog to unexpected touch. Train it, as you would train a dog to sit, to have a positive response to gentle touch. Do very light touch on the shoulders or back and when the dog responds positively, give it a treat. With repeated exposure to positive outcomes from unexpected light touch, the dog should adjust to it.

, Keeping your dog safe requires that you are able to get its attention. You even need to learn how to get the dog's attention when it doesn't know you are nearby or when it is sleeping. This can be done in a variety of ways with a deaf dog:The easiest way to get a deaf dog's attention is to wait until it looks at you and then signal for it to come to you.
Make vibrations on the floor that the dog can feel. This is easily done by stomping on the floor.
If you are in a dark space, you can use light to get your dog's attention.

, Part of keeping a deaf dog safe is the ability to get its attention. If you have not been able to train the dog sufficiently to check in with you and you have not been able to get the dog's attention in other ways, then a vibrating collar may be called for.A vibrating collar usually has two different functions. One is that it will make an auditory sound. This will allow you to find your dog. The other is a vibration, which is designed to get your dog's attention.
A vibrating collar is not a substitute for thorough training. In fact, your dog will need basic training for a dog to understand that a vibrating collar signals that it should come to you.
The feeling created by a vibrating collar is not painful but not particularly pleasant. It is not as strong as a shock collar but it does sometimes irritate dogs. Because of this, it is better to train your dog in other ways so that you can get its attention instead of using this collar. There are also collars that release a spritz of citronella, which many dogs find unpleasant, as a painless training aid. This may be an option to consider, as well.

Make sure your dog’s vaccinations are up to date.,
Supervise your dog while it’s outside.,
Keep your yard clean.,
Be on the lookout for stray animals and report them to animal control.,
Make a pet first aid kit.",How to Keep Your Dog Safe from Wild Animals1," Get your dog vaccinated against rabies and talk to its vet about any other inoculations mandated by your local laws. Many pet owners are most concerned about potential injuries that can result from a fight or attack. However, the most dangerous threat a wild animal poses is disease.Take your dog to the vet at least once a year to make sure its vaccinations are up to date.;
, Try not to leave your dog out in the yard unattended for long periods of time. Be especially cautious if you live in a wooded area and have a smaller dog that might be an easier target for predators. In addition, pet experts generally recommend against leaving a dog chained in the yard for long periods of time.Leaving a dog unsupervised outside can lead to excessive barking, digging, potentially dangerous escape attempts, and other anxiety-related behavioral issues.

, Avoid leaving your dog’s food and water outside, since it can attract wild animals like raccoons, rats, and coyotes. Clean up after your dog when it goes to the bathroom, as excrement can attract stray dogs and other unwanted wild intruders.Clean up any debris in your yard that might offer wild animals hiding spots. If you have a small dog, take extra precautions if you live in an area populated by owls, large hawks, and other sizeable birds of prey. Avoid leaving your dog unsupervised and remove excessive plant matter and other potential nesting materials from your yard., Stray dogs and cats, as well as wild animals like raccoons, skunks, and foxes, can all spread rabies. Pay attention for signs of rabies in any stray animals you might come across, including aggressiveness, foaming at the mouth, and erratic movements. Call your local animal control officer if you notice stray animals, especially if they exhibit symptoms of rabies.If you see a coyote in your area, it’s important to keep them from becoming comfortable around people. Predators like coyotes and foxes are more dangerous when they’re not afraid of people and pets. Use coyote hazing techniques to scare them off: stand tall, stomp, shout, spray it with a garden hose, bang objects together, or throw rocks toward (not at) the coyote., Include gauze, tweezers, non-latex gloves, and saline solution in your kit. Keep a muzzle on hand, as an injured dog can be confused and dangerous for you and others nearby.In addition to these animal attack-specific items, keep copies of your dog’s medical records, including proof of rabies vaccination, and important contact info, like your vet’s number, a local emergency vet clinic, and the ASPCA poison control center: (800) 426‑4435.Keep the kit in a easily accessible place while at home, and take it with you if you go on trips with your dog.

Discipline your dog in the moment.,
Command your dog to drop the toy.,
Avoid using ineffective discipline strategies.",How to Keep Kids’ Toys Away from Dogs2," You will need to discipline your dog if it takes your kids’ toys. When you discipline your dog is important, though—do so only if you actually see your dog take the toy. If you discipline your dog after the fact, your dog will not understand why it’s in trouble. Instead, your dog will become fearful of you or maybe even aggressive towards you.It may be challenging to catch your dog in the act., The ‘drop it’ command teaches a dog to drop whatever it has in its mouth. If you see your dog putting one of your kids’ toys in its mouth, tell your dog to drop it. Reward your dog with a treat when it drops the toy. By rewarding your dog, you are making a positive association with dropping the toy.


When your dog drops the toy, you can also reward your dog with one of its own toys. This will help your dog learn the difference between its toys and your kids’ toys.
If you’re lucky enough to see your dog walking towards one of your kids’ toys, you can command your dog to leave the toy where it is. The ‘leave it’ command teaches a dog not to put something inappropriate in its mouth.

, If your dog routinely gets into your kids’ toys, you may be so upset with this behavior that you shout at your dog. However, shouting at your dog will not stop the behavior (even if you catch your dog in the act). Rather, it will make your dog fearful or wary of you.


Also, do not chase your dog if it has one of your kids’ toys in its mouth. Chasing will feel like a game to your dog, so it will actually enjoy the chase."
"
Give your dog its own toys.,
Rotate the toys out regularly.,
Do not let your kids take your dog’s toys.",How to Keep Kids’ Toys Away from Dogs3," When your dog is busy with its own toys, it may be less likely to take your kids’ toys. Many types of toys are available for dogs, such as puzzle toys, chew toys, soft plush toys, and nylon bones.You could even turn dirty laundry (pillowcases, t-shirts, towel) into toys, since your dog would enjoy smelling your scent on the item.Interactive toys, such as a rope toys, could also be a good toy type for your dog.Interactive toys would allow you and your dog to spend quality time together.
If your dog is particularly destructive, choose toys that are durable, such as nylon bones.
Do not choose toys that have easily removable parts, like string or plastic eyes. Your dog could swallow these parts, causing a potentially serious medical problem., Even if your dog has a basket full of toys, it may get bored with them if they’re out all the time. To keep your dog interested in the toys, leave out only a few at a time and rotate them about once a week. If your dog has a favorite toy, though, consider leaving that one out all the time.Replace toys when they are worn and damaged.

, If you have young kids, they may not understand that they should not grab your dog’s toys.Explain to your kids they should not grab the dog’s toys, just like the dog should not grab their toys."
"
Put up a fence.,
Use plant barriers.,
Create a barrier using gravel or mulch.",How to Keep Dogs Out of Gardens1," Perhaps the most obvious way to keep dogs out of your garden is to put up a fence. You can pay to have a fence installed professionally (which can be expensive), or consider erecting one yourself. You may choose a fence made from wood, wire, or mesh, which can all be found at your local home repair store.For small dogs, a 16” fence should be adequate.
For large dogs, you may need a taller fence or a fence with a top-enclosure.;
, If you don’t find a traditional fence aesthetically pleasing, you can use plants to form a barrier around your garden. Tall, sturdy plants or shrubs are your best bet for this purpose. Although thorny or prickly plants can deter dogs, they may also cause some injury.You might consider:


Tall sturdy plants, such as peony, cone flower, verbena, Russian sage, Mexican primrose, and black eyed Susans.
Shrubs, like evergreen, laurel, escallonia, and huckleberry.

, Dogs dislike the texture of gravel and mulch against their paws. So, another option is to create a mote-like barrier around your garden using these substances.Mulch is available at most hardware stores. Mulches made from pinecones or needles are good options. You do not want “dog-friendly” mulch for this purpose!
Gravel is available at many hardware stores and greenhouses. Select rocks with rough edges to best deter dogs.

Keep your dog on a leash.,
Never let your dog interact with wild animals of any species.,
Carry a walking stick or noise making device.",How to Keep Your Dog Safe from Wild Animals2," Avoid letting your dog off its leash unless you’ve taken it to a dog park or other safe, fenced area. Never assume that your dog will listen to vocal commands when off its leash. Remember that the lease is an important means of training your dog and maintaining your status as alpha., When you walk your dog, always keep an eye on whatever it’s sniffing or trying to investigate. Do your best to keep it out of holes or enclosures that resemble burrows or dens of any kind. In addition to preventing a chance encounter with a venomous snake, you’ll keep your dog from attacking a rodent or other small animals.Attacking a small animal presents the risk of disease and will disrupt your dog’s obedience training.

, If you live in a wooded location, or are aware of coyotes, foxes, or other potentially dangerous wild animals in your area, prepare yourself for an encounter ahead of time. You can bang a walking stick on the ground or throw it in the direction of the animal to scare it off.Noisemakers like whistles, air horns, and bells are also useful for scaring away potentially dangerous animals.Hold your large dog’s leash tightly or pick up your small dog if you see a wild animal.
Remember, never turn your back on a coyote, fox, wolf, or other wild animal. Turning your back will encourage them to chase.

"
Talk to a vet about risks specific to your camping spot.,
Double down on precautions you’d normally take at home.,
Make yourself appear big and loud if you encounter a wild animal.",How to Keep Your Dog Safe from Wild Animals3," Give your vet a call and tell them about your outdoor plans. Ask if they’re familiar with flea, tick, heartworm, and other health risks associated with your camping or hiking location. If the location is far away or your regular vet is otherwise unfamiliar, consider getting in touch with one located near your camping or hiking spot.Apply parasite preventatives and any other vet-recommended medications before heading out on your trip.

, While camping or hiking with your dog, try to be even more thorough about all routine safety precautions. Keep your dog leashed, supervised, and don’t let it chase or otherwise interact with any animals you encounter.Keep your campsite clean: keep all human and pet food in wildlife-proof containers, don’t leave water out, and clean up after your dog when it goes to the bathroom.
Bring wildlife hazing items, such as an air horn or other noisemaker.

, You’re more likely to meet a larger predator, such as a wolf or bear, when camping or hiking than on a walk through your neighborhood. Remember to secure your large dog’s leash or slowly pick up and hold your small dog in your arms. Make yourself appear as large as possible by standing tall and, if you have a free arm, raising it above your head.Use your noisemaker to scare it away or shout, “Hey! Go Away!”
Consider bringing bear or pepper spray with you.
Dangerous encounters with larger predators are fairly rare, so you shouldn’t worry or let the possibility keep you from doing a fun outdoor activity with your pet. However, it’s still best to be aware of both encounters with dangerous wild animals and risks like parasites or diseases when camping and hiking with your pet."

Spray vinegar or apple bitter on vegetables.,
Sprinkle some spices.,
Place potatoes or orange peels around the garden.",How to Keep Dogs Out of Gardens2," Pungent odors like white vinegar or apple bitter have been shown to repel dogs and other creatures, but these stinky liquids are perfectly safe for vegetables and plants. Fill a spray bottle with white vinegar or apple bitter and give your garden a spray after watering.White vinegar is available at most grocery stores.
Apple bitter is available at most pet stores.

, Strong smelling herbs and spices are unattractive to dogs. You can keep dogs out of your garden by sprinkling spices around the perimeter. Place 1 tsp of powdered spices for every square foot of your garden. Repeat after heavy watering or rain.Try mustard powder, red pepper flakes, or a mixture of both.
Avoid cayenne pepper, as this can injure a dog’s sensitive feet.
Experiment with any spices (excluding cayenne) that you have at home.
Spices can be purchased at most grocery stores.

, Certain food items—such as semi-rotten potatoes and orange peels—are repulsive to dogs. By placing these foods around your garden, you can effectively deter dogs from entering the space. Use the peal of one orange and/or one semi-rotten potato for every 2 square feet of your garden. Replace these when have visible rotted away.Shred orange peels into chunks or slices, and sprinkle these around your garden.
Leave potatoes in your pantry for approximately three weeks, then place whole potatoes around your garden.

Figure out how you want to restrain your dog in the car.,
Introduce your dog to the crate, if you are using one.,
Exercise your dog before loading it into the car.,
Avoid feeding your dog right before your trip.,
Pack appropriate supplies for your dog when taking a long car trip.,
Place a few chew toys in the back with your dog to keep your dog occupied.,
Consult your veterinarian if your dog shows signs of car sickness.,
Address hyperactivity before the trip.,
Let a puppy or new pet become accustomed to riding in a car gradually.Begin by allowing your dog to wander around your car with the motor off.,
Make your first few trips in the car to somewhere fun for your dog.,
Keep your dog's tags on whenever you are driving long distance.,
Take breaks.,
Don't leave your dog in a parked car on a hot day.,
Avoid comforting your dog if he or she is showing signs of distress.,
Reward your dog once you get to your destination.",How to Travel by Car with Your Dog," It is not safe to let a dog roam a car unrestrained. Consider crating your dog if you are driving a long distance or if your dog is a nervous passenger. It is the most effective way of keeping a dog put while you are driving. Having a dog crated will help you to focus on driving instead of on the dog, which is important because distracted drivers can easily cause accidents.It will also keep your dog safe if you have to stop quickly or if you get in an accident.


If you don't want to crate your dog, at least find a way to make sure your dog is secure. For instance if you have a station wagon, consider confining your dog to the back portion of the car. If you do have a large window boot, put up a wire grid to stop your dog jumping over the back of the seats. Line the dog's area with dog blankets or place its bed in the corner so he or she can nap comfortably on the journey. Make sure you don't have any heavy loose items, such as bowls or bottles, as those can become dangerous projectiles in an accident. Most dogs find sleeping an easy way to cope with motion sickness.
You could also purchase a dog safety seat. While it is not as secure as a crate, it will be safer and more comfortable than a car seat for your dog if you turn or stop the car suddenly. The most popular among these are bucket seats. They attach at the back of the front seats, and the top of the back seats, creating a soft well in which your dog, and any liquids (or solids!) they may create, are contained. These can be made with a blanket or purchased cheaply.
Car seatbelts for dogs are a great tool if you don't want your dogs confined, or if you have a two-seat car. Make sure to attach them to a harness, and not a collar. They clip into the female buckle of a car seatbelt on one end, and have a standard leash clip on the other. By attaching them to a harness, you ensure the dog is secured by the body, and their neck won't be damaged in an emergency.
If you use a crate, make sure it is secured. Make sure it is very secure to prevent it from moving if you stop quickly or get hit. An unsecured crate can be just as, or even more dangerous than an unsecured dog.;
, Present the crate to your dog positively. Allow the dog to sniff the crate before it goes in the car. Once the crate is placed in the car, put your dog in it. Continue your positive attitude about the crate and walk away from the dog in the crate for several minutes. Allow the dog to get into the crate itself by luring it with treats, do not force the dog into the crate., You need to get your dog tired before crating it. While a tired dog may still be upset about being crated, a fully rested dog will usually be even worse.

, Feed him or her at least a few hours before. This will help your dog avoid getting carsick.

, Make the dog's area comfortable by placing its bed or blankets down for padding. Also bring water, treats, the dog's collar and leash, some of your dog's favorite chew toys, and plastic bags for waste.

, It is better not to give him or her a bone or food treats because if the dog feels sick it will vomit it back up.


Squeaky toys are also undesirable as they will drive you crazy.

, Never medicate your dog with Dramamine or any other medication without the guidance of your vet. Your vet may have some other suggestions instead.

, If your dog has hyperactivity problems, contact your vet before the trip. See if a mild sedative is available and safe for your dog, especially if it is a long journey. Follow the dosing instructions carefully.

, Then start with short trips until you and your dog become familiar with traveling by car together.

, Don't go long distances right away, just get your dog used to the space. Take your dog to a park or a field so they associate a car ride with something good rather than just trips to the vet.

, There's always a chance, no matter how well behaved your dog may be, that your dog will get out of the car and away from you. Make sure that your dog can be identified if it gets away from you while traveling.

, Let your dog run around and tire itself out. You should also give your dog a little snack and a little water while taking your break. Make sure that you stop every hour or so and go for a quick walk, even if its only on the grass by a fast food restaurant on the highway. This lets your dog use the toilet, so you can also give him or her some water around now. Taking your dog on short walks is important as it means that the dog can stretch his or her legs and stops it from going crazy from being bored.


This is especially important if your journey is more than a few hours. A four hours is your average dog's absolute limit for driving without a longer break. Make sure you stop somewhere grassy and relatively quiet (not right by the road), lock your car, feed your dog some food and water, and take him for a walk so he can let off some of his excess energy.
If you stop by the highway your dog MUST be on a leash for his own safety.

, Be aware of how quickly a dog can get heat stroke, and die, in a parked car. To be safe, never leave your dog unattended in your car in warm weather for any length of time.


If you stop for a meal, park your car in the shade, and let the windows down about an inch each to let cool air in. Put a bowl of cool water in the car for your dog and unbuckle him or her if in a dog seat. Lock your car doors, and order your food to go.
Try to spend no more than five minutes away from the car if it is a warm day, as you don't want your dog to overheat. If your stop will take a bit longer, for instance you are waiting in a long line for food, tie your dog to a post either just inside the front door or just outside in a place where you can see it. At least he or she will be out of the heat while you wait. Make sure to tie the dog with secure knots so it doesn't escape onto the road. Tight knots will also mean it will be less likely for someone to steal your dog.

, Comforting the dog, as natural as it seems, reinforces the idea that something bad is happening. Do your best to stay calm and normal while paying attention for signs of true distress (instead of discomfort).

, Take your pup for a long walk immediately on arrival. Give it a treat, assure it, and give it lots of love for making through the journey.

Install a motion-activated sprinkler.,
Build a dog path.,
Create a dog-friendly space.,
Train your dog.",How to Keep Dogs Out of Gardens3," Motion-activated sprinklers can be programmed to spray water anytime an animal enters the garden. These sprinklers can deter not just dogs, but cats, deer, and other unwanted animal intruders.


Motion activated sprinklers range from $35 to over $100.
A popular choice is the “Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion Activated Sprinkler,” available on Amazon for $60.

, If your dog frequently walks on your garden on its way someplace else, you may be able to provide a better path for it! If you are open to reorganizing your garden, you can create a path right through the middle. Otherwise, create a path for your dog nearby.For a pleasant dog-friendly path, you may want to use:


Soil/sand mixture.
Outdoor carpet.
Step stones.

, You can encourage your dogs to stay away from the garden by providing a better space for them to play. If you like having the dogs with you in the yard, this is great way to keep them happy and enjoy their company.Choose a location. Dogs tend to prefer shade. Provide enough space for dogs to play and relax.
Select a dog-friendly surface. The top choice is a sand/soil mixture, but wood chips or leaves will work too.
Provide some toys and a dish with water.
Use positive reinforcement to encourage dogs to hang out in this space.

, If the dog in question belongs to you, you may be able to train it not to enter the garden. If your dog has never had any kind of training, you might consider formal obedience training for your pet.


Praise your dog when it does not enter the garden and provide a treat.
Scold your dog with a firm ""No"" when it enters the garden. Avoid yelling or physical threats.
Be consistent and try to remain patient throughout this process.

Socialize your dog to deal with stress.,
Acclimate them to the sound of your smoke alarm.,
Practice calling them to an exit.,
Reward them when they come.,
Put them on a leash and lead them outside.,
Repeat this exercise for all potential fire exits.,
Repeat the drill often.",How to Fire Drill Train Your Dog1," Before you even start specific fire safety training, it will help a lot if you can introduce your dog to a wide variety of people, places, noises, and experiences. The more your pet encounters new and different things, the more likely they’ll be to be able to deal with stressful new situations, like a fire.This means that you should make a conscious effort to introduce your dog to a new environment, from a park to a parking lot, every week or so. Keep them on a leash, so that you can control their movement. Reward them with treats and praise every time they remain calm and observant when facing a new situation.
Be sure to go at your dog’s pace. If your pooch responds badly to particular setting, lavish them with treats and praise until they feel at ease. Keep returning to that setting until they automatically feel at ease with it.
To ensure they’re prepared to face emergency situations, it’s a good idea to work your way up to environments with a lot of distractions and loud noises, like an outdoor concert, festival, or sporting event, as part of their socialization.;
, The blaring of your alarm is likely to be startling to your dog, so it’s a good idea to familiarize them with it in advance. That way, they’re far less likely to panic in the moment.Put your dog on a leash, and then press your smoke alarm to make it go off.
Give your dog treats while they listen to the sound. If they panic, cower, and/or bark, hold them firmly on the leash and speak to them in a happy, reassuring voice until they calm down enough to give them treats.
Turn the alarm on and off a few times, increasing the duration each time. Keep standing with your dog and giving them treats every time it sounds until they’re at ease with the noise.
For maximum benefit, practice this exercise a couple times a week for a few weeks before moving on to the next step.

, Next, have someone else press the smoke alarm while you stand at an exterior door. Once the alarm goes off, start calling your dog. Keep calling until they come to you.


Use whatever phrase you normally use for recall, such as your dog’s name or “Here, girl!”
This is also good training for you because it will indicate how loudly you need to call to be heard over the alarm.
Be sure to use a happy voice. Keep in mind that you should also strive to use a calm, happy voice to call your dog when in an actual crisis situation.

, As soon as they arrive where you are, give your dog praise and a big treat. It should be a treat they really love, like some lunchmeat or a bone or several smaller treats, to impress on them the value of coming to you when they hear the smoke alarm.

, Keep an extra leash by all exterior exits for easy access in case of an emergency. Dogs can easily panic and run away once they’re outside, so it’s best to have them under control as you leave your house.Once you’re outside and away from the house, reward them with more treats.

, You want your dog to learn to listen for your voice and identify which door you’re waiting at when they hear the smoke alarm go off. Once they get the hang of meeting you at one exit, move on to another exterior door.


The treats you give them when they find you should offer a strong motivation to get the right door.

, Your dog’s fire training will only take a firm hold if you repeat it at regular intervals. Try doing a family fire drill once a month with your dog, so that you can be confident everyone is prepared for any potential blazes."

In the event that they do experiment with some of your backyard flora, though, you want to make sure that this accidental consumption is non-toxic. Opt for flowers that are wholly and safely edible for peace of mind.In contrast, avoid flowers such as foxgloves, rhododendron, azaleas, lily of the valley, and everything from the buttercup family.
Check this list from the ASPCA about which plants are toxic to dogs: http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/dogs-plant-list
;
, Growing delicious fruits and veggies in your garden is a great way to augment your diet with fresh produce. Make sure your healthy lifestyle change is safe for your dog by using only those plants which are safe for canine consumption. Among others, broccoli, celery, blueberries, pears, peaches, and apples are all safe options.Avoid allium vegetables, such as garlic onion, and shallots, as well as grapes, mushrooms, asparagus, and cherries, as these are toxic to dogs., Culinary herbs, such as oregano, thyme, rosemary, and parsley, are safe for your dog to consume. They also emit strong tastes and smells, so your dog is unlikely to find them appealing in any case.The same goes for aromatics, such as lavender and bee balm, so feel free to fill your garden with as much fragrant flora as you like.

, Potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants are all safe for dog consumption, but, as members of the nightshade family, their foliage contains potentially harmful chemicals, such as solanine and tomatine. While it’s unlikely your dog will sample these leafy parts, you should take special care when including these fruits and veggies in your garden.You can take special safety measures with these plants by erecting a pet-proof fence or planting them in elevated containers.

, Though particularly effective at exterminating unwanted garden pests, chemical pesticides such as metaldehyde are dangerous for dogs. Rather than using these harmful solutions, opt for natural, oil-based solutions that will help repel and control pesticide populations without presenting a hazard to your dog’s health.You can also make a non-toxic, homemade pest repellent by mixing ½ cup liquid dishwashing soap, two tablespoons ammonia, and five to seven cups of water., While fertilizers and mulches can provide essential boosts to your garden’s growth, they often contain toxic chemicals and additives. Read the labels of all products you purchase to make sure they’re pet-safe and all-natural. No matter what, though, keep your dog away from fertilizer while it’s fresh, as organic blends contain appealing ingredients, such as fish byproducts and blood meal. Ingesting small quantities won’t harm your dog, but overdoing it can cause stomach upset.Cocoa mulch is lethal to dogs when ingested, so avoid it at all costs. Instead, opt for root mulch or pine bark mulch., Due to its pungent smell and strong taste, vinegar acts as a natural, safe deterrent for dogs and other pets. Pour distilled white or apple cider vinegar from your kitchen into a spray bottle and give your plants a good dousing every couple of weeks. As an added bonus, the vinegar will also dissuade aphids, squash bugs, and other insects.If you live in an area with lots of other wildlife, be sure not to use deer or rabbit repellents which contain coyote urine. This will attract your dog rather than repelling it.

, Just like people, your dog finds sharp, bitter, or spicy flavors distasteful. If he associates these unpleasant tastes with your garden vegetation, he will avoid your plants without the assistance of an external barrier or chemical solution.Some gardeners also recommend using a mixture of coffee grounds and orange peels as a natural dog deterrent., If your dog still expresses interest in rooting around your garden, you need to install a durable physical barrier around your vulnerable vegetation. You can use a wooden or metal garden fence from a home improvement supply store, or you can plant a row of prickly plants, such as rose bushes or holly branches, to keep curious canine snouts and paws away.Even a relatively low fence can be sufficient to dissuade dogs, as it creates a visual barrier between them and the off-limits flora.
If your dog seems to get through any fence or thorny shrub, plant your sensitive items in raised beds or elevated containers.

, Perhaps the most surefire way to keep your dog from rooting around in undesirable areas is to avoid leaving him to his own devices. Keep a watchful eye on your dog whenever you’re out in the yard together, and never let him out to rove around without someone to monitor., If you construct special paths so that people and pets alike can meander throughout the garden, you’ll encourage your dog to restrict its traffic to specific areas. Pave pathways with gravel or brick, or use a safe mulch., If you want to keep your dog entertained and well-exercised, you should keep a supply of chew toys in the garden or on your deck. This way, you’re showing your dog what positive behaviors and activities he can do while in the garden, rather than just showing him what he can’t do and where he can’t go. Tennis balls, Kong cones filled with peanut butter, and hard rubber bones are all good options.Just be sure not to leave your dog alone with tennis balls, as they can break and get lodged in your dog’s throat.

, Due to its high concentration of nitrogen and salts, dog urine can cause unsightly brown spots in your lawn and damage your garden plants. You can minimize this damage by creating a prescribed area in the garden where your dog can relieve itself.Use a driftwood stump or artificial post you’ve purchased from a pet supply retailer. Surround this area with an easily cleaned material, such as brick, flagstone, or cedar chips., Dogs love to dig for many reasons: they could be overheated and seeking cooler soil, searching for ground-dwelling critters or other edible attractions, trying to relieve anxiety, or tunneling as a method of escape.If your dog loves to dig, give him a good place to indulge in this activity rather than simply discouraging him from digging everywhere in the garden.In order to protect your dog from heat stress, make sure the sandbox is out of direct sunlight, and periodically sprinkle the sand with water in order to cool it down., Studies have shown that certain herbs and plants can significantly improve a dog's health and stress levels, and also that dogs can find and select these helpful plants for consumption. For example, hops can calm a hyperactive dog, while St. John's wort acts as a sedative and pain reliever."

Stay calm.,
Put someone on dog duty.,
Leave a door open and call back.,
Check your dog’s hiding places.,
Keep your dog safely away from the house and street.",How to Fire Drill Train Your Dog2," Your behavior will set the tone for your household and its pets. Dogs are especially susceptible to catching your panic, which can make them act erratically and put them in harm’s way. Strive to maintain a calm voice and manner, even if you’re feeling stressed and fearful., Before a fire takes place, assign one member of your household to look after your pet. That way, you can be sure to account for your dog while avoiding any confusion that could delay your evacuation.This should also be the person who runs the fire drill training with your dog.

, If you’re forced to exit your burning house without your dog, be sure to keep the door you left through open. Then, call back to them from outside it.Remember to grab your dog’s extra leash by the door as you exit.
If you’ve run the fire drill enough times, your dog should know to listen for your voice at an exit when they hear the smoke alarm go off.
If you left through a door that your dog does not normally exit the house through, be sure to also open their regular exit.

, Before an emergency occurs, take time to notice where your pet goes when they are feeling anxious or stressed. If you cannot find your pet during a fire alarm, check those spots if they’re safely accessible.If they’re not safely accessible, notify the rescue workers of where your pet might be.

, Once your dog is outside, be sure that they are secured. Either store them in a locked crate or carrier out of harm’s way or have them on a leash and make sure that someone in your household is responsible for holding your pet.If you prefer the crate or carrier option, be sure that you store one near an accessible exterior door, for instance in a mud room or your garage.

Maintain functional smoke alarms.,
Put up pet alerts.,
Be sure their ID is current.,
Consider a doggy door.",How to Fire Drill Train Your Dog3," Every floor of your house or apartment should have a working smoke alarm installed on a ceiling. Be sure to test them and replace their batteries regularly.It’s a good idea to replace the batteries in your smoke alarms twice a year.
If you’re often away from your home, it may be worth investing in a monitored smoke alarm system. That way, any time a smoke alarm is triggered in your absence, a service would immediately dispatch first responders to check on your house and rescue your dog if need be.

, Use stickers placed on a window near your front door to notify first responders about any dogs or other pets living in your home. The sticker should state what kind of pets and how many of each you have in the family.The ASPCA provides these window-cling stickers at no charge in their free pet rescue packs, which you can order online.You may also obtain pet alert stickers in person from your local firehouse., Things are chaotic during a fire. In case your dog is lost in the melee, be sure to keep their microchipping and/or ID tags up to date with your current contact information.


Microchips correspond to an electronic database with owner information. Be sure to apprise your vet and/or the company where you purchased your microchip of any updates to your address or phone number.

, Creating a doggy door that leads into a fenced yard is a good way to ensure that your pet can get out of the house in the event of a fire, even when you’re not there.If you crate your dog during your absence, it’s wise to keep the crate near an exterior door, so that they can be easily rescued in the event of a house fire.

Attempt to get the dog off the road.",How to Get a Dog Out of a Busy Road1," When you see a dog on a busy road, go to the edge of the side of the road. If you are in a car, pull over onto the shoulder and stand at a safe distance from the road. If you are on foot, walk to the edge at a safe distance from traffic.You want to get into a position where you can get the dog’s attention but keep yourself safe from cars.
If you are in a car, put on your flashers.;
, You want to try to get the dog to come out of the road to you. So, first you need to try to get the dog’s attention. The dog may be running down the road, standing in the middle of the road, or dodging cars, so think of a way to get the dog to pay attention to you.For example, try whistling, loudly calling to the dog, or making noises, like clicking your tongue.

, After you get the dog’s attention, try to coax the dog to you. This may be difficult since you are a stranger. Clap your hands and use a soothing voice to talk to the dog. Squat down into a welcoming position that puts you closer to the dog’s height.You can say things like, “Come here, buddy!” or other similar things.
Make sure your voice is calm and friendly instead of frantic, scared, or aggressive. This may make the dog nervous or reluctant to come towards you.

, If you have food with you, you can try to get the dog to come towards you using food. Wave the food like a treat, trying to show the dog that you have something it wants to eat. If you have human food, you can take a bite to show the dog it is food.If the dog is reluctant to come towards you, leave the food on the shoulder and walk away. Wait to see if the dog will come out of the road and towards the food.

, When you pull over to the side of the road, instead of getting out of your car, just leave the door open. Often, if a dog is scared, they will see an open car door as a safe place to go. Try calling to the dog in a friendly, soothing voice.It may take some coaxing to get the dog into the car. Whistle, clap your hands, or use food to entice them.

, If you can’t get the dog to come to you when you are standing up or squatting, try to make yourself less threatening by sitting or lying down. Sometimes, a dog may think you are a threat if you are towering over them. If they see you lying or sitting, they may think you want to pet them or let them crawl into your lap.If a dog is tired or scared, it may come over and lay beside you because they see you as a safe place.

, If you can’t quite get the dog to come to you, try to get the dog to run off the road in the opposite way. You might try this by honking your horn, yelling, or throwing a stick towards the dog without hitting it. Think of a way to get the dog to run to the other shoulder of the road, out of traffic.Try yelling, “Shoo!” or “Go on!” or “Get away!” to encourage the dog to run the other way.

"
"
Place a leash on the dog.,
Look for identification.,
Check nearby homes for the owner.",How to Get a Dog Out of a Busy Road2," If you manage to get the dog to come to you, gently slip a leash on the dog’s neck. This can help you keep the dog from running into the road again if the dog gets startled or doesn’t want to be near you.You can try to get the dog into your car without a leash, but a leash helps you secure the dog and keep it safe once you get it out of the road.

, Many dogs have collars and tags around their neck. The tags may provide information about the dog, such as their name, the owner’s contact information, or vet information. You can use this information to help locate the owner.If the tag only has the name, it can help you identify the real owner of the dog.
With vet information, you may be able to contact the dog’s vet, who can get in touch with the owner.

, If the dog doesn’t have a tag with owner identification, try finding the owner. You may rescue a dog from a neighborhood or area near houses. Go around to the houses asking if they have a missing dog. Sometimes, the dog just wandered off and ended up in the road.You may consider asking people to describe the dog and keeping it out of eyesight so you don’t give the dog to someone who isn’t the actual owner or may hurt it.

"
"
Take the dog to the vet.,
Call around to local vets and shelters.,
Call animal control.",How to Get a Dog Out of a Busy Road3," When you rescue a dog, you should take it to the vet. The vet can check the dog for a microchip. If the dog has a microchip, they can be returned to their owner. If there is no microchip, the vet can look the dog over to see if there are any health concerns before you take them home around your own pets.For example, if the dog is a stray or been lost for awhile, it might have parvo, worms, or other diseases. If you take it home around your dog, it might infect them.

, If you still are unable to locate the owner, try calling around to see if someone reported a missing dog. Try the veterinarian practices in town, animal shelters, animal rescues, or other pet organizations. Ask if anyone has lost a dog.Make sure to give everyone you call a description of the dog and your contact information so you can be contacted if the owner looks for the dog.

, When you see a dog on a busy road, it might be too dangerous for you to try to intervene. The dog may also be aggressive or too dangerous to interact with. If this is the case, call animal control. Animal control can come to the scene to help get the dog to safety and prevent an accident.You may consider calling the non-emergency police line to see if there is an officer who could help you get the dog out of traffic without causing an accident.

Bring the bike along for a walk.,
Teach your dog important cues.,
Choose a location.,
Start out slow and short.,
Increase the time and pace.,
Watch for signs of heat stroke.,
Carry your dog.",How to Ride a Bicycle with Your Dog," For safety reasons you want to first establish that your dog is fit for biking. Consult with your doctor as to whether the dog has any underlying conditions that could be exacerbated by such strenuous exercise. You also want to establish that your dog is of a breed for which this would be an appropriate exercise and that it is in sufficiently good shape. If not, start out with longer and more regular walks.Under no condition is this a safe activity for dogs under 25 lbs or under one year of age.;
, The first step in establishing your dog’s safety while biking is keeping yourself safe. You will need a helmet and something to ensure that you are noticeable to potential motorists, including bright cycling clothes and a reflective device to attach to your bike. You should keep some water for yourself and your dog. Some additional equipment will be required in case of emergency.


In case of emergency you should have a cellphone on you, as well as money, identification, a spare tube, and a tire pump.
While it should be no surprise that you will want a bike, you also need to consider what type of bike you will need. This is an activity that it is best performed off-road, so it is important to have a bike appropriate for that. A hybrid bike will be best for riding along a path; for tough terrain you will probably want a mountain bike., Some people will try to bike by holding the leash in their hand while the dog runs alongside them. This is extremely unsafe. To bike safely, you need special equipment to ensure that your dog is not strangled by a leash around their neck, pulled under the wheel, or hit by an oncoming vehicle. Thankfully all of the necessary equipment is now mass-produced and readily available for those willing to invest the time and money to keeping their dog safe.


The first consideration should be safely attaching the dog to your bike. For this you will need a body harness, which, unlike a leash, will not apply pressure exclusively to your dog’s neck. If possible, the harness should be padded, and not so long as to allow your dog to get far ahead of you. Also you should purchase a “baton” lead that will attach the harness to the body of the bike. This will keep the dog away from your wheel and prevent the dog from pulling on the handle in a way that would cause you to loose your balance.
The next thing to consider is your dog’s visibility. Consider purchasing both a reflective vest and/or a collar with a blinking light embedded in it.There are also some purchases you should consider in case the exercise might be too much for your dog. A bottle of water for your dog is highest on this list. You should, also, however, think about a dog bike trailer that will allow you to pull your dog if he or she gets too tired to run. Cooling vests can be purchased if you are concerned about your dog overheating., Start inside. Bring the bike down to the ground so that the dog can explore it. Call it over to you. Explore the bike with the dog, giving it treats, possibly placing treats on the bike. Begin walking with the bike and encourage the dog to follow you.Your demeanor is important in establishing the bike as a fun toy for the dog. Praise your dog and pet him or to create a positive association.

, Repeat the last exercise on a walk outside with a leash. Begin to take your dog on progressively longer walks. Make sure that the dog does not get caught up in distractions and becomes accustomed to the movement of the bike. Occasionally jog or do a short sprint so that it becomes comfortable with a faster pace alongside the bike., Your dog should learn cues like “slow,” “stop,” “turn” and “leave it” to be able to cooperate on a bike ride.Give your dog treats when they successfully perform these tricks.


When teaching your dog these cues, it is important to use your own unique phrases. Your dog will hear “slow” or “stop” often when you are not biking and this will confuse it. Using an unusual sound or word to signify these commands will ensure that your dog recognizes them., You need to be careful when picking a place to bike with your dog. Trying to bike on terrain that is either too undeveloped or too congested can be dangerous. The optimal location is a lightly traveled road or a designated biking path.


Riding with a dog can triple your width, making it difficult if not impossible to ride in a designated bike lane on the side of the road. Considering that your dog might be less than fully visible and its roadside etiquette rather unrefined, this is a very dangerous option. However, if there is a lightly traveled country road nearby, with a low speed limit and no overly sharp turns, this could be a viable option for biking with your dog.Mountain biking with your dog is at least as risky. Rough terrain will require precise navigation and excellent balance, which can be difficult to maintain with your dog pulling on you.Your best option will be a long straight path with no automobile traffic. You should also consider the likelihood of encountering pedestrian or bike traffic. Although this is less problematic, you still want to avoid it, especially when starting out.

, It will take some time for your dog to become accustomed to be the behaviors and the levels of exertion necessary for biking with you. After you have trained your dog you will want to take him or her on a short, slow ride, no more than a few minutes long. Make sure that your dog is only jogging gently next to you. Give treats and praise to build positive associations with biking.

, Every time that you go out, increase the time and the pace of your excursion. Be attentive, however, to signs that you are pushing your dog too hard. If so, adjust your pace. Eventually your dog should be able to go longer distances at greater speeds.


Your dog’s paw pads will grow tougher with more running. They might, however, start off sensitive. Check them after a run to verify that there are no signs of damage or injury. Also be aware of limping, itching, or chewing on the paw; all of these can indicate that the paw might be injured.Inspect to make sure that there are no signs of chaffing where the harness is pulling on your dog.
Throughout the ride be attentive to your dog’s behavior. If she begins to show signs of laziness or appears unenthusiastic, call it a day and come back out some other time., Heat stroke is a serious condition that can cause organ failure. To prevent heat stroke you should avoid strenuous exercise in extreme heat. Even then, you must be mindful for signs of heat stroke. Some dogs will be more inclined toward it than others.


You should be particularly mindful of heat stroke if your dog is either very young or old, obese, short-nosed, has a thick coat, or has an underlying medical condition.Signs of heat stroke include: Rapid or erratic heartbeat, rapid breathing, exaggerated panting, loud heaving, excessively drooling or frothing at the mouth, vomiting, dizziness, shaking, and unconsciousness.
If you suspect that your dog is experiencing heat stroke stop, move to a cooler area, give the dog a small amount of water, and sponge him or her down with cool (not cold) water. A change in temperature that is too rapid can be dangerous. Exposure to cold water , Whether through trial and error or because your veterinarian has told you that your dog is not equipped for it, you might find that your dog can not run alongside you. That does not mean, however, that you can’t enjoy a bike ride together. For small dogs (which shouldn’t run alongside you anyway) one can purchase bike baskets. For larger dogs, there are also trailers and side cars that can be used to carry your dog with you."

Ask your vet about medication.",How to Travel by Car with a Fearful Dog," If your dog is particularly fearful of cars or if it has never been in one before, you'll need to do some basic desensitization work. This should entail getting your dog familiar with being in the vehicle, even if it is not yet comfortable being in there for prolonged periods of time.Open both rear doors so that your dog can see there is a way out. Seeing that it won't be trapped may help alleviate some of your dog's fears.
Put your dog on a leash and climb in on one side. Without saying anything, gently tug the leash to lead your dog into the backseat.
Slide all the way over and get out on the other side, making sure your dog comes right behind you.
Quickly return to the other side and repeat the process until your dog can get in and out comfortably. You may also want to reverse which side you enter and exit on so your dog gets used to both sides of the vehicle.
If you have a hatchback or ""boot"" on your car, keep the rear door open and begin alternating between the backseat and the rear of the vehicle.;
, Once your dog has been in the car multiple times, you'll want to start extending the amount of time your pet spends with you in the vehicle. Always stay in the car with your dog so it does not think you're locking it inside the car alone.Don't start the engine or put the key in the ignition. The goal is to simply get your dog used to being in your car and make it a positive experience.
Offer treats and verbal praise whenever your dog sits comfortably in the car. You should also pet your dog to make it feel comforted.
If your dog won't get in the vehicle, try to get it as close to the vehicle as possible. Then offer treats and praise.
You can also get your dog used to being in the car by moving its food bowl in the vehicle and feeding it one or more meals in the car.
Repeat this process several times on multiple occasions. You may want to do this for at least one to two weeks before starting the engine with your dog inside.

, Now that your dog is comfortable being inside the vehicle, the next step is adding the sound and feel of a running engine. This may frighten some dogs, even those that have been calm up to this point. Be patient and make sure your dog is doing okay at every step of the way.Make sure your dog is already used to being in a stationary vehicle before turning the engine on. Your dog should have spent about one to two weeks, or as long as necessary, simply sitting in your vehicle.
Continue offering treats and/or feeding your dog in the vehicle. Start the engine while your dog is already inside, then immediately offer food or treats.
Watch your dog's reaction. If it seems anxious or upset, offer even more petting and verbal praise, being sure to speak in a calm, soothing voice.
Be sure your dog is as relaxed and calm as possible before you end each session with the engine running.

, A moving vehicle can easily scare an unaccustomed dog. Your dog should be comfortable being in a vehicle with the engine running by this point. Do not attempt to put your dog into a moving vehicle without proper acclimation.Don't actually go for a drive yet. Simply shift gears between ""drive"" and ""reverse,"" pulling your car in and out of the garage or up and down the driveway.
If you do not have a garage or driveway, try simply pulling forward about 10 to 20 feet on a quiet side street, then putting the vehicle into reverse and backing up that same distance.

, Taking an actual trip should be tolerable to your dog if it's used to being in a moving car for short periods of time. Make sure your initial trips are very brief and cover very short distances.Take your dog someplace fun that will feel like a reward for car travel. For example, you might take your dog to a park to play with a ball or Frisbee, to a dog park for social time, or to a familiar hiking location., Ideally, you should create a comfortable little refuge in the car for your dog. This can help make your dog calmer and feel more at ease during travel. Many dog owners use a crate for this reason, but you can achieve the same effect without one.Bring one of your dog's favorite toys, a familiar blanket, and anything else that will help put your dog at ease.
Play some soothing music in your vehicle. This can help calm your dog once it gets inside the car., Walking your dog can help lower its stress levels and increase its sense of calm. A good, long walk will also reduce the risk of your dog urinating or defecating in the vehicle.Give your dog a good, long walk. Try to walk your dog for whatever time and/or distance you usually cover during a typical walk, but make sure it's more than just being let outside to urinate.
Aim to walk your dog approximately 10 to 20 minutes before departure. That way your dog will still be calm when you approach your vehicle.

, Some dogs have specific travel-related things that cause anxiety. For example, some dogs get fearful when the vehicle drives over rumble strips or comes to a complete stop. It will take some time and experience in the car to determine what (if any) specific triggers your dog has. Be patient and offer support as best you can.Speak in a calm, reassuring voice before, during, and after the trigger.
If you're traveling with another passenger, have them offer your dog treats after your dog experiences any of its anxiety triggers in the car.
Try to avoid those triggers as best you can in the future, but make sure you prioritize road safety. If you can't safely avoid a trigger, do not attempt to do so.

, In some cases, it may be easier to simply leave your pet at home. This may be true if your dog has particularly severe anxiety or if you do not have adequate time to train and desensitize your dog to car travel.If you plan on being gone for longer than your dog is normally left alone (like typical work hours), make sure your dog has a sitter to feed, walk, and comfort your pet.
You can have a friend or relative come care for your dog at your home, or you can drop your dog off at a friend/relative's house. You can also drop your dog off at doggie day care or hire a dog walker to come to your home.
Ask to see the credentials of anyone you hire to care for your dog. If you're using a kennel or daycare service, make sure you go in person to inspect the facility ahead of time.
Make sure your dog has a microchip and an up-to-date ID tag on its collar before leaving your pet in anyone else's care. That way, if your dog runs away, it will be easier to track it down and bring it home safely.

, Anti-anxiety wraps are worn by anxious dogs to naturally calm them down during stressful situations. An anti-anxiety wrap gives your dog a gentle yet un-intrusive squeeze, which may provide some relief for your pet.You can purchase anti-anxiety wraps from many pet stores or through an online retailer.

, Dog appeasing pheromones (also called DAP) are a synthetic version of naturally occurring pheromones your dog's body produces. Adding these pheromones to your dog's environment can help alleviate anxiety and leave your dog feeling calm.Dog pheromone products come in a number of forms, including sprays, diffusers, wipes, and medicated collars.Remember to plan ahead if you intend to use this product. Like many other medications, it usually takes some time (two weeks, on average) of consistent use for this product to be effective.Talk to your vet before using this or any other medicated product for your pet.

, If your dog paces in the vehicle or tries to climb up to the front seat, you may need a restraining device. These devices can help keep your dog safe and secure during travel.Some common restraining devices include:


a harness
a head halter
a portable carrier or crate, If your dog's travel phobias are severe, your vet may recommend a medication like Alprazolam (Xanax). This can help relieve the symptoms of your dog's anxiety and, if administered in low doses, should not sedate your pet.


Remember that you will need a prescription from your vet to get anti-anxiety medication for your dog.
Follow your vet's instructions on how and when to administer medication to your dog.

Note that fits around the mouth properly.",How to Put a Gentle Leader on a Dog," If you do not have a leash, buy one while buying a gentle leader. The control ring is the metal ring that is located at the end of the strap extending out from the neck strap and nose loop. Clip your leash in so that once you get your dog into the gentle leader, he won’t run away., When you do this, your leash and the nose loop should hang down directly in the center so that the whole gentle leader forms the shape of a ‘T’. Place the neck strap around your dog’s neck. The center bar ring (which connects the neck strap, nose loop, and strap with leash) should be under your dog’s chin, above the Adam's apple, while the back of the neck strap should rest at the base of his skull behind his ears., Putting it on before unclipping it ensures that it fits properly (it is harder to adjust when the nose loop is on your dog). control ring. Once you have the neck strap adjusted to the right size (See Part Two), unclip it. It is easier to clip the neck strap back into place after you put the nose loop on your dog.

, Make sure your dog is either between your legs or at your side so that you can hold him in place while putting the gentle leader on for the first time. Slip the nose loop onto the base of your dog’s muzzle by reaching under your dog’s head. Once you have the nose loop on, give your pup a treat to tell him he’s doing great, and to distract him a bit., Once your pup is snapped in, make sure all of the parts of the gentle leader are in place (see Part Two).

, The gentle leader’s neck strap must be long enough so that it as high up on your dog’s neck as possible. This means the front of the neck strap should be above your dog’s Adam's apple, while the back should reach around to touch the base of the skull directly behind your pup’s ears.You can adjust the tightness of the neck strap by sliding the adjustable snap clamp down towards the control ring (the ring where you clip your leash to the gentle leader).

, It should be tightened enough so that you can barely fit one finger underneath the strap. This is like the ‘collar’ of the gentle leader--it wraps around your dog’s neck and helps you to guide the dog. Keep in mind that it does not cause your dog any discomfort--resist the urge to keep the neck strap loose as doing so will reduce the effectiveness of the gentle leader., It is important that the neck strap is tight enough that it doesn’t rotate because the point of the neck strap is to dictate the direction your dog heads in. If your dog can turn around in his neck strap, the strap is too large and will be not effective.

, The nose loop, unlike the neck strap, should be loose enough that your dog can open his mouth as wide as he likes--even wide enough to catch a tennis ball. However, you should check to make sure that it is not so loose that it can be pulled over and off the nose., As stated above, you don’t want the nose loop to be able to come off the nose, but it should be able to move from just above where the wet (or fleshy) part of your pup’s nose begins to right in front of his eyes. This movement will allow your dog to be comfortable, as well as help you to guide him.

, This means that the gentle leader should fit behind the corners of your dog’s mouth. If it doesn’t, you have probably chosen a leader that is too small for your pup.

Book in advance.,
Place the dog in a suitable pet carrier.,
Carry pet documentation.,
Consider the time of year.",How to Travel Safely With Dogs1,"


Each airline has their own policy regarding dogs on flights. They all, however, require that you call ahead to let them know that you'll be traveling with a dog. If the dog is small enough, it may be able to travel in the cabin of your airplane; otherwise you'll need to ship the dog in the baggage compartment. Service dogs may be allowed in the cabin regardless of their size, but call ahead to check on the airline's policy regarding service dogs.;
,


Airlines specify that the pet must be able to stand, turn around and lie down in the pet carrier. If they cannot do so, then the carrier is too small and you take the risk of your pet being denied access on the plane.

,


Depending on where you're traveling, you may have to provide a veterinary certificate to prove the dog is in good health, or provide the dog's immunization records. Always check with the country of your destination to see if they have any other requirements for bringing a dog into that country. Ensure that their vaccinations are current.

,


Due to the actual flight duration, the amount of time spent on the tarmac and transportation to and from the terminal, some airlines impose restrictions on the time of year you can ship a pet in the baggage compartment. For example, you may not be able to book your dog on a flight if travelling from Texas to Canada in the middle of winter.

Use a pet carrier or restraint.,
Carry the dog's immunization records.",How to Travel Safely With Dogs2,"


Many people choose to bring their dogs with them on car trips. This is fine, provided that your dog is properly secured in the car. It is safest to place the dog in a dog carrier or portable kennel that is large enough for them to turn around and lie down in. There are also varieties of seatbelt-like harnesses that you can use to secure your dog to a seat. There may be laws about how to transport a dog in a car depending on where you are travelling.

,


You may never need them, but having the dog's immunization records with you might prove helpful if the dog is in an accident or if it gets into a fight. Some dog-friendly hotels may also ask to see the dog's immunization records.

Get a vet checkup.,
Check for rules and restrictions regarding animals.,
Exercise your dog before you crate them.,
Research dog-friendly accommodations and areas.,
Create a small emergency kit for the dogs and yourself.,
Avoid sedating your dog.",How to Travel with Dogs1," It is essential to get a checkup at your vet before your travel in order to receive a health certificate, often required for airline travel, and proof of vaccination. Many transportation services open to the public (trains, planes, boats) require a health certificate and proof of vaccination before agreeing to transport your dog.


Carry all of your dog’s documentation with you while you are travelling to avoid any issues with veterinary border control or emergency illnesses.
Be sure to plan ahead in order to avoid cancellations or unavailability. Get a checkup at least a few weeks in advance of your trip.
While you're at the vet, be sure to stock up on all necessary medications.;
, If you are flying or driving to another country, be sure to check for their immigration and veterinary border control policies. Contact the airline you are travelling with as well as the border control for the country you will be arriving in to find out what restrictions and laws you need to abide by.Consult the airline you are travelling with to be put in touch with veterinary border control.
Some airlines will not transport dogs in extreme heat or cold.

, Crating your dog is recommended for both their and your safety. Before crating, be sure to exercise your dog so that they are more comfortable resting.Go for an extra long walk or run before putting your dog in the car or arriving at the airport.

, Whether you are driving or flying you’ll eventually need to find a dog-friendly hotel. Ask your hotel what they’re pet policies are when you are booking.


Find out if your accommodation is near a park, lake, trail, or field that you and your dog can walk to for exercise and bathroom breaks.

, It comes in handy for cuts, ticks and the like. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else! Make sure your kit also includes any medications that your dog might need.


Emergency kits should contain all of your dog’s relevant paperwork, a nylon leash, muzzle, and various medical supplies like hydrogen peroxide, gauze, bandages, tweezers, and adhesive tape., Sedating your dog can often cause unwanted complications as most sedatives will reduce your dog’s response to pressure and climate changes. Instead of sedating your dog, be sure to give them plenty of exercise before crating and have drinking water close by.Consult your vet if you are concerned that your dog may be in need of a sedative or tranquilizer while travelling.

These records will need to detail when your dog had all required vaccinations. If you do not have these records, your dog may not be permitted to enter Canada.


Vaccination records must be issued by a licensed veterinarian.
Dogs traveling from the USA to Canada must have been inspected by a veterinarian within the 30 days prior to travel, and the veterinarian must provide a certificate showing that the dog is free from any form of communicable disease.
Check with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency before traveling in order to find out if specific vaccinations are required at the time.;
, The most important piece of documentation is a letter from your veterinarian certifying that your dog is rabies free and has been vaccinated within the last 3 years (if the vaccine is a 3 year vaccine). This requirement cannot be waived and your dog will not be allowed entry into Canada without a rabies vaccination certification. A rabies certification must:


Clearly name and describe your pet.
Specify the type/validity of the rabies vaccine: if it is a 1, 2, or 3 year vaccine.
Be in English or French.
Dogs under 3 months do not require rabies vaccinations., While you might be overwhelmed with the records and certification you need to get for your dog, make sure not to forget your own documentation. Forgetting your own documentation will stop both you and your dog from entering Canada. Make sure to have:


A current United States government issued passport.
If you do not have a passport, you can also provide an enhanced drivers license issued by most U.S. states that border the Canada.
Vehicle registration and proof of insurance if you are driving from the U.S. to Canada., Check with your airline regarding their pet policy. If you choose to fly with your dog from the U.S. to Canada you need to first check with your chosen airline to figure out their pet policy. Airlines have very different policies, so take a chance to look around and see what different airlines charge and whether or not you can bring your dog on the airplane with you. Consider:


Most airlines are happy to accommodate your pet, either by keeping them at your seat, or by checking them in to the baggage compartment.
Dogs traveling in the cabin of the airplane must meet the airline's size requirements, and they must travel in a carrier that will both accommodate the dog's size and that will fit under the seat in front of you. Most airlines will charge a surcharge for carrying your dog onto the plane.
Checking your pet into the baggage department is the only suitable option for dogs that are medium or large in size. They will need to travel in a portable dog kennel or carrier that is large enough for the pet to both lie down and turn around. Your pet will travel on the same flight as you, and the check-in counter will advise you on where to pick up your pet once you've reached your destination.
If you plan to check your dog with your luggage, be aware that this could be a very traumatic experience for your pet. There are also incidents in which pets have been injured or killed. , Traveling via rail is another option of going to Canada with your dog. While this is a potentially convenient option, there are a few things to remember. Consider:


Canada's railway operator will only allow service dogs into the passenger cars.
Other dogs, however, are allowed to be checked into the baggage car provided they pay an additional fee and that they are properly housed in a pet carrier.
Make sure to have your rabies certification handy when you approach the border. , Taking a bus from the U.S. to Canada is another option. Bus regulations concerning dogs vary from bus line to bus line. The obvious advantage of taking a bus is that you won’t have to worry about fueling up your car and have your car inspected at the border. However, make sure to consider:


Always call ahead to find out your bus line’s dog policy before you depart.
Larger dogs may not be able to travel safely on a bus, as room may not permit it.
You will need the same documentation, including rabies certification, in order for your pet to enter the country., Driving by car with your dog from the USA to Canada is one of the most popular methods of travel. It is possibly the most convenient method for you and your dog because your pup can sit comfortably in the passenger seat or in the back seat. This, of course, avoids any potentially dangerous complications associated with having your dog shipped in a cargo or luggage compartment.


Remember to bring your rabies certification and other vaccination records.
Your car may be inspected at the border.
Avoid packing any items that could cause delays, such as an excessive amount of dog food or medications., Whatever mode of traveling you’ll be doing, as you approach the border or the line where you’ll talk to border agents or other inspection personnel, you’ll need to prepare your dog for this moment. This is because there are a wide variety of things that can upset your dog when traveling. Your dog might be anxious, he or she might be afraid of people, or he or she might be sleeping. In order to prepare your dog:


Make sure he or she is alert and awake. Don’t provide the opportunity for the inspection agent to wake your dog up – this might scare your dog.
Try to calm your dog before interacting with any border personnel or inspection agents. Provide your friend with a treat and reinforce that this will be a positive experience.
Try to keep your dog quiet.
If your dog is upset or anxious, take a minute and try to relax him or her., Before you approach the inspection agent, you should have your dog’s records, specifically his or her immunization and rabies certification papers, out and ready to turn over to the agent. This will help the inspection process go a lot smoother for all parties involved.

, After you’ve got your papers out, you’ll either approach the inspection agent or they will approach you – depending on if you are in a car, in an airport, or traveling by bus or rail. At this point, the inspection agent will ask you to present your papers and will proceed to ask a couple of questions about your dog and your travels. Be prepared to:


Answer questions about your dog’s immunization records.
Answer questions about if your dog has been out of the United States anytime during the last 6 months.
Have the inspection agent look over and examine your dog for visible signs of illness., All dogs entering Canada will have to be inspected by the Canada Border Services Agency. This inspection will further certify that the dog has been vaccinated for rabies and is rabies free. In addition, inspectors will look at the dog to see if there are signs of other illnesses.

Most airlines have a weight limit of 20 pounds for in-cabin dog carrying and charge a fee of $125.If your dog is above your airline’s weight limit restriction your dog will need a cargo approved crate to travel in the cargo hold., Call your airline to reconfirm your dog’s travel and double check your airline’s pet policies at least 24 hours before your departure. Airlines can also refuse to transport your pet if there are extreme weather conditions of if your dog has an illness.

, Feed your dog four to six hours before crating to help them remain comfortable during travel and also avoid motion sickness. Be sure to pack their normal food with you during your trip and provide water up until they board the flight.


Don’t leave anything, including snacks, in a dog’s cargo approved crate.
Do not give your dog tranquilizers, unless prescribed by a vet, before a flight as this can cause health issues., Your dog’s crate will have to go through security screening, so be sure to bring a harness that can safely secure your dog while they are out of their crate., Although many animals are completely fine being shipped in the cargo hold, there are still a few animals that die or are injured each year.Try to fly direct in more moderate months, like during Autumn or Spring.
Fix a label to your dog’s cargo crate and make sure they are wearing a collar that cannot get caught and cause injury., Pick up your dog at baggage claim if they were traveling in the cargo hold of the plane. Once claimed, let your dog out of their crate, give them drinking water, and provide them with a small snack. Like people, your dog may need time to acclimate and adjust after a flight.Be sure to let your dog out of their crate in a controlled area, like outside baggage claim, and keep them on a leash or lead.

Be prepared if your dog runs off.",How to Prepare Your Dog to Go Off‐Leash," Once you've decided to let your dog go off-leash, be prepared to put in some effort. Don't just let your dog run off without the leash or any training. Your dog could get injured or hurt someone or another animal.


Start training your dog as soon as you can. It's best to begin while you're dog is young. Just wait to take your dog out for walks until he's gotten all of his vaccinations.;
, Keep your dog on a long leash and let him get some distance between you. This may mean that he's five or six feet away from you. Say ""come"" and then take a few quick steps backwards. Your dog should start moving towards you. You may want to wave your hand towards your chest as you say ""come"" so your dog associates a visual cue with the verbal cue.If your dog doesn't immediately move toward you, gently tug on the leash and repeat the command cues.

, Stand in front of your dog and look him directly in the eye. Hold a treat right over his nose while you say ""sit."" He'll have to sit down in order to see the treat. When he does, say ""yes!"" and give him the treat. Keep practicing until your dog responds to the command without you needing to hold the treat over his nose.You should also use a physical gesture to teach him to sit. You might want to place your palm in front of your dog's head and pull your hand up and into a fist while you say ""sit.""

, Your dog should start by sitting. Turn to your dog and hold your palm in front of his face while you say ""stay."" Say ""stay"" several times and then take one or two steps backwards. You should keep your hand out, urging your dog to stay put. If he stays put, immediately give him a treat or reward.If your dog stands up to follow you, say ""no, no, no."" Make him sit down and keep practicing.

, When training your dog, use treats and verbal praise as rewards and incentives. For example, if you're teaching your dog to stay, hold your hand out and say ""stay"" to keep your dog from approaching. When your dog stays, you can say ""okay, good job,"" open your hand, and give a treat.In addition to using verbal commands and visual cues, you might want to use a whistle. This way, when your dog goes off-leash, you'll have another way to call him back if you need to.

, If your dog is aggressive, you probably shouldn't let him off the leash. But, if your dog is socialized (does well around other dogs and people) and good-natured, your dog won't be a liability off-leash.


Think about how well your dog responds to your commands. If he regularly obeys, he'll probably do well off-leash. But, if your dog fails to listen to your commands, you might have a hard time training him or recalling him off-leash., It's always a good idea to have identification tags on your dog, even if you don't let him off-leash. But, it's even more important to have these I.D. tags current once your dog has freedom of movement. You may want to microchip your dog if you're worried he may lose his tags or get stolen.Microchipping your dog is relatively inexpensive and might increase your chances of finding your dog if he becomes lost. Just make sure to update your contact information periodically.

, If your dog is off-leash, there's always the possibility that he'll get loose from you and run off. If he does, make sure your dog won't impregnate another dog. If you choose not to spay or neuter your dog, you may want to limit your dog's freedom during certain times (like if your female dog is in heat).


Some cities require dogs to be spayed or neutered in order to go off-leash. This is another reason it's important to check your local off-leash regulations.

, State regulations cover a variety of situations. Some states regulate what time of day your dog can run off-leash, whether your dog can run off-leash during a rabies quarantine, or whether female dogs can run off-leash while in heat, for example. Find out regulations in your area before letting your dog go off-leash.Some states require you to be with your dog at all times when he's off-leash. If your dog is off-leash and causes damage to someone's property, you'll be liable to pay for it., Create a small visible boundary so your dog sees his limits. Choose a quiet area to begin training. For example, you might place flags along the edge of your backyard so your dog sees that he shouldn't go beyond them. Keep your dog on a long leash so he has freedom of movement. Let your dog run off (while on the leash) and call him back.


Keep letting him run off and calling him back until he consistently and immediately obeys your command.
Boundary training is a good way to give your dog a chance to run off and respond to your calls., Once your dog masters small boundaries with a long leash, take him to a dog park or other active area. Keep him on the long leash. Again, let your dog run off and command him to return or stay. Your dog will need to learn how to focus on your command while being distracted in an exciting environment.


If your dog isn't paying attention to your or isn't following commands, consider clicker training him. When he does eventually come to you, make the clicking sound and give him a treat. He'll quickly associate the clicker sound with a treat and will eventually return to you when he hears the sound of the clicker., Give your dog a chance to run off-leash in a large fenced-in area. This gives you a little control while testing your dog's ability to follow commands. Make sure he consistently obeys your commands while in the secured area.


If your dog struggles to listen to you, go back to training him with a long leash. Your dog might just need more time with training before going off-leash.

, If your dog is overly excited when you start training, it may be harder for him to focus on what you want him to do. Give him a chance to run around for a few minutes and stretch his legs. When he calms down a bit, start training.Don't start playing and getting your dog worked up before you begin training. Just give him some time enjoy being outside.

, When your dog repeatedly follows commands in calm and active environments, he's ready to go off-leash. For your own peace of mind, you might start by letting him run around a large secured dog-park.


Never let your dog go off-leash where there might be traffic or where he could injure himself. You should stay near your dog when he's off-leash.

, Give your dog a chance to run off a bit. Then, call him back to you using commands he's familiar with. If he obeys, immediately reward him with a treat. You should also give lots of verbal praise (like ""good boy"").


It's important to keep a close eye on your dog when he goes off-leash. Pay attention to how far he goes from you, whether he's in any danger, or whether he's encountering an aggressive dog. You may need to step in or call him back.

, At some point, your dog may run off and not respond to your command to return, sit, or stay. While your impulse might be to run after him or yell for him to return, stay calm. Keep him in your line of sight and call for him to come back. You may need to walk closer to him to get him to listen. When he does return, praise him so he has a positive association with coming back to you.


If your dog disobeys a command and runs off, hold a few training sessions. Bring out the long leash, clicker, or even put out boundary flags. Your dog may just need a reminder of your rules with the leash.

Use just your thumb.,
Fold the leash in your hand.,
Hold the leash with both hands.,
Stand on the leash when you’re stopped.,
Stabilize your body if your dog pulls.",How to Hold a Dog's Leash1," Slip your thumb through the loop at the end of the leash. If you hold your hand upwards in front of you (like you’re giving someone a high five), the leash should dangle off your thumb. Then close your hand around the loop. The rest of the leash should come out the bottom of your fist, beside your pinky finger., Do not wrap the leash around your hand or arm. Instead, fold the leash several times and hold the folds in your hand. Make sure the end of the leash is coming out of the bottom of your fist, near your pinky finger.Wrapping the leash around your arm or hand can cause serious injury if your dog suddenly pulls hard, or if the leash gets tangled in something. This could break a bone or cut off circulation.

, While walking it is best to hold the leash with both of your hands, not one. Your right hand should the end of the leash, with your right thumb through the loop. Excess portions of the leash should be folded into your right hand. Your left hand should be holding a section of the leash closer to your dog.There should be enough slack between your two hands that the leash forms a U shape in front of you. There should also be enough slack between your left hand and your dog so your dog is not uncomfortable.
Hold your arms down at your sides, not bent upwards or even above your head.

, If you decide to stop at any point while on a walk with your dog, put your foot on a part of the leash and stand on it. This will provide you with more stability and resistance if your dog starts to pull or run away.Alternatively, fold the leash into both your hands and hold it in front of you with both hands. Your hands should be vertical, one on top of the other, like you’re holding a baseball bat.

, If your dog starts to pull on the leash, stand up straight and point your hip in the direction your dog is pulling. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. This will stabilize you so that you aren’t pulled off-balance if your dog continues to pull on the leash.Dogs that encounter resistance will stop pulling faster than those who do not encounter resistance. By not building a resistance to your dog’s pulling, they will learn that they can keep doing it until you give in (or fall over).

Reward good behaviour.,
Practice sitting and following first.,
Let the puppy drag a leash.,
Allow slack in the leash.,
Hold the leash below your waist.,
Shorten and lengthen the leash as needed.",How to Hold a Dog's Leash2," Treats (in the form of pieces of kibble) should only be given to the puppy when they’ve performed the correct behaviour. And the reward should be given immediately after the good behaviour. If you cannot get to your puppy quick enough after the good behaviour, it’s better to forego the treat altogether.While training a puppy it’s helpful to keep a belted pack around your waist so you have easy (and quick) access to treats when needed.

, Before attaching a leash to your puppy, teach your puppy to stay seated and pay attention. Reward your puppy for staying seated. Then, run away and get get your puppy to chase you. Stop after 5-7 steps and wait for your puppy to sit down before handing out the reward.The point of this training process is to teach your puppy to sit and follow properly, without the added pressure of a leash. Your puppy needs to think this process is fun.

, Attach a lightweight leash to your puppy’s collar. Practice the sit and follow routine, but do not hold the leash. Allow the puppy to drag the leash around. Reward your puppy for performing the sit and follow routine properly.Make sure there aren’t any obstacles where the leash can get caught.

, When standing and walking normally, the leash should be held with enough slack that the puppy’s collar isn’t being pulled tightly around its neck. If your puppy moves too far from you, it may pull. But your puppy will soon learn that staying closer to you is more comfortable.The more pressure and discomfort a puppy is feeling, the more they’ll fight back.

, When holding the leash while on a walk, your hands should be down by your sides. Your right hand should be against your right thigh (with the loop of the leash in your thumb), and your left arm should be against your left thigh (holding a portion of the leash in your fist).Never wrap the leash around your hand or wrist on either side of your body, this can cause serious injury.

, When the puppy is stopped beside you, you may need to fold excess parts of the leash into your hand. But when the puppy (and you) start to move, you may need to allow a couple of the folds to come out of your hand.Avoid holding the leash in one spot and raising and lowering your hands to lengthen and shorten the leash. This will cause you to inadvertently hold the least too tightly.

Use a hands-free leash.,
Select the right leash.,
Run with your dog.,
Walk with your dog.,
Pull backwards on the leash to stop.,
Practice ignoring distractions.",How to Hold a Dog's Leash3," A hands-free leash is a leash that has a belt, instead of a loop, at the end. You wear the belt around your waist with your dog’s leash attached to the belt. In general the process for walking your dog is the same.There are two great benefits for using a hands-free leash. One is the obvious, you’re hands are free. This makes it easier to reward your dog for good behaviour, and swing your arms if you’re walking quickly or running. Two is that the main point of resistance to your dog is the middle of your body, right near your centre of gravity. This makes you significantly more stable than holding the leash in your hands.

, When you go to the pet store to buy a leash, you’ll notice they come in every material, length and colour you can imagine. The colour you choose is completely up to you! The length should be based on the type of activity you’ll be performing with your dog. And the material should be based on personal comfort and expense.If you’re taking your dog for a loose leash walk, a leash that has the ability to uncoil and recoil is very useful. Instead of folding pieces of the leash in your hands, you can simply click a button and allow your dog to uncoil the rope. These leashes, however, are not designed for heel walks, or walks where there are a lot of obstacles for a rope to get caught on (including people and other dogs).
Leashes can be made of metal chains, leather or nylon. Here are some things you may want to consider when choose the material of a leash:

Metal - looks cool, but is heavy. Can prevent a dog from attempting to bite the leash.
Leather - expensive, but easy to hold and use. The leather may not be as flexible in cold weather.
Nylon - the least expensive, and has the most variety. Stands up after constant exposure to different weather conditions. But can be hard on the hands.



, Many dog owners enjoy bringing their dogs when going for a run, a bike ride, or rollerblading. This offers great exercise to both you and your dog, and should hopefully tire your dog out faster!Remember to control your dog throughout the run. Since it is a run, don’t allow your dog to stop unless you do. You both should be able to maintain the same, steady pace.

, Your dog should have more slack on the leash while walking, than while standing still. They should always feel comfortable in their leash and collar to avoid injury and misbehaviour. When walking, your dog should be immediately to your side (which side will depend on what’s more comfortable to you). Your dog should not walk behind or in front of you.If you allow your dog to walk behind you on a leash, there’s a great chance you’ll pull too hard on the leash in order to force the dog to keep up with you.

, Your right hand should be holding the end of the leash, with your thumb through the loop and excess leash folded in your hand. Your left hand should be holding another section of the leash, closer to your dog. Your left hand should be down near your left thigh. When it’s time to stop, simply pull backwards with your left hand.There should be some slack in the leash between your two hands AND between your left hand and your dog.
When you’re ready to move again, start walking forward. Your left arm will naturally pull on the leash and signal your dog it’s time to go. Don’t yank on the leash.

, One of the worst situations most owners encounter when taking their dog for a walk is what happens when another person or another dog walk by. You dog may walk perfectly if there’s no one around, but the moment there’s a distraction, your dog may completely forget everything they've learned. That’s why it’s important to train your dog to ignore distractions while on a walk.When practicing, use a friend or family member as the distraction, rather than practicing on unsuspecting strangers.
While learning to ignore distractions, you may find the use of a head halter beneficial. A head halter has a nylon strap that goes around your dog’s snout. And the leash connects to the halter under your dog’s chin. Both of these added features provide you with more control of what your dog is looking at. Teaching your dog to ignore a distraction has a lot to do with making your dog pay attention to you, and only you.There are several methods you can teach your dog:Avoidance - Sometimes the problem isn’t your dog, but maybe the dog coming in the opposite direction. Instead of walking past the oncoming dog, train your dog to reverse directions.
The L Pattern - The L pattern method can be used to position your dog off to the side of the path you’re on, facing away from the path. If you see something distracting coming towards you, turn your dog to the left or right. Walk your dog just off the path and use the sit command. Keep your dog sitting there - looking at you - until the distraction has gone by.
Repeated Sits - When you see a distraction coming towards, regardless of whether they’ll pass on your left or right side, repeated sit trains your dog to sit and face you. Your dog remains sitting until the distraction has passed. Depending on the situation, you can train your dog to sit facing away from the oncoming distraction, or facing the distraction with their head tilted away, looking at you.
Speed Up - Most methods require that you stop your dog while the distraction is near, and wait to resume your walk after the distraction has passed. An alternative is to simply pick up the pace when the distraction approaches, and slow down again after the distraction passes.

Consider your dog's breed.,
Take your dog's age into account.,
Respond to your dog's cues for more exercise.",How to Give Your Small Dog Enough Exercise1," Research your dog's breed for specific exercise requirements and talk with the vet for specific recommendations. It's important for your small dog to get exercise, especially to reduce the risk of obesity and joint problems. You'll also need to tailor the types of exercise to your dog's breed.For example, small terriers and toy breeds will thrive with a few 15 minute walks a day along with active games inside or outside the house. Small terriers will enjoy tag and hide-and-go-seek while toy breeds will want to play fetch.;
, While you can get breed-specific exercise requirements, you'll also need to consider your dog's age and activity level. Work closely with your dog's veterinarian to determine the right amount of exercise based on your dog's age.For example, puppies will require more exercise than a senior dog with health conditions regardless of breed.

, Watch your small dog for signs that it needs more exercise. If it needs more activity, your dog may become aggressive or bark because it's bored. For example, your dog might begin tearing up the furniture or barking at every person it sees if it doesn't get enough physical activity. Other signs your dog needs more exercise include:Running through the house
Playing rough (nipping or biting)
Digging, scratching, or chewing on household things
Whining for attention

Pick a play appropriate for your breed.,
Just let your dog run.,
Play Fetch.,
Focus on agility exercises.,
Exercise with your dog.,
Talk to your vet about strength training with your dog.,
Take your dog to the vet regularly.,
Feed your dog at the same time every day.,
Find foods with a high protein content and natural ingredients.,
Provide plenty of clean water every day.,
Make your dog work for their food.,
Don't feed dogs table scraps.",How to Keep Your Dog in Shape," Just like playing basketball isn't appropriate for all people, playing fetch isn't appropriate for all dogs. But all dogs need to engage in some kind of activity and play to remain healthy. Learn more about your particular breed, and your particular dog, to see what works best for your pet.


Retrieving breeds like spaniels or labs might prefer catch, fetch and swimming.
Smaller breeds like collies and corgis might appreciate agility classes, which teach dogs to jump and herd.
Draft dogs, like huskies and bernards, might like ski-joring, sledding, and endurance runs.;
, The single best way to get a dog some exercise? Just let it run around. Whether it's running free or chasing a stick, giving your dog some off-leash freedom to run at top speed is the best and easiest way to keep your pet healthy and in shape. Find a dog park in your area to give your dog some space, and let your pet play with other dogs to socialize.


If you don't live near a dog park you can always go to a regular public park where dogs are allowed, or a playground. Be certain to check and obey local leash laws or other possible regulations.

, Playing fetch is a fun way to ensure your dogs gets regular exercise. Most dogs, especially retrievers or other sporting breeds, will fetch balls, sticks, and toys without even needing to be trained. Other dogs can learn to play with very little effort.


Some people find it difficult to play this game because of local leash laws or disobedient dogs that would run away if unleashed. Fetch leashes are available, however, for this purpose. They're made of strong materials, such as Kevlar, and come in 25ft, 50ft or even 75ft sizes.
If you can't find a leash that long, or if you want an extra long leash, simply tie two or more leashes together. with a long leash, a dog can safely run after a ball, stick or Frisbee while remaining under control and obeying leash laws. this allows a dog tremendous freedom in a controlled environment.

, Dogs can do all sorts of agility training. There are even professional agility competitions and obstacle courses for experts. Stretching, ""dog yoga,"" jumping, climbing, tunneling, crawling, swimming and balancing are all parts of agility training. For small, mobile breeds, this is an excellent way to get in shape and stay active.


How to get your dog agility trained? Sign them up for a class at a local dog park, or take them there yourself. Most dog parks have the necessary equipment to preform all sorts of fun agility training. you can also buy or build various see-saws, hurdles, tunnels or obstacles for use in your own backyard.

, Human exercises, such as jogging, or other outdoor activities can be great opportunities to bond with your animal and to get a workout at the same time. If you regularly workout in the great outdoors, take your dog with you. If you're just going for a long walk after work to cool down, bring the dog along with you.

, Most owners don't think of strength training a dog, but it's sometimes appropriate for medium-sized or large dogs who are healthy enough to do it. It's especially effective with working dogs.


Dogs can be fit with weighted harnesses or be latched to light wagons or sleighs. Walking or doing light activity under load for short amounts of time can strengthen the dogs muscles, just like a work out at the gym.Again, be certain to check with a vet before attempting this type of exercise and never put the dog under too much weight or stress the dog for long amounts of time.

, Consult your veterinarian before starting a hard-core exercise regime, and start sensible. Humans who do crazy work-outs after months of inactivity can end up with stress fractures and pulled muscles, and the same is true for dogs. Make sure your pet doesn't have any musculoskeletal problems like joint dysplasia that might be worsened by heavy running, and stick to low-impact activities like walking or swimming for animals if needed.


Make sure all pets are up to date on vaccinations and treatments for other medical conditions.

, Dogs' diets need to be kept consistent. If you're feeding your dog whenever you remember, they're not getting the proper nutrition and digestive health that they deserve. Most adult dogs in good health should be fed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.


Always talk to your vet about nutritional requirements for your particular breed and your particular dog. Some older dogs will eat less food, while young pups will need as many as 3-4 feedings a day to ensure proper development.

, A lot of main brand pet foods have high amounts of corn and other ""filler"" feeds. Try to find foods with higher protein content, or consult your vet on proper nutrition. Many dog owners find it effective to mix a small amount of canned ""wet"" dog food with a proper serving of kibble for your dog. This adds added nutrients, textures, and helps street the more expensive canned food a little farther.


Dried dog food has been often linked to digestive and urinary tract issues in dogs.Often, dog owners very concerned about their pets' health will opt to make their own dog food.

, Dogs need access to clean drinking water at all times, and will drink nearly as much as you do in a given day, up to eight cups, or one ounce per pound of body weight.If your dog doesn't drink as much as you think it should, change the water more regularly, or think about providing a water ""fountain"" which will bubble constantly. If the dog bowl looks gross and dirty to you, it probably looks gross and dirty to the dog as well.

, The best dog trainers hand-feed their animals, doling out bits of kibble as rewards for sits, stays, comes, heeling on the leash, or helping reinforce clicker training. If you don't have this kind of time though, you can increase the amount of time and energy the dog spends eating.


Try doing a kibble treasure hunt. Throw the dog kibble into long grass. That way, the dog has to spend some time rummaging around for it, rather than just bolting it down in two seconds flat.
Put food in rubber toys. Freezing beef broth or peanut butter inside toys can provide hours of entertainment, thereby lowering stress levels, and helping your dog feel full.

, The number one way to get your dog out of shape? Too many bites from the table. Even though it's tempting to give the pet little bacon bits and other food bites, those calories add up and the high salt and fat content can be chaotic on a dog's digestive system. Keep the people food for the people.


Feed your dog high-quality dog treats, instead of providing chicken bones or other ""human"" treats. Sow ears, rawhide chews, and dental bones are all better choices than a ham hock.
If your dog is a bigger when you're eating, don't give in. Instead, work on training your dog not to beg.

Take your small dog to the dog park.,
Try a variety of exercises.,
Exercise with your small dog.,
Keep the dog active around the house.,
Try a new activity with your dog.,
Create physical and mental challenges for your dog.",How to Give Your Small Dog Enough Exercise2," Dog parks are a great way to let your dog off the leash so it can explore and stretch its legs. Before you go to the dog park, ensure that your dog responds to basic commands so you can call it back to you, if needed. Keep an eye on your small dog since there may be larger or more aggressive dogs at the park.Check the dog parks to see if they have a small dog section or offer small dog play times.

, You can easily play tug-of-war or fetch, go for walks, or take it swimming. If you play fetch, ensure that the ball is large enough that your small dog won't choke on it when it's retrieving the ball. If you take your dog out for exercise, your dog should be responsive to commands or you may need to train it. Doing different physical activities will help you learn what your dog enjoys to do, making it easier to get the exercise it needs.


Although your small dog can easily walk or jog, it won't be able to exercise as long as a larger breed would., Make your dog's exercise part of your daily routine and so you both form healthy habits. Just ensure that you tailor your routine to fit your dog's needs. For example, if you're training for a half-marathon, it's fine to jog your dog, but it probably won't be able to keep up with you for an extended period of time.If you have a pug, Boston terrier, or any flat-faced breed, you should limit your runs to under five miles. This is because some flat-faced dogs may struggle to breathe while running.

, It's not always possible to take your small dog outside for exercise, especially if it's too hot or cold out. However, your dog will still need to exercise. Play simple indoor games like making it jump, offering exercise balls, and giving mental games like food puzzle toys.Watch your dog when you let it into the yard. If it's only pacing or sniffing around, it's probably not getting enough exercise. Go outside with your small dog and chase it around, help it run laps, and get it moving.

, If you or your small dog are getting tired of the same walk or run around the neighborhood, explore a new environment. Put your dog on the leash and take it to a new part of town. Let the dog lead you so it can check out anything it's interested in.


You could take your small dog on a gentle hike through the forest. Let the dog sniff and examine things along the trail.
Take your dog along with you when you do contained activities like canoeing or kayaking.

, Remember that small dogs can get exercise from simple activities that we often overlook. Have your dog run up and down the stairs with you for an easy work out. You could also create a climbing obstacle course by stacking cushions, pillows, and chairs for your dog to scramble on.


You could also hide doggie treats around the house for your dog. This will motivate it to run around and explore its environment.

Set up the treadmill.,
Familiarize your dog with the treadmill.,
Get your dog to walk on the treadmill while it's turned off.,
Let your dog come near the treadmill while you use it.,
Have your dog walk on the treadmill at its lowest speed.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Build up to higher speeds and longer periods.,
Choose the right treadmill.,
Look for certain features.,
Be safe.",How to Get a Dog to Use a Treadmill," Before you can begin training your dog, you'll need to set the treadmill up in the proper fashion.


The treadmill should be positioned so it is not facing the wall and your dog will not be facing the wall when walking on it. You don't want your dog to think she's going to walk into the wall if she uses the treadmill.;
, Your dog will not get on the treadmill right away. As it's a new piece of machinery, she will need time and patience to familiarize herself with the device.


Always introduce your dog to a new treadmill with the machine turned off first. If a dog encounters a treadmill while it's on and making noise, she can easily become frightened.Allow your dog to sniff the treadmill and familiarize herself with the machine for a few days. Let her get used to the new object in her home.Try to turn the treadmill into a positive object. Feed your dog meals and treats around the treadmill. Place her water bowl and toys near it., Once your dog is familiar enough with the treadmill that she remains calm in its presence, try to urge her to walk on it while it's turned off.


You can use treats to lure your dog onto the treadmill. While using the treats to get her to walk on the treadmill, use a verbal command like ""Get on"" to reinforce this behavior.Praise your dog the second she steps on the treadmill and give her a treat.Practice getting your dog on the treadmill a few times a day. Once she gets on the treadmill in response to the command ""Get on"" the majority of the time, you can move on to letting her walk on the treadmill., Once your dog is familiar with the treadmill while it's turned off, allow her to interact with it while it's running.


Use the treadmill on the lowest possible speed in front of your dog. Allow her sniff the treadmill while it's in use and observe you walking on it.If possible, use the command ""Get on"" to see if your dog is comfortable walking on the back of the treadmill with you as you use it on a low speed. It may take a few days or weeks before she's comfortable enough watching the treadmill in action to climb on while it's moving., Once your dog is familiar with the treadmill in action, you can start having her use it while it's moving.


Leash up your dog first. Hold the leash upwards as she steps onto the machine. Then, switch the treadmill on to the lowest setting.Your dog might adapt quickly to walking on the treadmill but she might also be frightened and resist. You may have to stand in front of the treadmill holding her leash and urging with treats and encouragement to stay on.Start small. Use 30 seconds to 1 minute sessions on the lowest setting until your dog is comfortable using the treadmill regularly., Throughout the process of training your dog, use positive reinforcement to encourage her to use the treadmill.


Use treats and praise when your dog stays on the treadmill.Dogs live in the present, so it's important to use reinforcement the second she correctly follows a command. As soon as she steps on the treadmill, for example, verbally praise her and give her a treat.If your dog begins to look unhappy or distressed, stop the session. Dogs use their faces and bodies to display their emotions. Some of the signs that your dog may be upset include his eyes being larger than normal, his mouth closed with his lips slightly pulled back at the corners, and his tail lowered between his legs or tucked up against his stomach., As you continue to make your dog use the treadmill, gradually speed up the intensity of the workout.


Once your dog is comfortable on the treadmill for 1 minute, build up to 2-3 minute sessions and eventually 5-minute ones. Most dogs need 20 to 30 minutes of physical exercise a day, so try to work your way up to this timeframe.Depending on your dog's fitness level, you can experiment with different speeds and intensity levels. If your dog is overweight, you might want to strive to gradually increase her workout's intensity to get her in shape., There are a variety of treadmill types and you want to make sure you choose the right one for your dog.


Animal powered treadmills are specifically designed for animal use, and prices range from $300 to $600. If you don't plan on using the treadmill yourself and only intend to use it for your dog's workout, this might be a good option.Motorized treadmills, designed for human use, tend to be more expensive. Prices range from $500-$5,000 depending on what features you get. They can usually be used safely by dogs if you take proper precautions. If you plan on using the treadmill as well, you should get a motorized treadmill. If the device is only for your dog, you might want to save money and go with an animal treadmill., Depending on your fitness goals for your dog, certain features might be necessary.


Incline control allows you to increase the intensity of the walking surface to make the workout more effective. If you're training your dog for fitness or agility events, or your dog is severely overweight, this feature can help get your dog in shape.Track length is based on the size of your dog. Smaller dogs, like beagles and and small terriers, would best be suited for a 29 by 14 inch length. Medium sized dogs, like Australian shepherds, boxers, and spaniels, would benefit from a 47 by 17 inch track. Anything bigger would require a 75 by 17 inch track.A treadmill with a time and distance meter can help you track how many miles your dog is running in how much time. This is probably only necessary if you're trying to get your dog in shape for a marathon or competition. It might not be needed for casual exercise., Certain safety precautions should be taken when using a treadmill with your dog.


Do not feed a dog before a strenuous workout. This can cause cramping, abdominal pain, and even vomiting.Always use a leash, but never tie a dog to a treadmill and leave her unsupervised. This can lead to injury and even death.You should start off before each work with a slow, steady walk for a warm-up and then slow down the pace again towards the end of a workout to allow your dog to cool down."

, Those barks means he's letting you know that a stranger is approaching.

, Those are just a greeting bark to a familiar person.

, Those barks means he's happy and wants to share his good mood with you.

, Those barks means he wants you to pay attention to him (such as going for a walk).

, These barks means he's telling you that you've gone too far. He wants you to back off and give him a little space, and some time to relax.

, These mean he's detected something that he doesn't understand(unfamiliar sound/scent). he's frustrated by his inability to understand what you want from him.

, This bark means he may have experienced a moment of pain. Check him for boo-boos of sharp objects or ticks/insects carefully.

, These growls mean he wants you to back off and leave him alone. If he tell you this when he encounters a strange dog, back off and listen to him.

, This growl is an aggressive response to a threat, and it's apt to be followed by a snap/bite. If it's a strange dog, leave well enough alone. If he's yours, don't immediately try to assert your dominance. Wait until the mood changes for comfort.

, This growl means he's prepared to stand up for himself, even though he's unsure what the outcome will be.

, This growl is a sign of contentment.

, Your dog is fearing the unknown. It is the sound dogs make in the vet's waiting room. A sooth pat and some soft encouraging words will help him cope.

, These reflect an intensification of anxiety (seriously full bladder at the door). Therefore, it could be thought that these can be a plea for help.

, These mean that he's waving a white flag, hoping to avoid a fight, in which he expects he'll get pummeled.

This can ensure that you get it enough activity so that it doesn’t get bored or exhibit destructive behaviors. Most dogs in the hunting, working, or herding groups are high energy. These groups include retrievers, hounds, collies, spaniels, pointers, and shepherds. Some specific dog breeds that are high energy include:Alaska Malamute
Bernese Mountain
Norwich Terrier
Shetland Sheepdog
Weimaraner;
, Simply taking your high energy dog for one or two short walks isn’t enough activity, nor is letting it loose in the backyard. High energy dogs need more exercise than low energy breeds. In general, they will need at least 30 minutes of vigorous exercise every day as well 1-2 hours of additional activity. Some great ways to meet your high energy dog’s both indoors and outdoors include:Walking
Running
Swimming
Climbing and/ or running up stairs
Throwing toys
Enjoying time in a fenced-in yard
Obstacle courses, High energy dogs are easily bored if they have nothing to do and destroy furniture, pillows, clothing or other household items as a result.Watching your high energy dog’s behavior can signal if it needs more exercise or activity.Some signs your dog may have energy to burn include:


Barking or whining
Digging
Jumping
Restlessness
Chewing, nipping, or biting
Scratching, High energy dogs need regular exercise as a result of their evolution. Your breed may require as many as 2 ½ hours of activity every day.This may be a lot of time if you are very busy. Setting a daily activity schedule can keep your high energy dog healthy and happy. The routine helps your dog anticipate it and may minimize unwanted behaviors.Establish a specific time every day for 30 minutes of vigorous activity with your dog. For example, set aside 30 minutes every morning to run. If you don’t run, let your dog run in an enclosed yard or dog park for 30 minutes. You could also play fetch or blow bubbles specifically designed for dogs to chase.Incorporate a brisk walk of about an hour every day, too. Break this into two 30-minute walks if need be.
Adjust your dog’s exercise routine as necessary. For example, if you have an appointment and get home early, use the extra time to engage your high energy dog.

, Just like people, every dog has a distinct personality. Your dog may run or play harder in certain place or with specific activities. Take at least one day to do something with your dog that you both enjoy but can’t get to daily. You could do any of the following “doggy and me” activities:Running
Inline skating
Bicycling
HikingSwimmingJumping over obstacles, If it is extremely cold or hot outside, it’s safer to keep your dog inside except for potty breaks. You can still give your high energy dog plenty of activity even if you are indoors.This can also be a great way to give your high energy dog activity if you are worn out or physically unwell. Doing any of the following can ensure your high energy gets enough activity and exercise so that it doesn’t get bored:Running up the stairs with your dog
Playing fetch up the stairsHiding treats around the house or in toysPlaying keep away
Kicking around dog exercise ballsSetting up an obstacle course

, A backyard is a great space to give your dog some activity. It’s not sufficient as a form of exercise, but can help burn off extra energy if you are worn out or otherwise unwell. Make sure to always supervise your dog in a fenced-in yard space.Turn outdoor time into exercise time, even you are unwell or worn out. You can easily do this by sitting outside or in a doorway and throwing you dog a ball, Frisbee, or other item to retrieve for you. Incorporate some games of tug while you’re watching your dog for added activity.Consider a dog park as an alternative to a yard space. This can help your dog get exercise and activity that burns energy—and boredom.

, Your dog may be hungry when it comes in from outside or after an indoor activity. Feeding your dog by using smart toys such as Kongs, Buster Cubes, Squirrel Dudes, and Tug-a-Jugs can provide vital activity and mental stimulation that requires little effort on your part.


Consider giving your dog some of its regular food when you get home so it’s not starving. Then put the rest into a smart toy.
Recognize that this is a great way to keep your dog busy when you are not home, feeling unwell, or unable to provide more activity because of external factors.

, It may be difficult at times to live with your high energy dog. This is true if you are worn out, physically unwell, or stressed out. Enlist the help of family members or friends with your dog. Many people are more than happy to help out with a cute pet. This can give you a needed break and provide your dog with the necessary activity to burn its energy and stay content.


Consider asking friends who have children to give you a hand. Kids often love dogs and have similar amounts of energy to run around and play games.

, Because of this, high energy dogs need more stimulation and are more prone to separation anxiety. This can be especially true if you have to leave your dog for 8-10 hours a day. Separation anxiety can lead to inactivity as well as cause boredom and destructive behaviors. Making a safe space that mimics a den can ensure your high energy dog gets enough activity and doesn’t develop separation anxiety.Put the dog in a dog-proof room or its crate. Make it comfortable with familiar toys, food and water, and other things to keep it busy such as chew sticks.Leave a piece of your recently worn clothing to provide your dog extra comfort.

, Your high energy dog will still need activity even in a doggy den. Providing it toys can help your dog get exercise and entertainment until you get home. Consider putting the following toys in your dog’s space:Hard rubber toys for chewing and carrying around
Rope toys
Balls
“Busy box” toys with hiding places for snacks.
Soft, stuffed and/or squeaky toys
Chew toys, Your high energy dog may have more activity needs than you can accommodate. If you need to leave for longer periods of time, consider putting your dog in day care. You can also employ a professional dog walker. Both can provide attention and activity when you can’t. Your dog should always return home happy and worn out from day care or time with a dog walker.Save the contact information for a couple of dependable dog walkers. They can help you in a pinch or if one is on vacation or otherwise unavailable.

Keep your dog on a leash.,
Place a lifejacket on your dog.,
Make sure your dog can swim.,
Put a pet ramp on your boat.",How to Protect Your Dog Around Natural Water Sources2," When you are walking with your dog around bodies of water, keep them on a leash. This protects them from running off into potentially dangerous water, especially before you have a chance to make sure it is safe.A leash also protects them from other dangers, like predators and getting lost or separated from you.

, Taking your dog with you on my your boat, kayak, or canoe can be fun for you and your dog. However, your dog may be at risk if the kayak or canoe flips, or if your boat capsizes. To help protect your dog, even if they are a good swimmer, put a life jacket on your dog any time they are in a boat.You can find pet life jackets at pet stores.

, Before you let your dog free in the lake, river, or ocean, you should figure out if they can swim. If they cannot, then don’t force them into the water. You and your dog can have fun splashing around.If your dog is new to water and swimming, get them used to water slowly. You may consider swimming lessons from a professional dog trainer.

, If you have your dog in your boat, consider putting a pet ramp on the boat. This helps your dog be able to get in and out of the water easily so you can keep them safe while still letting them have fun swimming.Always help your dog in and out of the boat, even if you have a pet ramp. Always watch to make sure they’re safe.

Avoid letting your dog swim too far out.,
Respect all signs around the water.,
Test the water temperature.,
Protect your dog from snakes.,
Supervise your pet.",How to Protect Your Dog Around Natural Water Sources3," When your dog is at lakes, rivers, and the ocean, don’t let them swim too far out. Dogs can tire easily and may not realize how far they have swum out before turning around. Lakes and oceans can get deep very fast. This can be a risk to your dog.Keep your dog close to you and to the shore to avoid fatigue and any drowning risk.

, Pay attention to all signs posted around the body of water. If there are signs around the water saying “Do Not Swim” or “Beach Closed,” this means your dog should stay out of the water and area, too.This ensures that your dog stays safe.

, Though it may be a warm day, the water in the lake, river, or ocean may not be warm enough for your dog to swim in. Always test the water before you let your dog go in to make sure it is not too cold.If your dog goes swimming in cold water, it can lead to hypothermia.

, Snakes are common around sources of natural water, especially rivers and lakes. When you are with your dog in areas that are prone to snakes, you should keep your dog on a leash. Keep them close to you and don’t let them go running off where you can’t see.Keep your dog out of places where snakes may hide, like areas with tall grass and piles of wood.
If your dog gets bitten by a snake, take them to the vet immediately.

, Whenever your pet is around a body of water, you should make sure to supervise them. Accidents can happen suddenly, and your dog may drown quickly. By watching your dog, you ensure their safety.Keeping an eye on your dog also means you keep others safe. For example, if your dog is running around, they might trip someone or push another pet into the water.
If you do not want to worry about supervising your dog while you are at the water, leave them at home.

Know your breed or breed type of dog.,
Now that you know your dog's breed (or breed type), you must know the natural instincts they have.,
Fact: To really have a happy sporting dog, they ALL enjoy flyball and excel in obedience!,
Take your dog(s) for a daily walk.,
Be the pack leader.",How to Understand Dogs and Their Environments," This will help you to achieve his special needs that have to do with his instincts. If you have a mixed breed dog, you can buy a breed test kit from www.wisdompanel.com. If you don't want to spend the money, buy some breed books (example: The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds), look at the different characteristics of the breeds, relate them to your dog, and figure which breeds your dog resembles the most. If your dog is a mix of many breeds, find out which breed instincts stand out in him. For example, if your dog is a Bloodhound mix most likely your dog's scent hound traits will stand out, because Bloodhounds were bred to be scent dogs, nothing really precise.;
, ,Dogs in the sporting group were bred to spend days of dashing through the fields, finding land and waterfowl for their masters. Read here if you have a Sporting Dog (aka: Gundog Group)


Retrievers: If you have a retriever (ex: Golden Retriever), your dog has a natural instinct to retrieve. Every day, throw your adult retriever a ball, stick, toy, frisbee (you get the point!) to get his retrieving instincts intact. You can throw the ball until he gets tired. (If you have a puppy try to stop earlier or you can put stress on their joints.) (If you have a senior dog, 7 years of age or older, let them stop when they get tired! They aren't 2 anymore!!!) If you have dogs 1 and a half years and older (up to seven), take your retriever on walks daily, or whenever you get the chance! If your dogs are younger, take them on short, brisk walks every few days, not too much though or you could put stress on their joints.






Pointers: Pointers need to retrieve just like retrievers do, but they also need to ""point"". Use their natural pointing instincts daily by doing games with hiding treats.






Setters: Setters have the same need as pointers.
Spaniels: Spaniels are like retrievers, except smaller. Do the same thing as with the retrievers.







, (since they have so much stamina, they also enjoy Agility)! Also, try to get these dogs into the AKC retriever trials.


If you have a dog in the Hound Group (this also includes sight hounds), read:






Scent hounds (ex: Bloodhound, Beagle, Harrier, etc.): These dogs have a natural instinct to smell! To encourage their instincts and keep them active and interested, hide tidbits of treats in corners of the house. Then say, ""go find them!"" and your dog will race around, trying to sniff out where the treats are! A lot of hounds have high energy levels, so exercise them often.
Coonhounds (Black and Tan Coonhound, Redbone Coonhound, Treeing Walker Coonhound, Plott, etc.) : Coonhounds have basically the same needs as scent hounds, put they also need to ""tree"". In addition to hiding tidbits around the yard, hide some in trees too, put make sure they are big enough to be spotted.
Sight hounds (greyhounds, afghan hounds, Saluki, etc.)- These dogs use their site. Let them chase balls, and let them RUN!!! These dogs are VERY energetic.

Special Hound Breed, Dachshund- The dachshund is the most unusual hound, they have the same instincts as scent hounds, but also are quite like terriers. They were once almost classified as terriers! Do the same things as you would scent hounds, but do the terrier stuff too. Get them into earthdog trials.




Terrier (if you have a terrier, read:)






Terriers (Dandie Dinmont terriers, Welsh Terrier, West Highland Terrier, Cairns, etc.): These dogs need to DIG. Hide their favorite toys in a small hole in the ground. Cover it with dirt. Encourage them to dig, dig, DIG, until they find their toy! They also have a high energy level, so take them on walks, and exercise them often. If you can, get them into earthdog trials.


Herding Dogs (if you have a herding dog, read:)






Herding Dogs (German shepherds, Rough Collies, Belgian Malinois, etc.): These dogs have a natural instinct to herd. If you can, get them into herding trials, but if you can't, these dogs were born for a JOB. Herding dogs excel in sports such as agility, obedience, and much more. They require frequent exercise also.


Working Dogs






Working Dogs (Rottweiler, Doberman Pinscher, Giant Schnauzer, etc.): Each of these dogs was born for a specific job. Each breed was bred individually for different purposes. For example, if you have an Alaskan Malamute, you should get him into weight pulling or sled racing. If you have a Doberman, that's a different story! Research your breed, find out what they were bred for. But remember, all of these dogs have one thing in common: They have a job. You need to get them into sports or have lots of exercise and training.


Non-Sporting Dogs






Non-Sporting Dogs (Chow-Chows, Dalmatians, Miniature and Standard Poodle, etc.): These dogs each have their own individual needs. Research your breed and find out what it needs to stay healthy and happy.


Toy Dogs






Toy Dogs (Yorkshire Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Pekingese and most famous, Chihuahua, etc.): These dogs were bred to be companions. All they want is to be with you! Do things together, but make sure that if your breed still has an instinct (some of these dogs are ""minis"" of others) to maintain it. For example, a Cavalier still has retrieving instincts. Yorkies still have terrier instincts. These dogs need exercise, love, and attention.



, The canine species has an instinct to migrate. No matter how much exercise and affection you give your dog, a dog cannot be happy if it isn't taken for daily walks. Heel!

, Small Dog Syndrome is a common problem (no disease, don't be TOO scared) when a dog thinks he is pack leader to humans. This puts a lot of stress on Fido.

Pick a can with a heavier lid.,
Weight the lid if necessary.,
Think about a can with a lockable lid.,
Get a motion-activated opening trash can.,
Don't forget about the bathroom trash cans as well.",How to Dog Proof Your Trash Can1," Instead of a plastic trash can, use a heavier metal can with a lid for your garbage. Small plastic cans are easy to tip over, even if they're hard to reach and relatively clean. This can make that garbage pretty tempting for your dog.


Metal cans don't have to look industrial. Lots of sleek, modern looking metal trash cans are available at most home goods stores. These are difficult to tip over and look great in your kitchen.;
, The lid of the can is the most important part. If your can already has a lid and your dog can still get into it, you might consider weighting it with something on top to keep things in place.


Use a heavy book, a break rotor, or a couple of plates on the top of the can. That thing won't move.

, Lots of trash cans are available with closeable lids, operated by foot pedals, or little latches that you can open quite easily. They can get pretty fancy. If your dog's tenacious about nosing open the trash, even if you've got a lid on it, these can be a great dog-proofing mechanism.

, The high-end of garbage technology is the motion-activated can, which will only open with the wave of a hand or a touch in the proper spot. If you want to make sure your trash can outsmarts your dog, this is the way to go.


The downside is that these can be pretty expensive, and are still always susceptible to tipping. They're usually a bit heavier, but if you have a really big dog, it's probably still able to knock it over.

, Some dogs are big fans of tissues and other hygiene products that end up in your bathroom trash, and these trash-diggings can sometimes go unnoticed for longer. Make sure these trash cans have lids as well, or are placed high enough so your dog can't get to them.

Most dogs need 30-60 minutes of exercise every day.Your dog can get this exercises through a variety of outdoor and indoor activities. These might include:


Walking
Running
Swimming
Climbing and/ or running up stairs
Throwing toys
Obstacle courses;
, The amount of exercise your large dog needs depends in part on its breed. Certain breeds used for hunting or herding will need the most exercise, whereas a short-nosed breed such as a boxer will need less. If your dog is in ill health, speak to its vet about appropriate amounts of exercise.Exercise breeds in hunting, working, or herding groups will need at least 30 minutes of vigorous exercise and 1-2 hours of activity every day. Breeds in this group include Labrador retrievers, hounds, collies and shepherds. Other dogs that need this much exercise are pointers and spaniels.Be aware that some large dog breeds won’t need much exercise. Aim to get the following breeds 30-60 minutes of activity each day: bulldogs, bull mastiffs, Great Danes, greyhounds, and Old English sheepdogs. In some cases, your dog’s personality and ability may warrant more or less.
Recognize that it can be difficult to gauge how much exercise mixed breeds need. If you have an idea of what heritage your dog has, follow exercise guidelines for that breed. If you don’t, consider asking your vet what breed the dog may be and adjust your exercise program accordingly.

, Dogs are very sensitive animals and can provide signals about their needs. This is true for exercise, too. Paying attention to your dog’s behavior can also inform you about if it needs more exercise or activity or is content to get some rest.Some signs your dog may want more exercise include:


Restlessness
Pacing around
Racing through the houseRough play
Excited nipping or biting
Digging
Scratching
Destructive chewing

, Dogs require physical activity as a result of their evolutionary development as pack and work animals.Your large dog may need up to 2 ½ hours of exercise and activity every day, which can be a lot if you have a busy schedule. Having a set daily schedule for exercising can ensure that your dog gets enough physical activity to maintain its health and happiness. The routine helps your dog anticipate it and may minimize unwanted behaviors.Fix a specific time each day to get 30 minutes of vigorous activity with your large dog. For example, you could schedule a 30-minute run together in the mornings before work or school. If you’re not a runner, consider taking your dog to the yard, a field, or dog park for 30 minutes. Do an activity that is vigorous for your dog but easy on you such as fetching or blowing bubbles specifically designed for dogs.Aim for a long walk of about an hour in addition to the vigorous exercise. You can also break this into two 30-minute walks.
Adjust your dog’s exercise routine as necessary. For example, if you have an early meeting, see if you can sneak out to run the dog at lunch.

, Every dog has a personality. You may recognize that your dog plays harder or is happier after certain types of exercise. You may enjoy these, too. Incorporate activities that you and your dog love as much as you are able. This can make it easier to ensure your large dog gets enough exercise and can strengthen your bond.Set aside at least one day to do an activity you and your dog both love but may not be possible every day. For example, if you have work or school, you may have off weekends. On a Saturday or Sunday, you can let your dog run as you ride your bike or go for a nature hike.

, Regular walks are important to a dog’s health and happiness. One way to make them fun is going for brisk walks where you follow your dog on a lead or leash. This can fulfill your dog’s need for exercise and to travel and explore.Follow your large dog for a brisk 30-40 minute walk at least once a day and ideally twice. This can ensure your dog’s gets enough exercise and brain releases feel-good hormones.
Allow your dog to sniff around and decide where to go as long as it is not pulling on the leash. Doing so may promote dominance and bad leash manners. Guide the dog with verbal commands if it starts to pull at the leash. A gentle “This way, Spot” gives your dog the sense that it can explore while maintaining your authority.

, If you’re very active physically, the easiest way to give your large dog enough exercise is doing activities together. This can ensure that both you and your dog stay fit and happy. Some exercises you can do together include:Running
Inline skating
Bicycling
HikingSwimmingJumping over obstacles, Many areas have designated dog parks that allow off-leash activity for dogs. This can be a great way for your large dog to get its daily recommended exercise as well as romp around with other dogs.Watch your dog while you’re at the park, which can cue you into when your dog is tired. This is also important because not all dogs play nicely with one another.

, If the weather is extremely cold or hot, it may not be safe for your dog to exercise outside.You may be injured and unable to go outside. Even if outdoor exercise isn’t an option, you can ensure your large dog gets enough activity every day with indoor activities. The following activities can provide your large dog its recommended daily exercise:Running up the stairs with your dog
Playing fetch
Hiding treats around the house
Playing keep away
Kicking around dog exercise ballsSetting up an obstacle course

, If you work or attend school, you may need to leave your dog at home. Your dog will still need activity during this time. Leaving toys for your large dog can help it get enough exercise. They can also provide entertainment until you get home. Consider providing the following toys to your dog:Hard rubber toys for chewing and carrying around
Rope toys
Balls
“Busy box” toys with hiding places for snacks
Soft, stuffed and/or squeaky toys
Dirty laundry that smells like you

, You may find that your dog needs more exercise that your schedule permits. If this is the case, consider taking your dog to doggy day care or hiring a professional dog walker. These can fill in where you can’t. A day care or walker will exercise both your dog’s body and mind.Recognize your dog should come home worn out and happy from a day care or dog walker.

Put the trash can in an inaccessible location.,
Secure your trash can to the wall.,
Take your trash out more regularly.,
Always dispose of toxic substances properly.",How to Dog Proof Your Trash Can2," If you want to keep the dog away from the trash can, keep it away from the dog. Put it under the sink where a dog can't get at it, or in a side room or closet that you can keep closed. If you have a very small dog, put the can up higher on a stool. If your dog is large, put the can in an alternative location, such as:


Coat closet.
Washing room.
Front room or mud room.
Garage.
Outside.

, If you have a really big dog, it's sometimes necessary to fix the garbage can to the wall so the can can't be knocked over. Use a sturdy metal can and fix it to a beam in a fixture or a wall in an appropriate location.


Sometimes, it's helpful to do this in an out-of-the-way location, since it looks kind of weird to have an unmovable garbage can in the middle of your kitchen.
Put it in a closet adjacent to your kitchen.

, A smelly garbage can with lots of food in it is going to tempt even well-trained dogs. Take your garbage out as soon as the can gets full, instead of letting the can sit and stuffing the trash down.


Consider taking things such as meat wrappers, leftovers and other pieces of garbage with very attractive scents immediately to the garbage bin outside, instead of putting them in the kitchen trash can.

, Some bigger dogs are just good at getting into trash cans, even if the dogs are well-trained and even if you take good care of your garbage. If you fear that your dog might consume something that will harm it, dispose of those materials properly.


Batteries, paint, oils and other nasty substances should always be taken directly to collection points. Read this article to find out more about getting rid of toxic substances.

Teach your dog to avoid the trash can.,
Never rub the dog's face in the garbage.,
Use an environmental punishment.,
Associate the garbage can with a loud sound.,
Feed the dog elsewhere.,
Put up room dividers to keep the dog out of the kitchen.,
Spray the trash can with citrus.",How to Dog Proof Your Trash Can3," Maybe the best way to dog-proof your garbage can is to train your dog to stay away from it. Be firm and react swiftly if you see the dog nosing around the garbage can. If you see your dog approach the can with interest, say ""No"" or ""Off"" firmly and grab the dog by the collar and lead it elsewhere.Prevention is key. If a dog gets in the garbage can once, it's likely to happen again. It's important to react swiftly when you see your dog start to nose around the garbage can.Spraying a bitter apple or other spray with a nasty taste into the dog's face is sometimes effective. These are harmless and relatively cheap sprays and can be found at most pet stores.

, Punishing the dog after the fact will only teach the dog to be afraid of you, not to associate the mess on the floor with its behavior. If you come home to a mess on the floor of the kitchen, it's too late to do any training. Clean up the mess and come up with another prevention plan.


Shock-collars or pads and muzzles are not recommended as a training method to make dogs avoid the garbage can.It's also good to avoid pulling things out of the dog's mouth. This inadvertently teaches the dog that it needs to compete for food, and will make it scavenge more. Encourage the dog to leave the item and reward the dog for obeying, instead of taking it from the dog forcefully.

, Most dogs wait until you're not around to thieve the trash. This makes it much more difficult to keep a dog away from the trash can, but you can do a little planning to make it less likely that the dog will investigate the garbage while you're gone.


Try stacking a few cookie sheets or other lightweight but metallic kitchen items on top of the garbage or on the counter by the garbage can. These items will make a loud sound if the dog disturbs them while investigating the garbage can.
Check local pet stores for motion-activated devices that will trigger a blast of compressed air if anything comes near the garbage can.The devices are safe but can startle sensitive dogs.

, It can be effective to associate the garbage can itself with something you dog doesn't like. If your dog gets nervous around loud sounds, clip a clothes-pin or other little clip on the inside of the trash can, so it will make a loud popping sound when you open the garbage. Commercial mouse-trap-like trainers are also available at pet stores.


Stack things like newspapers underneath the garbage, or use other items that make noise to scare the dog away.
Some dogs may still investigate the garbage can, or even become even more attracted to the can if it makes a sound. Use this technique only if your dog is jumpy around loud sounds.

, Sometimes, dogs will come to associate the kitchen with eating, just as you do. People eat there, the dog is fed there and the delicious-smelling garbage is also there. It's no wonder the dog roots around. To eliminate this connection, feed the dog outside or in another adjacent room of the house.


This can be somewhat of a hassle. But if the dog doesn't ever make it into the kitchen, it's likely that your dog will never get into the garbage can. Make the kitchen a no-dog-zone.

, If you have a small dog, sometimes it's much easier to just make the kitchen an inaccessible place, instead of trying to train the dog to stay away from the garbage. Use small room dividers in the doorways to the kitchen and keep your dog away from the trash can.

, Dogs are often repelled by the scent of citrus. Mix a few tablespoons of lemon juice in warm water with a cap full of vinegar. Put the liquid into a spray bottle and spray the bottom of your trash can each time you take out the trash. After you replace the bag, spray the inside of the bag as well.


Rotten meat and other nasty garbage smells will quickly overpower the citrus scent. Use citrus spray in conjunction with other methods, including changing your garbage more regularly.
Some people like to regularly use basic Lysol disinfectant spray on the trash or in the can, to mask the odors and keep animals away as well.
""Dog repellent"" sprays are commonly sold commercially. Sometimes these are quite expensive and don't work particularly well. Read the ingredients and find out what's in the spray before you buy.

Be sure that you have adequate fencing or walls.,
Consider limiting your dog’s visibility.,
Check for any holes or gaps in the perimeter.,
Get latchable gates.,
Avoid growing plants that are toxic to dogs.You could build a fence around the perimeter of the toxic plants.,
Avoid growing thorny plants.,
Keep tools and chemicals securely locked up.,
Minimize hazards.,
Provide shelter and water.,
Keep the compost out of reach.,
Design your garden with your dog in mind.,
Avoid exposed dirt or soil.,
Plant densely and wisely.,
Secure plant beds and borders.",How to Dog Proof a Garden," If you intend to let your dog roam off-leash in your garden, it should be securely enclosed with sturdy, continuous fencing or walls. The barrier should be high enough to prevent your dog from jumping over it and dense enough to prevent your dog from going through it.Six feet is generally high enough for most dogs. If your dog is an exceptional vertical jumper or a good climber, go for seven or eight feet.
Secure construction materials include vinyl, wood, iron, chain link, concrete, brick, and masonry. Pick the type of perimeter barrier you want according to your budget and taste.
If your dog is especially crafty, they may be able to climb chain link or other fences with gaps or holes that offer potential footholds. Split-rail fences will not keep your dog in because the gaps between the poles are too big.
If you opt for a wooden fence, be sure that the lumber has not been treated with CCA. It’s a chemical that’s toxic to dogs.;
, If your pooch is prone to barking at or chasing after other dogs or animals, it’s a good idea to install solid-paneled privacy fencing. This will prevent them from seeing beyond your garden and help keep bad behavior and excitability under wraps.If your dog is susceptible to outside temptations, don’t use chain-link or picket fencing that gives them a clear view of the surrounding area.

, Once your controlled barrier is in place, be sure that there are no other sneaky ways for your dog to escape. Inspect the bottom of all your fencing or walls, and check the openings under any doors or gates to be sure that your pet can’t wiggle through.If your dog is a determined escape artist or prodigious digger, you may need to create an underground barrier in addition to your fence. Consider installing rebar, wire fencing, or concrete beneath your fencing to prevent your dog from tunneling out.
If your dog keeps digging a hole in the same spot, you can deter them from repeat offenses by covering it with bricks or pavers, filling it with gravel, or simply putting some of their own feces in it., You want any exit from your garden to have a secure closure that your dog is unable to open. Either the latch should be so high that it’s out of their reach or so tricky to work that only human fingers can open it.Remember to always keep gates firmly closed when your dog is out in the garden.

, Many common garden flowers, like Daffodils or Azaleas, are poisonous to pooches. Even vegetables and herbs that are harmless to humans, such as Parsley and Fennel, can be toxic for canines. Dogs can very easily sniff, chew, and ingest plants that are detrimental to their health if left unsupervised, so it’s important to minimize their chances of being poisoned by eliminating high-risk plant species from their stomping grounds.The deadliest plants that result in the most annual poisonings for dogs include: Castor Bean, Caladium, Dumb cane, Rosary Pea, Larkspur, Foxglove, Autumn Crocus, Sago Palm, Black Locust, Yew, and Oleander.The ASPCA has an extensive alphabetical list of both those plants that are toxic and safe for dogs.Look up the status of plants that currently exist in your garden or ones that you’re thinking about planting. It’s best to avoid or remove species that are poisonous to your pet.

, Even non-toxic plants can be dangerous for dogs if they come with nasty thorns or spines. To avoid abrasions and eye injuries, keep spiky plants like cacti, yucca, or blackberries well out of your dog’s reach.

, Protect your pooch by storing all tools (from axes to rakes) and chemicals (from fertilizers to antifreeze) in a garden shed with a latch or lock.Remember, if you’ve recently treated your lawn or plants with pesticides or fertilizers, you should keep your dog out of the garden altogether. Use non-toxic and/or organic options whenever possible.

, Take care to address any potentially dangerous features in your garden or landscaping, such as exposed wires, protruding nails, or sharp edges on your furniture or fencing.If you store your trash or recycling in your garden, be sure to keep it in bins with tightly fitting lids. If you can, store them in an out-of-reach shed.
When landscaping, opt for dog-friendly materials. For instance, use mulch and cedar chips rather than sharp gravel for lining beds.

, If you intend to leave your dog out in the garden unsupervised, it’s a good idea to give them a place to escape from the elements, like the heat and rain.Either install a doghouse or be sure there’s a shady area with an overhang that’s accessible to your dog, like an arbor or gazebo.
Ensure that your dog doesn’t get dehydrated by keeping a water dish outside and filling it with fresh water each time you let them out into the garden.

, Weeds can be toxic to dogs, so it’s wise to use a covered compost bin in your garden to keep them from poking around in it., When you’re planning your outdoor space, consider your pet’s traits and needs. First and foremost, they need a place to go to the bathroom and a place to run around. If you don’t provide these designated areas for your dog, they’ll run and relieve themselves wherever they like.Even if you don’t have a large yard with lots of open space, keep in mind that your dog will at least need a path to run on. Make sure that its width is at least 3 feet. If they already have an informal route established through the garden, consider making it into a formal path.
Create an easy-to-clean place where your dog can do their business. Cover it with grass, gravel or cedar chips, and train your dog to always go there when they want to relieve themselves. This is a great way to protect your lawn and plants.
If you have a male dog, you might want to add a designated marking post, like a fence post or a stump, where he can regularly stake out his territory.
If your dog loves digging, consider giving them a sand pile where they can act out on that love to their heart’s content without ravaging your plantings.

, Many dogs like to dig, play, and lie down in cool dirt. This can not only damage your garden but also lead to serious messes once they come inside. Eliminate this possibility by covering exposed soil with hardly mulch, like bark or wood chips, and making sure paths are paved or covered with pebbles., The larger and closer together your plantings are, the less likely your dog is to trample over them or run through them. Don’t bother with plants that are not hardy enough to withstand an occasional romp.The most practical varieties of plants for your dog-friendly garden include sturdy shrubs, hardy perennials, grasses, and trees.
If you want to grow small, delicate plants, keep them safe in large pots, boxes, or hanging planters., Put up low borders, barriers, and/or fencing to protect plantings. These usually don’t need to be high enough to physically keep your dog out, just serve as visible reminders that encourage them to steer clear.If you choose to use fencing, be sure that it’s sturdy and high enough to deter your dog from crossing it but also porous enough to let the sunlight through for your plants.
For instance, you don’t want to use a solid wall of railroad ties or other privacy fences as a barrier. Chain-link fences, split-rail fences, or decorative garden fencing are more appropriate.
Alternatively, you can create raised beds to ensure that your plantings are on another level from your dog’s play area.
If your dog still has a tendency to run through your plantings or vegetable patches, make the fencing more formidable and at least four-feet high.

Consider door mounts.,
Look at wall mounts.,
Consider panel doors.,
Choose an electronic doggie door.",How to Choose and Install a Doggie Door1," Door mounts are doggie doors that are installed onto doors in your home. These can be placed on exterior doors to allow your dog to easily travel inside or outside. They can also by placed on internal doors, to allow your dog to access certain rooms in your home. Door mounts can be added to wooden, aluminum, or screen doors and typically consist of a swinging flap door.These are the most reasonably priced doggie doors and range in price from $25 to $500 depending on the size, material, and security/weather resistance of the door.;
, Wall mounts are doggie doors that allow your dog to travel through a wall. They can be installed on exterior or interior walls. A panel is attached to both sides of the wall and an aluminum or plastic tunnel is built into the wall to ensure that water cannot seep into the walls of your house. This tunnel also prevents the dog’s legs from getting caught while stepping through the tunnel.Exterior wall mounts are difficult to install, so you may need to factor installation costs into your decision making process.
These mounts cost between $250 and $800 depending on the size, material, and depth of the wall tunnel.

, Panel doors are removable panels that are installed on a sliding door track. The panel is made primarily of glass and has a permanent doggie door already installed in the bottom. These panels are non-permanent and can be easily installed and removed. This is an excellent option if you are renting a home and do not want to create a permanent doggie door.Panel doors are a fairly expensive option, costing between $250 and $1,000 depending on the size and materials.
Panel doggie doors can be purchased online through a variety of websites.

, Electronic doggie doors are available in both door and wall mounts. These doors are slightly more expensive, but they have a number of added safety features. Electronic doors are activated by a microchip that is worn on the dog’s collar and they unlock as the dog approaches. This means that wild animals cannot enter your home.Electronic doors are the most expensive option and cost over $1,500.
They can also be problematic if there is ever a glitch in the electronic technology. For example, your pet may get trapped outside.

Consider single or double panel doors.,
Purchase a doggie door that can lock.,
Choose between aluminum or plastic frames.,
Read user reviews.",How to Choose and Install a Doggie Door2," If you live in a part of the world that has seasonal changes to the weather, then you should opt for a doggie door that has double panels. These doors are specifically designed to seal the air in your house so that the outdoor temperature does not enter your home. They often have strong magnets and weather strips that help to keep the door closed at all times.These strips also prevent bugs and small rodents from entering your home.
A single panel door is fine in a mild climate because you do not have to worry as much about the outdoor elements.

, If you are worried about pesky animals such as squirrels or raccoons entering your home, then you should consider a doggie door that has some form of locking mechanism. This way you can lock the door at night or when you are away on vacation.A doggie door lock is also good if you want to prevent your dog from entering or exiting the house.
For example, you may not want your dog to be able to leave the house when you are not home.
A lock can also prevent burglars from entering your home through the doggie door.

, All doggie doors come with either plastic or aluminum frames. Plastic frames are cheaper, but they can also be flimsy and break. If you have a large or medium sized energetic dog, you should use an aluminum frame because it is sturdier and lasts longer. If you have a small dog, you can opt for the cheaper plastic frame.Aluminum frames are also preferred if the doggie door will receive a lot of daily traffic. For example, if you have multiple dogs that will use the door.

, It is always a good idea to read user reviews before making a large purchase, especially one that includes cutting a hole in a door or the siding of your home. Previous users can help you determine which doggie door features and types are the best for your specific needs. For example, some doors may be more energy efficient than others.

Consider the weather.,
Attach the door to a mudroom.,
Make sure the ground is the same level on both sides of the door.,
Ensure that your yard is fully fenced.",How to Choose and Install a Doggie Door3," Before installing a doggie door, you should always consider the surrounding environment. For example, if you live in an area that gets snow, you may want to place the doggie door under a covered porch or patio. This way you will not have to worry about snow buildup blocking the doggie door. The covered porch will keep the area surrounding the door free from any snow., You should also consider the room of the house that the doggie door is attached to. For instance, you may not want the doggie door to enter into a formal carpeted living room. Your dog may enter the house with muddy paws, or track leaves and sticks into the house. Instead, consider installing a doggie door in a mudroom.If that is not possible, choose a room with tiled flooring.
Alternatively, you could place a mat in front of the door or separate the mudroom from the rest of the house using a gate. This way the dog will not be able to track dirt through the house.

, It is important that the ground is the same level on both sides of the door. In many instances, the flooring on the inside of your house will be higher than the ground outside. In these circumstances, you may need to build a step or ramp so that your dog can easily enter and exit the house.You can actually buy a pre-made doggie ramp online. They are sold at many of the same places as doggie doors.

, Doggie doors are convenient because they allow your dog to enter and exit the house of their own free will. This means that your dog will often be unsupervised outside. As a result, it is important to ensure that the outdoor environment is safe for your pet. For example, the yard should be fully fenced and secure so that your dog cannot escape.You will also want to make sure your dog has access to water and shade while outside.
Make sure there are no pesticides or toxic plants that your dog could ingest while in the yard.

Measure your dog’s height, width, and weight.,
Read all instructions.,
Trace and cut out the hole for the door.,
Attach the doggie door frame.,
Hire a handyman to install a wall mount.",How to Choose and Install a Doggie Door4," Before purchasing and installing a doggie door, you will need to ensure that you purchase the right size of door to reflect the measurements of your dog. In order to measure your dog to fit a doggie door, measure their height from the floor to the highest point of the shoulders. Then add two inches (5 cm) to that measurement for extra room. Next, measure your dog’s width at the widest part of their body typically this is along the shoulder blades. Add two inches (5 cm) to this measurement as well.Some doggie doors will also ask for the weight of your dog. Have your dog stand on a scale to determine their weight.

, All doggie doors will come with a detailed set of installation instructions. Make sure that you carefully read through the instructions before you begin the installation process. Instructions will typically provide you with a list of materials provided and any will inform you of all tools you will need in order to complete the installation.


Check to make sure you have all of the parts before beginning installation.

, Most dog doors will come with a template to use for measuring the size of the door. Trace the template onto the door and use a level to make sure that door is not installed diagonally or crooked. Then use a drill to drill a starter hole at any corner. Use your jigsaw to cut out the hole for the door.If you are drilling into an aluminum door, you may need to use a reciprocating saw.
Make sure that you position the doggie door low enough so that your dog can easily step through it.

, Insert the dog frame and door into the opening of the door and screw the frame into place using the screws that were supplied with the kit. You will have to do this on both sides of the door.In some instances, you may have to add weather stripping to the door, so make sure that you read all instructions carefully.

, If you are installing a wall mount or are not comfortable working with power tools, then you should hire a handyman to help with the installation. Cutting through walls can be extremely difficult depending on the material, and you have to take into consideration the pipes and electrical wiring that may be hidden within the walls. A local handyman can help get the job done.

Use a standard length leash.,
Begin at the point where your dog starts getting excited about going for a walk.,
If your dog pulls you towards the front door, turn and walk the other way every time he pulls ahead of you.,
Have your dog sit and stay at the front door.,
Now have him sit and stay while you step out (dog remaining on the inside).,
Now you are ready to start the walk.,
You do not need to keep your dog very close to you.,
DO let your dog sniff while on a walk.

",How to Walk a Dog on a Leash," You want to work towards having a 'J' shape in your dogs leash at all times when walking. This avoids tension in the leash. Tension can lead to 'leash reactivity' or 'leash aggression'.;
, If he is excited now, will he get calmer outside? Nope! And an excited dog will pull you- plus it's a small step from hyper excitement to aggression. A calm dog is a responsive dog. If your dog gets excited when you put on your shoes or coat, do this randomly throughout the day without going for a walk until your dog no longer reacts to it. Do the same with your dogs leash until you can clip your leash on a quiet dog. When you can clip the leash on, unclip it and go back to what you were doing. When your dog is calm and quiet through all this, you can now tackle the front door.

, Repeat until you can reach the front door with a relaxed leash.

, Reach out and touch the door handle. If he stayed, give him a treat. Repeat until he is calm. Then wiggle the door handle. Repeat until he is calm. Open the door a little and then close it. Repeat until he is calm. Continue until you can fully open the door.

, Return to your dog and reward him. When he is calm for this step, then call him to you when you are outside. Have him sit. Reward him. If he is excited, go back inside and repeat until he is calm.

, Tell him 'lets go' and step forward. If he leaps ahead of you, simply abruptly turn and walk the other way. His punishment for pulling is simply to go back the other way. Repeat. A lot! Until you have a 'J' shape in the leash.

, Allow him to move around you a little but 'punish' tension in the leash with either a change of direction or by stopping all together (wait for a loose leash and eye contact before continuing). Keeping your dog close to your side is a different command ('Heel') and should only be used for short periods- remember the walk is about exercise AND stimulation for your dog. Letting him move around a bit and sniff will enrich his life- it's an important natural behaviour.

Be calm and assertive.,
Once your dog realizes that you are in control you must get your dog to lie down.,
With your dog calm and submissive, you may open the door.,
Now you can get on your way.,
Keep the lead short, holding your dog beside you, but not lifting him off of the ground.,
Keep yourself calm and assertive.,
Open the door.,
Enter the house first.,
Once you have sorted yourself out, you can see to him.,
Walk your dog before you give him his food, breakfast, dinner, or just a couple of biscuits.,
He may not be a wild dog, he may live in a cozy house in the middle of the city, but he's still a dog.,
Let this be a start to a great relationship with your dog.

",How to Walk Your Dog," The very first thing you must do before getting ready to walk your dog, is to be calm. Bring your shoulders up and stand tall. Be confident before your dog and show him that you are his leader. If he does not believe that you are in charge, the next steps will not work.;
, This is the best position of submission that your dog can give you. Once he is calm you can then move to get his lead. Having his ears relaxed against his head is a good sign that he is calm and submissive. You must not continue if you dog is not submissive, otherwise you will increase his excited energy. Once you have the lead, you can put it on him. Make sure that the dog is still submissive.

, If your dog is excited he may try to run out of the door, be firm, and hold your dog back. You decide when to leave, your dog doesn't make the decision. Get your dog to sit beside you, you cannot go any further until this is accomplished. Once your dog is once again calm beside you, you can go out the door. You must again stop of course, to shut it, but make sure that your dog sits beside you.

, The dog must stay beside you at all times, unless he is specifically told by you that he can go ahead. Remember, you decide what happens, not you dog.

, Keeping it short, however, does not mean that you should hold it so tightly that there is tension constantly along the lead. Dogs can sense the tension, even if we humans do not mean to send it down the lead to them. Try your best to relax your arm, keeping a firm grip on the lead. Only tense the lead if your dog pulls you. You must only pull it for a second or so, enough to draw his attention away. Pull also, to the side, not up as this sends the signals better.

, Just because the walk is almost over doesn't mean that you can stop concentrating on how calm you are, or how your dog is behaving. Make sure that he is still beside you, and at your heel, and walk him calmly to your door. He may notice that you just want to get inside, and he will take advantage of that. He may see this as a weakness, so keep your shoulders high and remember that you are in control.

, Stand there and wait for a few moments. Make sure that he is calm. Get him to lay down on the floor beside you if you have to, if that is what it takes to get him to submit to you again. Your dog doesn't care that it is you or your family that paid for your house. All that he cares about is the energy you're projecting. Are you calm and in control? If not, then get in control. You must be in control before you can enter your house.

, Don't let him push past you. That is rude behavior, and he isn't aloud to be rude to you. You are the pack leader, and you go first. Once you're inside, you invite him in, and for a little while don't give him any attention. Get him to wait while you take off your coat and shoes. Tell him to lay in his bed while you change your clothes. Don't let him play just yet. You need to reinforce your control before you give him affection.

, Take off his lead and give him some water, making sure that it is under your terms, not his.

, This means that he has worked for his food as he would have done in the wild.

, He doesn't care where he lives, as long as he's got a good, calm pack leader who takes him on his daily trek and takes him to food and water.

Use high shelves and locked cabinets.,
Secure trash.,
Place food out of reach.,
Install gates.,
Keep cabinets closed and locked.",How to Dog Proof Your House1," Your first line of defense is simply removing all dangerous items from the area your dog has access to. To this end, high shelves and locked cabinets are your friend. You may want to install childproof latches on a few cabinets for extra security.Items to move include:


Medication
Make-up
Children’s toys
Cleaning products and chemicals of any kind
Plastic bags
Food waste;
, Dogs are driven by their noses, and they are naturally drawn to explore trash. When dogs get into the trash, it isn’t just messy, but potentially dangerous. Take steps to insure that your dogs cannot access trash in your kitchen or bathrooms.Use trashcans with tight-fitting lids in both your kitchen and bathroom.
Select heavier trash bins that your dog cannot knock over.
Place trashcans inside of cabinets, and secure these cabinets with childproof latches.

, Food can also present a hazard for your dog. Coffee, onions, and chocolate can make your dog ill, and wrappers, peels, or other food items may present a choking hazard. Try to ensure that all food items and packaging are placed in areas your dog cannot reach. This also includes your dog’s food and any other pet food in your home.Secure food inside your pantry, refrigerator, or cabinets. Ensure that these are kept closed.
Use hanging baskets for fruits and vegetables.
Keep snacks and packaged foods off of counters.
Secure your dog’s food in a dog-proof container (such as a dog food vault).
If your dog is choking, try to dislodge the object and call your vet.
If your dog ingests a poisonous food item, contact your vet or call the ASPCA poison hotline at 1-888-426-4435.

, Keeping your dog confined to certain areas of your home at certain times—such as during meal times, when you are using art supplies, or when you are cleaning—can help keep your dog safe. Consider installing gates in areas where you’d like to keep your dog in (or out).Gates can be purchased at big box stores, pet stores, or online.
Most gates will be approximately waist-high, which will work for most dogs. If you have an especially large dog, you may want to seek a specialty gate (available at most pet stores).
Avoid keeping your dog confined for more than a few hours.

, Curious dogs will investigate open cabinets, and this can present hazards for your dog. It is crucial to get into the habit of keeping all cabinets and cupboards closed. Additionally, many dogs can open kitchen and bathroom cabinets. You may want to install childproof latches on your cabinets to keep your dog out, particularly if a cabinet contains something dangerous.It is also important to keep appliances—such as your dryer or dishwasher—closed at all times.
Before you exit a room, perform a safety check. Ensure that all cabinets, etc. are closed and that all hazards are out of reach.

Slow down.",How to Walk Two Dogs on Leashes," If you're going to walk two dogs, choose solid leashes with a set length, about 1.5 meters or more. Any style is appropriate, but thick braided nylon leashes tend to be the strongest and longest lasting. Pick one appropriate to your dog's size and energy level.Variable-length button-activated leashes tend to get tangled a lot more easily and encourage the dogs to pull at the leash. When the leash suddenly gives way as you give it more length, this gives the dog an incentive to yank at it.;
, Aside from the leashes, it's good to take a couple of bags (assume each dog will need two), and some readily available doggy treats if you're actively training the dogs. Keys, cellphone, and you're ready.


If you're going for a very long walk, you may also want to bring a little water with you in a bottle. Dogs pant when they're very thirsty, and need to be provided clean drinking water on a regular basis.

, Make sure the dogs have access to clean water at all times, and make sure they get a chance to drink up before you head out on a long walk. Dogs might not always be interested in drinking, so it's not necessary to force it, but just make sure they have a chance to drink if they're interested.


Dogs often need to go out shortly after eating or drinking. These are good times to schedule walks into your routine.

, Leash training is a lot easier if you do it with one dog at a time. It's very difficult to try to leash-train more than one dog at a time. After they've gotten experience walking on the leash, it's fine to try walking them together.

, You should be the first one to set foot outside of the house when you go for a walk, especially if you're going with more than one dog. Lead the way and provide your dogs with directions and not vice versa. If the dogs follow your ""stay"" command, call them out and make them sit while you lock up.


Attach the leash to the collar before you leave the house. Spend a lot of time at the door getting your dog to calm down before you go outside, if there's a lot of excitement.

, When you're first starting, try to keep the dog on a relatively short leash. Cinch the leash up on your wrist, so the dog will have to stay close at your side. You want to train the dog to stay that close to you at all times, even when the leash is a little bit longer. This makes the walk a lot smoother and more comfortable., If one dog starts yanking at the leash in a particular direction, don't go in that direction. Stop moving, command the dog to heel, or sit, and wait until the dog relaxes and gets under control before you start walking again.


Some trainers find it effective to ""ask"" the dog to stay close. As dog comes to you, reward him. You can even click down being next to you with a clicker.
Don't tug hard on the leash, but stay consistent and demand proper behavior. If you start walking and dog still pulls after multiple attempts, stop for a while.

, When the dog walks calmly at your side, staying on the leash, give a little treat and praise. As your dog stops pulling, start enforcing ""heel"" or ""side"" commands, to get the dog to walk closely. Dog should stay at your left at all times. Practice short walks (2 steps at first) with release commands and luring with treats., It's good to be in control of the walk, but the walk is for their benefit ultimately. Let them smell, stop, search, and explore like they want. Continue walking at a calm pace, but take a minute or two to stop as well.


Any time you can let dogs off leash is a good time. Find a dog park in your area if you don't have any fenced land they can roam in.

, It can take some dogs a long time to get trained properly on the leash. It's an unnatural and strange thing for the dog, and will only work with some careful training and some dedicated work.


It's actually a lot easier to let the dog drag you around, but it'll result in a poorly trained dog that's difficult to walk on the leash. It takes some serious self control not to yank the dog back at you, or to just be dragged along for the ride.
try to be cheerful, because it will make the walk go much smoother for the dog. As you change your walking direction, enhance good behavior with some doggy snacks and encouraging talk.

, Get your leash loop on your right hand and leash into your left hand with your dog on the left side. Put the hand through the hole and around the wrist a couple times, if the rope is big enough.


Leave some slack in the leash, between you and the dog so even if he pulls it out of your hand its still on your wrist.
Keep a tight grip on the leashes. Even calm and well-trained dogs can get distracted and start running without and you seeing them and pull the leash off the hand. And if you've got two, it's even more important to get a solid grip on things to keep them under control.

, The easiest way to keep the dogs separated is to keep them on separate sides of your body. Let dogs sniff at the opposite sides of sidewalks, and walk them with your body in between. This will keep the leashes from getting tangled.


Dogs will often want to sniff at the same things. If the dog on your left tries to cross over to your right, practice turning with the dog, or keeping the dog moving forward by giving a short little yank on the leash to move forward.
If your'e walking very small dogs, they can sometimes stay on the same leash, with leash-dividers. This is usually the best way to keep them under control. They'll usually stay out of the other's way.

, If you try to walk a very big dog and a very small dog, or a very old dog and a very young dog, you can have different types of challenges. If one dog needs to meander and another dog needs to run, you've got to make up for that with a little bit of work.


If you're going to walk different sized dogs, remember to walk slowly for the small one, and play more with larger dog before you head out at home to get their speed about the same.
In some cases, it's just easier to walk dogs separately. Not all dogs make good combinations. Try to match their energy level and walking speed, if at all possible.

, While it might seem silly, it's a lot more difficult to keep track of two dogs at the same time. You're picking up one's mess and the other's got a mouthful of chicken bone from the sidewalk. try to stay diligent.


Keep an eye out for debris on the sidewalk. Look for shattered glass or cigarette butts on the ground. Don't let them eat anything they're trying to get at.
Choose the place you're walking them carefully and go there without them before go for the walk. Make sure the sidewalk is big enough and traffic is quiet.

, Often, when you're walking two dogs, they'll start getting excited and go into pack mentality. This means there will be a competition between them. try to stay calm to counterbalance their excitement. Don't let them start going faster or slower, but try to maintain a calm rhythm. Stop and pet them regularly if they're getting too worked up."

Secure chemicals.,
Clean anti-freeze.,
Move tools.,
Secure your gate.,
Avoid using pesticides.",How to Dog Proof Your House3," The average garage and/or yard contains a number of substances that are dangerous for dogs. Even if you do not expect your dog to go into your garage, it is important to place all toxic substances up high or in locked cabinets, just in case.Some dangerous chemicals include:


Mothballs
Rat poison
Garden pesticides
Automobile chemicals (including anti-freeze)

, Anti-freeze poses a specific threat. Although is extremely toxic, dogs are attracted to the smell of anti-freeze and may try to lick it. If there has even been anti-freeze on the floor of your garage, or on your driveway, you will need to clean these areas before your dog comes home.Wet these areas using a hose.
Apply a mild cleanser (such as dish soap) and scrub using a mop (which you should discard afterward).
Rise the soap away using your hose.

, Curious dogs have been known to knock things over, eat small items, and otherwise break things. Heavy items, small objects, sharp objects, and tools must be kept out of reach. Consider investing in a tool box or putting in shelves.You may want to move:


Tools
Screws, washers, and nails
Saws and other sharp objects
Building materials
Car parts

, If you plan to leave your pet unsupervised in the yard, you must first ensure that you fence and gate are secure. Take a walk around your property and look for any gaps in your fence and/or gate.Wiggle the gate. Do you feel confident that it could contain your pet?
Block and/or repair any openings.
You may consider contracting a professional to help you, if the damage is significant.
If your dog is prone to digging, you may want to place large rocks near the base of your fence.

, Some fertilizers and pesticides can make animals ill. Avoid using chemicals on your lawn and garden. Before adding anything to your lawn or garden, read labels and make sure that all products are safe for pets.Even some “organic” pesticides can pose dangers to your dog.
Look for products that claim to be “pet safe.”
If you’re unsure, consult your vet.

Before you take your dog to the beach, where water conditions will be rougher and less predictable than a pool or shallow pond, you should know your dog’s swimming skills.If your dog enjoys swimming but is not a strong swimmer, consider purchasing a dog life vest to help them float. A life vest does not replace supervision and attention.
Even if your dog does not enjoy swimming, they may still enjoy being with you on the beach and exploring away from the water.;
, Whether you are on vacation or live close to a beach, you will need to make sure the beach allows dogs. If they do not allow dogs, respect that rule and find a different beach to go to. Check the website of the town or county that you'll be in to see whether the beach is designated as a dog-friendly area.


Websites like PetFriendlyTravel compile lists of dog-friendly beaches in different states across the United States. Search the Internet for ""dog-friendly beach (insert the name of your location"" to see local results.Some local ordinances require that dogs be on a leash at all times, be mindful of this as well.

, Check the local weather to see whether there are storms or rain expected in the area. Some beaches have rougher water than others, have strong currents, or tides that change dramatically. While you should expect some waves, calmer water is generally safer for your dog to play in.


Dogs that enjoy swimming or playing in the water at the beach are at risk of being hurt by rough waves.
If weather or water conditions are poor, consider rescheduling your beach trip for another day.

, Fill a beach cooler with plenty of fresh water both for you and for your dog. Dogs can easily become dehydrated in hot weather and need to drink water frequently to stay cool.


A lightweight and collapsible bowl is a good alternative to having your dog drink from a water bottle.
Access to fresh water can also help prevent your dog from drinking too much salt water. A few gulps of salt water will not be harmful for your dog but it will dehydrate them if they continue to drink it rather than fresh water.

, While you’ve probably already thought through the beach gear that you and your family will need for your outing, there are also a few essentials that will make your trip smooth and enjoyable for your pet. These include:


Treats. Pack a handful of treats in a re-sealable bag for your dog to enjoy. These can be particularly useful to entice a wandering dog to come back to your area and to reward good behavior. Pick treats that don’t melt easily in heat or moisture.
Leash. Even if the beach allows dogs to be off-leash, you will need a leash to safely walk your dog from the parking lot or street to the beach. If the beach does require leashes, consider bringing one regular leash and one extra long leash so your dog can have some independence.
Toys. Toys are a great way to make the beach trip even more enjoyable. Pack toys that can be used in water, like buoyant rubber balls, and can be easily cleaned. Leave the plush toys at home since they will get sandy and wet quickly.
Disposable plastic bags. You will need to clean up after your dog so bring along a few disposable plastic bags or the waste bags that you typically use.

, In hot weather, dogs need breaks from the sun. Playing, swimming, and running dogs can become overheated and dehydrated easily, especially in hot temperatures. Use a sun umbrella or a beach tent that is large enough for you, your dog, and whoever else might be joining you to sit together comfortably.Some beaches have natural shaded areas but you won’t know whether those areas are already occupied until you’ve already arrived at the beach.

, Regardless of whether the beach requires dogs to be on leashes or not, your dog should always be wearing a collar with identification tags. It is illegal in many areas for dogs to be without identification, and identification is absolutely necessary if your dog is playing off leash. Before you leave, check your dog's identification tags to make sure they are legible and up to date.

, If this is your dog’s first trip to the beach, let them take their time adjusting to the currents and waves. Even for strong swimmers, waves can easily knock dogs down and pull them out to sea.


Never throw your dog into the water, this can be a frightening experience and a frightened dog will struggle to swim.Start in shallow water where they can stand and coax them in with a treat or toy. Stay within arm’s reach of your dog so you are always in a position to help them if they need it.

, Sand gets hot very quickly and the pads of your dog’s feet are sensitive to these extreme temperatures. Test the sand for yourself, if it is too hot to walk on barefoot it’s too hot for your dog.


Dog booties add a layer between your dog’s paw and the hot sand below. Not all dogs are used to wearing booties so they will take some getting used too. You can find dog booties at large retailers, pet stores, and online. They may be marketed as snow booties but can also be used at the beach.
Apply a paw wax product that protects your dog’s paws feet from hot surfaces. You can find a paw wax at pet stores and online through manufacturers' websites., Like humans, dogs can get sunburns. Dogs that have light colored coats, are shaved, or have pink noses and skin are at a greater risk of becoming sunburnt. Apply dog sunscreen to areas that are not protected by fur, like their noses, tips of ears, bellies, and any hairless bald spots.Sunscreens designed for sensitive skin, babies, and dogs are usually fine to use as long as they do not contain zinc oxide, which is toxic to dogs. Check with your veterinarian if you are concerned about the sunscreen you’re using on your dog or if you need a recommendation.
Reapply your dog's sunscreen every hour to ensure that they stay protected throughout the day.

, Especially during the summer, it is easy for your dog to become overheated after running and playing along the beach. Dogs can become easily overheated in hot weather, especially those with long coats, dark colored fur, thick coats, or are overweight.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include rapid panting, a bright red tongue, weakness, vomiting, and thick saliva. If you suspect your dog has heat stroke move them to a shaded area and apply cool (not cold) water all over their body to gradual lower their temperature. Let them drink small amounts of water and apply ice packs or cool towels to their head, neck and chest. Take them to the nearest vet if symptoms persist.

, Dogs can get overwhelmed by the sight, smell, and sounds of the beach. If you intend to keep your dog off leash, make sure they stay in an area where they can still hear you when you call for them. The beach can be a dangerous place and dogs need careful supervision.Avoid areas that have potential dangers, like fishing docks that may have hooks buried in the sand, broken glass, or rock outcroppings.
When your dog is swimming, you should also be in the water or at the water's edge so you are close enough to intervene if your dog begins to struggle to swim.

, Not all beachgoers want to interact with your dog and may be upset if your pet becomes an unwelcome guest to their beach picnic or tent. Dogs that are left out of sight and are free to roam can easily become a nuisance to others.


This is especially true with families that have young children. If the family does not have a dog with them you should assume that the children are wary of dogs and that the parents do not want an unwelcome four-legged guest.

, Tide pools are shallow pools of water where plants and sea creatures like crabs live. They are often surrounded by rocky areas that can cut the pads of your dog’s feet.


As a general rule, keep your dog away from rock outcroppings. These can become very slippery and can easily cut your pet.

, This refers to the animals and birds that make the beach their home. Dogs can destroy wildlife nests and injure birds in the matter of seconds.


If there any protected wildlife areas near the beach, keep your dog away from these.
Sick or injured beach wildlife may carry diseases as well.
Some wildlife also can pose a threat to your dog. Keep your dog away from any seals or sea lions and flocks of seabirds.

, It is common courtesy to pick up and dispose of your dog’s waste while on the beach. Bring disposable plastic bags to clean up after your dog.


Likewise, remember to bring any toys or items that you’ve brought home with you.

, Sand has a reputation for getting everywhere, and most dogs love to dig and roll around in it. You will not be able to get rid of all of the sand in your dog’s coat but a quick rinse with fresh water can help to remove large clumps.


Line your car seat with a durable material that is easy to clean., Before you leave the beach and head home, you will need to dry your dog off. Seawater will start to smell even an hour after you leave the beach. Dry off your dog with thick towels to help avoid the smell lingering in your car as you leave the beach.


Saltwater can also begin to irritate your dog’s skin after prolonged contact. Dried salt will also begin to itch so your dog will be grateful for the rub down!, Even though you’ve provided plenty of fresh water for your dog to drink while you were at the beach, they will need to continue to rehydrate after you leave.


Make sure they have plenty of water to drink after you leave and when you return home.
This is especially true if your dog has been very active and has been spending hours playing.

, Dogs that are prone to ear infections need their ears wiped out and dried after they leave the beach. Water can easily get trapped in the inner ear and salt water can cause irritation to the skin.


Use a soft and absorbent gauze to dry their ears since paper and cotton towels can leave behind fibers. You can also use a soft cotton tipped stick to clean the folds of your dog's ears, but never use these to clean the ear canal.

, Once you return home, you may want to bathe your dog. This is your best option to remove remaining sand and to get rid of any lingering seawater smell.


Salt and minerals can also damage your dog’s coat. A thorough bath is the best way to remove these from their coat and avoid damage to the hair follicles.
Use a conditioner to reintroduce moisture into your dog's coat.

Check local fencing regulations.,
Weigh the benefits of a tangible fence.,
Save money with a chain-link fence.,
Opt for a wooden privacy fence with a mild-mannered dog.,
Build a solid, permanent fence.",How to Choose a Dog Fence for Your Yard1," Your community may have laws about the materials and sizes allowed for residential fences. Don’t rely on a fencing company to know the regulations. Contact your town hall for specific by-laws and regulations for your area. Breaking them may result in fines and the requirement to remove your fence., A tangible fence is generally more protective of your dog, if it is installed and maintained properly. It is also far less likely to cause your dog anxiety, as there is no physical discipline associated with it. Likewise, it can help block visual stimuli such as people and other dogs walking by that may excite your dog and cause them to bark or bite. However, these fences are also generally more expensive, and need to be maintained with repairs over time.


If you’re hoping to fence around ½ an acre, you will spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand, depending on materials. Account for the full-grown size of your dog. Your fence may need to be higher than you expect. If you have a breed of dog that will stay small, four or five feet will likely be enough. This is often not the case for larger dogs, especially agile breeds.
If you have a husky, golden retriever, or another large breed of dog, go with a fence that's about six feet tall., Chain link fences are especially common for good reason. They are cheap, and extremely durable. However, they allow your dog to see out (and other dogs to see in), which can contribute to the occasional bark-off. Chain link fences are also relatively each to jump, if your dog is a bit acrobatic., Wood fencing is reasonably priced, lasts for over a dozen years, and can provide visual privacy for you and your dog. However, many dogs are able to push wood pickets out of wood fences, and wood fences tend to be the easiest to dig under.If you do go with wood, see to it that any horizontal beams are not able to be used as launch pads from which your dog could jump the fence.
Vinyl fences can offer similar advantages, but tend to cost more than wooden fences.

, Concrete, brick, or other solid, permanent walls are especially effective in protecting your dog and keeping them contained. However, these are also the most expensive to install and maintain. While concrete blocks are relatively cheap, they are also relatively unsightly, and may be banned in your area."

Put a leash and collar on the dog.,
Keep the collar tight, but not too tight.,
Choose the side on which you want your dog to walk.,
Pull the leash close to your body.,
Talk to your dog.,
Reward your dog with special treats.,
Talk to your vet before buying walking equipment.,
Buy the proper collar and leash for your pet.,
Consider the clicker device for training.,
Know when it is too hot to walk your dog.,
Carry plenty of water and food.,
Rest when necessary and get shade when you can.",How to Walk a Dog," There will come a time when your four-legged friend will recognize it is time to go for a walk by you simply reaching for the leash. Introduce this in your dog’s mind early on by using a collar at a young age. Place the collar around the dog’s neck and say “let’s walk” with the leash in full view.;
, You want to make sure the collar isn’t too tight around your dog’s neck. A good rule of thumb is to ensure you can place one to two fingers between the collar and your dog’s neck. You also don’t want the collar to be loose enough to slip over your dog’s ears if it tries to back out of it.

, Consistency is important when training your dog to walk. Choosing a side for the dog to walk establishes its spot in the activity. The puppy will become accustomed to walking with you by knowing what to expect. Just keep in mind that walking on a leash is not a natural occurrence for your pet.An adjustment period should be expected.

, The most important aspect of learning how to walk your dog is maintaining control so that your pet doesn’t dictate the walk. You are the boss and this should be reflected in your walking relationship as well.Wrap your traditional leash around your hand until there is very little give between you and your pet.
Pull the leash close to your body but allow enough give to allow your dog to walk naturally.
Your dog will feel the resistance of the leash and realize that getting ahead of you is unacceptable.

, Your dog understands the tone in your voice. Don’t get frustrated. Encourage your dog with a “good job” or “way to go” when it does something right. Use a stern voice when instructing it not to do the wrong things, like bark at people passing by or growling at other dogs.

, Use treats when teaching your dog to walk but especially when you want to teach your pet to not pull on the leash. Reward often and consistently. Reserve a treat that your dog especially likes for training purposes. Many dogs are quite enthusiastic about pieces of hot dog, cheese, or jerky.

, Your vet will know your pet almost as well as you do and can recommend the type of walking equipment you may need. Trust the vet’s expertise when it comes to selecting a collar and leash for your dog’s specific body type or weight. Your vet can assist you with tips to avoid neck conditions that can arise from an improper collar. , There is a wide variety of collars and leashes available on the market, but not all of them are suitable for your animal. For example, a traditional buckle collar and hook leash are typically used when there is little issue with walking your dog. For those that have more difficulty with a non-cooperative pets there is a variety of more restrictive collars and leashes available.Slip collars help keep the easily distracted dog in line.
Pack leader collars are used on dogs that like to pull.
Harnesses are useful on dogs with elongated necks.
Special-use collars include shock collars, vibrating collars, and GPS collars.
Glow in the dark collars make sure you are visible to others.

, This device is highly regarded as a safe and effective method for dog training. Use the clicker to reinforce good behavior and communicates in a clear, concise way to the dog. The click sound, followed by a treat, communicates to the dog that it has done the right thing.The clicker method is effective in training a dog to walk and other areas of training as well, such as barking, potty-training, and tricks. Use the clicker, followed by a treat, for the following steps:


Begin with putting the leash on.
When your dog stops resisting the leash.
As the dog walks behind you or beside you.
Repeat periodically throughout the walk.
When returning home, remove the leash.
Repeat daily.

, Temperature will often determine the best time to take your dog walking. Earlier in the day or later in the evening are suitable times of day to walk your dog. Avoid high noon as the pavement may be too hot for your dog’s feet. The best way to test if it is too hot is to place your bare hand on the pavement. If after only five seconds you have to remove your hand then chances are it is too hot., Along with poop bags and your clicker, carry a portable bowl and a bottle of water for your pet. Keeping your dog hydrated is important when walking for longer periods of time or during the hotter times of day. During summer months, it is extra important that your dog has plenty of water. Healthy and easy snacks to carry include:


Strawberries
Seedless watermelon
Apple slices
Blueberries
Carrots
Crushed ice for the hotter days

, Don’t overdo it when getting your dog used to walking with you, especially if this is the first time on a collar and leash. There will be a lot of pulling and resistance which may wear the little one out. Find a shady spot to rest for a couple of minutes along the walk.

Evaluate the risks associated with a hidden fence.,
Choose a hidden electric fence.,
Go with a buried wire fence system.,
Opt for a wireless electric fence.,
Train your dog carefully.",How to Choose a Dog Fence for Your Yard2," A well-trained dog is unlikely to break the perimeter set by an electric fence. However, an electric fence does not physically prevent a dog from leaving your yard. Moreover, electric fences are not appropriate for all dogs, as they may cause anxiety for some.For instance, if your dog is angered by another dog walking by and decides to pursue them, they may ignore the brief jolt their collar gives them when they cross the electric fence.
If a fence is improperly set up or used on an animal with a low pain tolerance or one that is prone to anxiety, the shock experienced when crossing the fence boundary may foster an overall fear of the fence in the dog.
Further, electric fences do not prevent anything from entering into your yard. This could leave your dog vulnerable to attack from another animal, and may create liability if someone enters your property and is bitten by your dog.

, Use an invisible electric fence to create a zone in which your dog is free to move with neither the expense nor the visual consequence of a traditional fence. Your dog will also need to wear an electronic collar that serves two purposes. First, the collar plays an warning tone that your dog will hear whenever they near the perimeter. Second, the collar will shock them with a harmless but bothersome electric current if they attempt to cross the invisible fence. There are many benefits to such a system.


They are quite affordable, and will almost always cost less than a traditional, tangible fence.
They are quickly and easily installed in a few hours.
Training for your dog will likely be quick and effective as well.
You have several different types to chose from, with the main difference being the use of a buried wire or a wireless system.

, An electric fence that relies on a buried wire to establish the boundaries of your dog’s safe zone is especially easy to customize. For instance, you can establish exact, specific areas within your yard that are off limits, such as a pool or flower beds.These systems also have greater range, and can be used to establish a safe zone up to 100 acres in size.
Costs range from $165 to $320.Setup is quite simple. It involves burying a continuous circuit of wire around the perimeter of your yard. To do so, use a flat spade to dig a 3in (8cm) trench wherever you want to lay the wire. This can usually be completed in one or two days.
Your transmitter (which keeps track of where your dog is relative to the fence) will usually be stored inside, near a power source.

, Another type of electric fence does not require you to bury a wire around the safe zone you wish to create for your dog. However, the range of these systems is more limited, and is based on a radio signal that reaches a certain distance from a centrally located transmitter to determine the perimeter.Advantages associated with this type of electric fence include an extremely easy installation, and the ability to move the system with ease - even for a vacation.
However, this type of system is limited to a circular safe zone, usually extending about 90 ft from the transmitter in all directions. As such, these systems are most appropriate for smaller yards.
Costs range from $220 to $350., Electric fences do work for a lot of people’s dogs. However, training is vitally important for your fence to work. To help during training, use yard flags or another clear indicator to provide a visual information to your dog about the fence’s location. The specific system you purchase will include specific information on setup, as well as training.Further, recognize that your dog ultimately learns to stay within the perimeter via negative reinforcement, even if you train them with positive reinforcement to respect the perimeter during training. As such, using an electric fence does mean that your dog will wind up being shocked at one point or another, likely during training.

Identify where your dog is getting out.,
Do a bit of digging yourself.,
Contain leapers with a chicken wire lean-in.,
Use coyote rollers for persistent jumpers.,
Plant vegetation along the inside of the fence.,
Add to a chain link fence.,
Provide a backyard activity.,
Don’t leave your dog outside.",How to Choose a Dog Fence for Your Yard3," The two main ways dogs can escape from a traditional fence are digging and jumping. To check for evidence of digging, walk the interior and exterior perimeter of your fence. Keep in mind that the hole they’re squeezing through may be smaller than expected.Any sign of digging indicates you may have found an escape hatch. If you’re certain they aren’t digging and they keep getting out, they’ve likely found a way to vault the fence.

, One way to deter a digger is by digging beneath your fence all the way around and adding a foot or so of chicken wire going straight down, then burying this added part of the fence. Your dog will likely try again, but may give up when they encounter this new barrier.For especially serious diggers, you can add an L-footer to the bottom of your fence. This extends down off of your fence, turns 90 degrees at ground level, and extends inward into your yard for about a foot. This will greatly diminish a dog’s ability to choose., If you think your dog is getting over your fence, one option is add something to the top of your fence to prevent them from doing so. Chicken wire can likely do the trick. It’s cheap and easy, if a bit unsightly. Simply staple, nail, or tie chicken wire to the top of your current fence, and bend it inwards to form a ¼ circle or so.Make sure there are no sharp spires of chicken wire that your dog could jump into and scratch themselves on.

, Coyote rollers are designed to keep wild coyotes out of fenced-in areas, but they can also help keep your dog within your fence. Most commonly, coyote rollers are long metal tubes affixed to a frame on top of the fence that allow the tube to spin.Coyote rollers can be purchased from several different online companies, but they are not cheap. You can make a more affordable version yourself using PVC piping and other hardware from your local home improvement store.

, Persistent fence-jumpers, or dogs that have worn a path patrolling the inside of your fence-line may be dissuaded from doing so by landscaping. Dense shrubs are especially effective in keeping dogs back from the fence. In fact, the deterrence offered by landscaping within your fence can prevent escape attempts generally., If you go the chain-link fence route but find that you and the other neighborhood dogs are prone to singing to one another, you may want to add something to keep them from seeing one another. There are plenty of options. One easy, good-looking option is zip-tying some reed fencing to the inside of your chain link fence. You can also tie on bamboo poles or wind plastic slats through the fence itself. While none of these are perfect, they will diminish the chorus of canine greetings., Many dogs who are trying to escape simply need more stimulation to be happy in your yard. If they like to dig, consider adding a sandbox where they are allowed to do so. Further, play with your dog a while each time you go into your yard together. Play fetch or simply run around together., Though it can be tempting to let your dog out on their own to take care of business or catch some rays, it’s not recommended. Even with the safety of a fence, your dog can wind up getting themselves in trouble by eating something it shouldn’t or getting wound up in something you forgot to put away.Do not rely on running loose in the yard as your dog's only form of exercise and mental stimulation. Taking your dog for regular walks or runs, engaging in play in the home, and providing appropriate physical exercise and mental stimulation for their breed, size, and age will help curb attempts to escape the yard and other mischievous behaviors.

Leash your dog if you see another animal.,
Know your dog’s anxiety triggers.,
Look out for wild animals.,
Read up on leash laws.,
Keep an eye on the weather.,
Pay attention to your dog’s physical needs.,
Check for ticks and fleas.",How to Walk a Dog in the Woods1," Sometimes trails allow dogs to be unleashed, while other require your dog to stay on a leash. Either way, it is very likely that you will encounter other dog owners on the trail. Be aware of other dogs and bring your dog close to your side if you see one. This is especially important if one dog is leashed while the other is unleashed. Unleashed dogs can become combative.
Check with other owners before allowing your dog to interact with theirs.
Rein your dog in at the first sign of aggression from either side, whether your dog is unleashed or on a long leash.
Also be aware of other animals in the woods, like squirrels and deer. If you see a woodland creature, recall your dog before they notice it, or pull the leash in.
Reward your dog with a treat if they obey and don't get in a scuffle with other dogs.;
, Be aware that there are things that can trigger a dog’s anxiety, just as with people. For dogs, the reason can be a genetic predisposition to be skittish. It can also be that the dog was traumatized and they see something that reminds them of that trauma. Observe your dog at home and on walks in your neighborhood to determine what they need to avoid in the woods.Signs of dog anxiety include urinating, barking or howling, chewing or digging, and so on.You can reduce dog fearfulness by practicing desensitization or clicker training., Your job on the trail is to protect your pet from harm, including noticing when other dogs are exhibiting aggressive behavior. Pay attention to the wildlife around you, watching for large animals like bears, wild hogs, large deer, and any wildlife that might bite (snakes, for example). If you see any wildlife like this, rein in your dog and get as far away from the potential threat as you can.
Read about the trails in your area and find out what the risks of encountering wildlife might be.

, In order to protect yourself from fines and from negative interactions on the trail, find out the leash laws in your area. Mostly, these laws are up to the discretion of local government. Pennsylvania and Michigan are the only states that have a state-wide dog leashing requirement.You will need to look on the county website where a trail is located to determine what the law is for leashing.
Some trails might have laws that are dictated by the parks where they are located, so look on park websites for leash laws.
There may be some trails that don’t allow pets at all, so be sure to look up your trail online or call the local parks services to check on this.

, Protect your pet from the elements by keeping tabs on the weather—hot and cold temperatures as well as precipitation. If it’s going to be very hot, it may not be wise to take your pet on a trail where they are going to exert a lot of energy. If it’s going to rain, lightning may be an issue, making it dangerous for either of you to be out on a trail. Try to go on a trail during mild temperatures and on a clear day.


Also pay attention to the sky and temperature when you are on the trail. A forecast of clear skies can be incorrect, as can be a forecast of mild temperatures.

, Even if the weather is cool, you dog may get dehydrated by exerting a lot of energy. Be prepared not only with treats, but with water, a rain poncho, a backup leash, a first aid kit, and other important essentials to deal with issues in the woods.


You might want to pack a bowl to pour water into.
You can allow your pet to urinate and defecate on the trail, but come prepared to clean up dog feces as you go.
Materials in a dog first aid kit might include:a pet first-aid manual,
emergency veterinary phone numbers and directions,
important paperwork (proof of rabies shot, perhaps a photo if they get lost),
pet bandages (a special non-stick kind for fur, available at pet stores),
a muzzle,
other basic first aid supplies like an ice pack, gauze, tape, antiseptic, etc.



, After you get home, check your dog for ticks and fleas. Feel under the fur all over their body, placing enough pressure on the skin to feel for bulges that might be ticks. Look especially between the toes, around the tail and head, behind the ears, and under the armpits. Use a comb to check for fleas.If you do feel a bulge, part the fur and look for an embedded tick. Remove it by grasping it with tweezers and pulling away from the skin.
If you live in an area where ticks are known to carry Lyme disease, make sure you get your dog vaccinated.
Take a fine tooth metal comb and rake it through your pet's fur. Make sure you reach the skin. If fleas are on the comb, treat your dog to a flea bath to kill the fleas."

Pick out the right collar and leash.,
Wear comfortable clothing and shoes.,
Bring treats.",How to Walk a Big Dog1," Both the leash and the collar can be used to control the dog, but some brands and types work different for different kinds of dogs. Knowing the correct option can be something difficult to ascertain.Use a simple leash and collar. This option works well for balanced dogs who understand their place in the pack (i.e. subservient to the human) and do not cause issues on walks. Choose this option if your dog has a happy demeanor and no obedience issues. Try a slip collar. For more difficult dogs, those distracted by a variety of things on the walk, the slip collar can be a great option.The corrections made by slip collars pinch the brachial nerve and imitate how mature dogs nip at the necks of their puppies for social purposes.The Pack Leader Collar (PLC) is a great option for difficulties with slip collars. While slip collars may cause issues, the PLC fits around the neck towards the head. By placing focus there, the dog has less pulling power and less control. Using this collar is a great way to keep the dog’s nose up and away from distractions.Use a harness. For many dog owners, a body harness or ""Halti"" head collar might be preferable, especially if your dog tends to pull. Some of these products, like the Halti, have the ability to steer and muzzle the dog, as well as stop them from pulling.;
, The more stiff your clothing and footwear, the more likely a large dog will be to pull you off balance. And the greater chance you can be scuffed up or injured. Think tennis shoes over high heels, and jeans over dress pants.

, Many dog trainers and walkers recommend positive reinforcement with animal training. Bring small meats, cheeses, or processed snacks specifically designed for dogs. Try experimenting with the flavors to which your dog responds best. Lead with a treat. One quick trick is to walk with the treat in front of the dog's nose. Like the proverbial carrot on a stick, the dog will follow the scent and walk along your side."

It's possible the dog is hiding in one of their rooms or one of them took the dog for a walk. Plus, you can establish when someone last saw the dog., Dogs love food, so you may be able to draw him out by shaking the treat or food bag. Wander through the house with it so your dog can hear it., Once you've established your dog isn't in plain sight, begin searching your house methodically. Check each room carefully, looking under beds and in closets. Make sure to hit every room, bathroom, and closet in the house. Don't forget to look under and behind furniture., Scared dogs can find unique places to hide. Look behind and in appliances, as dogs can get behind refrigerators or crawl in dryers.Also, be sure to check behind access panels and even in areas such as the water heater closet. Small dogs can even be under reclining chairs (behind the footrest) or behind books on a bookshelf., As you're searching, be sure to keep calling out your dog's name. Your dog may be sleeping soundly in a corner, and she may not hear you at first.

, You'll have a much better chance of finding your dog in the first 12 hours after she escapes. In fact, some experts note that nearly 90% of pets are found again if the owner searches in the first 12 hours., Your dog knows his name and may respond to it. Plus, it gives your dog an audible beacon to where you are.Don't forget to use nicknames, too. If you've taken to calling your dog ""Pookie"" more often than ""Princess,"" try alternating between the two.

, Food is a big motivator for any dog, so take the bag of treats with you. Shake the bag as you go along, and call out with the name you use for them.For instance, if you call them biscuits, you'd shout, ""Fido! Don't you want a biscuit?""

, The most effective time to search with treat bags and by calling your dog's name is when it is quiet outside. Try early in the morning, so your dog feels safer coming out. Your dog may be out already at this time, looking for food., When searching, check for signs of your pet. Look for prints in the mud or feces your dog left behind. See if you see any snags of fur. These clues can point you in the right direction., Your dog may burrow under a porch, climb up on top of cars, or hide behind sheds. Check into all the small spaces you see because dogs can squeeze themselves into small areas. Use a flashlight to check in dark areas.Don't forget to look behind and under bushes., You need to listen for your sounds of your dog, such as a whine, a bark, or a rustle. Your dog may lead you to her if you stop and listen., Put a favorite toy outside, which may lead your dog home. Additionally, try leaving something with your scent outside, such as a dirty shirt, which may also draw your dog out., That is, look at newly constructed or abandoned houses, as dogs can seek shelter inside. Also, consider if anyone has moved since your dog escaped, as dogs sometimes crawl into moving vans., You want to search the outside of your home on foot to check in tight spaces. However, if you don't find your dog, hop in the car to take a spin around the neighborhood. Drive slowly, and take streets systematically. Keep your windows down, calling out for your pet as you go., Some dogs take off running when they get out. You should definitely search in a 1- to 2-mile radius the first day, but dogs can run up to 5 to 10 miles. While it is is uncommon for dogs to go as far as 10 miles, it doesn't hurt to expand your search., The more people you have looking, the more likely you are to find your dog. Ask for help from family members, friends, and neighbors, and be coordinated about how you search. That is, establish search areas for each person, so you're not wasting time overlapping areas., Your neighbors are a great resource for helping you find your dog. They may have seen him running in a particular direction, or one of them may have even taken him in after he lost his collar. Go door to door on your street, and bring a picture along to show them.Also, be sure to check with people like the mailman who cover a large amount of ground in your neighborhood., That is, notify your shelter that you have an animal missing so that staff members can be on the lookout for your dog. Don't forget to call private agencies, as well.Also, take the time to visit at least once in the first couple of days after your dog goes missing, so you can check for your dog. Visit every couple of days if your dog doesn't return in the first day or two., Call your vet, especially if your pet's tags had your vet's information on it. However, you should also check with other emergency clinics in the area, to make sure your animal wasn't brought in injured to another clinic., Don't search at night by yourself, and take flashlights and cellphones with you while searching., Pets can survive for a long time away from home. You may find your pet months from now, so keep looking and keep checking with your local shelters., Print out fliers with a picture of your dog, a description, the dog's name, and your phone number. Don't forget to add the general area she went missing from, though you shouldn't give an exact address. Also include the date.Put the key message at the top. That is, include ""LOST DOG"" in a bold, readable font at the top of the flier. Keep the rest of the message short and to the point.A color photo will work better than a black and white one. Make sure to pick one where you can clearly see your dog's face and distinguishing features.Try using a brightly colored paper, as that can draw more attention to your flyer. You can also try offering a reward for the pet, which can help motivate people.Try posting flyers at stores and restaurants and on telephone poles and trees. Work within a 1- to 2-mile radius of where your dog ran away, though it doesn't hurt to put them up farther away, as well. Dogs can run much farther.Animal-themed places are especially appropriate, such as pet stores and clinics, but try any place that has a large number of people coming through, such as laundromats and gas stations. Always ask permission before putting up a flyer at a business.Keep one key piece of information off the flyer. That is, hold back one identifying feature, such as a heart-shaped mark on your dog's hind-leg. That way, you can ask callers to provide a description of your dog and hopefully, weed out anyone trying to scam you., You can post on lost animal websites, as well as local classified ads websites, such as Craig's List. Also, use your own social network. Post notices to your friends, and ask them to share the notices with their friends. The more people you reach, the more likely you are to find your dog.Don't forget to make your post public so that it can be shared with other people. For instance, on Facebook you can change a post to public before you post it without changing your overall profile settings.

, Take out an ad in your newspaper's classified section. Keep it short and to the point, including the same information you included on the flyer., Take someone with you if someone calls to say they found your pet. Ask to meet in a public place, and don't give the person a reward until you have your pet back.When a person calls claiming to have your dog, ask the person to describe your dog thoroughly. Listen for the piece of key information you left off the flyer., On the same sites you're posting on, check the listings for found pets. Also, check the classifieds of your newspaper for found pets.

, ID tags should have your dog's name and your current phone number. That way, if someone finds your dog, that person can locate you. Be sure to update the tags if your information changes., A microchip is a harmless chip that is inserted into the back of the neck. The chip contains an ID that any vet or shelter can scan for. The ID can then be used to find your contact information so that vets or shelters can call you when they find your dog.Be sure to update your information as it changes, as out-of-date information will not be useful to your dog.One reason you should microchip and have ID tags on your dog is because collars can come loose when dogs are outside. The tags are then lost, which won't help anyone get your dog back to you., Make sure you don't have any holes in your backyard fences or anywhere that makes it easy for your dog to escape. Also, be careful when opening the door, making sure your dog isn't waiting to dart out.

, You can purchase a tag that goes on your dog's collar that has GPS tracking. If your dog gets loose, you can use your phone to track her down. For a more advanced option, microchips are available with this same technology, which would be embedded in your dog's skin, so it couldn't be lost."

Look at it from your dog’s perspective.,
Load up on dog treats.,
Have control when letting them out of the car.,
Teach your dog how to be leashed properly.,
Train your dog to check in.,
Offer more treats in return for going back home.",How to Walk a Dog in the Woods2," Before you set off into the woods with your dog, it is important to consider how they may act. If you are prepared for them to be curious and sniff around a lot, you will be much less frustrated. Be ready for both a leisurely stroll and a fast-paced chase to keep up with your furry pal.For example, right when you arrive at a trailhead, your dog will probably sniff a lot. This is because they are examining what has happened recently. If you hurry them along, they lose the chance to become comfortable in a new environment.
Later in the walk, your dog may try to chase down interesting things that they see. Be prepared to have your leash pulled or to chase your dog.

, Before heading out to the woods, you need to have many treats available for training them to come back to you. Think about what treats get your pet most excited. Do they like rawhide? Dog biscuits? You can make your own treats to minimize cost and control what your dog eats. Ensure that these treats are healthy since you will need to give them a lot.


For example, you can make your own dog trail mix with leftover meat scraps.You can bake your own dog biscuits with whole wheat flour, bullion granules, cheese, broth, an egg, bacon bits, and other protein-rich foods.
You can make pumpkin balls for a quick treat with canned pumpkin, molasses, whole wheat flour, and spices.
Just be sure whatever treat you make can be taken on the trail without making a mess in your pocket.
Consult your veterinarian about what treats are most healthy for your dog.

, When you arrive at a trailhead, set the tone for a calm and controlled hike by being firm when getting out of the car. Don’t allow your pet to charge wildly out of the seat. Instead, take a firm grasp of the leash, open the car, and command your dog to sit. Then command them to get out of the car.Wait until you are several yards or meters down the trail before releasing a tight hold on the leash.
This control prevents your pet from getting in others’ ways in the parking lot and trailhead, where people are often gathered when you first start a trail.

, If you are keeping your dog on a leash for the entire hike, you need to train them properly. Being familiar with a leash prevents frustration for both you and your dog. Your job is to assert your dominance in keeping your dog by your side instead of letting your dog walk you.Keep your dog by your side when walking on a leash.
Their head should be raised and show that they are paying attention.
Your dog should be walking at the same speed as you. This displays that they are aware of you and agree that you are in charge.
Train your dog to do these things by using a short leash and rewarding them along the way., As your dog becomes accustomed to walking by your side, you can start to give them gradual freedom on the trail. For example, they can be on a long leash (some people use 30-foot or 10 meter leashes) so that they feel like they are running free. Then when it is time for them to come back to you, you can pull them in if they don’t respond. This is called recall training.It is important to reward your pet each time they come when you call. A treat with each “check in” tells them that coming when you say their name is a good thing.Look at treats on the trail as payment for checking in. It is like being rewarded with $20 for giving your teacher a high five every 5 minutes.
As your dog responds to being recalled, you can let the leash get longer and longer. If the trail you’re on allows it, you may be able to take the leash off completely.

, When it is time to get back in the car, offer more treats. This way going home isn’t a tug of war or a power struggle. Seeing the leash (if they have been off of it for the hike) or the car should be a happy sign because it means more treats are about to come.After a few months, you will probably have a successfully trained dog.
You may be able to reduce how many treats you give on a walk as your dog becomes accustomed to being recalled and going home.

Give treats in return for playing fetch.,
Offer a treat if your dog jumps over logs.,
Teach them to run around a tree.,
Play hide and seek.",How to Walk a Dog in the Woods3," As your dog gets used to coming when you call, they may actually have a hard time leaving your side because they want treats. When you notice this happening, try to train your dog to play games. These require your dog to work harder for treats. Start by rewarding your dog for retrieving a stick or chew toy.Toss the stick or toy gently down the trail, making sure that you can keep it in sight. This may be difficult with a stick in the forest, so choose a unique one.
You can try tossing a Frisbee instead since a brightly colored disc may be easier for your dog to see.
Dogs do not see in black and white; rather, they see colors less powerfully than humans. Thus a brightly colored toy will contrast with the browns and greens of the woods, making a toy easy to see on the trail.Give your dog a treat when they bring the toy back.

, Whenever you encounter a log laying across the trail, use this as an opportunity to play a game. Pause in your hike to encourage your dog to jump over the log. Give him a treat when he does.Add to the game by rewarding them when they crawl under the log.

, If there are any trees close to the trail with space around them for running, encourage your dog to run around them. Show your dog where to go by running around it yourself, then coaxing your dog to follow your actions. Give them a treat when they perform this game successfully.

, Start a game of hide and seek with your dog in the woods by hiding behind a tree. Although you can play by yourself, this game works better with two people. Have your partner hold the dog’s collar while you position yourself behind a tree. Call out, “Where am I?” and watch your dog try to track your voice.Have your partner let go of the collar when you call out, but retain the leash if there are leashing rules or your dog isn’t fully trained to check in yet.
Have a treat ready in your hand for when your dog finds you.

Change up your route.,
Learn something new.,
Take in the scenery.,
Take pictures.,
Listen to music.",How to Have Fun While You're Walking Your Dog1," Going somewhere new and different can make the walk more interesting for both you and your dog. Try driving out to a lake or walking to a park you don't normally go. Even taking a different route in your neighborhood can make it more fun.You could also try walking in a different neighborhood with more interesting houses.;
, Walking is a great time to listen to an audiobook or podcasts. While you don't want to completely disengage from your dog while walking (after all, your job is make sure your dog is safe), you can keep one earbud in to listen to a novel, learn a language, or listen to a podcast about something interesting., Often, when out with your dog, you're likely thinking about what you need to do next week or what's on your work schedule. You're not fully in the moment. Instead, pull yourself out of your head, and take time to actually look at the scenery on your walk.Notice the pretty flowers your neighbor planted. Check out the interesting architecture. Listen to the sounds of the birds and people in the distance.
Taking time to be in the moment will make it more interesting, and it will help give you a much-needed break from stress.

, Another fun activity for a walk is taking photos as you go. Doing so will engage you in your surroundings as you always hunt for the next pretty picture. Plus, you'll likely capture some good shots of your dog being goofy and fun. You can even post a few pictures online after your walk to let others see what you've been up to., Nothing gets your heart pumping like your favorite song. If you have some tunes you love playing in your ears while you're walking, you're likely to walk faster (if they're upbeat) and stay more entertained as you go. Just remember to keep an eye out for your dog. Try just putting one earbud in instead of both of them, so you're still aware of your surroundings.

Find the phone number for animal control.,
Report by telephone.,
Report online.,
Meet with an animal control officer.,
Read your local leash law.,
Write down the name of the dog’s owner.,
Take pictures or video.,
Document if the dog threatened you.",How to Report Leash Law Violations," You usually report leash law violations to your city or county’s animal control department. You can find the number in your phone book or on the Internet. Search for “your city” and “animal control” in a search engine.


Check if there is a fax number and email address available as well.;
, You should call the number provided and report the leash law violation. In some cities, you will call a general number, such as 3-1-1.Provide as much information as you can about the dog and the owner.

, Some governments might have online complaint forms that you can fill out. Maricopa county in Arizona, for example, allows you to report leash law violations online, provided you know the animal’s owner. You will be prompted to provide the following information:your name and address
your email
your telephone number
the location of the incident, including street address and major crossroads
a description of the animal, including breed, size, color and age
any other relevant information

, Animal control probably won’t send someone out immediately to investigate. However, you should make yourself available to meet with the officer if requested. Share whatever documentary evidence you have of the violation.

, Your city or county government might publish its leash law. You can find it on the government website or by stopping into the town office and asking for a copy. Pay attention to what constitutes a violation of the law:


Does the law apply to only dogs, or to dogs, cats, and other animals?
How long does the leash have to be? Does the length of leash differ depending on the breed of the dog?
Does the leash law cover only animals out for a walk, or does it also require that dogs be on leashes when in their yards?
Can the owner install a physical or electronic fence instead of leashing the animal?
Is there a designated off-leash park where people can take their dogs?, If you see an unleashed animal in someone’s yard, then note the address. If the person is out walking their dog off the leash, then check if you can identify the owner. Your animal control will need an address in order to reach out to the animal owner.

, This is fairly easy if the animal is left unleashed in its yard. Make sure that the date stamp on the picture or video reflects the actual date.


However, be careful about taking video of a person, even in public. In many states, it is illegal to record someone’s conversation without their permission. For this reason, you shouldn’t videotape someone walking their unleashed dog in public since you might accidentally record a confidential conversation they are having with another person.Generally, you could still take pictures of someone in public space, such as a park or on the street.

, The dog might have rushed you or, worse, actually bitten you. You should document any damage the unleashed dog has caused. You can bring a lawsuit for dog bites, if you are sufficiently injured.


If a dog caused you to fall off a bicycle or crash your car, then document the injuries suffered. Get medical records and repair estimates. Also take vivid color photographs of your injuries."
"
Hold your leash properly.,
Stop your dog.,
Try multiple methods to counter pulling.,
Give voice commands.,
Use positive reinforcements.",How to Walk a Big Dog2," Incorrectly holding the leash can not only lead to injuries, to you and/or the dog, but it also can reinforce bad habits for your dog. Try a few of the following suggestions:


Well-mannered dogs can be controlled by simply placing a thumb in the handle of the leash, and then enclosing the hand around the rest of the leash.For more control, fold the handle a couple times into the palm of your hand. Ensure the handle protrudes towards the bottom of your fist so it slips out when uncontrollable force yanks the leash. This leash accordion can be let loose for more slack if the dog needs more room.Hold the leash firmly in both hands while draping it across your lap. This works well if the accordion is in a hand close to your hip, and the other is naturally on the other side.
Use two hands. With one hand extended holding the leash folds, use the other hand to hold the portion of the leash closest to you. Brace that rear hand on your back hip for more support.
Try selecting a shorter leash for more control. The shortened length of the leash will provide less leeway for the dog to pull and knock you off balance.

, Keep your dog stationary to distract it from pulling. There are various methods to get your dog to stop in its tracks.


Teach it the sit command. When it starts pulling, command it to stop. If there are distractions nearby, let it stay seated until everything passes.
When you have a moment that you aren’t completely focused on the dog and your walk, step on the slack of the leash to keep the dog stationary.
Try the baseball bat method. Hold the leash in both hands against your stomach, much like you’d hold a baseball bat, and keep your feet shoulder-width apart.That should keep the dog from moving.

, Backwards pulls cause resistance. You don't want the dog to feel like it's fighting you.


Use quick sideways tugs for corrections. Try using quick sideways tugs to make fast obedience corrections. These types of corrections are particularly useful with slip collars.Reverse direction. Instead of pulling back or going sideways, just turn around and start walking as if that's the desired direction. Don't acknowledge your dog until it catches up to you. Once it does, praise and reward it for being at your side.Tire your dog out first. Dogs often pull because they have an abundance of energy and want to run around. Before you go on your walk, play a game or rough-house with your dog to expend some of the excess energy.Walk quickly. When your dog is walking at a brisk pace, it will have no chance to spot or smell something distracting. Your dog will be focused and interested in what you are doing instead., Use a firm voice to give commands such as ""heal"" or ""halt"", while making sure to keep a firm grip on the leash. When the dog is calm, resume walking. With practice, the dog will understand they need to stay by your side. Remember that you are in charge and you set the pace of the walk., Many dog trainers and walkers recommend positive reinforcement with animal training. Use the treats incrementally to reward small movements and responses to commands."
"
Use calm-assertive energy.,
Be the pack leader.,
Be patient.",How to Walk a Big Dog3," Ensure the dog understands you’re in charge, and the dog will be more likely to listen to your instructions. Respond to positive behaviors with positive reinforcement as often as possible while remaining firm to your intentions., According to some experts, a well-balanced dog is easier to command and control. By exercising your dog and showing appropriate amounts of discipline and affection you will establish yourself as the pack leader. This is more important than working on verbal commands like “roll over”. Exude calm confidence with pack leadership and body language. , As frustrating as it may be at first, you should try to stay calm while leash training your dog. The goal is to make walking enjoyable for both parties. All dogs learn at different rates. It may be easier to start small, by putting your dog on its leash in a secure area (such as your backyard) with few distractions, and just walk a few times around the perimeter."

Research your transport options carefully.,
Check the laws before planning to ship your dog.,
Consider hiring a professional animal transport agency.,
Consider the dog's size when thinking about air travel.,
Think about the animal's health and breed.,
Think about the timing of your trip.,
Buy a suitable shipping crate.,
Acclimate your dog to the crate.",How to Ship a Dog1," The two most common ways to ship a dog are by air and by automobile. The method you choose will depend on the length and timing of the journey, the size and variety of the dog, and the funds you have available to ship your dog.


Note that both the U.S. Humane Society and the ASPCA caution pet owners to avoid shipping animals as cargo on commercial airlines whenever possible.;
, Some countries and states strictly regulate the importation of dogs. Check the laws for your destination early to ensure you can get any health documentation and permits you may need in time for your trip, and that you understand any quarantine rules that may apply upon your pet's arrival.

, There are many agencies worldwide that can facilitate and/or provide transportation for your pet, by land, or by air. Given the complexities of shipping a dog, it might be worth it to work with one of these companies. The International Pet and Animal Transportation Association maintains listings for both air and ground pet transportation services.

, On most commercial airlines, dogs can only ride in the cabin with you if they are small enough to travel in a carrier that fits under the seat. The exact specifications vary by airline, but the space allowed is generally 8-9 inches tall by 12-13 inches wide, by 15-23 inches wide. If the dog's carrier doesn't fit under the seat, it will have to travel in the cargo hold of the plane.Chartered private flights generally allow larger animals in the cabin, but this is a very expensive option.

, Talk with your vet before your trip to find out if your dog's health or breed will require any special shipping considerations. Note that brachycephalic or ""snub-nosed"" breeds of dogs, including pugs, bulldogs, chows, etc. are at greater risk from the dangers of air travel. It is strongly recommended that these animals never be shipped in the cargo holds of planes, and many airlines refuse to transport them., While airplane cargo holds are pressurized and have some climate-control, animals in the hold will be subject to outdoor temperatures whenever the plane is being loaded and unloaded. For this reason, airlines restrict the transport of animals when extreme temperatures are expected at any of the plane's stopping points. Some airlines won't transport animals during the winter at all, and all companies take into account daily temperatures when deciding whether or not to permit animals in the cargo hold.If you must ship your dog during periods of extreme heat or cold, automobile transport may be your safest and most reliable option.
Research various airline policies before making your reservations. Some airlines offer specific advice (e.g. only ship animals on daytime flights in winter, etc.) that can help alleviate temperature concerns.
Some airlines will also allow you to present an acclimation certificate from a certified veterinarian stating that your animal can handle extreme temperatures (usually cold) and should be allowed to fly even if the airline cannot guarantee recommended temperatures., Whether you ship your dog by air or automobile, you should secure a shipping crate for the dog that is well-ventilated and large enough for the dog to comfortably stand up, turn around, and lie down in.Be advised that some airlines have additional crate requirements.
If you will be travelling by car, look for a crate that is crash-tested, and is designed to be secured with car restraints.
It is best to acquire your crate in advance so that you can get your dog used to it before you travel.

, Begin getting the dog used to its crate several weeks in advance. Begin by simply placing the dog in the crate for some time every day. Then try driving the dog around town in the crate for increasingly longer periods of time to get it used to the sensation of travelling.If you find your dog is extremely anxious when travelling in the crate, speak to your veterinarian to determine if sedation would be helpful or necessary.

Help your dog get acquainted with new places.,
Neuter your dog.,
Make sure your dog gets exercise and play time.,
Desensitize your dog to loud noises.,
Make your home a place they want to be.",How to Avoid Losing Your Dog1," Unfamiliar places can cause your dog to run away to “get back home.” If you have recently moved to a new home or are travelling with your dog, acquaint your dog with these new places so it doesn’t feel like it needs to “get back home.”Lead your dog around a new or unfamiliar house so that it can sniff everything and become familiar with the place.
Also, surround your dog with its blankets and toys, or something with your scent, like a t-shirt or pillow case, so the place becomes familiar to your dog.;
, Many dogs, particularly male dogs, will attempt to run away if they feel the urge to mate. You can prevent your dog from running away to mate by neutering it.Take your dog to your vet or the ASPCA to have it neutered. Neutering your dog is cost-effective; it is generally $40 to $100 dollars depending on its sex. The best time to neuter your dog is when they are six to nine months old., Many dogs attempt to run away because they are bored or lonely. You can prevent this by providing your dog with interactive exercise and regular walks.Take your dog on regular, daily walks. Walk them once in the morning after they have use the restroom, and once in the evening, after you get home from work.
On the weekend, take them to the dog park. If you don’t have time for the park, play fetch with them in your backyard. By associating your backyard with fun activities, you can also prevent your dog from wanting to escape.
If you don’t have time to walk your dog regularly, hire a dog walker to come by once a day to walk your dog.

, Especially during the holidays, loud noises, caused by fireworks for example, can scare your dog and cause them to run away in order to escape the noise. Desensitize your dog to loud noises by training them to relax at the sound of the noise. Also, provide your dog with a safe place to escape to if they hear a loud noise, like thunder. For example, if your dog runs under the bed when it hears thunder, make your bedroom available during a storm.On a tape recorder, record the sound of fireworks. First, play the tape at a low, non-frightening volume. While the tape is playing at a low volume, give your dog a treat, feed it dinner, or play its favorite game. Keep repeating this activity. Gradually increase the volume of the tape over a period of weeks or months. If your dog is frightened at any point, stop immediately. During the next session, start at a lower volume., Make your place a home your dog loves to be. By doing this, you will prevent your dog from wanting to escape. Make your home a happy place by:Regularly cleaning your home.
Giving your dog an area that is especially designated for them, for example, a corner with their bed and toys.
Playing with them in the backyard regularly.
Feeding them and give them treats regularly.

Move a little faster.,
Start running.,
Try rollerblading.,
Stop at the dog park for active fetch.",How to Have Fun While You're Walking Your Dog2," If you usually meander with your dog, that's a decent workout. However, to make it more effective, try moving a bit faster. You should start breathing a bit heavier, but not so heavy that you can't talk while you're walking. You should feel a bit warmer, but there's no need to get extra sweaty.Before starting a more strenuous program with your dog, make sure your dog is healthy enough for it. Talk to your vet about your dog's capabilities.

, If just walking bores you, consider running with your dog. Not every dog will be up to it (especially elderly dogs), but if you can get your dog in the habit of running with you, it can be fun for both of you. Plus, your dog will hold you accountable better than any other running partner.Make sure you're dog can handle running by consulting your vet.

, Another option to workout with your dog is to rollerblade. You'll be able to go faster, which your dog will enjoy. Plus, you may find it more interesting than just walking, because you'll be more fully engaged in working out. However, your dog needs to be well-trained on a leash if you are going to rollerblade with it., Your dog will love having time to play fetch, and you can use the time to workout, too. Try throwing the ball, then performing some exercise moves while your dog fetches a ball or frisbee. For example, you could try lunges, squats, or jumping jacks. Challenge yourself to see how many you can fit in before your dog returns with the ball or frisbee."

Decide if homeowner’s insurance is sufficient.,
Ask about umbrella coverage.,
Find insurers.,
Get quotes.,
Check how comprehensive the coverage is.,
Sign a contract.,
Pay your premiums.,
File a claim, if necessary.",How to Buy Dog Owners Liability Insurance," If your dog bites someone, then it should be covered by your homeowner’s insurance. With most homeowner’s insurance, the injury doesn’t have to incur on your property. Instead, the insurance will cover any liability you incur. You can get coverage worth several hundred thousand dollars.


Homeowner’s insurance companies do have a “one-bit rule.” This means that the company will usually pay for the first bite then quickly cancel your insurance.
You also might be able to get coverage for certain dog breeds which are commonly thought dangerous: pit bulls, Rottweilers, Dobermans, etc.If you have one of these dogs, then you might not be able to get homeowner’s insurance coverage.;
, You might already have homeowner’s or renter’s insurance but it doesn’t cover dog bites. Instead of buying separate liability insurance for dogs, you could ask your current insurer to provide you with “umbrella” coverage, which is essentially supplemental coverage.Call your insurance agent and ask about whether or not you can get umbrella coverage. You will need to already have the underlying homeowners insurance.
Tell your agent why you want umbrella coverage. Some umbrella policies may exclude canine coverage.

, If you need separate liability insurance for dogs, then you will need to research specialty insurers. You can research on the Internet for “dog bite insurance” or “dog owner’s liability insurance” and see what pulls up. Some of the more popular dog owner’s liability insurers are:


Federation of Insured Dog Owners
Einhorn Insurance Agency
Lester Kalmanson Agency, Inc.
Pet Protection Pak

, You should contact the insurance carrier and ask for quotes. Some insurers will have websites where you can get a quote by entering requested information. The insurer will want to know:The age, sex, and weight of the dog.
The dog’s breed. Some insurers might not insure dangerous breeds. The insurer will let you know.
If the dog has been spayed or neutered.
If the dog has been vaccinated.
Whether you rent or own your home.
If the dog has previously bitten someone. You can expect a higher premium if your dog has a history of biting someone. If it has, then you might be denied coverage altogether.
Whether the dog has been trained.
If your property is fenced.
Your name and contact information.

, Not all policies will be the same. Check to see if the policy covers the following:legal fees
medical expenses for the person injured, including plastic surgery
loss of income for the person injured
medical expenses for any injured dog (excluding yours)
coverage for property damage

, After you have compared insurers on price and comprehensiveness of coverage, you should pick an insurer and tell them that you would like to buy their insurance. If the insurer needs additional information not provided for the quote, then you should get it to them.


Sign the contract and return it to the insurer. Keep a copy for your records.

, You need to pay your monthly premiums in order to keep your coverage current. You should set any reminders necessary so that you don’t forget. If your coverage lapses and your dog bites someone, then you will not be covered.

, In the unfortunate event that your dog bites someone, you should act quickly to get the victim necessary medical attention. You will also need to take steps in order to file a proper claim with the insurer. After attending to the medical needs of the victim, you should do the following:Take a picture (if possible) of the victim’s injury.
Get your dog secured in a safe area.
Document the names of the victims and witnesses
Call the police or other appropriate authority
Immediately report the injury to your insurer. Your policy may state the number of days that you have to report (e.g., 10).

Keep your dog away from caffeine.,
Avoid giving your dog dairy.,
Refrain from giving your dog macadamia nuts.,
Avoid foods containing xylitol.",How to Avoid Foods Dangerous for Your Dog1," You should never give your dog alcohol. Foods or drinks with alcohol in them can cause problems for your dog. This includes beer, liquor, and wine.Alcohol can cause digestive problems like vomiting and diarrhea, problems breathing and with coordination, tremors, and coma. Alcohol can also lead to death in dogs.;
, Caffeine and products containing caffeine can cause problems for your dog. Caffeine is included in coffee, tea, chocolate, and sodas. These can cause diarrhea and vomiting, panting, excessive urination and thirst, hyperactivity, seizures, and tremors. It can also lead to death.Dark chocolate is the most dangerous chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level.

, Dairy products can cause problems for dogs. These include milk, cheese, and yogurt. Dogs are lactose intolerant, so they cannot digest milk. This leads to digestive distress, such as diarrhea, gas, and bloating., Macadamia nuts can cause almost immediate problems in dogs. Within 12 hours, your dog may show weakness and depression, start vomiting, experience tremors, and suffer from hypothermia. You should refrain from giving your dog any nuts due to the oils and fats.These symptoms may last for up to two days.

, Xylitol has been proven dangerous for dogs. Since xylitol is a sugar substitute, it doesn’t affect a human’s blood sugar level. However, in dogs, the xylitol can trigger a dangerous level of insulin to release from the pancreas.Xylitol can be found in sugar-free candy, breath mints, baked goods, medications, and toothpaste.

Label the dog's collar.,
Place appropriate bedding in the crate.,
Provide water for the dog during travel.,
Exercise your dog before the flight.,
Feed your dog four hours before the flight.,
Avoid tranquilizing your dog.,
Arrive at the airport early.,
Alert the cabin staff that your dog is travelling in the cargo hold.,
Relax, and know that tens of thousands of dogs successfully travel by air every year.",How to Ship a Dog2," Try to book direct flights to minimize the amount of time your dog is left unattended in the cargo hold. It is best to make reservations for your dog by calling the airline directly to speak to a booking agent. Let the agent know that you are shipping a dog, and ask if there are specific guidelines and accommodations that the airline can provide.


Travel with your animal, whenever possible.

, Within 10 days of your flight, you will need to obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian confirming that your dog is healthy enough to fly, and that all of its vaccinations are up to date.Some destinations may require a separate certification that your dog is up-to-date on rabies vaccinations. Your vet can provide this at the time of the exam.

, Make sure that your shipping container has the words ""Live Animal"" written in letters at least one-inch tall on the top and at least one side of the crate, along with arrows indicating which way is up. Also write the dog's name, along with the contact name, address, and telephone number of your pet's destination on the crate, and indicate whether or not you are accompanying the animal on the flight.It may also be helpful to affix a photo of your dog to the outside of the crate for identification purposes.
If your dog is on any medication, also include this information when labeling of the crate.

, It is also helpful to carefully label your dog's collar with name, flight, contact, and health information, in the event that your dog escapes the crate.</ref>

, If you know your dog won't eat paper, put a piece of clean cardboard at the bottom of the crate to help prevent sliding during transport. You can also add a low-sided dog bed, blanket or towel to the bottom of the crate for your dog to lay on., Affix one or two water bowls inside the crate with zip ties. Freeze some water the night before travel, and at the airport, place the ice into each water dish so that it will thaw during the journey and give your dog something to drink.


It is not advisable to give the dog food during the flight to prevent air sickness, but you may attach a packet of the dog's food outside the crate that airline personnel may be able to give the dog in case of delays or other emergencies., Make sure that the dog has time to urinate and defecate before you place it in the crate. Once the dog is checked in at the airport, it will not be able to get out of the crate until you pick it up at baggage claim.

, A dog with a full stomach is more likely to experience air sickness, so be sure your pet gets to eat well before the flight., This can cause the dog to have breathing problems on the flight, and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Check with your veterinarian for specific advice., Most airlines restrict the number of pets that can be in the cabin on each flight, and spots are allotted on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you plan to take your dog in the cabin with you, be sure to check in for your flight early to guarantee a place. Also, give yourself and your dog extra time to get through airport security., They will most likely have been appraised of this before boarding, but it can't hurt to make a human connection with the staff on your plane., Although accidents do occasionally happen, with proper preparation, your dog will almost certainly arrive at your destination happy and safe.

Keep your dog's medical records handy.",How to Ship a Dog3," If you choose to have your dog transported by someone else, be sure to do your research and look for a company with good reviews. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation, or for guidance in selecting the best carrier. Pet transportation can be expensive, but is considered to be the safest, most reliable way to ship your dog.Different transporters offer different levels of service, but most ensure that your dog will be closely monitored throughout the trip, and get out routinely for monitored exercise and rest.
Be sure to alert the transporter of any medical conditions or special needs your dog may have before the trip.

, If you plan to drive your dog across country yourself, bring an extra person along to help with the driving, and to keep an eye on your canine passenger when you need to use the restroom, go into stores, etc.

, Be sure to factor in time for exercise and bathroom breaks for both you and your dog every day. And be sure to book rooms with pet-friendly hotels, which are available in most areas.


Never let your dog out of the car without his collar, ID tag, and leash.

, It is not safe to allow your dog to ride in your lap or the front seat, and in some states, it is even illegal. The safest place for your dog in the car is in a crash-rated travel crate.It is also possible to buy car harnesses for dogs that snap into the car's seatbelt or LATCH system., As with air travel, it is best to acclimate your dog to travelling before attempting a long trip. Begin with short trips around the neighborhood, then slowly increase the time the dog spends in the car.

, Make sure your dog wears a collar and ID tag throughout your trip. Include a label on the collar with emergency contact information for yourself, and for someone at your intended destination. Carry a current picture of your dog, as well, in case it escapes and you need assistance locating it.


For added peace of mind, microchip your dog before your trip so that it can be quickly identified should it escape., Be sure that you have everything your dog will need to stay comfortable in the car as you travel. Bring along enough food and medication for a few extra days, in case you are delayed.

, Keep the windows cracked if it is hot outside, and remember that you should never leave a dog alone in a hot car.


Do not transport your dog in the back of a moving truck!, If you are shipping your dog in a vehicle crowded with boxes, luggage, or other belongings, be sure that everything is well-secured so that a sudden stop or turn will not cause heavy objects to fall on your dog., In case your dog falls ill during the trip, it will be helpful if you have a copy of its medical records with you at all times.

Collar your dog.,
Microchip your dog.,
Walk your dog with leash.,
Train your dog with stay and release words.",How to Avoid Losing Your Dog2," Buy a collar that is comfortable, but also one that the dog cannot remove easily. Choose a limited choke dollar to prevent your dog from removing the collar. The collar should have tags. The tags should have the dog’s name, your name, your street address, and phone number. In case the tags fall off, you can also right this information on the collar with a permanent marker., Unlike a GPS, microchips are not a tracking device. Instead, they are radio-frequency identification implants that do not require a power source. They provide permanent identification for your pet, so if your dog gets lost and someone finds it, they can scan the chip and notify you of your dog's whereabouts.Take your dog to your vet or the ASPCA to have it microchipped.


On average it costs around $45 to microchip your pet. It is a one-time fee that includes registration in a pet recovery database.Remember to update your address and information in the system if you move to a new house or apartment.

, When you take your dog for a walk, always have them on a leash. Try not to unleash your dog when it uses the restroom. Your dog might forget that it is unleashed, and if it sees a squirrel or a bird, it might run after it.

, Train your dog to sit, stay, and release. If you only train your dog to sit, then they are more likely to get up whenever they please and leave or run off. However, you want them to sit, say, and get up when you say it is OK to get up.When you use a release word, like “OK,” you are giving your dog a set start and end time. Every time you give your dog a sit command, you need to end it with a release command, like “OK” or “Yes.” This way your dog knows that they are not supposed to get up until you tell them to."

Search your home first and alert your neighbors.,
Make important phone calls.,
Create and post flyers.,
Don’t give up.",How to Avoid Losing Your Dog3," As soon as you notice that your dog is missing, search around your house to make sure they aren’t hiding or sleeping somewhere. Once you have confirmed that your dog is missing, alert your neighbors right away. Then, slowly drive around your neighborhood calling your dogs name as you go along.Bring a picture of your dog with you so you can ask any of your neighbors that happen to be outside if they have seen your dog.

, Call your local shelters, rescue groups, animal control agencies, and veterinary hospitals. Give them a description of your dog, as well as the dog’s name. Also bring photos of your dog to these places, and check-in with them regularly to see if they have found your dog. If there aren’t any of these places near your house, contact your local police department.Services like HomeAgain or Lost My Doggie will allow you to post online that your pet is missing. These services will notify people in your area, pet shelters, and pet rescues that your pet is missing. They will also contact you if your pet has been found.

, Create flyers that will stand out and get noticed. For example, create a flyer on bright green paper with a bold headline that people can read from afar, for example, “LOST DOG.” On the flyer, include your dog’s specifications, like name, breed, sex, age, coloring, weight, and any distinguishing features. Also, include your contact information, like your name, phone number, and an email. In case you cannot be reached, include the name and phone number of a family member or friend, as well.Post the flyers around dog parks, running trails, your neighborhood, pet supply and grooming stores, veterinary offices, and places you frequent with your dog.

, Most importantly, don’t give up. Many lost dogs eventually find their way back home. Scan your neighborhood weekly until you have found your dog. Regularly check in with the places mentioned above, and replace old flyers with new ones."

Let your dog get its sniffing out.,
Work on training.,
Encourage play.,
Make an obstacle course.",How to Have Fun While You're Walking Your Dog3," You may be a bit annoyed that your dog stops every five seconds to sniff something on your walk, but to your dog, each smell is fascinating. Every smell communicates something about what's going on in the area, including who's been there recently (dog and human). Giving your dog a chance to sniff around will keep it entertained., Walks generally aren't the place to introduce new commands, but they can be a great way to reinforce training your dog already knows. Plus, your dog will find the walk more interesting if it gets to interact with you more.For instance, you can work on sit and stay as you walk. Try telling the dog to sit at various times throughout the walk, particularly if it's a challenging time, such as your dog wanting to chase after a squirrel. You could also try running a few paces ahead and then asking the dog to sit.
You can also work on recall. Start by practicing with less interesting places, such as a light pole. Let your dog sniff the area, and go to the end of the leash. Call the dog's name, and use your recall word to get it to come. If it comes immediately, praise it and offer a treat. If it needs some help, get its attention with a funny noise or by lightly bumping it on the back. Then run off, calling its recall word. When it follows you, make sure to praise it extravagantly and give a treat, so you prove you're more interesting than what it was looking at.

, Your dog will likely enjoy playing with you whether you're on a walk or at home, though some may need to get used to the idea in public. For instance, you can take a tug toy along with you to bring out at different times during the walk. You could also crouch down and act like you're stalking your dog (in fun). Try any game your dog seems to enjoy., Another way to keep your dog entertained is to treat the walk like an obstacle course. You could weave the dog between parking meters, for instance. You could also ask the dog to jump up and walk on benches or on low garden walls. Basically, you're just looking for ways to make the walk more interesting."

Discourage your dog from chewing on corn cobs.",How to Avoid Foods Dangerous for Your Dog2," Grapes and raisins can be extremely harmful to your dog. There are substances found in grapes that are toxic to dogs, even though experts don’t know what it is. Don’t give this to your dog because it can cause kidney failure., The fruit part of the fruits are okay for dogs, but the seeds or pits are toxic. Apple seeds and peach pits contain chemicals that release cyanide in the body when it’s digested. Pear seeds contain small amounts of arsenic.

Refrain from giving your dog raw meat.,
Use caution when giving your dog bones.",How to Avoid Foods Dangerous for Your Dog3," Raw fish can lead to a vitamin B deficiency, which can cause problems. Raw salmon and raw trout are dangerous for dogs because when they are raw, they sometimes contain bacteria-carrying parasites that can prove fatal.Cooked fish should be okay for dogs.

, Raw meat has the potential of containing harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella or E. Coli. These bacteria can cause digestive issues, such as vomiting or diarrhea. Only give your dog cooked meat.This includes raw eggs. Raw eggs can cause vitamin deficiencies and cause negative symptoms in your dog.

This should be no problem if you regularly take your dog to the vet for checkups and other issues. If you have not:


Make an appointment with the vet.
Talk to your vet to make sure your dog is up to date on important vaccinations. This might be very important if you are traveling to areas where certain canine illnesses are common.
Seek treatment for any outstanding issues that your dog suffers from. This could range from car sickness (in which case your vet could prescribe medication), to flea problems (this can also be solved with medication).;
, One of the best items you should invest in when going on a road trip with your dog is a seatbelt harness. A good seatbelt harness will safeguard your dog’s life in the event of an emergency and keep your dog in one spot in the car.


After you’ve purchased a harness, put it on your dog so he or she can get the feeling of it. Allow your dog to wear it and walk around with it for a while until he or she is comfortable.
When wearing the harness for the first time, give your dog lots of praise and treats.
Perform a dry run with the harness. Once your dog is suited up in the harness, put him or her in the car. Run the seat belt strap through the harness handle and latch to the buckle. Be sure there is enough slack to sit up, lay down and look out the window. Take your friend for a drive around the neighborhood., Microchipping your dog is something important you might want to consider before going on a road trip. A microchip will be extremely important if your dog somehow gets lost or goes missing on your journey.


Canine microchips contain all of your contact information and can easily be scanned by local animal shelters and vets.
Canine microchips are relatively inexpensive and can range from less than $10 to $50 with yearly fees.
Canine microchips are responsible for thousands of dogs being returned to their owners every year.
Make sure your dog’s microchip information is up to date with your current address and phone number., Whether your dog is a seasoned traveler or a new traveler, you may want to consider taking a relatively short practice trip just so you both can get used to how you’ll be traveling. A practice trip can help you identify any issues you might have on the road.


A practice trip will allow you to figure out if your dog suffers from motion sickness.
Set your dog up in the car the same way he or she would be set up on the real trip.
Try driving for about half an hour to an hour to see how your dog behaves.
Be positive and reward your dog every step of the way on the practice trip. You can do this both verbally and with treats. Doing so will help your dog build a positive association with the car., Most places you'll visit will require your dog to be leashed at all times, even when nature calls. If your dog isn't used to eliminating while on leash, you will need to teach this skill well in advance.


Begin in your backyard. Use a verbal cue such as ""go potty"" to let him know that it's time to perform.
Once your dog eliminates, praise him.
Practice this routine in unfamiliar areas around town., Before you get on the road, you need to make sure that you’ve purchased enough dog food for your journey. Whether you trip is a day long or a month long, you’ll want to make sure that you have your friend’s favorite food in stock so you don’t have to hunt it down when on the road.


If space allows, bring all of the food you’ll need for the journey.
If your dog has a special diet, this could be extra important.
Make sure to bring plenty of treats., When gathering your travel gear, make sure to bring some of your dog’s favorite toys. Toys will provide your dog with something to do and serve as a familiar item that could relieve stress and anxiety.


Bring toys that your dog can realistically play with.
Bring some toys that your dog just might like to have around – like a favorite teddy bear.
Avoid bringing toys like rawhide, bones, or other items that your dog could choke on when you are driving., Make sure that you pack your car with plenty of blankets and other comfortable items so your dog can nest and rest comfortably on the journey. This, ultimately, might be the most important thing you can do to make your dog’s journey a fun one.


Bring your dog’s bed, if space permits.
Pack blankets pillows and spread them around the area your dog will be laying.
Always bring more pillows and blankets than you think you need, as your dog will be sleeping the majority of your trip and will want to be comfortable.

, Your dog’s leash is perhaps the most important part of the road trip experience – as your dog will have to be leashed when you walk your friend or hike in parks and other scenic areas. As a result, you won’t want to forget a leash.


Bring a spare leash, in case something happens to your main one.
Consider bringing leashes of several lengths, as you might need leashes for different occasions.
Always use a leash when walking your dog in strange locations.
Leash your dog before you open the door to let him or her out of the car., When packing for your trip, make sure to bring your dog’s collar with any vaccination tags and contact information. You’ll want to put the collar on your dog whenever he or she is out of your car or has the chance to escape. Wearing a collar could pay off big time if your dog is lost and someone brings him or her to a local shelter somewhere., Consider buying a dog crate. Dog crates are extremely important when going on road trips. They will allow you to crate your dog at a hotel or motel, or in the car if possible. In the end, your dog crate might wind up being an indispensable item for your trip.


Hard-sided, collapsible crates provide protection during travel and also while staying at your destination.
Avoid soft-sided crates since dogs can tear out of them when they are nervous and stressed about unfamiliar situations.
If you have to leave your dog alone in a hotel by himself or herself on the road, a crate will be extremely important., One important item you should not forget are doggie waste bags. These are important since your dog will be pooping on public or private property (that you do not own). Doggy waste bags will allow you to pick up after your pooch and avoid making a mess for other people., A dog first aid kit is a really good idea for any person traveling with their canine friend. Bringing a kit will prepare you for the eventuality of an unexpected emergency on the road. Ultimately, if something does happen, you will be equipped to treat your friend for an array of issues.


Include items such as dog wound compression wraps, antiseptic rinse, gloves, scissors, gauze, tweezers, and hand sanitizers.
A muzzle should also be included, since a dog's natural reaction when seriously injured is to defend itself with a bite.
Consult your veterinarian about items to include if your dog has a specific medical problem., Part of getting your dog ready for the trip is making sure you’re ready to take care of your dog. As a result, you need to make sure that you’ll be prepared and know exactly where to go if your friend has a medical emergency. To do this, you need to do some footwork on the internet and create a list of veterinarians along your route and at your destination.


If your dog has any special needs, contact vets along the way or at the final destination to make sure they can care for your dog.
Do a quick internet search to find vets in major cities or substantial towns along your route.
Call veterinarians on your list if you have any questions or concerns., If your dog is on any medication at all, make sure you have enough medication to last the entirety of the trip and then some. Having enough medicine will make sure that you won’t have to track down a vet at the last minute.


Tell your veterinarian about your travel plans and let them know you might need extra medicine.
Ask your veterinarian for an emergency prescription just in case you need more medicine or lose what you bring.
Store any medication appropriately. If medication (like insulin) needs to be cool, bring a cooler. Never leave sensitive medicine in a hot car."

This means that the dog needs come when called and that it does not ignore your commands.Only taking a well-trained dog on a boat is a matter of safety. To keep a dog safe while boating you need to direct its actions so that it does not get into trouble or get injured accidentally.;
, Your dog doesn't need to be an amazing swimmer to enjoy a day on a boat. However, it should be able to doggy paddle and stay afloat to ensure that it can stay survive in an emergency.


Teaching your dog to swim starts with introducing it to water. Ideally, this would happen early in the dog's life, so that it can be trained to swim early.
Even with a life jacket on, your dog will need to know how to paddle a little bit to stay afloat and to get to shore safely. If your dog is not a good swimmer, at least make it practice with its life jacket on before going on a boat trip. This can be done by taking the dog to a doggy pool or practicing in the bathtub if you have a small dog.
Not all dogs can stay afloat, safely swim, or even like to swim. For example, bulldogs, pugs, and dachshunds aren't known for their love of the water. If you choose to take a dog who can't swim out on a boat, you need to be very, very cautious with its safety. The best option is is make sure that your dog can at least keep itself afloat.

, Your dog may be a little uncomfortable with its life jacket at first. In order to work through this, you should make it wear the jacket repeatedly so it gets used to the jacket. Try the life jacket on a few weeks ahead of your trip so that you have time to acclimate your dog to it if the pup doesn't like the jacket right away.


Before taking the dog on a boat, put the life jacket on the dog at home repeatedly for short periods of time.
Make the process fun for the dog. Do a fun activity while the dog has the jacket on, for instance throwing the ball for your dog while it is wearing the lifejacket. If the dog is doing well with the life jacket on, give it a treat to reinforce its good behavior.

, Before you take your dog on a boat trip, you should make sure you have the supplies you may need in case of emergency. These include the usual supplies included in a first aid kit, as well as some dog-specific supplies. These include:First-aid book for pets
Emergency phone numbers
General information about your pet (vaccination status, important medical records, current photo)
Leash
Self-cling bandages (clings to itself, not to fur)
Muzzle or piece of cloth to prevent biting

, You will need to bring a variety of supplies with you on board so that you and your dog have a pleasant and easy boat ride. These include:Fresh water
Leash
Collar
Life jacket
Identification (such as up-to-date tags on its collar)
Emergency kit

, Water is not the only hazard your dog will face on a boating trip. Dogs can easily get sunburned if they are out in the sun too long. To avoid this, apply sunscreen on the areas of exposed skin on your dog.Follow the directions on the packaging to know how far ahead to apply it.


Buy special sunscreen for your pet at a pet supply store. Pet sunscreens don't have PAPA or zinc in them, as these can be harmful if ingested.
Sunscreen should be applied to your dog's belly and inner thighs, as well as its nose, ears, and any bald spots or exposed areas of skin.

, Don't assume that your dog will love boating and will easily spend a long time on the boat on its first outing. Instead, begin with a short trip that is for the purpose of introducing your dog to boating.


Like most new experiences, your dog may take some time to acclimate. Just because it is nervous or scared on its first boating trip, that doesn't mean that it will always be that way. With a kind and gradual approach, your dog may become an avid boater over time.

, Whether your dog will be swimming around like a fish or will never touch the water with its paws, having a life jacket on your dog while boating is important. This means that you should keep it on the dog from the start of the ride to the finish.Even if your dog is a strong swimmer, it may benefit from a life jacket. Strong currents and long periods of time swimming can even wear out a dog that is a great swimmer. The life jacket is just a smart level of protection in case of emergency.

, Large dogs that you can't pick up may need a ramp to get on to your boat. There is no need to risk your dog's safety as it gets on and off the boat when you can easily supply a ramp to give it easy access.The ramp can also be used to help the dog get back on board if it gets off the boat to go in the water or onto the beach.

, In order to get your dog used to the boat, you should let it explore and sniff all around the boat. With the dog on leash, lead it all over the boat so that it gets a general understanding of the space. This will help to ease the stress of being stuck in a new space., Just because your dog is having a good time, is calm, and is a proficient swimmer, that doesn't mean that you don't have to keep an eye on it. Boating can present a variety of unforeseen hazards for your dog, from propellers to dangerous chemicals, so its your job to keep an eye out for them.For example, keep your dog on-leash when you start the boat. Also, don’t allow your dog to wander around the boat unsupervised, so that your dog doesn't get into a chemical it shouldn't.
Even a strong dog can slide off a boat due to unexpected boat movement. Keep an eye out on your dog, and if you see it go somewhere it shouldn’t, redirect it.

, Your dog should not have to stay in the sun all day. Access to shade is important for its well being and for its ability to control its body temperature. Without shade, your dog could get over heated and potentially get heat stroke.Dogs don't sweat like humans do, so they need other ways to regulate their body temperature. One way they can do this is to get out of the sun.

, You should give your dog a bowl of water on board the boat so that it does not get dehydrated. This is especially important on a hot or windy day, as dehydration can occur quickly under these conditions.Don't encourage your dog to drink from the water you are boating in. You do not know the purity of the water and many times, even if you are boating in fresh water, that water can make your dog sick.

, If your dog won't go to the bathroom on a wee-wee pad on the boat, you will need to give it a break on land to do its business. This is important for housebroken pets, as they need to be able to go to the bathroom on a regular basis."

You will need to plan your trip, book your flights, and sort out your paperwork well in advance—ideally months ahead, if possible.


Find out if your pet is allowed where you are staying while abroad.
Ensure that your pet can handle travel and is not hampered by age, illness, or injury.;
, Each country has different regulations regarding the entry of dogs. Check with the embassy or consulate of the country you are visiting to determine their specific rules. Read these regulations thoroughly and ensure that you comply with them.


Some countries do not allow foreign dogs to enter, while others require a lengthy quarantine process for foreign dogs.Remember that you must check your own country’s requirements as well, since it may have restrictions on “re-importing” your dog when you return home.
Several websites also offer information regarding rules for individual countries regarding pet entry.Find out if there are restrictions on the number or types of dogs that can enter the country you are visiting.

, Different airlines have different policies on transporting dogs internationally. Before booking your ticket, make sure you can bring your dog with you on that airline. Also check to see whether your dog will be accepted as checked or carry-on baggage, or whether you will have to use a cargo designation.The Humane Society of the United States recommends that pets travel in the cabin when possible.Be sure to check what breeds your airline allows to fly. In particular, some airlines will refuse to fly some toy or short-nose breeds.
If your dog accompanies you in the cabin, you will need to pay a fee and the dog will need to fit comfortably in its crate under the seat in front of you.If your dog must travel in cargo, check whether the cargo area for dogs is controlled for climate and pressure. This is a basic necessity for flying with a dog, and you should not fly your dog with an airline that doesn’t do this.

, Most airlines do not allow for booking space for animals online. Once you have booked your own tickets, phone the airline immediately afterwards to reserve space for your dog, since some airlines limit the number of dogs allowed on board per flight.

, This prevents mistakes arising from transferring your dog from one flight to another and minimizes disruption, which could cause your dog stress.

, If your dog isn't traveling in the cabin, consider the climate when booking your flight. If it is a warm summer, fly in the early morning or late evening. If the temperature is colder, fly at midday., The health requirements for flying with a dog vary from country to country, but nearly all require a health certificate from your veterinarian stating that your dog is free of infectious diseases. Your veterinarian will also determine whether your dog is healthy enough to endure international air travel.Typically, the pet health certificate must be current (no older than 10 days) for the airline to accept it. Be sure you are aware of these rules before boarding.Some countries require blood tests at least 6 months prior to departure to ensure that your dog is vaccinated against rabies.You should also obtain a vaccination record from your veterinarian.
Bring your veterinarian’s contact information with you.

, Proper identification is key when traveling internationally with your dog, and the American Veterinary Medicine Association recommends having your dog implanted with a microchip to make it easier to find your pet if it becomes lost. Talk with your vet about whether this is the right option for your pet.If you do not have a microchip implanted, be sure your dog has properly secured tags with up-to-date information.
You should include a travel ID tag with the contact number for your accommodations and your local contact number while traveling.

, Your dog will need a sturdy, comfortable carrier that is the proper size. Accustom your dog to being in the crate and being jostled and moved in ways it's not used to. Take several trips in your car with your dog in the crate before your flight to help with this.Getting your dog used to its crate is a long-term process, which usually takes several weeks. Again, begin early.
Taking the time to properly acclimate your dog to its crate will help ease your dog’s stress level during the flight.

, Place soft bedding, puppy pads, a water supply, and a food dish in the crate. Attach contact information on the crate as well, including your dog’s name, your contact information (both phone and e-mail), flight numbers, and your final destination. Tape it to the crate, preferably with a strong adhesive tape so it doesn’t come loose.Attach a food bag and water bottle to the outside of the crate if your dog will be flying as a checked item. Airline personnel will need to be able to access this without opening the crate.

, You want your dog to be as comfortable as possible while on a long flight, so give it a thorough brushing to remove any excess hair the day before your flight. Take your dog on a few extra walks that day as well, so that it is worn out and less stressed for the flight.

, The day before you fly, feed your dog a bit less than normal to help it have an emptier stomach for the flight. Be sure to give it plenty of water during this time, however, to help avoid dehydration.


This is dependent on the age and breed of your dog: if you are flying with a young puppy or a toy breed puppy, you shouldn’t withhold food. Check with your vet for more specific recommendations about food intake.

, Before you go to the airport and before you check in, take your dog for a few last walks to really make sure it will be as calm and tired as possible for the flight. These walks will also give your dog a chance to eliminate waste. Additionally, feed your dog a very light meal two hours before checking in to further help it remain calm.


It is a legal requirement in the U.S. to feed your dog two hours before check in.

, The earlier you arrive, the better chance you have of securing a quiet place in the baggage area for your dog. If possible, watch your dog being loaded on to the plane. If this is not possible, ensure that you are notified when your dog has been boarded. When you fly, notify the captain and crew that your dog is on board. They may take special steps to ensure your dog’s safety and comfort., Since your dog will be in its crate under the seat in front of you in the cabin, it is wise to spend as little time as possible on the plane.

, While you won’t be able to remove your dog from its carrier while you’re onboard, you can keep the carrier on your lap before takeoff. This is a good time to talk gently with your dog and reassure it that you are there. You can also gently massage or pet your dog through the carrier at this time.

, You don’t want to fill your dog’s belly while up in the air, but an occasional piece of kibble offered multiple times throughout the flight will be a welcome distraction for your dog. You can also offer your dog an ice cube to play with, and this distraction can also help keep your dog hydrated., Flights can be cold, so bring an extra blanket from home and keep it easily accessible. Check on your dog periodically to see whether the blanket is needed., One problem that can arise when your dog is flying cargo or in the cabin is that it can escape. To prevent this from occurring, be sure that the door is tightly secured and that your dog cannot escape by chewing the plastic on the kennel or crate.

, As you are getting ready to land, gather all of your paperwork necessary to identify your dog, any shipping documentation you have received, and your pet’s health and vaccination records. You will need all of this information in order to pick up your dog if it was in the cargo hold and to pass through customs inspections. Also identify where the cargo terminal is, if that is where you will be meeting your dog.

, If your pet flew in the cargo hold, it is essential to inspect your dog to make sure it didn’t suffer any injuries or problems during the flight. Let it out of its kennel for the exam, and if any problems are apparent, seek veterinary care immediately."

When you crate your dog they are less likely to suffer from motion sickness, nausea or vomiting.Most pet-supply stores carry dog crates. When buying a crate for your dog, make sure it is big enough for them to lay flat on their side for comfort, stand up, and turn around. Don't pick out a crate that is too big, however, as your dog still needs a sense on confinement for comfort. Use a larger crate with an adjustable divider if you are training a growing puppy. If you have a small dog that you like to bring with you everywhere you go, consider a smaller, easier to carry carrier made with luggage-grade nylon. These beds are not only comfortable, but easy to travel with. Frontgate, Sherpa, and Pet Life are just a few brands that make these.
Train your dog to associate positive things with the crate. Put treats and/or toys in the crate and encourage them to enter. Some dogs may need to slowly warm up to the crate. If your dog refuses to go in, place a treat in the back as far as he is willing to go. Once they are comfortable with doing that, feed them their next meal inside the crate with the door open.

Some leashes, which can be found at pet stores or online, even have extra handles for this reason., You won’t be able to safely walk a big dog until the dog is willing to obey your commands.

To help achieve this relationship, practice telling your dog to do basic obedience tasks, such as “sit” and “stay”.Talk to your parents about the way you should reward your dog for obeying you. With family dog’s it’s important that everyone is on the same page about the dog’s discipline and training.
Before you will be able to safely walk your dog on your own, be sure that your dog obeys your commands to “leave it” and “come” as well.

, If there isn’t room in your yard, have someone take you to a safe, fenced-in area where you can practice walking your dog. Hold the leash firmly, with the loop around your thumb or palm. Stand beside the dog and start walking forward. Stop walking and command them to “stop” or “heel,” depending on what they’ve been trained. This will ensure the dog is paying attention to you and that you’re in control.


If the dog attempts to misbehave by pulling or ignoring your commands when you’re the one holding the leash, you need to practice more obedience commands with them.
Ultimately, your dog needs to learn that they need to obey you before you can safely walk them. This is best established through patient and consistent training.

, Big dogs need sturdier collars and leashes, and even adults often need harnesses to help control larger dogs. Specific devices designed to help control a large dog can be especially helpful during leash training, which should be done initially by adults only.


When you do begin walking a large dog after it has been trained, use a body harness to ensure that you're physically able to control them if necessary.
A specific example of collar that an adult can use to help train a larger dog is the Halti, which loops around the dog's muzzle and prevents them from pulling forward."

Make sure the dog is comfortable but safe.,
Avoid giving the dog a large meal prior to travel.,
Give the dog plenty of opportunity for breaks.,
Make your dog as comfortable as possible.,
Take someone else with you until your dog gets used to being in the car.,
Take a bag of supplies with you for your journey.",How to Calm a Nervous Dog in the Car1," Always travel your dog in a crash-test approved safety device, such as a travel pod (small dogs), harness (medium-sized dogs), or crate (large dogs.) This keeps the dog safe and prevents it from distracting the driver by actions such as climbing onto his lap.;
, A good compromise is to feed the dog 3-4 hours prior to travel. You can also wait to feed your dog when you get to your destination, if your trip is short.


Remember that a dog may feel sick even if its stomach is very empty.

, Your dog will need toilet breaks if you are taking it for a long ride. You should also carry water and a bowl so it can have a drink during breaks in the journey.


Get out and take your dog out to stretch its legs. This will go a long way toward soothing its sickness or nervousness.
For long journeys exercising the dog before hand will help to burn off excess energy and help it to settle en route.

, Don't over heat the car or smoke during the journey, as this may induce nausea even in a seasoned traveler.Consider using pheromones in the car, such as an Adaptil collar on the dog. This gives off hormones that reassure the dog and reduce anxiety, and may well help with his distress at being in a vehicle.Take along something the dog finds comforting, such as a blanket that smells of home, or a favorite cuddly toy., Your dog can easily distract you if it is moving around a lot in the back of the car and if it is whining or barking. Obviously any distraction while you are driving can be dangerous.


If the dog is sitting in a rear gate, have someone pat the dog (if able) every so often. Move it if this location causes undue stress.
Talk to your dog to reassure it. Use a calm voice and don't show panic or annoyance if it is doing something you don't want it to do. Just keep calmly talking to the dog and telling it how good it is being.

, It should include treats for rewards, a good strong leash, fresh cool water and a bowl to drink from, a toy or two, and plenty of cleaning up materials, such as cloths, spray cleaner, poop baggies etc. It is likely that your dog might have an accident in your car in the early days just due to plain nervousness. If you have cleaning products at hand, the long term damage to your vehicle will be minimized and you and your dog's comfort can continue for the rest of the journey.

Measure your vehicle's interior.,
Purchase spring-tension rods.,
Choose crossbar material.,
Calculate the total crossbar length.,
Buy less material for certain vehicles.,
Measure the crossbars.,
Cut the crossbars.,
Position the vertical rods.,
Mark off attachment points.,
Assemble the barrier.,
Put the barrier in place.",How to Build a Dog Barrier for Your Vehicle," The size of your dog barrier will depend on the floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall lengths of your vehicle’s trunk area. If your vehicle has collapsible back seats, you have the choice of placing the barrier just behind the front seats. In this case, run a tape measure from the floor just behind the front seats up to the ceiling. Otherwise, just measure the floor-to-ceiling height of the trunk area behind the back seats. Finally, take the longest measurement between the side windows in the trunk area, then write down these lengths.


If you have a sedan or other vehicle without open trunk space behind the back seats, and you don’t mind keeping your dog in the back seat, you can place the barrier just behind the front seats.;
, These are used either to hang draperies in windows, or to support shower curtains. Their spring action allows them to be fitted between two surfaces without screws or adhesives. You’ll need to find rods that can compress to just a little shorter than the floor-to-ceiling length of the trunk that you measured. Bring this measurement to the department or hardware store, and ask an employee to help you find the appropriate size.


For example, if the floor-to-ceiling length is 3 feet, 6 inches (1.067 meters), buy rods that compress to at least 3 feet, 5 1/2 inches (1.054 meters).
You can find these rods at large department stores or hardware stores.
Select rods that have tapered rubber stoppers on their ends. These will help to secure the barrier in place against the floor and ceiling surfaces.

, For the horizontal bars, look for ¾-inch (at least 1.9 centimeters) PVC pipe or wooden rods at the hardware store. Either one will be strong enough to keep the dog from getting through. PVC will be lighter, but also easier for the dog to chew through.

, These will need to be at least as wide as the wall-to-wall measurements of your trunk area. Calculate the total rod length to be purchased according to the size of your dog: If your dog weighs more than 25 pounds (11.3 kilograms), multiply your wall-to-wall length by four for four crossbars. If the dog weighs less than 25 pounds, multiply by five for five bars. Finally, multiply this figure by ⅘, and write down the result.

For example, if your longest wall-to-wall measurement is four feet (1.22 meters), for a 40-pound (18.1-kilogram) dog, multiplying by four gives 16 feet (4.9 meters). Then multiplying this figure by ⅘ gives 12 feet, 7.2 inches (3.92 meters).

, In some minivans and SUVs / SACs without collapsible rear seating, there won’t be a gap to block off between the rearmost seats. Or you might prefer not to collapse the rearmost seats. In these cases, get just enough material to cover the gap between the top of the rearmost seating and the ceiling—three bars should be enough, so multiply the longest wall-to-wall length in the gap above the rearmost seats by 3, then the result by ⅘., Your crossbars will vary in length according to the gap they’ll be covering. If you’re using four bars, the bottom two only need to be long enough to cover the gap between the fronts seats just above the center console. Measure these at 2/5 of your wall-to-wall measurements, or long enough to span this gap. Measure the top two bars at ⅘ of the wall-to-wall length, or long enough to cover the gaps between the front seat headrests and the side windows.


If you’ll use five bars, measure the bottom two at ⅖ the wall-to-wall length, the middle one at ⅗, and the top two at ⅘. Again, make sure these will be long enough to cover the gaps.
If you’re only cutting three bars for a barrier behind the rearmost seating without a gap between the seats, measure the top bar at 7/10 the longest wall-to-wall length, the middle bar at ⅘, and the bottom bar at 9/10. Make sure all gaps will be covered by these lengths.

, Using a table saw or hand saw, cut the four or five crossbars to their various lengths. Use medium-grade sandpaper to sand off the sharp frayed edges of the PVC pipe or wooden rods., Put in place the two spring-tension rods vertically, one just behind each front seat, or behind the rear seats.Their distance from each wall should generally be about ⅕ of the wall-to-wall measurement. Make sure they are perfectly vertical, not leaning to one side or the other., One at a time, position your four or five crossbars horizontally and evenly spaced from one another, beginning with the two shorter bars three inches (7.62 centimeters) higher than the center console. The top bar can rest four inches (10.16 centimeters) below the ceiling. Using a thin felt-tip marker, indicate the attachment points by putting an x-mark on the horizontal PVC or wooden rods where they intersect with the vertical rods. Then, keeping the horizontal rods in place, put horizontal marks on the vertical rods above and below where they intersect with the horizontal bars.

, Using 20-gauge utility wire (0.0319 inches / 0.018 centimeters), bind the crossbars to the vertical bars at their marked intersection points. Run the wire in an x-shaped pattern diagonally around the intersection, changing the orientation of your winding every two passes. Wrap the wire tightly until the two bars are firmly secured. Check that the bars remain perpendicular to each other throughout the winding.

If you’d prefer to hide the wire, cover it over with electrical tape of a color that most closely matches the color of the bars.

, Make sure the bars are all securely attached at the intersection points. Position the barrier directly behind the front or back seats, dividing the rearmost seating area and the trunk. Use the spring-tension feature of the vertical rods, compressing them enough to allow the barrier to be slid into place and secured.

Treat your dog for motion sickness.,
Try a holistic approach.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Prevent Your Dog from Becoming Carsick3," There are times when it is necessary to use medication to help your pet travel. Over-the-counter anti-nausea drugs may help keep your dog’s stomach calm, such as Dramamine, Benadryl, and Acepromazine. Contact your veterinarian for advice before starting any new over-the-counter treatments.Antihistamines can help with motion sickness, while also calming your dog with sedation and reducing drooling., Ginger is a safe way to treat your dog's nausea. You can give it to your dog in the form of ginger snap cookies. You can also give your dog ginger pills 30 minutes before traveling.Apply aromatherapy for dogs topically on the skin. You can also use diffusion or inhalation. Dilute oils before use. The only time oral application of essential oils can be given to dogs is under the supervision of a holistic veterinarian properly trained in aromatherapy.Consider trying other natural remedies for your dog’s nausea. Peppermint, chamomile, and horehound are other safe alternatives to prevent your dog's nausea., Seek their advice before purchasing any over-the-counter treatment. They will advise you on the correct dosage to give. Check with your veterinarian before trying any holistic remedies. They may also have a prescription in mind for your dog's particular reaction.

Accept that you may not be to walk your dog yet.,
Pet your dog every day.,
Positively reinforce friendly behavior.,
Teach the dog to obey your voice with active training.",How to Walk a Big Dog As a Kid2," You may not have the strength or physical presence necessary to control a big dog. While this can be frustrating, it’s important to realize that anyone walking a dog needs to be able to control the animal in the event of an emergency.If, for instance, another dog attacks your dog but is then restrained, you need to be able to restrain your dog as well. If you are not able to do so, you should not be walking a dog on your own.

, The more time you spend with your dog, the better your relationship will be, and the quicker you will learn how to behave around one another safely and lovingly. Petting and brushing your dog are both especially good ways to get to know them., Help train a large dog to be calm and friendly around you by providing treats when the dog is gentle and friendly with you. Talk to whomever trained the dog about whether you can practice talking to the dog, petting them, and offering them treats.Note that this assumes that your dog already knows how to do things like “sit” and “stay,” which are important basics that the dog's adults owners should teach the dog.

, Once you and your dog are comfortable around each other and the dog does not try to take things from you, you can start to train them basic tricks. Shaking hands, for example, is a fun and easy trick that kids can teach a dog once the dog is obedient and well-behaved.Put a treat in your pocket and position yourself in front of your dog and have them sit. Give them the command to “shake” in a clear voice, and hold your hand low enough for them to reach it with their front paw.
When they do, provide them with a treat and verbal praise. If they don’t understand at first, lift their paw gently off the ground with your hand, say “shake”, and pet them. Then try again. As soon as they shake, don’t forget to give them a treat.

Select a big dog from a breed that is usually good around kids.,
Never leave young kids alone with a dog.,
Go on walks as a family first.",How to Walk a Big Dog As a Kid3," Some dog breeds are recommended for homes in which kids live, in part because of a peaceful and otherwise friendly nature. Bringing any dog into a home with children is a serious endeavor, and this is especially true if you’re considering a larger than average dog.Those breeds that do have a favorable reputation regarding interactions with children include Bernese Mountain Dogs, Collies, Mastiffs, German Shepherds, Newfoundlands, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers.

, Note that any dog can become aggressive. For this reason and for the safety of the dog, young children should never be left alone with a dog, especially a large dog. Large dogs may be especially likely to physically exert dominance over a small child, and risk hurting them., Once your kids begin to want to walk the dog, be sure to accompany them until you're sure that they are safely able to do so on their own. If your child is too small physically, allow them to hold the leash with you. Once it seems that a child is ready to walk a large dog on their own, accompany them as they practice walking the dog from start to finish.Your presence as an adult will help make sure that the dog does not try to misbehave, and will increase your child's comfort handling the family dog.
When specific issues come up during shared walks - such as a neighborhood dog that is off leash - talk through the scenario together and take over if need be.

Assess whether your dog has motion sickness.,
Be prepared for the dog to be sick.,
Place your dog in a spot in the car where it can see out.,
Consult with your vet about whether your dog needs medication to prevent nausea.,
Consider alternative treatments.",How to Calm a Nervous Dog in the Car2," Some dogs are nervous about car travel because they feel nauseous and associate journeys with feeling ill and travel sickness. Recognize the signs of motion sickness, the most obvious of which is heavy drooling. Strings of saliva hanging from the dog's lips is a sure sign of motion sickness. In addition, all dogs react differently but some hang their heads and look troubled, others may try to pace, and some will whimper.


Those dogs who suffer from motion sickness will need medication to travel well. You will need to speak to your vet about a safe medication to counteract the nausea. It might be that the dog always needs medication for long journeys, but you may well be able to retrain it to accept short journeys without illness.

, Do not shout or chastise the dog if it vomits. It cannot help being sick and being chastised only adds to its apprehension and increases the trauma of the experience, which will make it even more anxious.


If you know your dog gets travel sick but have to make a journey, such as to the vet to get travel sickness meds, then seat it on a puppy pad so that the mess can be easily cleaned.

, It usually helps a dog if it can see out of a window. If you have a toy or small dog, consider getting a travel pod which raises it up off the seat in a safe way, so it can see out. For medium sized dogs, have a certified crash-tested harness and seat the dog on a back seat so it can see out. For large dogs, consider putting the dog in a crate, so they are safe and can see out.You can also put a blanket underneath where the dog will be sitting. It should be a blanket that the dog uses regularly, so its smells will be familiar to the dog.

, Avoid using human anti-motion sickness medications unless you have checked it out with your vet first. These are not approved for use in dogs, so the side effects have not been fully tested, and the possible reactions with other drugs is unknown. On a practical level, dogs metabolize drugs differently than people, so there is a distinct possibility that those human drugs won't be effective.


The best medication for motion sickness is a prescription drug called Cerenia (maropitant) which is available as an injection (given by the vet) or tablet. Both forms work for 24 hours. This medication is superior to others because it acts on the nausea center in the brain, and switches off all feelings of nausea and sickness., Some owners find giving their dog Bach flower remedies, commonly known as Rescue Remedy, helps, but this is anecdotal. This is a liquid and you place a few drops on the dog's tongue.The Bach flowers are dissolved in alcohol and one possible explanation that some dogs seem to benefit is that they are given the equivalent of a small alcoholic drink.

Figure out if your dog is simply nervous, as opposed to nauseous.,
Avoid long journeys while retraining your dog.,
Begin exposing your dog to positive experiences in the car.,
Transition to pleasurable experiences while the car is on and moving.",How to Calm a Nervous Dog in the Car3," Some dogs dislike car journeys because they feel fearful or anxious because they had a bad experience in a car, such as being involved in a crash. It could even be that a dog is hesitant to get in the car because it got too excited and the driver shouted at it.


It is immensely helpful to retrain the dog so that journeys become associated with a pleasant experience and therefore something to be looked forward to.

, If your dog hates car travel, then try to avoid long journeys while you are retraining it.Your aim is to build new associations with the car so that the dog thinks the car is a great place to be.This is a gradual process that can't be rushed, and will actually be set back if you rush it.

, Start with the car parked and with the engine off. Open a door and put an extra tasty treat inside. Encourage the dog to jump into the stationary car and give it lots of positive attention when it does. Then let the dog come out and do something pleasurable afterwords, like take the pup for a walk.


Then start feeding the dog meals in the stationary car. Protect the upholstery with a towel or puppy pad, place the food bowl on top, and get it used to taking meals in the stationary car.
Consider stuffing a Kong and giving it to the dog in the stationary car. Think of different activities which your dog enjoys and make them happen in the car. It could be it takes weeks or months until the dog is willingly jumping into the vehicle, in anticipation of the ""good thing"", but eventually he will learn.

, Once the dog is comfortable in the stationary car, start taking ultra short trips. Initially, these are as limited as starting the engine, letting it run, then turning it off. Then try backing out of the driveway, and straight back in.


Build up to a short trip round the block. Then a short drive round the neighbourhood.
This is all about gradual adjustments, so don't rush it. Make sure your dog is really comfortable with a phase before moving forward.
If you can have someone go with you to watch the dog for signs of distress or nausea. If this happens, stop the car, take the dog out and let it walk around for a bit to give it relief. Complete the journey and next time don't go so far.
In these early days, try to visit places that are fun, so the journey has a reward at the end of it, such as a park or woods.

Make accommodations if you're flying.,
Consider a pet relocation service.,
Prepare your pet for travel.,
Get your dog a rabies vaccine and certificate.,
Familiarize yourself with exceptions to rabies restrictions.,
Learn about other special circumstances.,
Take a trip to the vet's office.,
Include all necessary information on a pet's crate.,
Prepare for customs.",How to Bring a Dog Into the United States," The majority of people who travel internationally do so via airplane. If you're planning on flying, and want to bring your dog with you, there are a variety of considerations you need to make.


Your dog can travel in the cabin with you or underneath the airplane as cargo. Your pet is considered extra baggage and you will be charged according to the weight, including the pet's crate. On most airlines, your dog can only be taken as a carry on if his crate fits under the seat in front of you.Different airplanes have different rules on shipping dogs. Some airlines might not allow dogs on board at all, regardless of breed and weight, so check with your airline to make sure your dog is allowed on the flight and you follow all protocol correctly. Most airlines do require that pets come with health certificates, no older than 10 days.Some dangerous breeds, such as pitbulls, are restricted from traveling on certain airlines or from being imported into certain states. Check this information with the airline if you think there's a risk that your dog's breed may a be an issue.
Acquire a travel crate. The airline requires the crate to be sufficiently large for the dog to be able to stand up inside and turn around.;
, If taking your dog with you via airplane is too inconvenient, or if your airline will not accommodate your dog, hiring a pet relocation service is another option. This can be quite costly, but might be worth the investment if typical airline shipping is not an option.


Start talking to an agency well before your move. All regulations regarding international transportation must be adhered to by the relocation service and they need adequate time to plan. Two to three months in advance is the best way to assure your pet arrives in the US in time.
Pricing varies, but is dependent on far more than just the weight of the dog. Other factors include the weight of the crate, the distance of the journey, the level of difficulty that comes with following regulations, and any other arrangements necessary to the dog's safe arrival. It might be difficult to get a cost estimate without scheduling several meetings with a representative.

, Travel is extremely stressful for pets, and adding the burden of an international journey can translate to disaster if you're pet is not adequately prepared. In the months leading to your relocation, take steps to prepare your pet for travel.


Crate train your pet before the journey. Dogs need to be familiarized with their crate and learn to associate it with positive feedback. This can start with putting food, water, and toys in a dog's crate and allowing her to come and go from the crate as she wishes. Shutting her in the crate while you are out of the house will teach her to accept being confined to it.After 2 to 3 weeks, your dog should have calmed down about being in the crate at home. If your dog is small enough, it's ideal to be able to carry the crate from place to place with the dog in it. This desensitizes her to movement and minimizes the trauma of an airplane's motions. If you're dog is too big to be carried, consider taking her on brief car trips in her crate.Before you leave, clip your dog's nails. Dogs get nervous and might try to claw their way out of a carrier. They could easily snag or tear a nail, leading to bleeding, crying, and general distress.Do not feed a dog in the 2 hours leading to a flight, and only feed him a light meal.You do not want your dog to urinate or defecate in his crate due to nervousness.Keeping your dog's comfort in mind, aim to fly during a time of year that is not extremely hot or cold. Look for a flight with limited layovers., Rabies is one of the most important issues when it comes to overseas travel. The vast majority of the dogs who travel to the United States must have a current and valid rabies certificate. It should include all of the following:


The name and address of the owner
The breed, sex, age, and color of the dog
The date of the rabies vaccination
Products used for the vaccination
The date the vaccination expires
The name, license number, address, and signature of the veterinarian who performed the vaccination.
The date of the vaccination can impact confinement periods. If the vaccination occurred less than 30 days before arrival, your dog will be confined for 30 days until it can be released to you. You are able to choose the facility where your dog will be confined., While most dogs will need a rabies vaccine to be permitted in the US, there are some exceptions. Know what these exceptions are as you might be able to forego the certificate.


If you have a puppy who is too young to be vaccinated, less than 3 months, you are permitted to take the dog into the country. However, the puppy will be confined until he can receive the vaccination and for an additional 30 days.Some countries, like Australia, are rabies free. Due to the limited access to rabies vaccines in these countries, rules are different. Dogs are permitted to enter the US without the vaccination if the dog has lived there since birth or for at least 6 months. The dog will be required to receive the vaccine upon arrival and will be confined for 30 days.If you're importing a dog for scientific research, and the presence of a rabies vaccine would interfere with that research, you can get the vaccination requirement waived., In addition to rabies concerns, there are other issues surrounding international transportation of dogs. If you're traveling from certain countries, the US has special protocol for allowing your dog to enter.


Screwworm, a parasitic fly known to infect dogs, is only present in certain countries. If your country contains screwworm, your dog will need a certificate from a licensed veterinarian declaring them screwworm free in order to enter the country. Your dog needs to have been inspected for screwworm within 5 days of entering the US.If you're from a country that's experienced Foot and Mouth Disease, you must take special considerations when bringing your dog to the US. Feet, fur, and bedding should be dirt free. Straw and hay should be eliminated from a dog's crate. Your dog should be bathed shortly after arriving in the US and kept separate from livestock for at least 5 days.There are no separate regulations in regards to dogs being brought in the country for breeding or commercial purposes. You must follow all protocol even if the dog is not your pet., Tell your veterinary you're planning on traveling to the United States. Book an appointment promptly, making sure you have enough time to procure test results. The following tests and procedures should be performed:


Blood tests
Vaccinations
Microchips for identification purposes, if your vet can provide them
After the exam, your vet should provide a Certificates of Veterinary Inspection to clear your pet for overseas travel., When traveling with your dog, it's vital to include certain information his crate. This provides security on the off chance the crate is misrouted when changing flights.


Include your pet's name and basic contact information for yourself. It's great to include email as, if you're traveling overseas, your phone might not work in the US.Keep this secure on the crate with duct tape or other sturdy tape. If possible, have a sticker of the information made at a local print shop as this will stick more readily to the crate., When traveling into the United States, you'll have to go through customs to get your pet cleared for entrance into the country. Prepare ahead of time to keep the process smooth and timely.


In addition to having forms from your vet and proof of vaccination, you need to fill out the CPB Form 7501. This asks for basic contact information for you and a variety of questions about your dog. It can be downloaded from the website of your airline. Have a copy handy when approaching customs. If you're having your pet shipped as cargo, fax a copy and the other forms to the shipper.Check the hours of operation at customs at your arrival port. You do not want to end up waiting overnight to get your pet home safe.If you have all the proper paperwork, and your dog does not need to be confined, you should be cleared to enter the country.

Different airlines have different regulations.Some airlines will not fly dogs during very hot months for insurance purposes. If you're flying during the summer or spring, you may have to try several different airlines before you find one that will take your dog.
Make sure you know specific requirements regarding things like crate size and fees.

, You need your dog's vaccination requests, form 7001, and your Home Quarantine Request. Double check that you have all these forms before leaving. Pack them in your carry on in case your luggage gets lost along the way., Your kennel should be big enough that your dog can stand and turn around. If you have a very small dog, see if you can find a kennel that fits under your seat. This way, your dog may be able to travel to Panama with you., If you have a long drive to the airport, make sure your dog is safe and comfortable throughout the trip. Keep your dog in a crate or restrain it with a seatbelt so it will not distract you when you drive.Make sure to make plenty of stops to let your dog out of the car to stretch its legs and use the bathroom.

Try antiemetics to relieve nausea and vomiting.,
Administer a veterinary anti-nausea medication.",How to Deal with Severe Motion Sickness in Dogs1," These medications work by interrupting your dog's stress and pain response between the brain and nervous system. They reduce stress and relax your dog for several hours. These products may even allow your dog to sleep peacefully. Always consult a veterinarian and get a prescription before giving your dog a sedative.Ideally, you should only use these medications in emergency situations rather than sedating your dog every time they travel. With repeated use, your dog will need increased dosages to achieve sedation, and these high levels of medication can be harmful to their health.
Sedatives may be beneficial when traveling for long distances or before transporting your pet via plane, boat, or train.;
, These are the most frequently used type of medication for motion sickness in dogs and people. They are available in a variety of forms both over the counter and by prescription. Please ask your veterinarian before administering any medication to your dog.


Dimenhydrinate should be given orally at a dosage recommended by your vet once every eight hours. This is the most well-known anti-nausea medication, commonly referred to by its brand name Dramamine.
Cyclizine is given at the dosage recommended by your vet every eight hours. It is sold under a number of brand names, including Nausicalm. You can buy cyclizine over the counter in most pharmacies.
Promethazine should be administered orally or intramuscularly at the dosage prescribed by your vet every 24 hours. This product is only available by prescription, and includes brand names like Phenadoz and Promethegan., There are medications specifically formulated for animals that are known to be very effective. Cerenia is the most commonly used veterinary-specific anti-nausea medication. Depending on your dog’s size, Cerenia can be administered in doses between sixteen and sixty milligrams. Your veterinarian will need to prescribe Cerenia.


Dogs should not eat for at least an hour before taking Cerenia.
Give your dog Cerenia at least an hour before travel for best effect."

Secure your dog in the car to provide a sense of calm.,
Maintain a comfortable temperature.,
Distract your dog.,
Wait until after travel to feed your dog.,
Take a break every two hours.",How to Deal with Severe Motion Sickness in Dogs2," Because dog motion sickness is often closely related to nervousness, it can be helpful to ensure your dog feels safe and secure while in your car. Additionally, reducing motion will help dogs who experience sickness due to the movement of the car.


It is often best to keep your dog in a limited area in your back seat.
You can purchase a special canine seat belt for your car, which will face your dog forward during travel and reduce motion sickness., Keeping your car cool with fresh air can be very helpful. A breeze is usually beneficial even if it’s warm outside. Keep the window cracked to improve air flow. If you notice your dog panting or drooling, you may need to further reduce the temperature as these are typically indicators that the dog is too warm., To quell nervousness and anxiety, keep your dog occupied by engaging them in an interesting task. Bring along a favorite treat or toy, or choose one toy that the dog only gets to play with in the car. Bring a chew toy that will take the dog several hours to consume. Ask a friend or family member to help you distract the dog so you can drive safely., Traveling on an empty stomach will reduce nausea. Allow your dog to fast for at least an hour prior to travel. Continue to give your dog access to plenty of water while they’re fasting., This gives your dog a chance to rest, and it is also a great opportunity for your pet to get some outdoor time, exercise, and relieve themselves. These travel breaks allow the dog to recover from nausea, and relax prior to continuing the trip."
"
Feed your dog ginger.,
Try aroma therapy.,
Use pheromones.",How to Deal with Severe Motion Sickness in Dogs3," To prevent motion sickness, you can administer fresh ginger root or a capsule of ginger. If you decide to feed your dog fresh ginger, give them five or six small slices about thirty minutes prior to travel. Ginger capsules should be administered based on recommended dosage for your dog’s weight. Ask your veterinarian about using ginger supplements prior to administering them to your pet., Use an extract mixture of multiple herbs like peppermint (Mentha piperita), chamomile (Anthemis nobile), and horehound (Ballota nigra). These scents can be used to treat motion sickness in dogs. Simply place a few drops of the extract of your choice on a cotton ball, and place it on your dashboard. The scent of these extracts is often effective in relieving or preventing nausea, and they make a great, natural air freshener.


Alternatively, you can massage your dog's belly with the extract.
Make an anti-nausea massage oil by mixing 8 drops chamomile, 4 drops ginger oil, and 1-1.5 ounces of vegetable oil.
Watch for any reaction from your pet to make sure the herbs do not have an adverse effect., Female dogs naturally release calming scents when they deliver a litter of puppies. These pheromones keep puppies calm and relaxed. A synthetic form of this pheromone has been developed to create the same response in anxious pets. You can spray the pheromone in the car or purchase your dog a collar that is saturated with the synthetic pheromone."

Train your dog to stop fearing the car.,
Acclimate your dog to its carrier or restraint.,
Bring along a friend.,
Make car rides a reward.",How to Deal with Severe Motion Sickness in Dogs4," Before you ever take your pet for a ride, let them gradually get used to the vehicle. This can be done a number of ways, but one of the simplest is to discover the point at which your dog gets anxious. This can be inches or feet from the car. Whatever the distance, work with your dog to gradually get closer without showing fear or anxiety, by offering them positive feedback, treats, and affection.


Stop your dog at the point closest to the car where they are still calm. Give them a treat, pet them, and go back inside. Every day, repeat this process slightly closer to the car.
When your dog reaches the car, let them sit inside for a few minutes. Repeat this for a few days in a row.
Try turning the car on. After a few days of letting your dog sit in the car with the engine running, take a short trip around the block. Continue this process and gradually extend the length of the trips., Your pet’s safety during travel is important, and much like always remembering to wear your own seatbelt, your dog should be restrained with a harness, net, or crate during any car ride. However, if your dog isn’t used to the restraint, this can be an added form of stress. Take time, weeks or months, to allow your dog to get used to the restraint before using it in the car.If your dog is used to the restraint, seeing the familiar item in the car may actually relieve stress.
Crates and pet carriers are an especially useful travel tool for anxious dogs. Leave the crate in the house with the door open, and over the course of weeks or months, encourage your dog to treat the crate like home.
If you decide to use a net to keep your dog in one part of the car, set the net up in the home for a few days to allow your dog to get used to it. Netting the dog into or out of a hallway is a simple way to do this.
If you want to use a harness, sometimes called a dog seatbelt, to keep your dog safe in the car, let the dog wear the harness for several days without associating it with the car. Build positive associations with the harness.You can give your dog a treat when they wear it, take your dog for a walk with the harness on, or play while your dog is wearing the harness.

, Once you’ve increased the duration of your trips past a few minutes, you may want to start having someone else in the car. This second person will be there to pet the dog, talk to them, play with them, and otherwise soothe your dog during car rides. This should be someone your dog is used to, or someone your dog is always very excited to see.

, If your dog learns a new trick, say, “Yay. You’re such a good dog. Let’s go for a trip.” Then, take your dog for short ride in the car. If your dog is being extra snuggly and lovey, say, “You’re such a sweet dog. Let’s go for a trip.” You get the idea. The key is to use a happy, positive tone of voice and take the dog somewhere fun like a park.

Play tug and fetch.,
Use food puzzles.,
Create an indoor obstacle course.,
Exercise your dog on a treadmill.,
Teach your dog new tricks.,
Consult your vet.",How to Exercise Your Dog1," A great indoor activity is tug-of-war. Buy a rope toy with knotted ends. Throw the rope and have your dog bring it back. While the rope is in its mouth, tug at the rope until your dog lets go. Then, throw it again. Play this game in a long hallway or in the garage.If you have stairs, throw the rope up the stairs for added intensity.
Rotate toys to keep your dog interested.
Do not play this game with toys that have ribbon, string, or parts that can be chewed off and ingested.;
, Food puzzles, such as Kong-type toys or “busy boxes,” are a great way for your dog to release pent up energy indoors. They provide not only physical exercise, but mental exercise, as well.For example, place peanut butter or dog treats inside the Kong. Give your dog the Kong and let it retrieve the food from the Kong.
Busy boxes are large cubes that have small spaces to hide treats in. Only by moving the box around with its nose, mouth, and paws can your dog get to the treats.

, Indoor obstacle courses are great indoor activities for dogs that require more mental and physical exercise. Create obstacles for your dog to navigate or jump over. Use treats to teach your dog to propel through the obstacle course.For example, use chairs as weave poles for your dog to navigate through. Or, line four chairs up and toss a blanket over the chairs to create a tunnel for your dog to run under. Place the treat at the end of the tunnel for your dog to retrieve.
A broomstick fixed atop two buckets, or a hula hoop, are great for making hurdles for your dog to jump over or through.

, Use a treadmill to exercise your dog indoors when outside weather does not permit exercise. Acclimate your dog to the treadmill by letting it sniff the treadmill. Give your dog a treat for good behavior. Once your dog is comfortable with the treadmill, help your dog get on the treadmill. Start with a very low setting, and work your way up to the desired setting.You can buy treadmills that are specifically made for dogs online or at your local pet store. They also come in different sizes depending on the size of your dog.

, Teaching your dog new tricks is a great way to exercise and promote mental health. Tricks are a great way to improve your dog's focus and mental acuity. Teach your dog to shake hands, roll over, play fetch, play dead, spin, or stand on its hind legs.

, The amount of exercise your dog needs depends on its breed, its size, age, and health. Therefore, consult your vet about your dog’s exercise needs. Your vet will tell you how much exercise your dog needs per day or week based on these factors.For example, German shepherds require daily, rigorous exercise, while sight hounds need short bursts of exercise daily.

Schedule regular exercise.,
Run with your dog.,
Let your dog move around your backyard.,
Bring your dog swimming.,
Visit a dog park.,
Look into lure coursing.",How to Exercise a Rhodesian Ridgeback1," Rhodesian Ridgebacks require frequent movement and exercise to stay happy and healthy, so be sure to schedule regular, rigorous exercise for your pet outside of everyday walks (2-3 times a week for about an hour). Jogging and hiking are activities that are well-suited to the breed’s stamina level and athletic tendencies. Bring your dog along for your outdoor workouts and stay fit and content, together.Wait until your dog is at least 15-18 months old to exercise it vigorously – strenuous exercise can cause problems for developing bones.;
, Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs love to run, but the breed has a natural inquisitiveness that could lead to being easily distracted. The sight of a squirrel or another dog, for example, could lead the dog to run out into traffic and get hurt. Try running with your dog on a leash, an activity that will provide your pet with exercise and stand as a bonding activity between the two of you., Rhodesian Ridgebacks do best with some outside space - ideally a large yard. Due to their adventurous spirit and natural proclivity to dig holes, however, dogs of this breed should be supervised at all times when outdoors. The yard should also have a sturdy, tall fence (i.e. a fence that is at least 6 feet tall); Rhodesian Ridgebacks have been known to clear fences as tall as 5 feet (1.5 m)., Rhodesian Ridgebacks are proficient swimmers and enjoy the activity very much. In terms of exercise, swimming is an ideal option for the level of energy and stamina that the breed possesses. Organize family swimming days (at a lake or dog-friendly beach) to include your pet in, but make sure to always keep a close watch on it both in and out of the water., While Rhodesian Ridgebacks love to run freely, they need a safe, enclosed space to do so. Bringing your pet to the dog park will let them exercise off their leash and socialize with other dogs; it is also a good option for exercising your pet if their energy level starts to exceed your own. Try to visit a dog park at least once a week so that your dog is accustomed to playing with other dogs and comfortable with the experience whenever you go., Lure coursing is a performance circuit developed for sighthound breeds like Rhodesian Ridgebacks to demonstrate their instinctual hunting skills. Within this system of mechanized lures and pulleys (simulating live prey), sighthounds are evaluated based on their agility, speed, and stamina; your dog can participate in either competitive or non-competitive coursing tests.For more information about getting started, find lure coursing or sighthound clubs in your area by visiting the American Kennel Club website at https://www.apps.akc.org/apps/clubs/search/.

Schedule 20 – 40 minutes of exercise a day.,
Go for a brief walk everyday.,
Play fetch.,
Play tug of war.,
Give your dog the opportunity to be social.",How to Exercise an English Bulldog1," Set aside at least 20 but no more than 40 minutes a day for exercising your adult English Bulldog. This may mean letting your dog into the backyard or bringing them to a park to move around — either way, the physical activity should be restricted to a half hour total. For the rest of the day your English Bulldog should be kept indoors and relatively inactive, which tends to be typical of the breed anyway., Despite the limits an English Bulldog owner should be placing on exercise, this breed tends to be prone to behavioural issues if not taken for a walk everyday. Walking meets the dog's primal canine need to migrate and change scenery, however briefly. To limit physical exertion but keep up the daily ritual, take your English Bulldog for a brief trip around the block at least once a day to keep them happy.For a real change of scenery that doesn't exert your pet, try driving your dog to a park or different neighborhood to walk and explore.

, Like other breeds of dog, English Bulldogs enjoy playing fetch — but in shorter intervals and within a smaller space. Once you have your dog's attention, throw a familiar object (i.e. a favorite toy)for them to retrieve. Make sure to toss it only a short distance away so that your dog can retrieve it without strain., While English Bulldogs may have a host of joint problems, they also have very strong jaws, making tug of war an ideal game to play with them. The breed is also laid back enough that there is little threat of the game getting out of hand, or of your dog getting aggressive about it. Make sure to choose a sturdy rope to play with, and be careful that your dog does not overexert themselves.Tug of war can be played indoors or outdoors, making it perfect for any occasion.

, While English Bulldogs may not be a very active breed, they love to socialize and explore. Look for activities that allow your dog can get outside and be around people (or other pets) without exerting too much energy. For instance, bring your dog to a park and spend time sitting with them or walking at a mellow pace, people watching and enjoying nature."

Take your dog to the dog park.,
Play fetch.,
Walk your dog.,
Schedule a play date.,
Sign-up for an agility class.,
Get in some pool time.",How to Exercise Your Dog2," Dog parks with shallow pools for your dog to wade in are extra great. If not, a regular dog park will do. At the dog park, your dog will be able to run around and meet and play with other dogs. You can also take a ball with you to play fetch with your dog.If your dog does not get along with other dogs, then play fetch in the backyard, or simply walk your dog in the neighborhood.

, Use a toy that your dog likes and is willing to put in its mouth. For some dogs it could be plush toy, while for others it could be a ball. Allow your dog to sniff and mouth the toy, and reward it for doing so. Then place the toy on the ground. Encourage your dog to pick up the toy. Place your hand under the toy in your dog's mouth and wait for it to drop the toy in your hand. Reward your dog for the correct behavior.Gradually increase the distance from where you place the toy on the ground and yourself. Make sure to reward your dog each time it displays the correct behavior.

, You should generally walk adult dogs for at least 30 minutes a day. However, the actual amount of time you spend walking your dog can vary, and is dependent on breed, age, and size. When walking your dog, do not let your dog walk in front of you. You need to establish that you are the pack leader by walking in front of your dog.By establishing that you are pack leader, this will allow your dog to relax and enjoy the walk.
Take your dog for a walk around the block, to the dog park, or to a regular park.

, Think about scheduling a play date with your dog’s favorite friends. Plan to meet at the dog park, or have your dog’s friends come over to play in the backyard., If your dog requires more rigorous exercise, then perhaps you should sign it up for an agility class. The high-energy jumping and running that is done in these classes is not only great exercise, but it will also develop your dog’s confidence and skill set.Sign your dog up for an agility class at your local pet store or dog training school.
If your dog has never had any training before, then you will need to place your dog in an obedience class, first, and then work your way up to the agility class.

, Pool exercise is a great way to improve your dog's muscle strength and tone, promote cardiovascular health, and improve your dog's metabolic rate. Swimming is also a low impact exercise that is easy on your dog's joints. Bring your dog to a dog park that contains pools, or a swimming center that caters to dogs.


Throw a ball or toy into the pool for your dog to fetch.You can also walk or trot your dog in a shallow pool, one where the water is at or below knee level. The resistance created by the water will strengthen your dog's muscles.

Play fetch.,
Set up blanket hurdles.,
Play soccer.,
Play a game of tag.",How to Exercise a Rhodesian Ridgeback2," Playing fetch, a classic game loved by most dogs, employs your dog’s natural instinct to chase and retrieve. While keeping your Rhodesian Ridgeback active is important, it is also important to keep it engaged and mentally stimulated; when bored, this breed can get into trouble (e.g. digging up plants or trees in the backyard). Use one of your dog’s favorite toys to play fetch with, like a rubber ball or squeak toy.

, For a fun game that will keep your dog active indoors, try setting up blanket hurdles. Clear as much space as you can in the living room, basement, or other venue and create a small obstacle course with rolled up blankets or other safe objects (e.g. plastic toys, pillows). Walk your dog through the course a few times until it is familiar with it, then have it run through the course from one side of the room to the other.Once your dog gets used to the course, add a few blankets or pillows to increase the challenge.

, While soccer may sound like an odd choice of game to play with your dog, it is an excellent activity to try with your Rhodesian Ridgeback. Use a large sized rubber ball that will be difficult for your dog to pick up with its mouth; avoid any balls that will be easy to puncture or deflate. To play, kick the ball and let your dog chase it; let him play for it for a minute once he catches up to it, then gently take it back and kick it again.To make the ball more desirable, try smearing a dab of peanut butter on it.

, Tag is an excellent game to play with a dog who is comfortable enough with you to engage with you physically. The game is not a very structured one, but instead involves running, chasing, dodging, and being silly. Play tag in a fenced-in yard or park to ensure that your dog does not run off too far or get lost during play."

Prepare your dog for the weather.,
Watch for overheating.,
Look for limping.,
Stop activity at the first signs of exhaustion.,
Keep up regular vet visits.",How to Exercise an English Bulldog2," English Bulldogs thrive in temperate climates and are sensitive to extreme heat or cold. In hot weather, they are likely to have trouble breathing and overheat, while in cold weather they can chill easily. Dress your dog for walks outside in cold temperatures (e.g. purchase a dog coat or sweater at a pet store or online) and make sure to bring water along for walks in the heat.In hot weather, schedule walks for the early evening, when the weather is moderate and cool.

, Overheating is a common problem with English Bulldogs, who should be monitored carefully during exercise. Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy, labored breathing and panting; a swollen airway; a buildup of white foam in the throat (due to heavy breathing); vomiting; and a general look of distress. Heat exhaustion can cause death for this breed, so act fast and do the following:Remove your dog from the heat — bring them to a shady area or preferably inside, and turn on a fan.
Keep your dog calm by reassuring them with a soft, soothing voice.

Cool your dog down however possible — pour cool water on their extremities (head, paws, tail); rub ice around their head or under their tail or armpits; or place them in a cool bath (do not use cold water — you risk hypothermia if your dog gets too cold).

Take your dog's temperature rectally. A dog's normal temperature is about 101.5°F (38.6°). If their temperature is over 105°F (40.6°C), then your dog likely has heat stroke. You want to reduce their temperature to 103°F (39.4°C) but no lower, as this may put the dog at risk for hypothermia. Once you have reduced their temperature, take the dog to the vet.If you can't cool your dog down, bring them to a vet immediately.

, English Bulldogs are more susceptible to weak joints and injuries than other breeds due to their heavy weight and short limbs. They also have a high threshold for pain, which means that they may continue to run and play after suffering an injury, further damaging their joints or muscles. If you see your dog limping or exhibiting any other signs of injury, bring them inside to rest immediately or bring them to a vet if the injury seems severe., If your English Bulldog starts to look distressed or exhausted while exercising, stop immediately and have them rest. The breed is known for having irregular energy levels so sudden fatigue is not uncommon. Be sure to give your dog plenty of water and keep them calm during a bout of tiredness., As a breed, English Bulldogs have a comprised anatomy and are more susceptible to a long list of health ailments (including dermatitis, hip and elbow dysplasia, heart disease, and degenerative spine disease) than other breeds. Schedule regular appointments with your veterinarian and ask for specific advice on diet and exercise to keep your dog at a healthy weight. Your vet can also help you monitor your pet's joint and muscle health, and diagnose conditions like arthritis."

Take your puppy to the dog park.,
Exercise in a fenced-in yard.,
Make a puppy play date.,
Take them swimming.,
Walk, run, and bike with your puppy.",How to Exercise a Border Collie Puppy1," Dog parks are also a great way to socialize your new Border Collie. Take your puppy to your local dog park and let them have the opportunity to interact with other dogs and to run freely. Keep a close eye on your dog while you’re at the park to make sure they are interacting positively with other dogs and are in your sight at all times.Do not take your puppy out in public before they’ve received all of their vaccinations. They should not interact with other dogs before they’re fully vaccinated.;
, Border Collie puppies have a tendency to compulsively stalk and chase anything that moves. That might be a passerby, a squirrel, a kid, or a bird. They can roam free in a fenced-in yard, but should still be under your supervision.Large fenced-in yards are great areas to play games like fetch with your Border Collie puppy. Many Border Collies enjoy fetch or playing with Frisbees, and these are great ways to burn off some of your puppy’s energy.


Make sure your fence is very secure. Border Collie puppies can be escape artists and have been known to dig under fences or virtually pick locks to get out., Set up a puppy play date with a friend or family member that has also has a dog. If the two dogs haven’t met yet, give them some time to become familiar with each other before allowing them to play. You can either let them play outside in a fenced-in area, or inside.Socialization is an important aspect of a young puppy’s development, and playing with other dogs in a safe and controlled environment will encourage positive and healthy behavioral traits.


Like with the dog park, your puppy should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to interact with other dogs., Swimming is a great aerobic exercise for your puppy, and many Border Collies enjoy the water. You can take your puppy to a dog-friendly area, like a beach or pond, and let them swim. Make sure to follow any guidelines and rules that area has and keep a close eye on your puppy. Some dogs are naturally strong swimmers, but you may need to teach them how to swim.


You can bring a buoyant plastic toy, like a retrieval toy designed for use in water or a Frisbee, to toss into the water for your puppy to retrieve.
While most Border Collies are adept swimmers, you can purchase a doggie life vest to help your puppy float while they swim.

, You may have gotten a Border Collie puppy with the intention of having a training and exercise partner. You can start to train your new puppy to exercise with you early on, so they can become lifelong training partners. Whether you walk, run, or bike you can take your puppy along with you.Gradually increase the duration or distance of your exercise routine over time, keeping a close eye out to make sure your puppy isn’t being overexerted.A good rule of thumb is to increase your workout five minutes each month as your puppy ages.You’ll need to leash train your Border Collie puppy before you begin running or biking with them, but they learn quickly.
With their natural energy levels, your Border Collie puppy can challenge and push you to beat your training records! Puppies can become overexerted, so keep a close eye on them and take breaks when they need one.

Purchase a vest or coat.,
Massage petroleum jelly onto its paws.,
Wipe its paws afterwards.,
Up your dog’s caloric intake.,
Monitor your dog.",How to Exercise Your Dog in Cold Weather1," If your dog has a short coat, is a puppy or a small breed, or is older you will need to purchase a vest or coat for your dog. The vest will provide your dog with the additional warmth it needs to exercise and play outside. A vest is necessary especially if you and your dog are going on a long walk or hike.Purchase a waterproof vest from your local pet supply store.
Always make sure the vest is dry before putting it on your dog.;
, Ice, salt, snow, and the cold ground can all crack, sting, and dry out your dog’s paws. This can cause discomfort, pain, and bleeding. In order to prevent this, apply petroleum jelly or another protectorate onto your dog’s paws before going outside.Alternatively, you can purchase dog booties from your local pet supply store. Booties will keep your dog’s paws warm and protected. Before going outside, acclimate your dog to the booties. Place them on your dog’s paws. Praise and reward your dog with treats for good behavior.

, Icy and snowy streets and sidewalks may contain chemical de-icers. De-icers can be harmful to your dog if ingested. Therefore, after a day of exercise and fun in the snow and ice, make sure to clean your dog’s paws and belly. Use a clean towel with warm water to wipe its paws and belly down.Also, use a dry towel to wipe down your dog to ensure that its fur is dry.
Bring a towel with you on your walks so you can wipe away ice and snow as needed.

, Your dog’s body uses more energy to keep itself warm outdoors in the cold. Therefore, you may need to feed your dog extra food so its body can create enough energy to keep it warm.During the winter months, feed your dog 15 percent more for every 20-degree drop in temperature., When outside, make sure to monitor your dog for signs of being too cold. Signs that your dog is too cold are shaking/shivering, whining or barking, hunched posture with a tucked tail, and lifting its paws off the ground. Other signs include changes in behavior (seeming anxious or uncomfortable), a reluctance to keep walking, or wanting to go inside.Take your dog inside if it is displaying these signs.
In general, if the weather is too cold for you, then it is most likely too cold for your dog as well. Avoid going outside on these days.

Identify the right kind of exercise for your arthritic dog.,
Exercise your dog on an underwater treadmill.,
Take your dog swimming.,
Go for a gentle walk.",How to Exercise a Dog with Arthritis1," The least pain-inducing exercises for dogs with arthritis are low impact and high resistance exercises. Low impact exercises lessen the weight that is applied to the joints, making them more comfortable for dogs with joint pain. High resistance exercises, on the other hand, are exercises that provide high resistance to the muscles being exercised, making them more developed and larger without stressing the joints.


Examples of low impact and high resistance exercises include swimming and walking on an underwater treadmill. In an underwater treadmill exercise, the dog is placed on a treadmill that is enclosed in a glass container that can be filled up with water.;
, Underwater treadmills are a great way to exercise dogs with arthritis dogs, but they are often cost prohibitive for most owners.Ask your vet about local facilities or clinics that offer underwater treadmills or hydrotherapy exercises for dogs. Most large animal clinics or hospitals offer this service.Ideally, you can exercise your dog on an underwater treadmill every day.


Start with short walks that last about 10 minutes and gradually increase their duration as your dog gets used to the exercise. As your dog gets stronger, they can walk for longer periods of time.
Underwater treadmills have adjustable speeds and have water temperature controls, because heat increases blood circulation, which reduces joint swelling and pain., Swimming is a great low impact way to exercise your pup.Take your dog to a lake, pond, or dog-friendly pool for a swim. You can let them swim on their own accord or throw a buoyant toy for them to retrieve. If your dog isn’t a strong swimmer, consider purchasing a doggie life vest to help keep them buoyant. You can teach them to swim with or without a doggie life vest.

, Take your pet for a short walk to get them moving. Start off with short walks, and gradually increase their length over time if your dog isn’t in pain. Start off with walks that are 10-15 minutes long once or twice a day. Softer surfaces, like grass or even carpeted floors, are better than rough surfaces like concrete. You also want to walk them on flat areas without any hills.Do not run or jog with your arthritic dog.
Avoid taking them on walks in the early morning or at night since colder temperatures can exacerbate joint pain.

Run with your dog.,
Bike with your dog.,
Explore a hiking trail together.",How to Exercise Your Dog3," Running with your dog is a great way for you and your dog to get your daily exercise. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of the run over a few weeks. And be consistent; this means a daily, and not just a weekly, exercise routine. This will enable your dog (and you) to gradually build up its stamina.Before and after running, always warm up and cool down with a five-minute walk.
Dogs tend to run in bursts, so let your dog sniff around, take a bathroom break, and absorb the scenery while you run together.
Always run with your dog on a leash.

, Biking with your dog is a more serious and rigorous activity than running. Work up to biking by first running with your dog on a leash. Your dog will need to know the come, sit, and stay commands very well in order for you to bike with your dog.If your dog tends to chase squirrels or skateboards, then you may need to buy a special leash that attaches to your bike, like the Springer. If your dog pulls away, these devices absorb most of the force of sudden tugs.

, Exploring a new hiking trail will engage your dog’s body, as well as its mind. The new sights and sounds will provide mental stimulation, while the trail will provide physical stimulation. Choose a hiking trail that is appropriate for your dog’s stamina and skills.For more active breeds, choose a trail that requires climbing, like hills and inclines.
For breeds that are less active, choose a trail that is short (in duration) and flat.

Exercise daily.,
Go to an indoor agility class.,
Take them to an indoor exercise space.",How to Exercise a Border Collie Puppy2," Border Collie puppies are very active and have a lot of energy. As a breed, they were originally bred to be working dogs so they have a strong drive to follow directions and to work. While it is ideal to exercise your puppy outdoors, you may have to exercise them indoors during inclement weather. Regardless, puppies need daily exercise.Border Collie puppies tend to have a lot of energy and can exercise for an hour or more a day. There isn’t a set amount of exercise they need, but a good rule of thumb is that your puppy needs five minutes of exercise per every month of age twice a day. So a 3-month puppy needs 15 minutes of exercise up to twice a day., Border Collies are known for their agility and athleticism. Border Collies are well suited to the agility sport and this is a great way to stimulate your puppy mentally and to provide the exercise that they need and crave. Enrolling your puppy in an indoor agility class, held by a local instructor or training center, will teach your puppy to follow your commands and give them an outlet to expend their energy.Agility can also become a lifelong pursuit for your Border Collie as they grow into adulthood. Many Border Collie owners who enroll their dogs in agility classes end up having their dogs compete in agility tournaments or events.

, Some pet stores, gyms, or training centers allow dogs to play and exercise at their indoor facilities. There are even dog fitness centers where trainers can help your dog learn new games and new commands. Since inclement weather can prevent outdoor activities, having an indoor space as a backup will ensure your puppy gets the activity that they need. You can also exercise your puppy indoors by playing ball games or by making an indoor obstacle course.


You can make an indoor obstacle course by marking small hurdles or obstacles that your puppy will go around. Try putting a blanket over two chairs to make a tunnel for your puppy to go through or use a plastic hula hoop for your puppy to jump through. "

Provide opportunities for mental stimulation.,
Play hide and seek.,
Teach them basic obedience commands.,
Play fetch.,
Play tug of war.",How to Exercise a Border Collie Puppy3," An extremely intelligent breed, Border Collies need opportunities for mental stimulation to keep them occupied, engaged, and alert.Puppies need to be kept engaged with mental and physical exercise, or they can develop destructive behaviors. Border Collie puppies can easily become hyperactive, so finding time to mentally engage with them can curb these behaviors.


Games that use your puppy's senses, like sight and smell, are good ways to mentally stimulate your puppy whether you're indoors or outdoors.
Obedience training is a great way to mentally stimulate your puppy. They learn very quickly, and as working dogs, they are bred to be responsive to commands. Teach them basic obedience commands like sit, stay, and come before moving on to more advanced tricks., Your Border Collie puppy has a keen sense of smell and will enjoy games that involve seeking out food and toys, since this appeals to their instinct to find prey. You can play games indoor, or outdoors, by hiding a treat or piece of dog kibble and letting your puppy find it. This is also a good opportunity to practice commands like stay and come.


You can also play hide and seek by hiding behind a door or piece of furniture and calling out your puppy's name. They'll try to find you and you can reward them with praise or a small treat whenever they successfully find you.

, It is important to start training your new puppy early on. Border Collies are very intelligent and respond well to training, but can be headstrong and overly independent if they are not taught to respect their owners early on. Start using positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviors and to discourage negative behaviors, like nipping or digging. Obedience training is also a great way to mentally stimulate your puppy and to curb destructive habits.While young puppies, those four months old and younger, can learn basic commands like sit and stay, they may not be able to fully grasp more advanced commands, like any tricks to roll over, until they are older., Border Collies love to fetch and can fetch a ball or toy for hours. You can play fetch either indoors or outdoors with your puppy, making it a great game to play no matter what the weather is. Teach your puppy to retrieve a ball or toy by using positive reinforcement, like offering a treat for a successful retrieval.You can enhance the fetch game by tossing the toy up or down stairs, which will give your puppy additional exercise.


Use a white or light colored ball when you’re playing fetch outside, especially if the sun is setting, for visibility.
Softer toys can be used for fetch indoors, since rubber balls could damage items in your home.

, Use a long sturdy rope toy to play tug of war with your puppy. Do not use articles of clothing for tug of war, especially socks or shoes. This can encourage negative behaviors, like chewing on clothing, as your puppy begins to associate chewing with a game. This game can also serve as a compliment to training.Use tug of war to practice the “let go” command, and reward your puppy with a small treat for successfully listening.

Change your routine.,
Choose brightly colored toys.,
Try skijoring.",How to Exercise Your Dog in Cold Weather2," A slight change in routine may just be the motivation your dog needs to go outside on cold days. Walk a different path in your neighborhood, or take your dog to the dog park or another hiking trail instead of the usual one.


New toys or games may also entice your dog to go outside. Purchase a new toy or introduce a new game to your dog.

, Heavy balls and neutral colored toys may get lost in the snow. Instead, choose glow-in-the-dark or brightly colored toys so your dog can find them. Additionally, purchase toys that will not sink in the snow, like Frisbees and balls made of lighter materials., Skijoring is like dog sledding, but instead of pulling you on a sled, your dog pulls you while you are on skis. Your dog must be at least 30 pounds in order to do this activity. You will need to purchase an appropriate sized pulling harness for your dog. Your dog should also know basic commands before engaging in skijoring.You will also need to purchase a 6 to 10 foot gangline and a skijoring belt—a rock climbing harness or a weight lifting belt will work as well.
Attach the gangline to your belt and to your dog’s harness and enjoy skijoring.

Play fetch.,
Make a scavenger hunt.,
Sign your dog up for an exercise class.",How to Exercise Your Dog in Cold Weather3," Play fetch in a long hallway or open space in your house with one of your dog’s favorite toys. To make it more challenging, throw the object up a stairway. Tug-of-war is also a good game to play inside if your house is too small for a game of fetch.Alternatively, walk your dog up and down the stairs while on a leash. Run up and down, take two steps at a time, or climb the stairs sideways for an additional challenge.

, For dinnertime, place your dog’s food in different places throughout your house. Help your dog by making a trail of dog food leading from one spot to the next. This exercise will challenge your dog’s nose and stimulate its mind at the same time.You can also place your dog’s food in a food puzzle, like a Kong, to keep it busy for a couple hours.

, Indoor exercise classes, like indoor swimming or yoga, are a great way to fulfill your dog’s exercise needs when you need a change of scenery. Sign your dog up for a class at your local pet supply store, or search for classes online.Exercise classes also have the added benefit of socializing your dog and increasing its mental agility.

Warm up your arthritic dog by performing range of motion exercises.,
Massage their joints.,
Dry your dog.,
Do cool down exercises with your dog.,
Provide a warm resting environment for your dog.",How to Exercise a Dog with Arthritis2," Range of motion exercises gently move certain joints, like an elbow or hip, through the joint’s entire range. This range runs from flexion (bent) to extension (straightened out). To perform a range of motion exercise, lay down your dog on their side on a mattress or blanket, with the limb you intend to exercise positioned towards you.With one hand, support the limb you intend to exercise below and above the joint at a natural position so that your dog is comfortable and without pain.
Flex the limb as slowly as possible until it reaches a natural flexed position that the dog is comfortable with (stop if the dog feels pain) and hold it in this position for 3 to 5 seconds.
After flexing the limb, slowly or gently return it to its original position and extend it all the way outwards. Repeat the gentle flexion and extension exercise 10 to 15 times., A gentle joint massage for five to ten minutes every day can help to relieve some of their arthritis pain. Massage helps to keep the joints flexible and warm up muscles prior to exercise. Start by petting the areas around their joints to warm up the tissue. Then, place your hand over the area and start making small, circular motions while gently compressing the muscle. Finish by petting the area again to soothe the nerves.Do not massage joints that are currently aggravated. If your dog winces or seems to be in pain, stop massaging that area immediately.
This is also a great way to bond with your dog.

, After exercising your dog on the underwater treadmill or by swimming, thoroughly dry your dog using soft towels so that your dog will not be chilly. Cold temperatures can decrease blood circulation and cause joint pain. If you opted to take them for a walk, be sure to warm them up if you’ve been in damp or cool weather.

, After exercise, your dog's muscles need to be cooled down. Perform the same range of motion exercises by repeating the same procedures that you performed when warming your dog up.


Perform these exercises in a warm area or inside so your dog will be more comfortable.

, Warm temperatures can help to increase blood circulation, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. On the other hand, cold temperatures can exacerbate symptoms of arthritis. After you’ve had an opportunity to exercise your pup, make sure they have a warm and comfortable area to rest in.


Provide your dog with a thick, soft dog bed to sleep on. There are also heated dog beds that you can purchase for your arthritic dog.

Help them maintain a healthy weight.,
Exercise on a soft surface, if possible.,
Give your dog vet-prescribed pain medication.,
Supplement your dog’s diet with vitamin C. Vitamin C has been found to help improve joint mobility in dogs.,
Consider giving your dog additional medications.",How to Exercise a Dog with Arthritis3," Extra weight puts unnecessary stress on your dog’s already damaged joints. By keeping them at a healthy weight, you can help to eliminate this additional source of stress and pain. Because your dog cannot exercise like they would if they didn’t have arthritis, maintaining a healthy diet is your best bet to keep them at a healthy weight.Dogs that are a healthy weight will also have an easier time exercising than will an overweight dog.
A healthy diet should provide a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Avoid feeding your dog table scraps, since human food is often more calorically dense. Limit the number of treats you give your pet.

, While this might not always be possible, try to exercise your dog on soft surfaces whenever possible. Soft surfaces, like grass, put less stress on your dog’s joints than hard surfaces, like asphalt., If your dog is in a lot of pain, talk to your vet about what medications might be right for your dog. Your vet will most likely prescribe an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that will help to combat pain and reduce swelling. Pain management medications can make exercise much more comfortable for your dog.These medications are prescription only; do not self-medicate your dog.

, It can also help prevent further joint damage in some dogs. When dogs are stressed, especially due to physical stress caused by conditions like arthritis, they can be prone to a Vitamin C deficiency.Talk to your vet about Vitamin C supplements to see if they think it would help your dog., Certain medications can help prevent further joint damage by maintaining joint health. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate both help to repair connective tissue and keep already existing cartilage healthy. Arthritis will degrade your dog's joints, but these medicines can help to slow this process.Talk to your vet before you give your dog any additional supplements or medications.
These medicines will not repair any structural damage caused by arthritis, like torn cartilage or advanced scar tissue. These can only be corrected through surgery."

Provide consistent, daily exercise.,
Consider food puzzle toys.,
Talk to your vet.,
Watch for changes.,

Use a jacket or sweater on your dog when it's cold outside.,
Pay attention to the heat.,
Dry your dog off.,
Exercise inside.",How to Exercise an Older Dog," The simplest form of exercise for both you and your dog is to take a walk. Your senior dog may not be able to walk as far as it used to, but it should still be able to exercise in this fashion. Plus, it gets you walking, too., A young dog may be able to go 30 to 40 minutes all at once. However, your older dog may have more trouble exercising that long. Consider breaking up your dog's exercise into smaller chunks, such as two 15- to 20-minute periods of exercise., As your dog gets older, it may have issues such as arthritis or other types of leg or joint pain. Your dog still needs to exercise, but choosing a low-impact exercise will make your dog more comfortable.For instance, swimming is a great low-impact exercise for your dog.

, Don't be a ""weekend warrior"" when it comes to your dog's exercise. If the dog only walks around the block during the week, it won't have the conditioning to handle a hike on Saturday. Try to keep walks and play sessions about the same length each day. This helps the dog build and maintain muscle, without straining the joints too much., Food puzzle toys are made to hide your dog's food. Your dog has to work to get the food out, which motivates it to work at the problem. Food toys can help keep your dog moving around, plus they keep its brain engaged, as well., Just like you should talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program, it's important to talk to your dog's vet before you start it on a new exercise routine. Your vet knows your dog's health, and they can tell you if a new exercise program will be good for your dog or not.Ask your vet if your dog is still up for 30 minutes a day of exercise, the general rule of thumb for exercising most adult dogs., If you're not starting a new exercise program but continuing an old routine, it's important to watch for changes in your dog as it ages. For instance, if you notice your dog getting tired more readily all of a sudden, that could be a sign of an illness rather than just aging. Coughing or trouble breathing could also be a problem., Your dog still wants to play with you, but it will be slower in its movements as it gets older. Make changes for your dog so that your dog still has fun but is not taken beyond its limits. For instance, if you play tug-of-war with your older dog, you may not want to tug and yank as aggressively as you did when your dog was younger. Similarly, when you throw a ball for fetching, you may have to spend a moment longer getting your dog's attention and throwing the ball., If you're walking at full speed, you may notice your dog lagging behind a bit. Your dog wants to keep up with you, but as it gets older, it may have a harder time. In fact, your dog may wear itself out trying to keep up. Pay attention if your dog seems tired. Take a break if you think your dog is getting too tired., Older dogs may have trouble jumping up on things like couches and cars, and they may also have trouble with stairs. However, instead of just accepting that as reality, try adding ramps in those areas. Your dog will still be motivated to move around, but it won't hurt as much., If your dog has severe arthritis or another condition that makes walking painful, ask your vet about hydrotherapy. With its weight supported by a bath of warm water, your dog can get a pain-free workout., Older dogs may have a harder time staying warm than younger dogs. Their coats aren't as thick, meaning they're more susceptible to cold. If you notice your dog shivering outside, you might consider purchasing a sweater or jacket for it., Your dog is also more susceptible to heat as it ages. If you're getting overheated, it's likely your dog is, too. You may notice more panting or your dog being extra tired. Try not to exercise your dog during the hottest part of the day, and if you do go out with your senior dog when it's hot, keep it short., If your dog has been out in the rain, make sure to dry it off thoroughly when it comes inside. As noted, older dogs have a harder time staying warm, and if you leave your dog wet, your dog may find it difficult to warm up, even inside., Another option is to simply have your dog exercise more inside when the weather is bad. You can play a small game of fetch, for instance, or enjoy a game of tug-of-war. You can also just walk around the house, asking your dog to follow you. If your dog can still manage them, stairs are great exercise."

Building a dog park is time-consuming and exhausting, but may have great benefits in the end.,
If you have decided to move forward with your plans, keep in mind that you will need a large, grassy, open space for dogs to run.,
The location that you select should be approved by your city/town and one where the associated noises of dogs barking and cars do not infringe upon abutting property owners' enjoyment of their property.

,
Set up a fence around the perimeter of the area.,
If your dog park will be open to the general public, you may need to plant some trees (if there aren't already some), set up park benches, and possibly purchase concrete sidewalk.

,
You may want to buy some dog agility equipment (available for retail from online suppliers) and possibly some extra dog toys (frisbees, tennis balls, dog rope, rope toys).

,
You may wish to add extras to your park, such as hedges, fountains, or any items of interest.,
Advertise!",How to Build a Dog Park," Consider if this is something you really would like to put your time into.;
, You may need up to a few acres, depending on the area and whether your dog park will be open to the general public. Make sure the grass is thick and healthy before moving on.

,, Make it durable enough for large dogs to jump on. Make sure it's not so low that a dog could leap over the top (but not so high that it looks forbidding), and make sure a dog couldn't slide out through the bottom.

,,, Remember: there will be dogs running around, make sure there is nothing they could get hurt on. You may want to have a specialist check things over.

, Put posters up, ads in the newspaper or in dog-related magazines. Get heard of!

Command your dog to track.,
Challenge your dog with more advanced tracks.",How to Teach a Dog to Track," Training your dog to track can be done indoors or outdoors.Because various weather elements (e.g., wind, temperature) can affect scent molecules,you may want to start his training inside to keep the scent in one place, so to speak.


Whether you train inside or outside, try to eliminate potential distractions, such as other pets, people and loud noises.;
, Although there are many ways to hone your dog’s natural tracking instincts, most dogs will enjoy following the scent of their favorite toy.Choose your dog’s favorite toy, and use it for each training session.

, Playing with your dog before your training session will get him warmed up and excited to train.Fetch is a great game to get your dog warmed up because it is so similar to tracking. Play with your dog for about 10 to 15 minutes before beginning your training session.

, Spend some time teaching your dog these commands if he is not yet familiar with them. Having him stay in one place will teach him patience and will help your track training go more smoothly.


Attach your dog’s leash to his collar when he is situated in one place., Although your dog’s tracking sense is likely very sharp,his training should first involve him retrieving his toy when it is plain sight. While your dog is seated or standing in one place, hold the toy in front of him. Allow your dog to watch you as you place the toy where he can see it., Pick up your dog’s leash and give him a verbal cue to get the toy. Common cues include ‘search,’ ‘seek,’ and ‘find it.’Your dog may follow your command with ease the first time. On the other hand, your dog may not initially understand what you want him to do.If your dog needs extra help, guide him with his leash to the toy. When he has the toy in his mouth, run back to your starting position and encourage him to follow you with the toy still in his mouth.Tell your dog to drop his toy when you and he reach the starting position. You may need to practice hiding the toy and giving your dog the verbal cue several times until he can retrieve the toy without your guidance.Reward your dog immediately with verbal praise and a treat when he retrieves the toy.

, To challenge your dog, hide your dog’s toy so that it is out of his line of sight. This will allow your dog to use his nose, rather than his eyes, to find his toy.Examples of where you can hide his toy include a different room, under furniture, or under a cardboard box.As you did before, command your dog to sit or stay, hide the toy, then command him to find it.
Remember to allow him to sniff the toy before you hide it.
Reward him immediately when he finds the toy and brings it back to you.

, Once your dog has gotten good at using his nose to find his toy, challenge him even more by incorporating wind into your training. After you hide the toy, stand downwind of it with your dog. By facing downwind, the wind will carry the scent of your dog’s toy to his nose, allowing him to find it more easily.Downwind means that the wind will be in your face.If you stand upwind, your dog will actually have to run past the toy until he is downwind of it.He probably won’t mind doing this, but it may increase your training time.

, This is another way to challenge your dog during your track training sessions. As you stand silently with your dog, have someone else hide the toy while your dog is watching him or her. Command your dog to retrieve the toy when the helper comes back to you.Your helper may need to initially hide the toy in an easy place so your dog can adjust to someone else hiding the toy. Your helper can then escalate the difficulty by hiding the toy in a harder place to find and not having the dog follow his or her movements.Make sure not to verbally encourage your dog to follow your helper’s movements. Your dog will probably look at you rather than your helper., A track line is used for more advanced track training. The line serves as a means of communication between you and your dog as he tracks. Track lines are typically made of rope, leather, or webbing and attach to your dog’s collar or track harness.Rope is strong and inexpensive, but can burn your hands if you are not wearing gloves. Leather has a natural feel and is less likely to burn your hands, but can stretch over time.A track line made of webbing is durable and long lasting. The ideal webbing is 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.Track lines vary in length, but 20 feet should be a sufficient length for your training purposes.You can purchase a track line and track harness at your local pet store.

, You will need a large outdoor space to lay the track.You will also need a few items to create the track: several flags, food morsels, and two objects. The first object will be the object your dog needs to find, and the second object will be the one you allow your dog to sniff before he begins tracking.Fabric objects (e.g., socks, gloves) are ideal to use, since they hold a scent fairly well.To prevent scent contamination, place the second object in a plastic bag until you give your dog the command to track.Place one flag at the beginning of the track, and another one at the end (about 10 to 15 feet away). Place several flags in between so your dog knows to walk in a straight line.Spread food morsels along the length of the track. Starting at the beginning of the track, take small steps and place the morsels where you step. The morsels should only be a few inches away from each other.The food morsels should be a tasty treat that you know your dog will want to eat.
Place the first object at end of the track., After you finish laying the track, walk back to your dog without walking back down the track. This will likely confuse the scent along the track, thus confusing your dog. Rather, hop sideways off the track and walk back to your dog.Attach your track line to your dog’s harness when you are at the start of the track.If you have to walk him to track, attach the track line to your dog’s collar first. You want to make sure your dog associates the track line-track harness attachment with only tracking., After you have attached your track line to your dog’s track harness, pull the second object out of the plastic bag and allow your dog to sniff it. Then, give your dog your verbal cue and let him move out in front of you as he begins to track. Use your hands to feed him more track line as he progresses down the track.When he retrieves the second object at the end of the track, walk up to him and reward him immediately with verbal praise and a treat.Shorten the distance of your track line as you walk up to him.
Detach your track line from his track harness and attach it back to his collar as you lead him away from the track., It may not take long for your dog to master a short, straight track. You can challenge his tracking even more by adding distance to the track, or adding twists and turns. You can also increase the distance between the food morsels along the track."

Take her on short walks.,
Keep food and water close.,
Lengthen your walks.,
Encourage her to play with the puppies.,
Give puppy-friendly toys.,
Reintroduce old activities.",How to Exercise a Mother Dog," You should take your dog on daily walks. If you walked your dog regularly before pregnancy, you may continue with this schedule. If not, start taking the dog on fifteen minute walks once or twice a day. After the first month of pregnancy, you may need to shorten the length of these walks to prevent overexerting your dog.If you have other dogs, you should start taking the pregnant dog on separate walks beginning during the last three weeks of pregnancy. This will prevent her from picking up diseases or germs from the other dogs that might put the puppies at risk.;
, You can still play games with your dog, especially during the first thirty days of pregnancy. This allows your dog to maintain muscle tone, which can help make the delivery easier. Catch and fetch are good games to play, as they are not too strenuous, but they still provide exercise. After a month, however, you should stop playing any games that require jumping or running., While your dog can play gentle games in the first month of pregnancy, you should stop any heavier activities as soon as you find out that she is pregnant. This includes any working dog activities (herding, guarding, etc.) or competitive activities like agility course training., Weight loss should not be a goal during pregnancy, as dogs should gain weight in order to provide adequate nutrition to the puppies. That said, pregnant dogs are at higher risk for obesity, and being overweight can cause complications. Weigh your dog once a week to make sure that she is gaining the proper amount of weight. If not, adjust the amount of exercise per day.While the amount of weight a dog may gain varies by breed, in general, your dog will gain about 15-20% of her body weight over the course of the pregnancy.
During the first two-thirds of the pregnancy, your dog will not gain much weight. However, you should still weigh her regularly to make sure that she is not losing weight. If she starts to lose weight, stop exercise and contact a vet.Your dog may rapidly gain weight during the last two or three weeks of pregnancy. This is normal. Carefully monitor her weight to make sure that she does not gain more than 20% of her pre-pregnancy body weight.

, Your dog will need to be isolated from other dogs and animals during the last three weeks of pregnancy.During this time, she may also not be able to exercise as much because of her enlarged abdomen. Take her outside on short walks. If you have a fenced yard, you may also let her outside for a short period to let her relieve herself and walk around. Avoid any activity that might overexcite or exhaust her.

, For the first day after giving birth, your dog will not want to leave the puppies’ side. She may not eat or go outside to eliminate. Do not force her to leave her puppies during this time. Let her stay with the puppies to nurse and bond., Between 24 and 48 hours after birth, you can take the mother dog outside to eliminate. She may be anxious to leave her puppies, but you should still encourage her to out and relieve herself. This will also provide a little exercise. If she does not want to go, put her collar and leash on, and take her out anyways.These walks may only last five to ten minutes as she will not want to leave her puppies for long. Try to avoid interacting with other dogs while out.
This is a good time to check your dog’s nipples for signs of swelling or redness. These are symptoms of mastitis, a problem which may make nursing painful for your dog.
If it is summer time, avoid taking the dam near grass where fertilizer or pesticides have been used. In winter, avoid salty patches. These can irritate her teats., For the first week after giving birth, your dog will not want to stray far from her puppies. Make sure to keep food and water close to the whelping box. She will get up to eat and drink as she wants during this time. If you keep these too far away, she may decide not to leave the whelping box at all.


Do not worry too much about exercising your dog during this period. Since she is protective over her pups, it is important that she can access food and water without going far from the whelping box., After about a week, the mother may be more comfortable leaving her puppies to take walks. You may try taking her on longer walks to make sure that she gets enough exercise. If you have a fenced in yard, you can also let her outside to eliminate and stretch her legs., Around three or four weeks of age, the puppies will be more active. They may start exploring their living area, and you may notice them playing with each other.During this period, you should still continue walking the mother, but you can also encourage her to play with the puppies.


Use baby gates to block off a room, and let the puppies explore with their mother. Typically, the mother dog will start playing games with them to teach bite inhibition and important social behaviors.
You can also take the family outside to run around together. Make sure that you have a fenced-in yard with no holes to escape through. Supervise the family while they are outside.

, A good way to exercise both mother and puppies is to start placing puppy-friendly toys near the whelping box and living area. As the puppies begin to play, they will investigate these objects, and the mother dog can teach them how to play with them.


Thick rope toys can let your mother dog play tug-of-war or other games with her puppies.Playing fetch can help exercise both the puppies and the mother dog. Make sure that the ball or toy that you throw is not small enough to be swallowed by the puppies., Once the mother is no longer nursing and has returned to her normal diet (typically between four and five weeks after birth), you can start up her old activities again. This might include work activities, running, swimming, agility training, or strenuous play. You may want to introduce these slowly as she may be a little out of practice, and she may still be exhausted from caring for the puppies.


The timing for this can vary from dog to dog. Your dog should have returned to their normal diet by eight weeks, and they should be able to return to normal exercise by this point.

Buy a minimum of 2 *dog* discs.,
Get your dog to get excited about the disc by associating it with very positive things.,
Throw ""rollers"".,
Throw the disc in the air and alternate with rollers.,
Encourage your dog's drive to get the disc.,
Prepare to be amazed.

,
Teach grabbing.,
Teach running and grabbing.,
Teach jumping and grabbing.,
Advance to the steps above for older dogs.",How to Teach a Dog How to Catch a Frisbee," Human discs (""frisbees"") can injure your dog. Look for the brands Hyperflite, Hero or Aerobie. These discs are specially designed to reduce risk of injuring your dog. There are discs for destructive dogs (the Hyperflite Jawz) and soft floppy discs as well (the Aerobie Dogobie). The Flippy Flopper is a soft fabric disc available at most pet stores. The Kong Flyer is also a good choice.

, For example:


Use the disc as a feeding dish for a week.
Rub hot dog on the disc and praise your dog for going after it.
Play tug gently with the disc. Always let your dog win. Don't rip the disc out of your dog's mouth.
Reward any behavior that shows ""drive"" to get the disc. This means that even if your dog jumps up and grabs the disc out of your hand without waiting for you to offer it to her, this is positive!
Never tell your dog to 'DROP' the disc. Always use a second disc to entice your dog to drop the one in his mouth, on his own. Remember, always encourage your dog's drive to have and get the disc.

, Instead of throwing the disc in the air, throw it so that the disc rolls on the ground like a wheel. This helps your dog transition from fetching a ball to retrieving a disc. Dogs love to chase discs this way. It helps them learn to ""target"" the disc and pick it up.

, Begin with short, slow throws, and be very careful to avoid hitting your dog with the disc. In the beginning, your dog will likely let the disc hit the ground before retrieving it. It may take 100 or more throws before your dog grabs it out of the air for the first time. Be patient!

, Eventually your dog will get used to the flying disc, learn how to track it in the air, and eventually will want the disc so badly (""DRIVE!"") that she won't want to wait for it to drop to the ground and will instead grab it out of the air. This is the moment you've been waiting for! Congratulations, you now have a Disc Dog!

,, Bend over slightly and hold frisbee in your hand, horizontal to the ground, at the height of the dog's mouth. Then let him grab it with his mouth while you are still holding on to it. Say ""drop it"" then take the frisbee from his mouth immediately. Now praise the dog graciously by saying ""good boy (girl) and repeat the process again a few more times.;
, Now do the exact same exercise, only move your body in a circle away from the dog, keeping it at the height of the dog's mouth. As the puppy grows, you will be able to stand up while doing this exercise.

, Now that you are standing up, hold the frisbee a little higher than the dog's mouth and horizontal to the ground, so he has to jump up to grab it. After a while, release the frisbee right before your dog jumps up to grab it. Try turning in a circle with this exercise as well.

, If you are training a young pup, you may need to repeat all the above many times before it is ready to chase the frisbee.

Train and socialize your dog.,
Bring water.,
Take along some healthy snacks.,
Get a few plastic bags.,
Grab a toy.",How to Be Prepared for Walking Your Dog1," When you take your dog for walks, make sure that your dog is properly socialized. This will prevent it from barking and growling at other people and dogs. You should also train your dog to walk beside you and not tug on the leash or pull you. Properly leash training your dog will help you keep your dog safe and under control during your walk.Walking your dog beside you is also important because it will help you assert that you are the pack leader. This will also keep your dog from getting ahead of you and running into traffic.;
, You and your dog will need to stay hydrated during your walk, especially if it is a long one. Bring a water bottle for you and your dog. You can carry this water in a backpack or have your dog haul it in a carrying vest.


Depending on the weather and intensity of the walk, plan for your dog to drink ½ to 1 ounce (14-28 g) of water per pound (1/2 kg) of its body weight. For example, a 60-pound (30 kg) dog will need 30 to 60 ounces (850 to 1700 g) of water.If your dog does not drink from a water bottle, be sure to bring a bowl.

, If you are going for a longer walk, you may want to pack some snacks for you and your dog. You can bring your dog some of its favorite treats or pack some healthy fruits and vegetables, which both of you can enjoy. Because some fruits and vegetables can be toxic to your dog, be sure to check with your veterinarian before you head out.Dogs enjoy fruits and vegetables like blueberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, bananas, carrots, and green beans.
Skip any fruit or vegetable that has large seeds. These can be a choking hazard.
Avoid poisonous foods like grapes, onions, tomatoes, nuts and mushrooms.

, During your walk, your dog will likely have to go to the bathroom. Be sure to bring a couple of small plastic bags to pick up your dog’s feces. Picking up your dog’s mess is not only courteous, it is the law in many places.


In many locations, failing to pick up your dog’s mess can result in a fine.

, Depending on the length of the walk, you may want to bring along one of your dog’s toys. For example, if you end up in a park or other open area, you can play fetch with a ball or other chew toy. This will help your dog burn off some of its energy and get some extra exercise.

If you haven't already, try gathering information from books, the internet and other agility dog owners about training techniques.,
Enroll in an agility class.,
Socialise.,
Practice often- the preferred way to teach your dog awareness of their back legs is to teach them the 'back it up' command:


Start with your dog standing in front of you, have the treat or toy reward hidden so they don't get distracted (they may not want to move away from you if they can see the reward).",How to Teach a Dog Rear Leg Awareness for Agility," There are many videos on YouTube specific to certain exercises and tricks.;
, Although these can be quite pricey, you can always take the basic beginner lessons to learn and ask any questions you have about the sport. This is fundamental to your own learning as it isn't just your pooch pal who has to try new things. After this you can begin to buy your own equipment and set up your own practice area.

, Going to lessons is a great way to meet both new and experienced competitors. You can also meet like minded people at the competitions, even if you aren't competing on the day. Many areas have local, free dog agility parks where you can train and talk to people who can tell you about their learning experience.

,
Slowly start to walk forward, using a hand gesture specific to this command and clearly stating 'Back it up!' The dog will instinctively walk backwards. Once it does this give it a reward. Try to get it to maintain eye contact so it cannot look where its back legs are going.
Once you have this handled, begin to walk less and do the hand and voice command more, until you no longer have to walk for the dog to back up.
Begin to space out rewards, you don't want to always have to give food, but verbal praise can be used every time as motivation.
Narrow it down to either just a hand gesture or just a vocal command.
Once you and your dog are confident with this, start placing stands behind the dog, so it has to step its back legs up while walking back, vary the height of the stands. This will cause your dog to think about what it is doing with its hind half.

Reduce your dog’s stress level.,
Strengthen the bond between you and your dog.,
Decide if your dog is ready for doga.,
Understand your dog’s limits.",How to Do Yoga with Your Dog2," Dog’s respond to your energy. If you are feeling stress, then your dog feels stress. Since yoga helps relax your mind and body, bringing your dog along with all help relax your dog.Some believe that doing yoga can help calm hyperactive dogs., Because you are sharing this time with your dog, you strengthen the connection you share. Not only are you touching, petting, massaging, and including your dog in yoga, but you are both sharing a calming, relaxing activity. Additionally, you are not distracted during this time like you might be while you walk your dog. Doing yoga with your dog can help the two of your become closer.Because you are touching your dog and spending time with him, doing yoga can help build trust between you and your dog.Some people believe that doing yoga with your dog can help get them used to being touched, which can help with things like nail clipping and other grooming tasks.
Since you are touching your dog’s body during yoga, you can also use the time to do a surface health check up.

, Before you take your dog to a doga class, decide if he is ready for this step. If your dog is social and relatively well-behaved, you can probably take him to doga. You can use treats to help keep him focused during the doga session.If your dog is not well socialized or not as well-behaved, start by doing doga at home. This might be a way for you to help him calm and become better behaved.
When you do doga with your dog, decide if he enjoys it. If he seems restless, resistant, or acts negatively, doga may not be for you and your dog.

, Doing yoga with your dog won’t be the same as doing yoga with your friend. Your dog can’t do complicated poses. While there are many yoga poses you can do with your dog, they are geared specifically for dogs.Don’t make your dog do normal yoga poses. Make sure to only go through yoga poses that are designed for dogs.

Talk to your veterinarian.,
Consider a basic leash and collar.,
Think about a slip collar.,
Purchase a harness.",How to Be Prepared for Walking Your Dog2," Before you get your dog, you should ask them what kind of leash and collar you might need. Depending on the type of dog, its temperament and the intensity of your walks, there is a variety of leashes and collars that you will want to consider. If you have puppy, they will also likely recommend that you leash train it.Your veterinarian may be able to supply you with the appropriate collar and leash. If not, you should be able to find them at your local pet supply store.

, If your dog does not have any obedience issues, this collar is a great option. It allows your dog to walk beside you comfortably and with a limited amount of control. This is the best option for well-trained dogs that have few behavioral issues.Remember to walk beside your dog in order to maintain control.

, If your dog is young or has issues while walking, try a slip collar. This will give you greater control over your dog and help you correct its behavior if it gets distracted. With a quick and firm tug to the side, you can get your dog’s attention and refocus it on the walk.If you are having troubles with a slip collar, consider pairing it with a pack leader collar. This will give you greater control and help you avoid hurting your dog.
Avoid pulling back while using a slip collar. This can hurt your dog’s neck.
If you are unfamiliar with using a slip collar, talk to your veterinarian before you use the tool.

, If you want your dog to pull you, you will need to get a harness. This is a great option if you want to roller blade or ride your bike while walking your dog. The harness distributes the weight of pulling across the dog’s entire body, instead of just around its neck.A harness is also a great option for dogs with slender necks, like Greyhounds, and dogs with breathing problems, like pugs and bulldogs.

Check the forecast.,
Exercise in the early morning or the late evening.,
Bring extra water.,
Use doggie boots.,
Check your dog’s arthritis.,
Buy your dog a jacket.",How to Be Prepared for Walking Your Dog3," Before you consider walking your dog, you should always check the forecast. During hot and cold weather, you will need to plan accordingly so that the walk is a safe one for you and your pet. It is also important to check the weather forecast to avoid being caught in a storm or other inclement weather.


You can check the weather on a television, radio, computer or a weather app on your phone.

, During the summer time, you will want to avoid walking your dog in the middle of the day when temperatures are at their highest. Instead, you should walk your dog during the cooler hours of the early morning or late evening. This will help keep you and your dog from being overheated and dehydrated., If you have to walk your dog during the day, be sure to bring extra water to drink. You will want to bring the maximum amount of water recommended for your dog. For example, if your dog weighs 65 pounds (30 kg), be sure to bring at least 65 ounces (2 kg) of water.


Consider having your dog wear a water carrying vest. This will help keep it cool while it walks.
Pack a spray bottle. Because dogs do not sweat, you may want to bring a spray bottle to mist your dog with water while you walk. This will help dissipate heat from your dog’s body. Be sure to spray the top and bottom of your dog to keep it cool., In many locations, pavement and other surfaces can get extremely hot during the summer months. These hot surfaces can burn your dog’s paws. In order to avoid this, consider training your pet to wear boots that are made just for dogs.Your dog can also wear the boots in the winter when it gets cold.
You should be able to find dog boots at your local pet supply store.

, Many older dogs suffer from arthritis, which is aggravated by exposure to cold. If you know that your dog is arthritic, talk to your veterinarian about ways to manage its pain. They may recommend medications or techniques that will relieve the pain of arthritis.Although you need to walk your dog, think about limiting an arthritic dog’s exposure to extreme cold. An arthritic dog is more likely to slip and fall on ice.

, One way of protecting your dog from the cold is to buy it a jacket. A Jacket will help maintain your dog’s core temperature and prevent it from getting too cold. These are particularly useful on shorthaired dogs that do not have a thick coat of hair to keep them warm. If your dog is arthritic, a jacket may also help with any joint pain.If the jacket gets wet, make sure that you dry it before using it again. A wet jacket will make your dog lose body heat quickly.
You can find dog jackets at most pet supply stores.

Sit behind your dog.,
Slip the harness over the dog's head.,
Slip the first paw through the first leg hole.,
Pull the remaining strap behind the remaining front leg.,
Adjust as needed.,
Clip the leash on.",How to Put on a Dog Harness1," With your dog in a sitting position, move behind it and crouch down so that you can easily maneuver around the dog's back, sides, and front.


The dog can be in a standing position as long as he or she is standing still and calm, but do not try to do this while your dog is in an excited state, since you or the dog could get hurt.
You will not be able to do this with the dog lying down.
You could also put this harness on from the front, but this position could make a dog more excited or anxious, so it is generally recommended that you put the harness on from behind.;
, Both the bottom and top loops of the harness need to be slipped over the dog's head.


The bottom loop is larger than the top, and the two should be parallel to each other.
Make sure that the snap buckle is undone when you slip the harness over your dog's head.
When done, there should be a vertical support strap running down the center of the dog's chest.

, Aside from the two loops you just slipped over the dog's head, there should be one other loop or hole. Lift the dog's corresponding paw and gently push or pull it through that leg hole.


The other leg hole is not yet a full loop, but you should be able to see the opening where the two buckled ends should come together and get an idea of where the next hole forms.

, The loose strap with a buckle on the end needs to go beneath the other front leg and up along the dog's side. Clip this buckled end together with the other buckled end.


Notice that your other leg hole takes shape when you complete this step.
At this, the harness should be completely on your dog.

, Make adjustments as necessary so that the harness fits right. As a general rule, you should be able to slip two fingers in between any portion of the strap and the dog.


Tug on the buckle. It should not snap apart, and if it does, the harness might be too tight.
Try to slip the harness over the head. It should not budge, and if it does, try tightening the harness further.
Check the front. Tug down on it to make sure that it is not too loose and that the dog cannot slip its paws out of the leg holes.
Make sure that the D-ring is positioned in the center back of the dog. The front loop should also be in the center front of the dog's chest.

, Your dog's harness should now be secure. Once you clip the leash to the back D-ring, the two of you are ready for your walk.

Decide whether a dog with a high prey drive is right for you.,
Do some research on high prey drive dogs.,
Spay or neuter your dog.,
Get your dog microchipped.,
Teach your dog to recall reliably.,
Crate train your dog.,
Observe your dog's individual and breed tendencies.",How to Live with a Dog with a High Prey Drive1," Before you bring a dog with a high prey drive into your home, carefully consider whether you will be able to provide an appropriate home environment for the dog, and what impact the dog will have on you and your family. Things to consider include:

Do you have enough space? Dogs with high prey drive do best in areas where they can get plenty of exercise, and are not likely to have run-ins with other neighborhood pets or children. For example, a home with a large, fenced-in yard is a good environment for a high prey drive dog.
Are you able to commit a lot of time to training and exercising your dog?
Do you have small pets or young children who might be at risk from a high prey drive dog? Keep in mind that some aggressive high prey drive dogs are incompatible with smaller animals or very young children, as they may severely injure or kill them.;
, Before you adopt or purchase your dog, learn what types of breeds have high prey drive and what kinds of behaviors you can expect from the type of dog you plan to bring home. While there are many types of dogs with high prey drive (e.g., whippets, terriers, malamutes, and hounds), prey drive can manifest itself in different ways – or cause different potential problems for you and your household – depending on the breed, size, and individual temperament of the dog., While hunting drives are largely based on genetics, spaying or neutering your dog can help deter instinctive hunting behavior. Spayed and neutered dogs are generally calmer, less dominant or aggressive, and less territorial.Be aware that since hunting drives are deeply instinctive, spaying and neutering will not eliminate these behaviors entirely.

, Ask your vet to microchip and register your dog. This will make it easier for you to relocate your dog in the event that the dog runs away or gets lost. Microchipping is a quick and relatively painless process with a low risk of complications. Once you have your dog chipped, make sure to keep the registration information up to date., It’s essential to teach your dog the command word “come.” Reliably recalling your dog, or telling it to come, can prevent unruly or dangerous behavior, especially if you ever let it off its leash outside.Use reward-based training. Start at a modest distance and say, “Come!” Wait for it to come to you or physically show it want you want it to do. Wave a toy if necessary. When it comes to you, make a big deal out of it. Give it praise and a small food treat.
Repeat 20 times per training session to condition the dog to associate reliably recalling with a reward. It could take weeks or even months to ensure the association is solidified, so be patient and persistent.

, If you have a cat, smaller dog, or other pet, crate training can give you peace of mind when you leave the house. Dogs are den animals that find security in enclosed spaces, so the crate can be both calming and great for other pets’ safety.It’s essential not to punish your dog wit the crate. If it misbehaves and you immediately yell and throw it in the crate, it will not associate the crate with security.
Be sure to put toys and familiar scent articles in the crate with the dog to keep it entertained and calm. Consider using puzzle or dispenser toys to keep it busy.

, In order to best manage your dog, you should get to know both its individual personality and the dispositions of its breed or mix of breeds. Find out if its breed was selected for hunting, and if so, whether it was meant for ground game or for birds.Prey drive has to do with genetics and is generally unrelated to a dog’s upbringing, so knowing breed traits is important. For example, dogs bred to flush birds, such as retriever breeds, might chase, but are unlikely to bite or attack.
In addition to knowing breed traits, observing your dog's playtime habits will help you know how much activity you'll need to give it in order to manage its prey drive.

These might be through yoga studios, speciality doga studios, or the Human Society.If you can’t find anywhere to do doga with your dog, then you can do it in your home. Many moves are easy enough for you and your dog to get maximum benefits.
Ask yoga instructors if they would be willing to start a doga class. Or ask if they would let you bring your dog to a traditional yoga class.

, Some yoga studios will offer classes that are for both the human and dog. In these classes, the human holds the dog and help him perform the pose. These classes offer modifications for larger or smaller dogs.Other classes may be a traditional yoga class where dogs just walk around while the humans do yoga.

Learn about the origins of the pack concept.,
Understand the differences between “pack” and “family.” By focusing too much on the idea of a pack, you might risk overlooking important specific factors.,
Remember that your dogs know you’re not a dog.",How to Understand Dog Pack Dynamics1," The pack concept is more than a century old, but most modern behavioral scientists argue that the term simplifies dog social dynamics. In the past, the pack was thought of as a militaristic hierarchy defined by dominance and aggression. Nowadays, professional trainers and behavioral researchers advocate a more complex understanding of how dogs interact with humans and each other.Since dogs and humans have evolved together for many thousands of years, dog social structures are more comparable to those of humans than they are to wolves and other animals.Given these advancements in research, rewards-based training routines based on positive reinforcement are generally preferred over training based on dominance and punishment.;
, Focus on how you, your pets, and other members of your household form a particular family. Where a pack might be based on elements of survival, like hunting, you and your dog’s family involves more complicated inter-species interactions.In terms of training, stressing “pack” over “family” often involves force, intimidation, and similar techniques that have fallen out of favor among professional dog behaviorists.
To understand dog social dynamics and offer your dog the most effective training, it’s important to consider specifics, including your dog’s personality, history, and breed or breed mix. When training or socializing your dog put nuances, such as whether your dog has a history of neglect or anxiety, ahead of trying to be the authoritative alpha., Even if dogs and humans have co-evolved for millennia, they are nonetheless different species. Your dog can understand that you’re not a dog, and that you’re not just animals hunting and living in a pack. Therefore, you should think of your “pack” in more complicated terms, especially when training and socializing your dog.Recent behavioral research has shown that your dog isn’t trying to be a “pack alpha” when it misbehaves. Rather, it’s either responding negatively to situations it associates with stress or acting in ways it thinks will result in rewards, like food or attention."

Sit behind your dog.,
Slip the shoulder strap over the dog's head.,
Snap the belly strap in place.,
Adjust the chest strap.,
Clip on the leash.",How to Put on a Dog Harness2," With your dog in a sitting position, move behind him or her and crouch down so that you can easily maneuver from the dog's back and around to the front.


The dog can be in a standing position as long as he or she is standing still and calm, but do not try to do this while your dog is in an excited state since you or the dog could get hurt. You will not be able to do this with the dog lying down.
You could also put this harness on from the front, but working from this position could make a dog more excited or anxious, so it is generally recommended that you put the harness on from behind or from the side.

, Slide the loop created by the shoulder strap and chest strap over the dog's head. The shoulder strap should rest across the dog's shoulders.


Before slipping on the harness, unsnap the buckle on the belly strap.
The shoulder strap and chest strap are nearly perpendicular to each other when extended out. Of the two straps perpendicular to the single shoulder strap, the chest strap is the longer one.
In many designs, the shoulder strap and chest strap are also the same color while the belly strap may be another color.
After slipping the shoulder strap on, adjust it so that the round connector ring sits above and behind the dog's shoulders, centered in between the two shoulder blades.

, Bring the belly snap underneath the dog's stomach and back up to the buckle snap on the other side.


Adjust both the shoulder and belly straps at this point so that the two are comfortably snug. For small and medium dogs, you should be able to fit one finger beneath both straps. For larger dogs, this should be two fingers.
The overall girth, consisting of both the shoulder and belly straps, should look like an even, vertical line. The belly strap should not slip below the dog's armpit area.

, The chest strap should be horizontal and rest over the dog's breastbone. Tighten or loosen the strap as needed to create this fit.


Gently press your fingers on the lower front of the dog's chest. In doing this, you should be able to find the breastbone.
Adjust both sides of the chest strap evenly so that the D-ring is centered in the front.
The strap should not hang down or ride up.

, Your dog's harness should be secure now. Once you clip the leash to the front leash ring or front D-ring, your dog can safely go on a walk.

",How to Put on a Dog Harness3," With your dog in a sitting position, move behind it and bend over so that you can easily maneuver around the entire dog.


The dog must be in a sitting position at this point. His or her back should be between your knees.
Do not try to do this while your dog is in an excited state since you or the dog could get hurt.
You will not be able to do this with the dog lying down.

, Hold the harness in both hands and open up the padded collar portion. Fold the breastplate portion in half so that the two ends of the thick chest padding meet.


Use your fingers to pull the padded collar and nylon webbing back behind the breastplate portion. You should notice an opening for your dog's head at this point.

, Pull this newly created opening over your dog's head and adjust the fur and skin so that the fit is comfortable yet snug.


If your dog has a medium to thick coat, pull the fur beneath the harness straps through the opening of the harness. If you do not do this, the harness will feel tighter on your dog, and it can also cause tension, pinching, friction, and other sources of discomfort as your dog works.
The harness should sit across the breastbone at this point. It should also be in front of the shoulder blades.
Slip two fingers underneath the neck straps. If you cannot fit this many fingers through, loosen the strap. If you can fit more than that, tighten the strap.

, Gently cup one front paw with your and and lift it so that it bends at the knee. Guide this leg through the opening or loop on the corresponding side of the harness.


Repeat this for the other leg and the other side.
When done correctly, the breastplate of the harness will run vertically and centered in between the dog's front legs. It will rest along the breastbone.
Readjust the fit as you did before, checking for any pinched fur, excess looseness, or uncomfortable tightness.

, The tailpiece of the harness should run down along the spine and to the base of the tail.


With a properly fit harness, the will sit at the very base of the tail.
The webbing must also sit flat on the dog's back. If it gets twisted, untwist it and try again.

, If you are using a weight pull harness, there will also be a spreader bar near the tail end of the harness. This bar should go over the dog's back and be positioned gently beneath the dog's tail.


Note that this is not a feature found on all full-body harnesses, though.

, The dog's harness should now be snug and secure on your dog, so he or she is ready for action.

Go on extended walks.,
Play lots of games.,
Take your dog to obedience classes.,
Find a trainer with an agility course.",How to Live with a Dog with a High Prey Drive2," The easiest way to wear out an active dog is to go on a long walk. Depending on its size, take it out for an hour or more once a day or as often as possible.Be sure to monitor your dog’s endurance level and avoid wearing it out, especially if it’s smaller. Try to identify how long it can go before panting hard and appearing overexerted. Do your best to factor in the walk back home.
Try varying where you walk it so it’s exposed to more sights and smells. This will give it mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise.

, Whether your dog has a high chase drive or prey drive, playing fetch, catch, hide and seek, and other active games will help keep it busy. Games like these will engage its drives, keep it physically active, and give it mental stimulation.Keep in mind that a dog that doesn’t get enough exercise or is bored is more likely to engage in destructive behavior, like chewing your possessions or going after other animals.

, It’s wise to make sure everyone in your household is comfortable handling your dog, especially if you have children. Find a local training class and have everyone attend together to learn how to control your dog when it chases or tries to break away.Call your local breed club or breed rescue group and ask them to recommend a trainer who’s good with your dog’s breed. You can also try asking your dog’s vet for a referral, or check with local kennels, community groups (like 4-H or Scout troops), or major pet stores in your area.

, If it’s affordable and if one is locally available, try enrolling your dog in an agility or sport class. Some trainers that specialize in specific breeds or groups have equipment and obstacle courses specially designed for dogs that chase, stalk, and track. These specialized activities are effective ways of releasing your dog’s pent-up energy and instinctive drives.Again, you can find out information about locally available options from a nearby breed club or by asking your vet.

Avoid leaving your dog alone with other animals.,
Keep your dog leashed and fenced.,
Learn the differences between chase drive and prey drive.",How to Live with a Dog with a High Prey Drive3," If your dog is prone to chasing or biting, never leave it alone with any other animal. If you have a cat or other pet, keep your dog away from it until you’re absolutely sure it won’t attack or play rough.Take precautions when you introduce your dog to other animals. Keep it leashed and try to introduce other animals by scent first if you have the opportunity. Muzzle the dog during the meeting if you are at all concerned about an aggressive response. Reward calm behavior with lots of positive encouragement and small food treats.

, If your dog has a high prey drive, keep it leashed whenever it’s outdoors, especially if other animals or children are around. Unleash it outside only in an enclosed space with a high fence.Avoid shock collars with electronic fences, as these are less likely to prevent a dog with a high prey drive from going after a target. Your dog might run despite the electric charge, or an animal might wander into your yard.

, To understand the threat your dog poses to other animals, you have to understand what your dog was bred to do. Since some breeds were designed to chase or stalk while others were designed to kill, it’s valuable to distinguish between chase and prey drives.Groups like terriers were bred to chase and kill small animals, so they have a high prey and kill drive, even if most breeds are small or medium sized.
Sighthounds like Greyhounds are strong chasers, but don’t typically bite or kill.
Breeds like Labrador Retrievers and Weimaraners were selected for stalking, flushing, and retrieving, so their kill drive is typically low.
Some owners allow their dogs to chase down small animals, for instance in an enclosed space like a large, fenced backyard. They know their dogs will only chase and pin, instead of bite and kill. However, be aware that chase and pin behavior can also lead to the serious injury or death of a cat or other small animal.

Train your dogs using rewards and reinforcement.,
Place consistency over punishment.,
Spay or neuter your dogs.,
Prevent urine marking.,
Deal with aggressive behavior.,
Consider if your dog has been neglected or abused.",How to Understand Dog Pack Dynamics2," Since dog pack dynamics are more complicated than competing to be alpha, a form of training called operant conditioning has become preferred over dominance or punishment-based training. Operant conditioning is when you use rewards, like treats and verbal encouragement, to modify your dog’s behavior.For example, when teaching your dog command words, like sit or come, you should first say the command, then physically guide your dog into the appropriate position, and immediately give it a treat. Repeat the process around twenty times per training session, eventually substituting the treat for exaggerated verbal praise and petting.
The key when giving a treat to your dog is to do so in the exact moment it does something correctly. If it sits and you immediately offer a treat, it will come to associate following the command with a reward.

, Consistency is the most important consideration when setting rules for your “pack.” For example, more trainers and behaviorists now advise that allowing a dog to lay on your bed or sofa is a personal choice that won’t really affect the dog’s general discipline. However, if you do choose not to allow your dogs on furniture, you should stick to the rule and never allow an exception.Likewise, if you don’t want your dog to beg for food, don’t give it any attention whatsoever if it begs while you’re eating. Don’t make any exceptions that might make it expect food off your plate.
While consistency is essential to establishing social dynamics and house rules, punishment is less effective. Humans can associate an action with a punishment regardless of time, but dogs cannot. If your dog has an accident inside or chews something up, punishing it after the behavior will have no effect. It can’t make an association between the bad behavior and you yelling or spanking it, even if just several minutes after the fact.

, One of the most effective and easiest ways to control your dog’s behavior is to spay or neuter it. This will reduce its aggressiveness, territorial instincts, and urge to urine mark. You should consider spaying or neutering especially if you have children or a multi-dog household.While spaying or neutering and other forms of preventive care can be costly, they’re typically more affordable and convenient than dealing with a pregnancy or health condition. If cost is an issue, call your local animal shelter and ask them, “Are there any local financial aid programs that can help me get my dog spayed or neutered?”

, One of the most common nuisances associated with pack or social dynamics is urine marking. Your dog is territorial, and if you have a human or animal visitor in your home, it might respond by urinating indoors. Clean up any marked spots with a pet odor eliminator, and keep items it’s likely to mark, like your guest’s belongings, in a room with a closed door.If you notice your dog lifting its leg or marking, get its attention by shouting or clapping, and tell it, “No! Don’t do that!” It’s important to stop it in the exact moment the marking or accident occurs so the dog understands your intentions. Take it outside if it hasn’t had a walk in a while and needs to relieve itself.
Remember that punishment after the fact won’t have any effect. If you’ve come home and found your dog has gone to the bathroom inside, it won’t understand why you’re rubbing its nose in the spot or yelling at it.
If your dog is potty trained but begins to routinely empty its bladder (as opposed to mark with a little urine) or defecates indoors, there might be a more significant issue. Take to the vet for a checkup, and ask the vet about possible incontinence or anxiety issues.

, Generally, dog trainers and behaviorists suggest that aggressive behavior has less to do with your dog trying to assert itself as an alpha. Instead, your dog is more likely responding to conditions it’s come to associate with danger or stress. Alternatively, it could be acting in a way that has resulted in a reward in the past.Try to pay attention to specific conditions when your dog misbehaves. It might take time and patience, but if you can identify why exactly your dog misbehaves you’re more likely to offer a long-term solution.  
Try to apply the methods of operant conditioning. For example, if you can safely ignore your dog when it’s barking or showing aggression, do so. When it displays calm behavior in response to something new, offer a small food treat or pet it and offer plenty of encouragement. Over time, it will associate barking or jumping with being ignored and calmer behavior with attention., Aggressive or unruly behavior could be due to a history of neglect or abuse. Your dog might have previously had success warding off a threat through aggression.


If this is the case, try to limit exposure to new animals and people. Try to offer it plenty of positive reassurance with a reassuring tone of voice.
Ask its vet if they recommend medication for anxiety, and consider seeking help from a professional trainer if aggressive behavior persists.

Teach your dog to associate new things with positivity.,
Introduce your dogs gradually and on neutral territory.,
Take the time to work on individual training.,
Ask for help handling your dogs if necessary.",How to Understand Dog Pack Dynamics3," Start socialization as early as possible in order to train your dog to be open to additional “pack” members later down the road. When you start getting your dog used to new sights and smells, give it a small food treat when it comes into contact with the new person or animal.Start socializing your puppy as soon as you bring it home, especially if you plan on getting a new dog or cat in the future. Puppies are more receptive to socialization than older dogs, but dogs of any age can be trained through proper conditioning. If a visitor comes to your home, have them offer the dog a treat so it identifies your guests with positivity.

, In addition to preparing your dog for social situations in general, you should take careful steps when introducing it to your new dog. Your “pack’s” dynamics in the long run will depend on a successful introduction.Introduce them gradually, starting with the sense of smell. Offer the dogs scent articles so they can get used to each other’s scents before making visual contact.
When they do make visual contact, do it on neutral ground, like a neighbor’s yard or park. Don’t force them to stand face to face. Allow them to show each other their profiles, walk around each other, and sniff.
Next, separately bring them to your own yard, and allow them to meet for a few minutes on your territory. If all goes well so far, bring them inside separately and keep them out of each other’s sight in closed rooms or crates. Let one out at a time, starting with the new dog. Let it explore the house. Then, put it back in its crate or closed room, and allow the old dog to explore. Finally, let them both out simultaneously inside the house.
Continue to monitor how they interact within the house. Keep them separated during the initial weeks using a sturdy baby gate if necessary. Keep them crated out of sight or in rooms with closed doors while they’re unattended.

, As you add dogs to your household, remember that each is most likely at a different level of training. In order to foster the best social dynamics, you should be patient and work with each dog as an individual. Spend extra time gradually conditioning each dog based on their needs.For example, if one dog is less tolerant of other members of your household, begin by instructing it to sit while another dog or family member stands behind a baby gate. Offer a treat if it remains calm. Next, remove the gate but keep the dog or person at the same distance, and again reward calm behavior. If working with two dogs, keep them leashed just in case. Proceed using the same method at shorter and shorter distances.

, Try not to be discouraged or reluctant about asking for help from a vet or trainer. Understand that some dogs simply don’t respond well to family environments or social situations.Ask a vet about anxiety medications or other recommended solutions. Ask them to recommend a trainer who can help it get along better with your other dogs or family members.
Try to get to know your dog before acquiring another pet. If it has trouble getting along with others despite training from you or a professional, try to accept its personality as it is. Some dogs are simply not social, and you should do your best to love it no matter what instead of creating a potentially unsafe environment.

Understand that adrenaline causes most signs of fear.,
Look for common symptoms of fear.,
Understand that dogs will take on different postures when faced with a fearful situation.,
Look for distancing signals.,
Watch for excessive submissive behavior.,
Understand that a scared dog may go on the defensive.",How to Recognize Fear in Dogs1," Fear is a physiological response designed to make the dog flee from danger and hence keep safe. In a fearful situation the dog's body releases adrenaline, which causes real physiological changes on heart, lungs, and muscles.


Adrenaline stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, and it is no coincidence that this is also known as the ""flight or fight"" system. Adrenaline prepares the body for the sudden explosive muscular activity necessary to run away. Thus the heart rate accelerates, the pupils dilate, the respiratory rate increases, and the dog is highly mentally aroused.;
, You see this as the dog panting and taking rapid, shallow breaths, his heart pounding against his ribs, sweaty paw prints on the ground, and dilated pupils. The dog may also shiver and shake, as his muscles tone up and prepare for flight., The fearful dog would rather the threat went away, than he had to stand up to it and risk fighting. His first line option is to send out ""distancing"" signals, which tell other dogs that he is not happy and would rather submit than fight.

, Distancing signals include avoiding eye contact, or fleeting glances at the object of his fear. The dog may back away, preparing to hide or flee. His tail is lowered, often clamped between his back legs, and his rump is held low to the ground. Some dogs even lift a front paw, in what appears an almost human placatory action.


Most dogs act in the same way, although not every dog will show every sign. Also, dogs with long hair, especially if it covers their eyes or muzzle, can be physically more difficult to ""read"" because their features are obscured.

, In an attempt to prove they are truly no threat to another, some dog's show excessively submissive behavior. This includes rolling over and displaying their belly, urinating, and possibly even an involuntary reflex of emptying their anal glands.

, If these signals are ignored and the threat continues to approach, the dog is forced to go to his second line option: defence. A fearful dog that is pushed and cannot escape, is likely to give out a mix of signals: submission and aggression.


Again, if you see a dog giving off mixed messages (wagging his tail whilst baring his teeth) - respect the worst case signal ie baring his teeth, and assume the dog may attack if pressed.

"
"
Walk up to the dog's owner and ask them if the dog is friendly and get their permission before petting their dog.,
Approach the dog slowly but not as though you are fearful.,
Hold out your hand slowly.,
It is best not to look hard into the dog's eyes or to stare at it as this is a threat to any dog.

,
Ask the dog's name and after it has sniffed your hand and has accepted you, then gently touch the back or chest; but not the top of the head, as most dogs find this intimidating.,
Keep the meeting short.",How to Meet a Dog for the First Time," Some dogs, who tend to be docile animals, aren't docile and can get spooked when approached. If the owner seems as though the dog and the owner are not friendly, then hold back. If the dog seems unfriendly or misbehaved, reverse course and don't go towards it, as the owner then needs to take charge.;
, If the dog thinks you are fearful, it will claim higher authority and possibly get sassy. But the best way is to let the dog approach you first, then you can make friends with it.

, Show it the back of your hand to sniff with your your fingers held together. This stance with your arms is a commonly-inherited trait to most dogs should (or will come to understand). The dog should have some knowledge about not biting you. Come down to this dog's eye level with your hand. Make all of this seem natural, as it will be if you've used it enough over time.

,, The dog could get worried because it does not know you. Make this step done slowly.

, Dogs don't tend to like long meetings with strangers.


If you get caught up in a conversation with the owner, lightly stroke the dog so that they know that you still are giving a little attention; though it's not necessary as just being around a balanced person is nice for a dog.

Try obedience signs first.,
Use American Sign Language (ASL).,
Make your own hand signals.",How to Teach a Dog to Read Sign Language1," Using obedience hand signals first is good because other dog trainers will know these signals, even if they don't rely on them solely.For instance, a common hand sign for ""down"" is to hold your hand up at your shoulder with your elbow bent, then move your hand to the floor.The main drawback to using only obedience signs is they may not cover everything you want to do with your dog.;
, Another option is to use American Sign Language. One plus of ASL is that people who are deaf will be able to communicate with your dog. One drawback is that ASL often takes two hands, which can be a problem if you have your dog on a leash. Nonetheless, some people modify ASL to be used with one hand.You can find basic ASL dictionaries online.

, You can also, of course, make up your own hand signals. The plus side is you'll be able to easily remember them. The downside is the only people who will be able to command your dog are people you teach the signs to. In addition, some people find it hard to just make up signs off the top of their heads."
"
Know that a fearful dog first warns you of he is prepared to attack.,
Look for leakage signals.,
Look at the dog’s posture.",How to Recognize Fear in Dogs2," He does this by baring his teeth and growling, drawing his lips back into a snarl, and wrinkling his nose.


Other signals include staring directly at you with dilated eyes, raised hackles, and his ears drawn back and down. The dog may also take a pace of two towards you, but moves with a hunched, crouched posture, rather than relaxed strides.

, Of course, not all dogs will be extremely afraid, but may be only anxious or a little fearful. In this situation you may get leakage signals (subtle signs that the dog did not deliberately give out) that clue you into how the dog is feeling.These include changes in behavior such as excessive yawning, licking his lips, pacing restlessly, becoming hypervigilant, barking or snapping, or refusing a much-loved treat.

, You can also get clues from the dog's posture as he walks. A fearful dog tends to skulk, with his head and rump down, moving in slow motion with a lowered body, almost as if creeping along.

"
"
Understand why it is important to watch out for signs of fear.,
Consider approaching the dog if the dog is yours.,
Understand that fearful dogs are torn as to how to react in a frightening situation.,
Exercise extreme caution if you do not know the fearful dog.,
Understand how to react if your dog is afraid.,
Train your pet to overcome fearful (but not dangerous) situations.",How to Recognize Fear in Dogs3," It is important to be alert for signs of fear in the dog. Not only is it an unpleasant feeling for the dog, but some dog's defense mechanism when afraid is to become aggressive.


Thus, if you fail to recognize fear signals and continue to approach, there is a greater probability of being attacked.

, If it is your own dog that is fearful, hopefully you have built up a degree of trust between the two of you. Respect any fear signals to go away, but if you are confident that your dog will be reassured rather than threatened by you, then approach slowly.If his signals change and the dog indicates he wants you to stop (growling, snarling, backing away), then respect this and back away.

, They are frightened and wish to escape (run away) but if they are trapped and their distancing signals are ignored (the signals they give out saying they've had enough and want out) then they are likely to attack in order to protect themselves against a perceived threat.


This inner conflict can make their body language appear confused to us: on one hand the dog appears submissive (trying to make danger go away) whilst he shows subtle signs of aggression (curled lips, a low growl). If in doubt, it is better to interpret the ""worst"" end and respect what that behavior is telling you. In practical terms this means giving a fearful dog space so that he doesn't feel pressured into attacking.

, Just as you do not know him, he does not know you and this increases his fear. It is best not to approach the dog. Getting closer to the dog decreases the distance between you, which increases his fear arousal. Most of the cues a frightened dog give off are aimed at increasing the distance between what he fears and himself.


Ignoring this only increases his distress and makes him more likely to attack as a form of defence. Back away, avoid eye contact, and if you feel the need to do something, speak in a quiet, reassuring voice.

, If it is your own pet that is fearful, it is to be hoped he is not fearful of you, but a situation such as a trip to the vet's or fireworks. Your dog looks to you for clues as to how he should react in such a situation, and this means you may have to act against your natural instinct to soothe and reassure him, because this rewards the fearful behavior.


Take the scenario of a dog frightened of fireworks. If you pet and soothe him, you are actually confirming that he is right to be fearful, which only compounds his anxiety. If however, you ignore the fearful behaviour and carry on as normal, he reads into this that you are not worried about the loud bangs, and neither should he. It also helps to decrease the fearful stimulus by closing the curtains to hide the bright flashes, and putting on the radio to disguise the bangs.

, Training a pet not to fear a situation, requires a combination of you appearing confident (ie not distressed) and desensitisation. The latter involves exposing the dog to such a small level of the fearful stimulus that he doesn't recognize it as the thing he is frightened of. By rewarding his calm reaction, he starts to associated the fearful noise with a treat. Slowly, over time you build up the level of exposure such that he has to work harder for the treats.


In practical terms this might mean purchasing a CD of the sounds of fireworks. Initially you play it with the volume right down, and reward the pet for his calm behaviour. You repeat this every day for a couple of weeks, and then turn the volume up one notch. You reward him and repeat this until you are able to play the CD at a normal pitch. This takes tremendous time and patience, but is well-worth doing for the sake of a happy, freak-free pet.

Decide what trick you are going to teach your dog.,
Begin with a voice command.,
Use a treat.,
Say your command.,
Offer praise and the treat.,
Practice without the treat.,
Work on the new sign.,
Try it without the voice command.",How to Teach a Dog to Read Sign Language2," The first step of training is to decide on a trick. For instance, one of the most basic tricks or commands is ""Sit."" ""Sit"" is good because you can use it in many situations, from getting your dog to stop jumping to helping him to calm down and wait for a treat., You can use whatever verbal command you want, as long as you are consistent. For sit, obviously the command ""Sit!"" is the most common., With a treat, you can show your dog what you want him to do. To get him to sit, first show him you have a treat. Then, bring the treat above his head, just out of reach. This action should get him to sit on the floor.If your dog wants to move before you can get him to sit, you probably aren't holding it close enough to him. Bring it directly in front of his nose., As you are using the treat to get him to sit, say your verbal command. So, you would say ""Sit!"" as you bring the treat above his head.Essentially, you want her nose to go up in the air, following the treat. That action will often get him to put him butt on the ground., When the dog sits or does the command, say ""Good dog!"" or ""Yes!"" immediately. Also, give him the treat., Practice for a while using the treat. Once the dog gets the hang of it, try it without the treat. Use the same hand motion and command, but don't have a treat in your hand. When your dog does the trick, praise him for it., Once your dog knows the voice command, work on using the new sign with him. Say the command, and incorporate the new sign. For the first couple of times, it may be best to start with the old hand sign and move into the new one. After a few times, leave off the beginning, but continue with the voice command.In some cases, such as ""down,"" it may be possible to teach him the sign from the beginning. With ""down,"" you generally start in a ""sit"" position and move the dog to the floor by using a treat and bringing it down to the floor in front of him. Then you modify the sign later so you don't have to hit the floor., Once the dog seems to understand the new sign, try it without the voice command. Make sure you have the dog's attention first by calling his name. He has to be looking at you to get the hand sign. If he doesn't seem to understand, work the voice command and hand sign together some more and then try the voice command again by itself."
"
Start with a ""watch me"" sign.,
Pick a hand sign and trick.,
Give the sign.,
Offer him praise and the treat.,
Keep practicing.",How to Teach a Dog to Read Sign Language3," With deaf dogs, you have to make sure they are watching you before giving them a signal. Therefore, the first thing you must teach them is a ""watch me"" sign. Pick a hand signal for it. Make the hand signal for your dog, and then point to your nose. When your dog looks up at you, give a hand flash or a thumbs up (as a replacement for the clicker that some trainers use), and then give him a treat and praise. Practice this signal with him until he understands he needs to look at you with the ""watch me"" sign.This method should also work just fine if you are deaf and are working with a hearing dog.

, Choose what you want your first trick to be. As noted, ""Sit"" is always a good place to begin. Choose your hand sign for ""Sit."", After doing the ""watch me"" sign, give the dog the sign for the command you want to teach. Immediately use a treat to position him for the command.For instance, for ""Sit,"" hold the treat in front of his nose, and then move it above his head so his butt hits the floor., As soon as the dog is in the correct position, give him praise and attention. Offer him the treat as reward., Continue practicing the command. Once the dog seems to understand, remove the treat from the equation. Practice the hand sign without the treat until the dog has it down pat."

Observe your dog’s posture.,
Determine if your dog is being submissive.,
Understand why your dog presents his belly.,
Gain your dog’s trust.,
Observe if your dog rolls over.,
Pet your dog’s chest.,
Rub your dog's tummy.",How to Rub a Dog's Tummy," Before you start rubbing your dog’s belly, look at his posture. If his body looks fluid and loose, then he’s feeling pretty relaxed and happy.If he looks tense, then he may not be very receptive to having his belly rubbed.


If your dog is sleeping, let him sleep rather than waking him up to rub his tummy.;
, Approach your dog. If your dog rolls onto his back as soon as you get closer to him, he is likely demonstrating submissive behavior. This submissive behavior may be accompanied by other submissive actions, such as licking the lips and tucking the tail. To the untrained eye, these actions look like an open invitation by your dog to rub his belly, but this is not necessarily the case.If your dog becomes submissive when you approach him, he may actually be intimidated by you and will not want you to rub his tummy right away.
To make him more feel comfortable with you, get on the ground a small distance away from him. Call out to him and let him come over to you. When you call him, do not reach out to get him to come closer., Your dog may present his belly as a form of submission, but he may also be showing that he trusts you or wants to play.It is not always obvious what type of behavior your dog is showing. If you are unsure if your dog is being submissive versus being trusting or playful, your veterinarian can help you more fully understand the differences.


When a dog lies on his back, he is putting himself in a vulnerable position. Provided that you and your dog have developed a close bond, he will probably be comfortable with allowing you to rub his tummy., If you and your dog have already established a trusting relationship, then you are well on your way to rubbing your dog’s tummy with ease. However, if your dog doesn’t fully trust you yet, there are a few things that you can do to gain his trust.Be calm when you approach him. If your dog hasn’t quite warmed up to you, staying calm as you approach him will help him see that you are not threatening and that he can trust you.
Approach him from the side, rather walking towards him from the front; approaching him from the front could be intimidating for him. When you reach his side, kneel down or sit in the same direction that he is facing. Do not make eye contact, since direct eye contact can be perceived as a threat.When he is more comfortable with you being close to him, you can sit by his side and gently pet him. Talking to him in quiet and soothing tones will reduce anxiety that he may have with you touching him.

, If your dog does not roll over on his own, he probably does not want to have his tummy rubbed. It is very important that you never force your dog to lie on his side; this can make him anxious and upset with you.Be respectful of his wish not to have his tummy rubbed.

, Before rubbing your dog’s his tummy, start by petting his chest. If he growls or snarls when you start petting him, stop petting him right away. He’s giving you a very strong indication that he does not want to be petted.


The growls and snarls can also be signs of aggression. A number of things, such as pain or behavioral disorders, could cause the aggression. Your veterinarian can conduct various medical and behavior tests to determine the cause of the aggression.If your dog is not showing signs of displeasure when you start petting him, continue to pet his chest. You can even weave your fingers through his fur to get him to be more comfortable.

, When your dog has become comfortable with you petting his chest, move your hand down his body to start rubbing his tummy. By now, he should be very relaxed. Use slow and sweeping movements. Talking to him in quiet and soothing tones will help to keep him relaxed.


Your dog may start kicking his back leg when you rub his tummy. Contrary to what many people think, this is not a sign that you hit your dog’s ticklish spot. His leg-kicking is actually an involuntary response called the scratch reflex.The scratch reflex occurs when nerves that are connected to your dog’s spinal cord are activated under the skin. Your dog will kick his leg automatically because his body perceives the nerve activation as an irritant on the skin. If you see your dog’s leg start to kick automatically, stop rubbing him in that area of his tummy and move to another area.If your dog seems to be enjoying the tummy rub, but then gets up and walks away, he is letting you know that he no longer wants his tummy to be rubbed. This is completely normal behavior, so there is no need to be concerned.If you feel his body tensing up when you rub his tummy, but then relaxes after you stop, he is giving you another indication that now is not the right time for a tummy rub."

Do not associate your dog’s eating behavior with dominance.,
Learn about other behaviors not considered dominant.",How to Show Your Dog Where He Is in the Pack," Training your dog is the best way to teach him good manners. When your dog is well trained, he will understand how he should to relate to you and other household members (his ‘pack’). You can train your dog to do many things, such as sit, stay, and come when called.


Other forms of training include leash training and crate training.
Keep in mind that training your dog is not about showing him that you are dominant to him in the pack. In fact, interacting with your dog from a position of dominance could actually weaken your bond with him and increase his stress and anxiety.Obedience classes are a great way to train your dog.
Training your dog will require your time and patience. It may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to train him.;
, In addition to formal training, creating a clear set of rules for your dog will help him understand how he should relate to his pack. The rules you set are up to you and should reflect how you want your dog to behave in your home.For example, you can establish a rule that your dog cannot sit on the furniture.


You can also set rules about where your dog can sleep (on the floor rather than on your bed),and how he should wait to be fed (sitting instead of jumping up and down).
As with formal training, these rules will teach your dog how to be a well-behaved member of the pack.
The better your dog understands the rules of the house, the less anxious he will be, and the less likely he will develop behavior problems., Reinforcing the rules is key to helping your dog understand how he is supposed to behave. Positive reinforcement (e.g., verbal praise, treats, extra playtime) is an effective way to reinforce the rules by rewarding only good behavior. Your dog will recognize that good behavior brings rewards, and will thus perform the behaviors for which he will be rewarded.Positive reinforcement should be immediate when your dog performs the desired behavior (e.g., sitting before he eats). Immediate reinforcement will help your dog establish an association between good behavior and reward.Positive reinforcement should also be consistent. The more consistent the reward, the better your dog will understand how to behave., Rewarding your dog for following the rules is one side of the coin—making the breaking of the rules undesirable is the other side. One way to create an undesirable consequence is to ignore your dog when he misbehaves. Because your dog does not want to be ignored,he will choose to follow the rules and get your attention, rather than break the rules and risk being ignored.


Deterrent devices, such as upside-down mousetraps and motion-activated bottles of compressed air,are available that will discourage the bad behavior without hurting your dog.
A firm ‘No’ is often effective.

Do not reinforce the rules through physical or verbal abuse. This will likely instill fear in your dog, rather than teach him good behavior., Consistency is key to teaching your dog how to behave properly. For example, when training your dog to follow basic commands, reward him each time he responds correctly. Likewise, correct his bad behavior each time he misbehaves.Consistency also involves giving the same cue for a command. For example, if you say 'down' on one occasion when your want dog off the couch, then say 'off' another time, he will be confused about which command to follow.Make sure that you and other household members train and correct your dog in the same way. Each person should say the same commands, and reinforce the rules in the same way.Without consistency, your dog will be confused as to when his behavior is desirable and when it is not.

, Your dog should feel like he is loved and supported by the members of his pack. One way to show him this support is to take him with you when you go places.For example, let him ride in the car with you when you run errands.If practical, let him travel with you when you go on a trip.
Your dog wants to spend time with his pack, so involving him in your life activities will make him feel welcome.

, On any given day, your dog probably has some pent-up energy that he needs to release. Exercising not only lets him release that energy, but it can also be a time for you to bond with him. For example, play fetch with your dog—it's an easy game that can keep him happily entertained with his interaction with you.


Walking or running with your dog is a great way to exercise your dog.
If you have a working dog, like a Husky, foster his love of work (e.g., pulling you in a wheelbarrow).Choosing exercises that allow interaction between you and your dog will make him feel like he's a part of the pack.

, Making your dog feel welcome in the pack should be a family affair. If it helps, create a schedule for each each family member to take care of your dog's needs (e.g. walking, grooming, feeding).When everyone participates in your dog's care, he will feel supported by his pack.


Training should also be a family affair. When everyone knows how your dog is being trained, and is consistent with giving commands and reinforcing the rules, your dog will likely feel comfortable and confident in his pack.

, Showing your dog affection is a good way for him to feel supported by his pack. However, indiscriminate affection will overindulge your dog, and will not help him understand how to be a good member of the pack. Show affection only when your dog is behaving properly (e.g. sitting before eating)., Dominance-based training uses the premise that a dog is trying to assume a leadership position over his owner, thus requiring the owner to show his or her dog who is in charge.However, dogs generally do not try to assert their leadership or take charge.Therefore, trying to show your dog that he is lower than you in the pack is not only ineffective, but could create an adversarial relationship between you and him.Because your dog is not trying to compete with you, the concept of dominance is not considered to be relevant to living and working with dogs., Although leash pulling is undesirable, it is not an assertion of dominance. In fact, how your dog walks on a leash is rarely a reflection of your relationship to him.More than likely, the leash pulling is indicative of him not knowing how to walk properly on a leash.Proper leash training should effectively address this bad behavior.

, Unless you have an unneutered male dog who urinates to mark territory, improper urination is usually a sign of inadequate housetraining or urinary system disease. If you have already housetrained your dog, but he continues to urinate in the house, take him to your veterinarian for a medical examination.If your veterinarian rules out disease as the underlying cause of your dog’s inappropriate urination, you may need to housetrain him again.
You may also need to be more attuned to his cues that he needs to relieve himself. Taking him outside and rewarding him immediately after he relieves himself will reinforce this good behavior., Barking is commonly misinterpreted as your dog trying to assert his dominance. Rather, he may be barking out of boredom, fear, or anxiety.If your dog is barking because he is bored, you can train him to bark only on command.


Fear- or anxiety-based barking may be more challenging to address. Your dog may have developed a genuine fear of someone or a particular situation, and may bark to signal his distress.
Consider seeking the expertise of a veterinary behaviorist if your dog barks out of fear or anxiety., If your dog is trying to eat before you, he is not trying to show that he is in control of your kitchen.Instead, he may just be scavenging—a natural dog behavior.If your dog sees food, regardless of whether it is on your plate or on the countertop, he will probably try to eat it.You can discourage this scavenging behavior by keeping him out of the kitchen while you are preparing food.You could also train him to sit while you eat or prepare food.
Keep in mind that your dog does not see himself as submissive to you if you make him wait to eat until after you finish.In doing this, you are teaching him good eating behavior, not that you are above him in the pack.

, Dog behaviors such as running through a doorway ahead of you, ignoring your command to come when called, and jumping up are sometimes interpreted as assertions of dominance.Although undesirable, these behaviors are not challenges to your leadership. Rather, they can indicate playfulness, natural canine behavior, or a lack of training.


The website https://apdt.com/pet-owners/choosing-a-trainer/dominance/ has a comprehensive list of behaviors that are commonly misinterpreted as dominant. Becoming familiar with this list will help you understand your dog’s behavior, as well as learn how to correct the behavior.

Chat with the owner.,
Ask about the dog.,
Stay calm.",How to Meet Someone's New Dog1," Dogs respond to their owners’ emotional cues, so before approaching the dog, chat with its owner for a few minutes. Keep your conversation upbeat and friendly so that the dog can observe the good rapport between you and its master. Be sure to ignore the dog during this conversation so it has time to get comfortable with your presence., Before approaching someone's new dog, get as much information as they can provide about it; if the owner adopted their new dog from a shelter or former owner, they were probably told about the dog’s history. Ask if the dog is friendly and likes to be pet, keeping in mind that the dog should have the ultimate say on this matter. Knowing more about the dog will allow you to accommodate its needs when you first meet it.For instance, a rescue dog might need extra space and time to warm up to you before being approached physically.

, Keeping a calm demeanor is important when meeting a new dog. Dogs reflect the behavior of humans around them, so your excitement could lead the dog to get overexcited or hyperactive; if an unknown person with very high energy approaches a dog, it could result in a fight-or-flight response that will cause the dog to act out. Stay relatively still and speak calmly to keep things comfortable."
"
Slow down.,
Get closer to a dog of your interest.,
Bend down.,
Slowly bring out your hand toward the dog.,
Pet the dog very gently.,
Look for any bad signs.",How to Look Friendly to Dogs," If you are riding a bike or scooter, slow down because dogs are often scared of wheels. If you are running and talking loudly to your friends, stop running and walk at a slow pace. Stop any talking or shouting around dogs.;
, Not too close but just close enough that he can catch your scent. If the dog is interested, let it come to you. Avoid dogs that don't have people around them. Always ask the owner before petting the dog. Remember to follow everything in the first step. Ask the owner about the dog, like name, age, etc.

, This looks less scary to dogs, mainly smaller dogs. If it is a bigger down, slightly crouch down. If it is a smaller toy dog, bend down to your knees, a few feet away from the dog.

, Let the dog smell your hand before petting it. If you run over and squeal and gush and make a big deal, that isn't very fun to the dog, as much fun as it is to you.

, Don't give it a rowdy push or something mean to the dog. Stroke his/her head gently.

, If the dog is growling and baring his/her teeth, it is a definite sign to back off!. A lot of smaller breeds may growl or hide behind his/her owner.

Sidle up next to the dog.,
Kneel to the dog’s level.,
Wait for the dog to approach you.,
Offer your closed hand.,
Gently pet the dog.",How to Meet Someone's New Dog2," Do not approach the dog from the front, which could be interpreted as a threat. Instead, sidle up to the dog, mimicking animal behavior. Dogs feel more comfortable and understood with this sort of careful approach., To avoid looking confrontational, get down to the dog’s level and face the same direction as them. Be sure to kneel in an upward position as opposed to leaning over the dog, which will be seen as a threatening move on your part. Stay in this position for a few moments and let the dog get comfortable with having you in its space., To allow the dog to feel safe, wait for it to approach you. Stay kneeling and avoid eye contact, which can be seen as a threat by dogs. Allow the dog to sniff you until it feels more comfortable near you., If the dog seems comfortable with you after a few minutes of sniffing you (i.e. if it wags its tail and seems at ease) offer it your closed hand to sniff. While a closed fist might seem aggressive, it is actually less threatening to a dog than your open hand, which is larger and more imposing. Hold your hand near its snout and stay calm and still., Once the dog seems comfortable with you, gently pet its chest. Avoid petting the dog from above its head; this will likely be seen as a threatening gesture and may result in an aggressive reaction. Be soft and gentle while petting, and continue to avoid direct eye contact."
"
If the dog is uninterested, leave it alone.,
Avoid approaching the dog while it eats.,
Ignore the dog if it gets overexcited.",How to Meet Someone's New Dog3," Be sure to read the dog’s body language carefully to gauge whether or not it wants to interact with you. Any signs of fear or unease should be recognized and respected; you can always try approaching the dog on another occasion when it might be more responsive. Some observable signs that you should back off could include:growling
bared teeth
flattened ears
aggressive eye contact
crouching with muscles tensed and tail stiff

, Be sure to avoid approaching the dog if it is eating or chewing on a bone or treat. Your approach might be seen as an attempt to take away its food, which will almost certainly be met with a negative response. Wait until the dog is finished eating, or simply leave the dog alone altogether., If your encounter makes the dog overexcited and it begins biting your hands or jumping on you, withdraw yourself immediately. Turn away from the dog and cross your arms, signalling your withdrawal from the interaction. Ignore the dog until it calms down; if its owner has just adopted it, it will likely still be in a process of behavioral adjustment and need to be prompted to calm down."

Look for the owner of the dog.,
Don't run away from the dog.,
Don't make eye contact with aggressive dogs.,
Don't strike an aggressive dog.,
Don't shrink into a ball.",How to Remain Calm Around Aggressive Dogs," If you're uncomfortable around dogs, you may take their every move for a sign of danger. Learning a bit about the body language of dogs, though, can help you know when to be cautious.



Excited signals: Dogs that are panting with their ears up, standing upright and moving around a lot are probably just excited. While some excited dogs are still nippy, its just happy and wants to play, not to harm you.

Dangerous signals: Stay clear of a dog that moves slowly, with its ears folded back and its tail is low. If the the rear end higher than the front end and the fur is standing up, or the dog bares its teeth, these are generally signs that the animal is aggressive, feeling threatened, and may attack.;
, Just as you can learn a lot from the body language of a dog, the sounds that a dog makes are indications of its mood and its intentions. Dogs make a variety of sounds that you can learn to interpret, and learn when to be cautious.



Excited signals: High-pitched barking, squealing, or whining sounds are usually just signs that a dog is worked up. Short bursts of barking may just indicate that the dog wants to play.

Dangerous signals: When a dog wants to attack, it will be silent. If a dog is feeling threatened, it will growl in as low a pitch as possible, and may bark as well.

, The way a dog moves toward you or away from you can tell you a lot about its intentions. While any time a dog comes bounding toward you can be somewhat frightening, try to remain calm and learn what to look for.



Excited signals: Any time a dog is bouncing or jumping around, it's usually just excited, even if it's nipping at you some. If the tail of the dog is wagging and the dog is moving around as if excited, that's probably the case.

Dangerous signals: Any time a dog gets low and starts slinking, as if trying to hide, that's a sign of danger. Dogs do this when they're trying to attack.

, Dogs that appear to be sick or injured should always be avoided. Even if the dog is friendly, if it's in pain it may be defensive and dangerous. Anytime you see a dog behaving strangely, steer clear. Odd signs to avoid include the following:


Frothing or foaming at the mouth
Excessive drooling
Staggering or walking strangely
Panting more heavily than normal
Any bleeding or other obvious signs of injury

, If you're worried that a dog is more than just excited, the best course of action is always to stay as far away from the animal as possible. While most dogs you'll encounter are likely just over-excited, it's true that some dogs are aggressive in more dangerous ways, and should always be avoided.


If you can't avoid the dog, such as when you're visiting someone's home, talk to the owner about possibly putting the dog into a separate room, or outside, while you're present. Don't make a big deal of it, just say you're not super-comfortable around dogs.

, If a dog wants to play, you'll quickly be able to give it the impression that you're not interested by turning your back and avoided eye contact with the dog. Most excited dogs will get bored quickly and give up.


If the dog seems more dangerous than excited, then don't turn your back, which can be a sign of weakness and an invitation to attack. Stay as calm as possible and stay facing the dog, but start moving away slowly., Take slow and short steps as you move away from the dog, and avoid running in any circumstance. Back away or walk away, looking as if you're not interested or intimidated by the dog. Look like you're doing something else entirely.


Never run away from dogs. Dogs will often take this as a sign of play and want to chase after you and continue nipping.

, Its true that dogs often sense and react to your emotions. If you're angry, concerned, or excited, dogs will be able to tell. If you're feeling scared, dogs will also be able to tell, and might become more anxious in turn, making the situation worse. The best thing you can do is to take deep, slow, even breaths and try to calm down.


Don't make any noise. If you shout, whimper, or make any submissive sound, the dog will pick up on it and might be encouraged to continue acting aggressively.
Try to count, if you're feeling really anxious. Take a slow breath for five beats and hold it for two, then let it out for five beats. Keep counting as you move away slowly.

, Often, dogs will nip at hands, especially if they're feeling excited or aggressive in play. If you stick out your hands to protect yourself, they might be more encouraged to jump up and nip at them.


Pull your fingers into your coat, if you can, or put them into your pockets if necessary.

, Most dogs will quickly lose interest if you demonstrate that you're not into playing. Move into another room, and avoid looking at the dog as much as possible. If it comes close, ignore it.


You want to be calm but be assertive. If you move quickly and act scared, the dog will think you are. If you act angry, the dog may react aggressively in turn. The best way to act as if the dog is beneath you, and as if the dog should be submissive to you. If you act this way, the dog will react this way as well., Most aggressive dogs were abused at one time or another, and are reacting out of fear. If that's the case, you want to let the dog know that you're friendly and you're not going to challenge of abuse the animal. But since you can't talk to the dog, you need to communicate on the dog's terms, and let it smell you.


As the dog approaches, be quiet and be calm, but keep your hands at your sides and control your breathing while it smells. Most dogs should be able to register that you're nice and leave you alone.

, The crouched position helps you seem less threatening to the dog but also shows him that you are not going to just roll-over on your back and expose your stomach to him. Flex your legs, and get into a football or squatting stance.


This stance puts you in a maximum position of power because the largest muscles in your body (thigh muscles) are flexed, and your neck is protected, if escape should become necessary.
Use your other forearm and fist to cover your neck, if necessary. This way, you have offered enough for the dog to acquire your scent, but you have not given up access to any vital areas of your body.

, If a dog is bothering you, its the owner's responsibility to get it under control as quickly as possible. Don't be afraid to tell the owner of any dog that its making you uncomfortable and you would like the dog to be restrained.


If you see a dog on the street without an owner that seems to be aggressive, call animal control immediately and go elsewhere. Write down the street address and take pictures of the animal if possible.
If the dog belongs to someone and is on a leash, stay out of the range of it. If it's not on a leash, ask the owner to place it on one.

, Fast movements encourage the dog to react quickly and run along with you. Dogs behave with a pack mentality. If one starts barking, the other will continue barking. If you run, the dog is going to run as well. Make slow, calm movements, and the dog will also calm down.


Don't make any sorts of fast movements in general, if a dog is being aggressive. No arm swinging, or jumping around. The best way to get it to leave you alone is to ignore it.

, Dogs are all about status. Eye contact communicates that you're challenging an aggressive alpha dog for dominance. Since you probably have no interest in doing that, it's important to avoid making eye contact with the dog, which can provoke it.

, Striking a dog is never recommended in any circumstance, whether its being aggressive or not. Dogs learn by positive treatment, like treats and love, not hitting.

, Some people instinctively want to ball up like a pill-bug if a dog's being nippy or kind of excited and aggressive. This tells the dog that you're submissive, and encourages it to continue dominating you. You don't want to collapse into a tiny ball, you want to make yourself appear as big as possible.


If you're being attacked by a dog, it's important to protect your head and neck as much as possible, and rolling up into a ball may be your safest bet. It's still better to stop moving as much as possible and stay big, however. Read this article for more information about what to do if you're attacked by a dog.

Identify signs of anxiety and stress.,
Consider your dog’s background.,
Have someone photograph you while hugging your dog.",How to Hug a Dog1," While dogs express high levels of anxiety and fear through generally recognized behaviors, such as growling or teeth-baring, they show milder feelings of discomfort in subtler ways. In order to figure out if your dog likes hugs, you should learn to recognize these less overt signals: after all, just because your dog tolerates your hugs, doesn’t mean they enjoy it.For example, check to see if your dog turns its head away from yours, closes its eyes or shows the whites of them, lowers its ears, licks its lips, or closes its mouth. Yawning, soft whining, and paw lifting can also be signs of stress.Additionally, take note of your dog’s behavior after you embrace it. If it shakes its coat as if it’s just had a bath, it’s showing that it didn’t particularly enjoy the hug.;
, Just like humans, dogs receive and respond to bodily contact due largely to their background and experience. If they have abuse in their past, for instance, they’re unlikely to be comfortable with close physical contact. Or, if they’ve been well-treated by previous owners but are older in age and unaccustomed to hugs, they’re probably going to prefer you keep your hugs to fellow humans.Similarly, consider your own personal history and relationship with the dog. If you’ve only recently adopted or purchased the dog, you should wait until the two of you become better acquainted before you try hugging it.

, If you’re still unsure as to whether or not your dog really enjoys your affectionate overtures, ask a friend or family member to take a snapshot while you’re mid-embrace. You’ll be able to assess the expression on your dog’s face in a way that you can’t when you’ve got your arms wrapped around it.Some experts also recommend watching your dog get hugs from another close family member or friend. As they lean into a hug and lean back out again several times, you’ll see if your dog displays any anxious behaviors in consistent and explicit connection with hugs.

Socialize your dog.,
Acclimate your dog to encountering children outdoors.,
Tell children how to act around your dog.,
Show children how to safely give your dog treats.",How to Help a Dog Overcome Its Fear of Children1," Introduce your dog to some quiet, calm children. Only let your dog interact with one child at a time at first. Ask each child to sit quietly so your dog can approach them. Praise your dog when it approaches the child and reward it for any positive interactions.Don’t push your dog to interact with children at any stage during these introductions.
This is especially effective when dogs are young, so they get used to children.;
, Take walks near parks or schools where children are playing. Stay a safe distance away from areas with children at first. Gradually move closer to the areas with kids. If your dog doesn’t exhibit any signs of fear, try sitting on a bench or the ground near playgrounds and letting your dog absorb the sounds of children playing and smell them.Reward your dog when it is calm and relaxed in an area near children at play.

, If children will be around your dog, ask them not to pay attention to your dog. Also tell them to act quietly and calmly. Strongly discourage any screaming, yelling, running, or other loud noises., Encourage children who are helping socialize your dog to give it treats. Demonstrate giving treats with your hand down, palm up, fingers together. Tell children not to force any treats on the dog."

When you first come home, ignore your dog.,
Be patient as it may take your dog(s) some time to settle down.

,
Once your dog has calmed down, call him to you and finally greet him in a relaxed manner and with a relaxed tone of voice.,
If your dog starts to jump or get overly excited, stop petting him.,
If you have multiple dogs, it's a good idea to greet them each individually.

,
Practice this every time you come home so that you can start to eliminate or avoid any bad habits over time.",How to Greet Your Dogs when Coming Home Properly," That's right. At first, ignore your dog. This may seem strange but it's the right thing to do. You want to wait until he's calmed down before saying hello and giving him affection.;
,, Make sure all 4 paws are on the ground when greeting him.

, Like I always say, ""we get what we pet"". If he is acting in a way that in unfavorable, like nipping with excitement, we must stop the greeting and petting or we are encouraging the unwanted behavior. Simply give him more time to relax and then try the greeting again.

,, It will also help to reestablish you as the leader.

Familiarize your dog with half-hugs and general closeness.,
Use treats to link hugs with positive associations.,
Evaluate the appropriateness of the situation.,
Never hug a strange dog.,
Discourage children from hugging your dog.",How to Hug a Dog2," Many experts recommend foregoing canine hugs entirely, but if you just must embrace your pup, you should work up to it slowly. When your dog is sitting still and relaxing, sit next to it with your shoulders touching. Slowly rest your hand and then arm on top of its back, give it a treat, and start encircling your arm more and more around your dog’s shoulders and neck., Once you've worked up to a hug with gradual closeness and intermediary levels of contact, you can begin hugging your dog. Just be sure to do so with positive reinforcement: give your dog a brief hug, then reward it with a treat. Repeat often over time and make the hugs longer the more tolerant your dog becomes.Many widely available dog treats are the equivalent of human junk food, so look for small, organic varieties, or use individual kernels of you dog’s high-quality, everyday kibble.

, Even if you’re pretty sure your dog loves hugs, remember that some moments are more opportune than others when it comes to cuddles. For example, never go in for a snuggle when your dog is eating or playing vigorously with another dog.For the best reception, embrace your dog when you’re both at home alone together and the dog feels relaxed, secure, and happy.

, No matter how adorable that dog at the park is or how jubilantly they might have approached you, you should never assume that a strange dog will be amenable to your hug. After all, even the friendliest dogs don’t greet other dogs with hugs; they show their interest in one another through tail wagging, sniffing, and licking.In the same way, you should refuse when others ask to hug your dog. Even if your dog has never bitten or growled at anyone, you never know how they’ll react to a new person’s smell and movements.

, Children are not good at discerning distress in dogs, even explicit threat signals such as snarling and bristling. Gently and firmly discourage children from giving your dog hugs.If your child persists in wanting to hug your dog, try educating them on other ways they can show their love. Teach them to tickle the dog’s tummy, rub its ears, and stroke its back.

Create a safe space for your dog in your home.,
Train your dog to go to its safe space.,
Keep children away from the safe space.",How to Help a Dog Overcome Its Fear of Children2," Set up a safe space behind a safety gate, under a table, or in a bedroom. Or leave your dog’s crate open so it can use the crate as a safe space. Make sure your dog can get to the space easily and quickly by removing any furniture or other barriers to its movement.Consider putting your dog in the space before children visit your home.

, Stand near your dog’s safe space and give it a verbal cue to move into the space, like “go to your spot.” Next, show your dog a treat and throw it into the space. Praise your dog when it moves into the space to eat the treat. Practice this sequence again a few times. Gradually train your dog to move into the space without the treat. Reward your dog with praise and occasionally give it treats to reinforce this behavior., Tell children who visit your home to ignore your dog. Your dog will feel more secure without any pressure to interact or react to children. Don’t allow children near this safe space. Be sure to supervise children in your home and keep them away from your dog’s safe zone.Don’t let children crowd your dog anywhere in your home.

Teach your dog to hand target.,
Steer your dog away from children.,
Train your dog to move away.,
Stop children who rapidly approach your dog.",How to Help a Dog Overcome Its Fear of Children3," Use this technique if your dog seems nervous around a child. It will help keep your dog’s attention focused on you instead of on the child. Keep your palm flat and fingers together, then present your hand to your dog. Reward it by saying “good!” when it moves towards your palm. Give it a treat with your other hand when it touches your palm with its nose. Practice this a few times until your dog masters the action.

, Don’t reassure your dog if it demonstrates fear of a child -- this teaches it that it’s fear is legitimate. Instead, move your dog away from a child that scares it. Walk with it into another room and interact positively so its focus shifts to you., This teaches your dog it has the option of walking away from a child. Start by tossing a treat a few feet away from you, pointing to the treat, and telling your dog: “go away.” Repeat this sequence many times. Next, point and tell your dog to go away without tossing the treat. When your dog starts moving away, praise it by saying “yes!” or “good dog!” and tossing the treat.

Never let a child follow your dog when it moves away to get distance from the child., Get out of their way if you can. You might even hold up a hand and say “stop!” to protect your dog from children it doesn’t want to meet.

Don’t punish your dog for being afraid of the children. It might start associating its punishment with the children it fears."

Turn your back.,
Cross your arms.,
Stand still.,
Turn around again.,
Do not block the dog with your knee.",How to Discourage Your Host's Obnoxious Dog1," Many dogs like to jump on their owners and their owners’ guests when they enter the front door. When you see your host’s dog making its way toward you, immediately give the dog your back. By giving the dog your back, you are signaling that you do not tolerate this type of behavior., When your back is turned, cross your arms, as well. This prevents the dog from making any contact with you. If not, the dog will try to lick or mouth at your hands to get attention.Remember that any kind of contact can be perceived as attention.

, While your back is turned and your arms are crossed, stand still like a statue. This way, you can avoid sending signals through your body language that encourages the dog to interact with you.Try to avoid pushing the dog off of you. Instead, stand still until the dog leaves you alone.

, If you are standing with your back turned and your arms crossed, but the dog comes around to see you, simply turn around again. Make sure you are facing away from the dog when you turn, and do not make any eye contact. Keep turning until the dog becomes disinterested and leaves you alone.Do not be tempted to look at the dog and tell it “No.”

, When the dog is walking or running toward you, do not put your knee up to prevent it from jumping on you. You might inadvertently harm the dog if you use the knee-to-the-chest method, especially if the dog is running toward you.Plus, this method is not very effective because the dog will either try even harder to appease you, or become fearful or aggressive, if hurt.

Understand what hugging behavior means for dogs.,
Know that your dog’s distaste for hugs doesn’t indicate a lack of love.,
Give your dog easily understood gestures, such as belly-rubs or ear scratches.",How to Hug a Dog3," In order to understand why hugging is probably not the best way to exhibit love to your dog, think about what hugs mean in the dog world. When dogs greet, play, or cuddle with one another, they do all sorts of things, but they almost certainly don’t hug in the way that humans do. On the contrary, the closest move in the canine world to a hug—what’s called ‘standing behavior,’ or placing a leg over the shoulders of another dog—signifies a bullying or dominating behavior.Even if your dog doesn’t perceive your hugs in the way that it would from another dog, they could be uncomfortable with it for other reasons. Some experts point out that dogs rely on speed and flight as their escape from danger, so a hug—which naturally arrests or immobilizes them—can seem like a threat or at least a source of anxiety., You might object to the idea that your dog doesn’t actually like hugs because you think it means they don’t love you. Remember, though, that hugs simply don’t mean the same thing to dogs that they do to humans, so their distaste for hugs has nothing to do with their feelings for you as a companion, friend, and family member., As you probably already know, dogs are very affectionate animals. They love to receive and give love through physical contact, just not necessarily in the same way that humans do. Instead of hugging, give your dog a belly rub, scratch their ears, or massage their shoulders and back.If you let your dog sleep on the bed, let them snuggle up at bedtime! Many dogs will be comfortable with close, sustained contact during sleep that they wouldn’t tolerate in other situations.

Weigh your dog.,
Measure your dog’s chest and neck sizes.,
Measure your dog’s length.",How to Choose the Right Life Jacket for Your Dog1," All life jackets are designed for specific weight ranges and will only be effective for dogs who fall within those ranges. Be sure you have an accurate weight for your dog before purchasing a jacket.If you have a dog that you can pick up, you can do this using your home scale. Step on the scale to find your weight, and then step on it holding your dog. Subtract your individual weight from the total of yours and your dog’s to find your dog’s weight.If your dog is too big to pick up, weigh them using a scale designed for dogs at your vet’s office or local pet store.;
, To fit their jacket properly, you need to know your pet’s girths around their rib cage and neck.Circle a string or ribbon from the widest part of their ribs around their back. Mark where the end of the string meets up with the rest; then, measure its length in centimeters and/or inches using a ruler or tape measure.
Use the same process to measure the girth of the base of your dog’s neck, so you can tell how large an opening their life vest will need.

, You need to know the distance between the base of your pet’s neck and the base of their tail to ensure that your canine life jacket provides adequate coverage. Use a tape measure to take this measurement in centimeters and/or inches."

Find a large, open space that has a lot of room for you and your dog to run the course.

,
Stay patient throughout the training.,
Make sure your dog has enough water to drink after it has completed the obstacles.,
Create some obstacles.,
Make weaves (a type of obstacle dogs weave through).,
Build a jump.,
Use broomsticks or long sticks.,
Make a flower pot and PVC pipe jump.,
Make a tire jump.,
Repurpose a play tunnel.,
Make your own tunnel.",How to Build a Dog Agility Course,", It takes time to teach a dog how to use an obstacle course, so this is about your own training in patience too.

, A few treats as rewards are vital too.

, These are important for increasing your dog's agility and running skills.;
, You can make those from PVC pipes as well but they are more time consuming.


The best way to do this is to buy very large, tall orange cones, line them up in a line and have your dog weave through. Plus, since they are so much thicker than normal weave poles, your dog will find that the real weaves are a breeze to do. Cones can be purchased at any hardware or home depot type place.
Strong and sturdy sticks or bamboo poles can also be pounded into the ground in a pattern that requires your dog to weave in and out. Bamboo poles can be purchased from a garden center or hardware store.

, There are various ways that you can build your own dog jump, some suggestions are provided next.

,


Use two flowerpots and balance a broomstick or a long stick on top of them.
If you want a higher jump, use two identical height chairs. Line the chairs back to back, separated by about three feet/90 centimeter (35.4 in). Balance a broom or a stick on top of the chairs or through the top rungs.

,


Take two flowerpots and place them upside down on the ground.
Put a PVC pipe in the hole in each flowerpot.
Attach another PVC pipe to each pole. Use such items as heavy-duty rope to duct tape to affix the pipe.

, Tie a tire (or a hula hoop/bendable pipe) sideways between two chairs or posts. Instant jump-through hoop!


Tie tightly so that the tire or hoop doesn't fall onto your dog as it jumps.

, If you go to any large children's shop they will usually have play tunnels for children. These are an inexpensive alternative to buying the special agility tunnels. True, it won't last as long as the specially made ones, but it will definitely work.


Box stores like IKEA also carry children's tent tunnels. You could also look at online auction sites or Freecycle for unwanted/used ones.

, Use a row of low tables––children's tables are a good height. Cover with blankets to create ""tunnel"" sides.

Do not make eye contact.,
Try not to pet the dog.,
Stay silent.",How to Discourage Your Host's Obnoxious Dog2," If you want your host’s dog to stop bothering you, then you will need to ignore the dog. An effective way to ignore a dog is to refrain from making eye contact. Do not look at the dog at all. It might be tempting to look at the dog, especially if it is in your face, but be vigilant.Look above the dog, or turn your head to the side.

, When the dog comes near you, refrain from petting the dog, as well. Cross your arms so the dog cannot lick, sniff, or mouth your hands. If you are sitting down, use your legs to create distance between you and the dog.For example, close your knees so the dog cannot get too close to you.

, Try to remember that any kind of contact, including talking to the dog, can be regarded as attention by the dog. Even if you are telling the dog “No” or “Stop”, the dog can still interpret this as attention. If you give the dog attention, it will be more likely to come back for more.If the dog jumps up on the couch while you are sitting down, immediately get up and move to another area to sit.

Ask your host to crate the dog.,
Be polite.,
Explain yourself.",How to Discourage Your Host's Obnoxious Dog3," If you tried all these methods, and your host’s dog still will not leave you alone, it is ok to ask them to put the dog up. Your host should understand. Especially if you have allergies, are fearful of dogs, or just don’t care for dogs, your host should be willing to accommodate you.


You can say, for example, “Thank you for inviting me into your home. This isn’t a huge issue, but your dog keeps following me around. I have tried to ignore it, but I am slightly allergic to dogs. Do you mind putting it up or outside?”

, When asking your host to put their dog away, remember to be polite. Using ""could"" instead of ""can"" will make a request sound more polite. Therefore, your host will be more likely to agree to your request. There are also other phrases that you can use that are less direct and more polite.You can say, ""I was wondering if you could put your dog in another room or outside because I am a bit allergic to dogs.""
Or, ""Do you think you might be able to put your dog outside? I am a little allergic to dogs.""

, Explain to your host that it isn't the dog that is bothering you, but the dog's behavior. In other words, try to separate the behavior from the dog as much as possible. On the other hand, if you are allergic to dogs or are fearful of dogs, make it clear that the dog isn't the problem, but that you are the problem. This way, you can avoid offending your host.


For example, you can say, ""Can I ask you something? I have never been good with dogs. I developed a fear of dogs when I was young, and I am still trying to get over it. Could you put your dog up or outside?""
You could also say, ""Your dog is very sweet, but I don't like the way it jumps up on me when it greets me. What can I do to prevent it from jumping on me?""

Make sure it has a durable handle.,
Choose one with high visibility.,
Get one with a front flotation pad.,
Read the sizing charts.,
Make sure it fits.,
Pick one that’s convenient.,
Read reviews.",How to Choose the Right Life Jacket for Your Dog2," Life jackets with sturdy top handles make it much easier to pick your dog up out of the water if they should need an extra hand.For the same reason, it’s also useful if the jacket has a leash attachment, so that you can pull or guide your dog out of the water.

, Life jackets come in many styles, but it’s important to prioritize functionality over looks. When it comes to the color or pattern, make sure that your dog’s life jacket is bright, neon, and/or has reflective tape so that they’re always visible in the water.This is essential not only so that you can keep track of your pet but also so that nearby boaters, swimmers, or surfers can avoid them.

, This buoyant pad will keep your dog’s head afloat in case of emergency. Be sure that your canine life jacket has a front flotation device across the chest that’s located immediately under your dog’s chin., Dogs come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, and each brand of life jacket will have a different type of sizing system. Be sure that you know the associated weights and measurements for each size when selecting a life jacket.

, All canine life jackets are adjustable, but that doesn’t mean that they all fit well. The fit is the most important criteria for keeping your dog happy and safe. You want a jacket that is snug and secure on your dog’s body while still allowing them to move freely.Test your dog’s mobility by having them walk, sit, lie down, and run in the jacket.
You want the vest to be snug but not so tight that it’s uncomfortable. When you have the jacket strapped on, be sure that you can fit two fingers between the vest and your dog’s body at the neck opening.
Be sure that none of the fittings or attachments (like buckles and straps) rub against your dog uncomfortably since that can lead to chafing.
Most pet stores that carry life jackets will do fittings for you. If you find that your dog’s life jacket does not fit them well, return it, and try another brand or size.

, You don’t want a jacket that has so many adjustable attachments that it’s difficult to get on and off of your dog. Make sure that you can easily put the jacket on your dog and remove it before purchasing it.Many jackets come with handy quick-release buckles, so that they’re simple to slip on and off.
For convenience’s sake, you should also make sure that the jacket’s material is durable, like sturdy nylon and neoprene, and easy to clean.

, Even though you can see in advance if a canine life jacket fits your dog, it’s still difficult to tell if it will actually function well when you hit the lake. Search online for reviews of products that have actually tested them with real dogs in real water.Be sure that the reviewers do not have a commercial affiliation with any brand.

Figure out if your dog is a water dog.,
Consider your dog’s body fat and coat.,
Assess the condition of your dog.,
Evaluate the water-safety risks.",How to Choose the Right Life Jacket for Your Dog3," For some breeds, swimming is not instinctual, and water inspires fear rather than pleasure. That fear can become dangerous when it hampers your pet’s breathing and ability to stay afloat. If your dog panics around water, you should definitely get them a life jacket.The list of breeds that are typically water-shy is longer and more various than you might think. It includes everything from English Bulldogs to Chihuahuas to certain types of Terrier. As a general rule, if your dog has short legs or weighs less than 15 pounds, chances are they should have a life jacket.Toy dogs are especially prone to being less than enthusiastic about water. If you have a pet that belongs to the Toy group, it’s advisable to get them a life jacket.

, Pooches with low body fat and thin coats will find it challenging to regulate their core body temperatures and keep themselves afloat. If you have a trim dog, it’s wise to get them a life jacket.Canines with low body fat and short fur include breeds like Greyhounds, Salukis, Whippets, Dobermans, and Boxers.

, If your pet is not in a peak state of fitness, it’s a good idea to get them a life jacket. They might be a water dog, but illness, old age, lack of exercise, susceptibility to overheating, and/or obesity can seriously affect their swimming abilities.If your dog has a seizure disorder, heart condition, or respiratory condition, it’s probably best to keep them out of the water altogether.

, If you’re taking your dog out on a boat or exposing them to potentially dangerous waters, it’s always wise to have a life jacket for them. Likewise, if there’s a chance that your dog will be swimming for a prolonged period, they should have a life jacket on.It is not a legal requirement to have a life jacket for dogs on a boat (as it is for all human passengers), but it is highly recommended.
Significant safety risks include water that is deep, fast-moving, wavy, and/or prone to currents or undertows.

Evaluate your dog’s capability.,
Build contact obstacles.,
Plan a tire jump.,
Plan your weave poles.,
Lay out tunnels.,
Create a few layouts.,
Decide if you want to DIY.,
Clear the space.,
Put up the obstacles.,
Let your dog explore.,
Take your dog on a walkthrough.,
Begin training.",How to Design a Dog Agility Course," As you start thinking about what obstacles you want to set up in your course, consider your dog’s capability. Make sure plan obstacles that are appropriate for your dog’s size. A corgi, for example, could not get through a tire jump meant for a German shepherd.Also consider any limited ability your dog has. If your dog has back problems, for example, it may be able to easily get up and down an A-frame, but may not be able to complete a weave pole exercise.
Do not try to force a dog beyond its ability. Some dogs may not be able to do certain obstacles, and all dogs will have to train up from easier to more challenging courses.;
, Contact obstacles typically include A-frames and see-saws. A-frames have your dog run up one side and immediately down the other of a wooden, A-shaped obstacle.It is generally easier and safer for your pet to purchase a ready-built contact obstacles, but you can make your own A-frame from wood or aluminum. Instructions can be found online.For see-saw obstacles, you may buy a purpose-built agility see-saw or you can use one meant for toddlers or small children.

, Tire jumps are easily adjustable if you have different sized dogs, and are typically found in many competitive agility courses. These are tires suspended by ropes to a wooden frame.According to USDAA regulations, tire jumps must have an interior opening of 20 inches (50.8 cm), and the tire itself must have a 4 inch (10.16 cm) wall.
Tire jumps are generally purchased whole from agility equipment retailers, as while you can build one yourself, professionally manufactured jumps tend to be more secure and less likely to hurt your pet if they miss the jump.Setting up tire jumps is generally a simple process that at most involves you connecting the tire to the suspending agents, but more often just involves placing the frame.

, Weave poles are a set of narrow plastic poles set closely together so that your dog can quickly weave their body between each pole. Each course should have five to twelve poles with approximately two feet (0.6 meters) between each pole.Weave poles should be sturdy enough that they can withstand your dog running in between them, but not so sturdy that they won't bend or fall if your dog does not weave perfectly.
Weave poles should not be driven far into the ground, as this cause them to become more rigid and subsequently poses an increased risk of injury for your dog.
You can make your own weave poles by setting one inch (2.5 cm) diameter PVC pipe in along a pipe base. Use tee pipe connectors to join the upright poles to the base.You can also purchase safe and sturdy weave poles from a manufacturer.

, Tunnels are generally of fabric, and may have a curve or bend, or may be straight. Tunnels can easily be improvised using children's play tunnels, and can be used as an indoor our outdoor training obstacle.If you are training for competition, your dog will need to know how to navigate a pipe tunnel, which is usually straight, and a collapsible tunnel, which may have a curve.
Play tunnels can be used to train for both types of tunnel obstacles. Simply reconfigure the tunnel to be straight or to have a bend.

, There is no one setup for an agility course. Different courses will have different obstacles at different points. Create a few layouts so that you can change up your course and keep your dog stimulated during training.Try not to put like obstacles next to one another. For example, do not put a see-saw after an A-frame. Create variation to help your pet get the most from the course.

, You can create your course either by buying purpose-built obstacles or by making your own. Take a look into the investment of purchasing new equipment and the time commitment and knowledge necessary to build your own and decide what is right for you.If you do not have much experience building or fixing things, a dog agility course might not be the best place to start. Lack of experience may lead to unsafe features in your course that could cause harm to your dog.
If you are considering purchasing equipment, look for agility training kits that allow you to bundle obstacles. The right package could help save money when compared to buying pieces individually.
If you choose to build your own obstacles, look up instructions for specific obstacles meant to fit your dog’s size. Follow their instructions, measurements, and plans closely.

, Make sure you clear the space for your course before you begin putting it up. Remove any obstructions such as sticks, rocks, bowls, and other play equipment. Also be sure to clear out distractions such as treats and toys unless they are specifically to be used during the training.Be sure that the space is mostly level. The obstacles associated with an agility course can be disorienting and potentially harmful if on uneven surfaces.

, Once you have your obstacles, set up one of your course designs so that you and your dog can start training. Remember to safety check each obstacle before you let your dog on the course. Make sure nothing shifts or moves while your dog is on it.Make sure bars like those on hurdles can easily be knocked off so that your dog does not run into a hard object while training.
Check to make sure that your dog can comfortably fit through any tunnels before guiding them into one.

, Before you ever start training, let your dog explore the course. Unleash them in the area of the course and allow them to sniff around and familiarize themselves with the equipment. Familiarizing early on helps your dog feel more comfortable on the course when training.If your dog seems curious about the equipment, help them explore obstacles such as tunnels and see-saws. Gently guide your dog through with your hands or with verbal encouragement.

, Once you have introduced the course to your dog, take them on a walkthrough so that they can start to understand each obstacle. Help guide them up and down contact obstacles and over jumps.Use vocal commands, treats, and gentle touch to help guide your dog through the course the first time.
Be sure to help your dog stabilize on obstacles such as the see-saw. Use your hands to help them keep from coming down too fast or sliding off the obstacle.

, Once your dog is comfortable with the course, you are ready to start your agility training. If you have never practiced agility training with your dog before, practice handling and commands on the ground before you work your way to the obstacles.Start with more obvious obstacles such as using cones for weave poles until your dog is ready to handle the more narrow poles.
Take your dog to agility training classes or training groups to help both you and your pet get the most from your new hobby.

Feed your dogs adequately.Your dogs should eat a mix of high-quality dry and wet (canned) food with high levels of fat and protein.,
Ensure your dogs have enough to drink.Sled dogs need access to water at all times to ensure they don’t become dehydrated.,
Protect your dogs’ skin.,
Don’t push your dogs beyond what they can endure.Excessive speed when sledding can lead to injuries, dehydration, and stress.,
Take your dogs to the vet regularly.",How to Care for Sled Dogs1," The protein and fat content in the food provides your dogs with the energy they need to run long distances. Whatever you feed your dogs, they should be taking in around 10,000 calories each day when they’re on the trail.Some mushers mix a cup or two of water into the food to help the dogs digest the food more easily and prevent dehydration. Adding water is also necessary when thawing out frozen food on the trail.Many sled dogs also like fish. Be sure to cook it thoroughly and remove bones before feeding it to your dogs.
Feeding a sled dog can be expensive, with costs totaling up to $500 per year.;
, Place water in a pan or bowl that won’t spill. A deep, heavy ceramic water bowl is best since, unlike flimsy metal or plastic bowls, they are less likely to be knocked over.


Empty the bowl each day and fill it with fresh water.
Clean the pan or bowl at least once each week to prevent food residue and bacteria from building up.
Always ensure your dogs have had plenty to drink before going on a run., Sled dogs are bred for cold temperatures. However, even the hardiest sled dogs have their limits. The temperature a dog can comfortably handle varies depending on its age, coat, and overall health, and there is no absolute temperature at which dogs should be kept from the elements.However, stay attentive to your dogs’ behavior and attitude, and look for changes that might occur in extreme weather. If your dogs are shivering, curled up in the snow and not moving, or engaging in other behavior that indicates they are unable to tolerate the temperature, don’t force them to continue running.Dogs can get frostbite, so always use caution if you suspect your dogs are at risk.In extreme weather, dress your dogs in special coats and blankets to give them an added layer of protection against the cold.
Wash your dogs at least once a month. Use a mild soap or shampoo specially designed for dogs that won’t dry out their skin. Special dog shampoos are available at pet stores.

, Take care to watch for behavior that indicates your dog is struggling or in pain, including labored breathing, yelping, an inability to keep pace with other dogs, and/or bloody paws or prints.


Know when to retire your sled dogs.Most dogs can only run until they are 10 years old. No dog should be running beyond the age of 15 years old.

, Many races require that your dogs are up-to-date on their shots and vaccines.When getting their shots, your vet should also examine the dogs for other illnesses or problems. Sled dogs are more likely to have joint problems then regular dogs, so if you catch the problem early, it could save your dog a lot of pain later and keep your team strong.

Mark your measurements.,
Cut the PVC.,
Create your cups.,
Assemble the sides of the jump.,
Build the bases.,
Finish assembling the jump.",How to Build a Dog Agility Jump1," Depending on where you bought the PVC pipe, you will need to measure and mark the pipe before you cut it. Most 1½-inch PVC pipe comes in in 5-foot (1.52 m) lengths. With a tape measure and Sharpie, measure and then mark the cuts that you need to make on your PVC pipe.For your convenience, you might also ask the sales associate if they would cut the pipe to your specifications. Whether you cut it yourself or have someone else do it, you will need to make the following pieces:


8 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces.
2 48-inch (121.92 cm) pieces.
2 5½-inch (13.97 cm) pieces.
2 6 ½-inch (16.51 cm) pieces.
2 15¼-inch (38.74 cm) pieces.;
, Once you have measured and marked your pipe, cut the individual pieces using a pull saw (hacksaw or miter saw) or a circular saw. Using the saw, you will want to cut along the lines that you marked on the pipe until you have 16 individual pieces of PVC pipe. When cutting the pipe, you should place the PVC pipe in a vise or hold it in place with a clamp.When operating a circular saw, you should always wear eye protection and keep your fingers away from the blade.
A miter saw and box may will give you more control over your cut, making it more accurate. You also do not need a clamp or vise since the miter box will hold the pipe in place.
If you use a hacksaw, always secure your pipe within a vise or with a clamp. This will help prevent you from cutting yourself.

, To create a cup where the jump bars will rest, mark a line down the middle of the center tube, stopping when you get to the joint. Then insert a small piece of scrap pipe into one end of the tee joint and clamp the other end to your work surface. Holding the scrap pipe with your free hand, you will cut along the line that you drew. Then turn the tee and cut parallel with the pipe to create the cup. Repeat this step with three more tee joints to make all of the cups.Remember to cut away from yourself when creating the cup.
If making your own cups seems too complicated or dangerous, you can also buy cups online from various pet supply companies.The cup should hold the jump bar in place while allowing it to easily come free. This will keep your dog from being injured.

, Build one side of the jump by putting the pieces together in this order: tee joint, 5½-inch (13.97 cm) pipe, cup tee, 6 ½-inch (16.51 cm) pipe, cup tee, 15 ¼-inch (38.74 cm) pipe, and end cap. Use a block and hammer to fit the pieces together securely. Repeat this process to create the other side.You will know that the pieces are connected when the pipe rests firmly against the inside shoulder of the connector.

, Take one of your side pieces and insert a 12-inch (30.48 cm) pipe through the open tee joint on the bottom. Put a cap on one end and another tee joint on the other. Finally, put two 12-inch (30.48 cm) pipes with end caps into each end of the open tee joint to make it steadier. Repeat this process to create the base for the other side.Once completed, the bases should stand on their own.

, Wrap a few strips of tape around the bars and the sides of the jump to make it more visible to your dog. Then place the sides parallel with the cups facing each other. Finally, connect the two sides by resting a 48-inch (121.92 cm) piece between them.Depending on your dog’s agility, you may only need the lower bar at first and then work up to two bars as your dog gets better at jumping.

Inspect the bottoms of your dog’s feet regularly.If you see any cracked skin, dryness, blisters, or scarring, consult a veterinarian.,
Invest in dog booties.There are several situations where it might be necessary for your dogs to don booties.,
Use healing ointments on your dogs’ paws.",How to Care for Sled Dogs2," Check the nails, too. Nails need to be maintained within a narrow “Goldilocks zone” where they are neither too long (which can cause them to snag and break off) nor too short (which will diminish their ability to grip the ice when running). Check the webbing between the toes for any redness, irritation, or swelling.


Your dog will usually let you know if it has irritated paws by limping, licking, or gnawing its irritated foot. It might also yelp when you pick up its paw to examine it.
Always be gentle when handling sled dogs’ paws.

, One is extreme cold. The other is when running in deep snow. Finally, you might also want to outfit your dog in booties if it has injured its paw and you cannot change the dog out for another one.Sled dogs have thick coats and have evolved to thrive in cold weather environments, and can tolerate temperatures as low as -55 degrees Fahrenheit (-48 degrees Celsius). However, sled dogs have their limits. Check your dog’s paws frequently for cracked, bloody pads and put them in boots if you see any of these conditions.
Different dogs have different tolerance levels for temperature.The dog’s age and health are the most important factors that determine how cold a dog’s feet can get before the temperature begins to have a negative impact.
Different booties are recommended for different terrain. For instance, you could get a bootie that works best on ice, or one that works best on snow. Other booties are designed for off-season practice on dirt or gravel tracks.
The booties also come in different sizes. Be sure to buy one that’s right for you and your dogs.Sled dog booties are readily available online, or at certain pet stores.

, There are a variety of oils, liniments, and lotions available to heal damaged paws.Choose one that is right for your dog’s needs. Most ointments simply require massaging the product gently into the dog’s paw. Always use lotions and ointments as directed.


Liniments with emu oil are good at limiting inflammation and preventing infection. Emu oil can restore elasticity and nutrients to the skin.
Ointments with zinc oxide are excellent for healing fissures and cracks on the dog’s pads and between the toes. Be careful, however, not to let your dog lick the zinc oxide ointment.
Ointments made with lanolin and glycerin are useful for preventing ice balling on your dog’s feet and ankles. These ingredients can help keep your dog’s pads and skin healthy.

Give your dogs time to play.Sled dogs work hard.,
Tether your sled dogs outside.When your dogs are not in the yard, put them in their kennel.,
Have space inside for your dogs.If your region of the country gets really cold you should bring your dogs inside.",How to Care for Sled Dogs3," Show your appreciation by giving them time to relax when they’re not in the harness.


Provide a large yard for your dogs to play in. This gives the dogs a space where they can be active outside of their sled regimen. Ensure the yard is fenced so they cannot run off.
Your dogs should be allowed to play with each other, but you should play with them, too. They might like catching a ball, frisbee, or stick and bringing it back to you.
Clean your yard regularly. Depending on how many dogs you have, you might need to do “poop patrol” two or three times daily.
Your yard should be level and free of pooling water where bacteria can collect.

, The kennel should have a semi-open arrangement that allows each dog to get close enough to its neighbor to play and socialize when tethered, but should also give the dog the option of sitting by itself without possibility of interruption from other dogs.


Experiment with the spacing to figure out how long your tether should be and how far apart each dog should be spaced from its neighborhood.
Use straw for bedding. Mix some pine shavings into the straw if you’re concerned the kennel is accumulating moisture. Change the bedding every two to three weeks, or when it is visibly dirty.The size of the kennel depends on how many sled dogs you have. Each dog should have at least 35 square feet to itself.
Puppies should be kept in the kennel but not tethered. Provide a separate, smaller pen for them to socialize in together.

, Temperatures of -30 degrees Fahrenheit or below usually qualify as a reasonable benchmark for bringing your dogs inside.


Make a “dog box” -- a series of deep wooden shelves that can accommodate a sled dog’s body -- in your barn or basement. Line the dog boxes with soft blankets or towels when in use.
You should also bring your dogs inside if it is raining and your kennel is not well-protected from rain and snow.
Although sled dogs are bred for cold temperatures, when they are not running, they have a harder time staying warm.

Think about what you value.There’s no one formula for determining what sled dog is right for your team.,
Choose an Alaskan husky.Alaskan huskies (also called Indian dogs) are the most common dogs in dog sled races.,
Choose a Malamute.Malamutes are excellent sled dogs and are bred for raw power.,
Choose a Siberian husky.Huskies are smaller than Malamutes (usually weighing 40-60 pounds) and have lower endurance levels.,
Choose a Canadian Eskimo dog.",How to Care for Sled Dogs4," A good sled dog will demonstrate a combination of endurance, speed, pulling ability, and perseverance. Sled dogs should also have a certain level of intelligence -- an ability to listen for and obey commands, actively avoid obstacles, and take care of themselves. A thick coat is a must for dogs running long-distance sleds in cold weather. Finally, your dog should be healthy and fit to endure the intense training and distances required of sled dogs.


Your sled dogs don’t need to be of just one breed, but they all need to be able to work together without conflict. Dogs that cause conflicts with others should be removed from the team.
If your dog is puling a sled over a shorter distance and time (two hours or less), it does not need to have such a thick coat.

, This “breed” is actually a mutt -- a cross between Siberian huskies and another breed, which varies. Some Alaskan huskies have wolf ancestry, others have greyhound, German shorthair pointer, hound, or terrier blood.


Wolf-dog mixes can be unpredictable and difficult to train. Use caution if purchasing or employing a husky with a close wolf ancestor.

, One popular variety of Malamute, the freight dog, has high endurance and excels at long trips, though it is not very fast. They usually weigh 80-120 pounds.


Popular depictions of dog sled races usually feature Malamutes or huskies.

, Over a short period of time, though, huskies can pull more than Malamutes. Purebred Siberian huskies are mostly bred for appearance, not pulling ability, and usually make poor sled dogs.

, Like other sled dogs, the Canadian Eskimo dog is muscular and built for pulling. It can cover 15 to 70 miles per day, and is capable of pulling up to 80 kilograms.Don’t confuse the Canadian Eskimo dog with the American Eskimo dog, which has a a short, white, and dense coat.

Mark your measurements.,
Cut your pieces.,
Make the jump bars.,
Build the feet of the jumps.,
Construct two bases.,
Assemble the jump.",How to Build a Dog Agility Jump2," Using a tape measure and Sharpie, mark the cuts on your 1-inch PVC pipe. 1-inch PVC comes in 10-foot lengths at most hardware stores. However, if you have your measurements handy, you should ask the sales associate if they would be able to make your cuts for you.Regardless, you will need the following pieces:


8 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces
4 1¾-inch (4.45 cm) pieces
2 50-inch (127 cm) pieces
4 30-inch (76.2 cm) pieces

, Once you have marked your cuts, use a pull saw (hacksaw or miter saw) or circular saw to cut your pieces. Make sure that you cut straight along the lines that you marked. Because you are making two jumps, you will have 18 pieces total, 9 pieces for each jump., While you are cutting your pieces, take the 10-foot (3.1 m) pieces of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) PVC pipe and cut off four 50-inch (127 cm) pieces.An easy way to do this would be to mark and cut off a 20-inch (50.8 cm) piece from each pipe, and then cut the remaining large piece in half to get two 50-inch (127 cm) pieces. You can then use tape to mark the bars or use newspaper and spray paint to make more complicated markings.Ul


You should end up with four 50-inch (127 cm) pieces of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) PVC pipe.
Depending on how exact your measurements are, you may find that you need to trim a little off the ends of your jump bars to get them to fit properly in the cups. You should not need to take off more than a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm).

, Slide two 12-inch (30.48 cm) pieces into the top and bottom ends of a tee joint. Then put caps on the ends of the 12-inch (30.48 cm) pipe. Repeat this process three more times to make all four feet for your jumps.If the pieces do not slide together easily, you might consider using a hammer and block to tap them together.

, For each foot, insert a 1¾-inch (4.45 cm) piece into the open end of the tee joint. Then attach another tee joint to the top of the 1¾-inch (4.45 cm). You should have four individual feet with tee joints facing in. Finally, take two jump feet and, with the middle openings of the tee joints facing each other, insert a 50-inch (127 cm) piece of 1-inch (2.5 cm) pipe in-between them.Once you insert the 50-inch (127 cm) piece, the base should stand on its own.

, Insert a 30-inch (76.2 cm) into the open tee joints at the tops of each base and put caps on the open pipe ends. Then clip two jump cups onto the 30-inch (76.2 cm). With the cups facing each other, place one 50-inch (127 cm) piece of ¾-inch (1.9 cm) in-between each jump cup. This should give you two parallel jumping bars for each of your jumps.You should be able to find the jump cup clips online. You can also make your own.
If the bars do not fit perfectly, consider sawing off a little at the ends until they fit. The bars should rest securely but fall easily if bumped.

Entice your dog with a reward.,
Take some time.,
Give the dog praise.",How to Build a Dog Agility Jump3," One of the easiest ways to get your dog to go over the agility jump is to stand on the other side with a treat. When your dog jumps over the bars, give it the treat and some praise. However, if the dog goes around the bars, do not give it the treat. Eventually, your dog will learn to associate jumping over the bars with a treat. Over time, they will jump without being prompted., It will take a fair amount of time to get your dog trained to jump over the jumping bars. Depending on their temperament and breed, your dog may take to the agility jump right away. However, your dog may be hesitant at first and need some coaxing to attempt a jump. Be patient and train your dog every day in order to master the agility jump., It is important that you be positive with your dog during its training. Maintaining a positive tone will help your dog master the agility jump and create a positive association. If you yell at your dog or take a harsh tone, it will become anxious around the jumps and take a longer time to master the trick."

Choose an easily trainable dog.,
Be cautious about certain breeds.,
Look for a dog with good endurance.,

Start slowly.,
Stay safe on the trail.",How to Choose a Good Hiking Dog," Some breeds are more independent and hard to train than others. If you want your dog to be able to frolic off-leash, you'll need a dog with good recall (comes when called).If you do plan to let your dog off his leash, avoid dogs with a strong prey drive. The last thing you want is for your dog to run away after a squirrel, never to be seen again.
Herding, sporting, and retrieving dogs tend to stick close to their owners.
If you plan on keeping your dog on a leash on all your hikes, trainability isn't as important.;
, If you're going to be doing a lot of cold-weather or rainy hiking, ideally you want a dog that will have a warm, waterproof coat (consider the Spitz breeds). If you'll be in the sun, a long-haired, dark dog might overheat easily.If you know the breed of the dog, research what they were bred for. Dogs that were bred to work outdoors in an environment like yours will be the most comfortable.
Your dog will get dirty on the trail. Be prepared to give a dog with a more generous coat baths more often, or favor a breed that is very fastidious about cleaning itself (e.g. Shiba Inu).
Long-haired dogs are likely to get burrs, and are more difficult to inspect for fleas and ticks.
Short-haired dogs will get cold more easily and may need to wear special hiking gear (like an insulated jacket) while hiking outdoors.

, You may encounter specific situations when hiking that require a certain amount of physical strength on your part or that of the dog. Consider the following questions:


If the dog gets hurt, would you be able to carry it home? If it falls down to an area where you can't reach it, do you have the strength to hoist it up?
If you carpool often, remember that a bigger dog will be harder to squeeze into a vehicle full of hikers.
If you need to cross a stream, will you let the dog cross on its own or will you need to carry it?

, If you come across other canine hikers, it'll make life easier for everyone if you have a dog that isn't aggressive toward other dogs (especially if some of your human hiking companions have dogs of their own).If you're getting a puppy, be sure to socialize it during that critical 8-12 week period. Introduce it to well-mannered dogs that are vaccinated.
If you're getting an older dog, make sure it already gets along with other dogs.
Know how to break up a dog fight, just in case.

, If you're going to be on trails with steep drop-offs or rocky cliffs and your dog will be off-leash, it's better to have a dog that watches her step and has good balance than to get a dog that in her excitement might slip and fall. An agile dog will be an excellent companion for hiking because they’ll be able to navigate tricky paths and trails without much assistance from their owner. Some dogs that fall in this category include:Weimaraner
Akita

, Dogs that are easy to train usually make excellent hiking companions because they can learn the trails and how you expect them to behave quickly. They will also usually interact well with other hikers and dogs. Some of these breeds include:German Shepherd
Labrador Retriever
Norwegian Buhund

, Some dogs (like the Pitt Bull and Rottweiler) are prone to aggression unless trained very diligently. Others are difficult to train – like Huskies and Akitas. Be careful when choosing one of the following breeds as a hiking partner:Pitt Bull
Rottweiler
Shiba Inu
Husky

, A greyhound or a whippet, for example, will probably not enjoy a 10 mile (16 km) hike because they are bred for sprinting, not endurance. Additionally, flat-faced breeds such as English Bulldogs will struggle to breathe on long hikes and in hot weather, and so generally shouldn't undertake endurance activities. Some breeds with high endurance include:German Shepherd
Chesapeake Bay Retriever

, Many people think you should never let your dog off-leash, ever. However, many people do let their dogs off-leash. But if you're going to be one of those people, be prepared, smart, and safe about it. You need to spend some time training your dog to make sure it will behave properly when you let it off the leash.To get your dog ready for off-leash hiking, you’ll need to work with it walking and hiking on the leash first. Encourage your dog not to pull or try to get ahead of the group and reward it with praise and treats when it acts the way you want it to.
Over time, you can switch to an extendable leash, but don’t allow the dog to walk past a certain point. When your dog gets to the point that it can stay with you and leave some slack in the leash, try off-leash walking.

, Train your dog to carry its own supplies by outfitting it with a small pack it can wear on its back. Let the dog wear the empty pack for a while to get used to how it moves and feels on their body first.Once your dog has become accustomed to wearing the pack, add some supplies to it. But make sure it isn’t so heavy that it’ll overload your dog and wear it out.
You can put water, a packable container for water, dog food, packable food dish, treats, medication, dog leash, and any other supplies your dog may need in its pack.

, Before taking your dog out on its first hike, make sure to discuss the outing with your vet. You’ll need to make sure that your dog has all of the appropriate vaccinations (especially for rabies) before you take it out into the wild.


Your vet will also be able to talk to you about any possible physical limitations your specific dog may have or any other health-related problems that may affect your pet’s ability to go on hikes with you.

, Let your dog ease into the hiking lifestyle. Take your pet on a short, easy hike for the first few times so it can adjust to the new experience and how you expect it to behave.After a while, you can work your way up to longer, more difficult hikes. You might even want to try an overnight camping trip after your dog has shown you it can handle normal hikes.
Remember, a dog that is harder to train may need more practice runs before it can go hiking with you the way you want it to. This may include longer time hiking with a leash or shorter overall hikes than you would prefer. Be patient and don’t rush the process.

, Only bring your dog on trails that are appropriate for your dog’s levels of physical strength and endurance. Don’t push your dog too hard or you may risk your dog injuring itself.


Bring a first aid kit with you on the hike that includes bandages, an antiseptic for wound care, tweezers to remove ticks, and a liquid bandage for paw pad wounds.Be sure to check ahead of time about the rules regarding pets in the area you are planning to hike. Many national parks do not allow dogs at all or require that your dog remain on its leash at all times."

Get competitive!",How to Find the Right Dog Sport for You," Conformation is a sport in which dogs are judged based on how they conform to their breed standard, more popularly known as dog showing. This sport is for purebred dogs only. Many kennel clubs, including the AKC, UKC, CKC, and KC, hold shows.;
, Trial obedience tests a dog's intelligence by requiring him to perform commands, find scent articles, and more. Your dog must have basic obedience and respond quickly and effectively; however, at beginning levels, your dog will only have to perform basic commands on leash.

, Agility is a sport in which a dog has to complete an obstacle course as quickly as possible, judged on time and accuracy. You cannot touch your dog or the obstacles, but you can give commands and hand signals. The course is made to be so difficult that a dog could not complete it without human direction. In order to compete in this sport, a dog must be physically fit; decide with your veterinarian on an exercise regimen for helping your dog become fit. Some agility obstacles include the jump, double jump, triple jump, tire jump, tunnel, teeter totter, and A-frame.

, Lure coursing is a sport in which sighthounds chase an artificial lure across an open field, judged based on speed, endurance, and many other traits. This sport is for purebred sighthounds only, and the sighthound must be at least one year old and in top physical shape to compete. Some sighthound breeds include the Afghan Hound, Azawakh, Saluki, Greyhound, Italian Greyhound, Scottish Deerhound, Whippet, and Irish Wolfhound.

, In it, hound and sporting group dogs are judged on how well they can hunt and flush game in the field. This sport is for physically fit hound and sporting dogs only. Eligible breeds include English Setters, Dachshunds, Beagles, Irish Setters, Golden Retrievers, Gordon Setters, Labs, and Basset Hounds.

, Schutzhund is German for ""protection dog"" - in this sport, which is used to help train dogs for police and search and rescue work, there are three parts: protection, obedience, and tracking. During the tracking part, dogs have to find things by using their noses. During the protection part, a decoy will try to attack the owner or dog, and the dog has to keep the decoy from doing so. During the obedience part, a dog has to follow commands issued by the owner. During one of the three parts, a gun will be fired into the air, (not at anyone) to see how the dog reacts. This is a very demanding sport that very few dogs pass. Eligible breeds include German Shepherds, Boxers, Great Danes, and Akitas.

, Earthdog is a sport that tests terriers' ability to dig for quarry. Usually, the quarry is two adult rats in a cage or artificial quarry capable of movement. The dog has to dig and find the quarry, tested on how quickly he finds them and how long he stays with them (neither rats nor dog are harmed). This sport is for small terriers only. Eligible breeds include Bedlington Terriers, Skye Terriers, Norwich Terriers, and Cairn Terriers.

, Dogs compete in teams of two as they jump over three or more obstacles, hit a machine to receive a tennis ball, take the tennis ball and return over the two fences. Size is not an objection, but dogs must be energetic, responsive to training, comfortable among other dogs, adults, and physically fit to compete.

, Research them to find the sport right for you!

,
Measure to find the centers of the feet and mark with the pencil.

,
Nail one upright to each foot, making sure it's in the middle and the bottom of the upright is even with the bottom of the foot.,
For the angled pieces, take one of the remaining pieces of 2""x4"" and line up the bottom corner of it with the inside bottom corner of one end of one of the feet.,
Cut along these lines.

,
Check to make sure the angled bar fits: Line up the bottom with the inside end of the foot and the top flush against the side of the upright.,
Nail each angled piece in place.,
From the bottom of each upright, measure up and mark at 8"", 12"", 18"", and 24"".,
Drill the holes.,
Cut 2 17"" pieces from the remaining 2""x4""s. Nail them on either side of the uprights (which are on the inside) to connect the two sides, and make sure they are also even with the bottom of each side.

",How to Build an Adjustable Dog Agility Seesaw,";
,,, Use 2 nails in each.

, Angle it up so it crosses the upright about 12""-18"" from the bottom. Draw a line on the angled piece where it crosses the upright (it will be about a 45º angle). Also draw a line on the upright where it sticks out past the end of the foot (that is, you'll cut it so it will be even with the end of the foot).

,, Check it in all four places where the angled pieces will go; it should fit everywhere.


Since this angled piece fits everywhere, you can use it as a template for the other 3 pieces. Lay it on the 2""x4"", mark, and cut.

, They go on the inside of the feet, with their ends even with the ends of the feet, and flush against the uprights. Put one nail in the bottom, then fit and nail the top, driving the nail at an angle through the support and into the upright. Then put another nail in the bottom. Make sure all nails are flush with the wood.

, These marks are where your holes will be. Also measure across each upright and mark the middle (do this at the top and bottom of each upright), lay your yardstick on the upright aligned with these marks, and draw lines that cross your 8"", 12"", etc. marks. Where your lines cross it where you will drill your holes for the pipe.

, With the point of your drill bit right where the lines cross, drill each hole. (You can put the upright on 2 scrap pieces of the 2""x4"" to help you not drill into the floor underneath.)

,, Just a few should do it. Now the base is done!

, Measure from each end to find the center (it probably won't be exactly at 6'), and mark it.

, You want the fulcrum (tipping point) to be 1"" to 2"" closer to one end of the board so that end will stay down (the teeter is a one-way obstacle), so measure and mark these. You can loosely attach two of the pipe straps so that they ""bridge"" the 2"" mark, and put the teeter together by running the pipe through one 24"" hole, through the pipe straps under the board, and out the other 24"" hole. Then do a not-very-scientific drop test by putting a 3-lb. weight (box of laundry detergent) on the up end 12"" from the end and timing how long it takes to hit the floor. It should be less than 3 seconds. In this case, the 1"" mark was used; see what you like.

, Paint the contact areas yellow. You'll probably need 3 coats for the yellow. Paint it once and let dry. Then paint it again, and this time lightly sprinkle play sand on it while it's still wet; try to get it kind of even. (You only need sand on the top of the board of course.) When it's dry, sweep off any loose sand, then apply the third coat of paint. When the yellow's dry, do the same for the blue area; you'll probably just need the first coat with the sand and the second on top of it. Viola! A beautiful no-slip surface, just like the real thing!

,, If using the 1/2"" straps, don't screw all the way in, but leave them a bit loose so the pipe will slip through without too much trouble.

For instance, you could search ""Golden retriever rescue Salt Lake City, Utah.""
Rescue organizations are the best way to locate purebred dogs available for adoption.
However, the application process can be quite rigorous and the fees are typically more expensive than your average shelter.

, Numerous online pet adoption locators—such as Adopt a Pet, Animal Adoption Center, Best Friends Animal Society, and Petfinder—exist to help you browse adoptable animals in your area. Simply enter the breed you wish to locate, and view the animals up for adoption in your area. These services draw from shelters, rescue organizations, and individuals looking to re-home animals.Once again, sport breeds include retrievers, pointers, spaniels, and setters.

, Adopting a sport dog is not as simple as walking into an animal shelter and waltzing out with your new pet. Shelters and rescue organizations work to make sure that these pets will be adequately cared for. As such, you will need to meet a series of requirements in order to adopt.These will vary from location to location, but may include:


You must spend at least 30 minutes with the dog you want to adopt.
You must show a valid government-issued I.D.
You must be at least 18 years old.
You must show proof of address. (Some shelters will require you to live within a certain area.)

You will also be asked to pay an adoption fee. Breed-specific rescue organizations will have the most rigorous in-depth process.The adoption fee will vary from organization to organization, and from breed to breed.
The fee can also vary depending on which medical services (such as spaying/neutering or vaccinations) are included.
This fee can range from as little as $25 to as much as $300.

, In order to qualify for a dog adoption through some services, you must bring the dog home with you for a short period of time as a kind of “test.” Inquire about this with your adoption service and schedule a time for your home visit.Get the details about your required home visit right away.
In some cases, this may only be for a few hours, while other services may ask you to take the dog overnight.
If you have other dogs at home, a representative from the organization might help facilitate the first meeting.
Make sure you have everything you need to care for the dog for this time period (some shelters may supply food and other items).

, If you have met all necessary requirements, paid the appropriate fees, and successfully completed your home visit, you can make arrangements to pick up your new dog and welcome them into your home., Before you bring your new dog home, you will want to get your home ready.

a leash
food and water bowls
dog food
a collar or harness (and tags)
a dog bed
a crate (optional)
dog toys

, Sport dogs are also called ""performance dogs,"" because they have been bred for hunting. As such, these dogs require a special diet that supports their athleticism. A sport dog should receive 30-35% of their calories from protein, and up to 60% of calories from fat, which is quite different from the diet of other breeds. Choose a ""sport dog"" or ""hunting dog"" blend of dog food that fits these requirements, and/or seek a recommendation from your vet.Studies suggest that hard-working dogs like these should be fed only once per day.
The amount of food your sport dog needs will vary based on their weight.
You may want to consult a veterinarian to determine the best diet for your sport dog.
These breeds need a lot of water, too! Water should be offered at least three times a day.

, Sport dogs are naturally curious, so it is best to allow them to explore your home in their own time. Although they are not known to be aggressive, they will be the most comfortable if they are given plenty of space at first. When you bring home your new sport dog, consider placing the dog in a quiet room, where no one will bother them. Leave the door open and allow your dog to investigate the rest of your home when they are ready.


If you have other dogs, it may be helpful to introduce the dogs to each other in a neutral place (such as a park) before bringing the new dog home.
Sport dogs tend to respond well to crate training. Consider crate training your new dog.
Be sure that all dogs have their own “nest” or private space to sleep.

, Sport dogs of all breeds are known for being active and alert. As such, a sport dog will need daily exercise. This can include walks, playing fetch, running, and general play. Be prepared to spend 30-45 minutes exercising your sport dog each day.At least some of this exercise should be vigorous. Try taking your dog on a run.
Additionally, some of this should include mental stimulation, such as playing hide and seek with a toy.
Aggressive play, restlessness, and excessive barking are all potential signs that your dog needs more activity., Now that you’ve acquired your new sport dog, be sure to take excellent care of them! Provide your new dog with food, water, daily exercise, veterinary care, and lots of love!

Understand friendly body language.,
Look for signs of anxiety.,
Ease their anxiety.,
Watch out for defensive postures.,
Be extremely cautious around dogs that display aggressive behaviors.",How to Get Along With an Abused or Unfriendly Dog1," When you are trying to interact with an unfriendly dog or one that you know has been abused, their body language will tell you a lot about how they are feeling and what kind of interaction they are okay with. Ideally, the dog will display signs that they are happy and comfortable in your presence, despite their traumatic history. These signs indicate that they are willing to interact with you and that they feel safe. Here are some common body language cues that your dog is happy:Relaxed body position
Enthusiastic tail wagging
Tail thumping the floor
Play bow where their rear end is up in the air with their tail wagging while their front end is down on the ground.;
, Anxiety is very common in dogs that have been abused and that are generally unfriendly with other people. Anxious dogs are generally fearful or stressed in the given situation, and do not want to interact with anyone else. Here are some common signs of anxiety in dogs:Suddenly scratching and biting at their paws or another body part
Yawning when they are not tired
Half moon eye
One paw raised

, The best way to ease a dog’s anxiety is to give them space. An anxious dog needs space to calm down and to relieve their stress. You can try speaking to them in a calm and soothing voice, but let them have some alone time.If this is your dog, let them go to a space that they feel safe, like their bed or crate. If this is a stranger’s dog, you should leave the dog alone and do not try to interact with the dog.


If you are able to, try to take the dog out of the stressful situation into a calmer environment that is quieter and has less external stimuli., When dogs are defensive, or show avoidance behaviors, they want to remove themselves from a situation and may perceive something as a threat.Defensive behaviors may be accompanied by anxious or aggressive behaviors, so you should understand these behaviors as potential warning signs. When a dog displays these behaviors, you should not try to approach them.Teeth-baring
Hair standing up on their back
Deep growls
Stiff legged gait
Prolonged stare

, Aggressive behaviors range from warning behaviors to signs that an attack is imminent. Do not approach a dog that displays any aggressive behaviors. This puts your safety at risk and is potentially very dangerous.Dogs can be aggressive when they are fearful, feel cornered or trapped, perceive you as a threat, or want to protect their owners. Here are some common signs of aggression in dogs. They begin with warning signs and become increasingly intense.Their bodies are very still and rigid
Deep guttural barking
Lunging forward or charging
Growling
Snarling and baring their teeth
Snapping in the air or towards a person
Biting

Listen to the owner.,
Do not make direct eye contact with the dog.,
Acknowledge your motivations in the scenario.,
Approach from an arc.,
Alternatively, let the dog approach you.,
Get on the dog’s level.",How to Get Along With an Abused or Unfriendly Dog2," When an owner tells you that their dog is unfriendly or does not like strangers, you need to respect their wishes and leave the dog alone. The dog’s owner knows more about the dog’s personality, history, and temperament than you do and you need to respect their wishes. If they tell you something like, “My dog doesn’t like strangers,” or “Please don’t pet him, he’s shy,” you should not approach the dog.Only approach a dog when you have the owner’s permission and the dog is showing friendly body language.

, Dogs may understand your direct eye contact as a sign of aggression. Do not stare directly into the dog’s eyes and hold their gaze for an extended amount of time. You can look around the dog’s face, or flick your eyes towards theirs, but avoid staring.

, Why do you want to approach an unfriendly dog or one that you know has been abused? The situation will be different if this is your friend’s new dog, or if it is a dog you see on the street that you think is cute.Understand that approaching the dog might not be in its best interests; it could make them feel cornered or attacked, which could make the situation unsafe. Only approach a dog with the owner’s permission and respect that the dog may not want to interact with you, even if the owner says it is okay.


You should be very aware of your own body language in this situation. Only approach the dog when you have a relaxed and casual posture.

, Do not approach the dog head on. Make sure the dog sees you and knows that you are approaching it. Sneaking up behind a dog will frighten it and they may become aggressive out of fear. Approach them from an arc, slightly from the side so they do not interpret your approach as a sign of aggression.


Take your time when you approach the dog and don’t move too quickly., A timid or shy dog may need time to warm up to you. They may only want to approach you when they feel comfortable and secure around you. You can give the dog the opportunity to check you out by sniffing you or walking around you.Stand very still and keep your hands at your sides. Glance away from the dog and try not to stare at them for prolonged periods of time.

, Crouch down or bend your knees to get on the dog’s level. This lets the dog know that you do not intend to harm it and that you want to have a friendly interaction. You can squat sideways so you do not face the dog head on. However, you need to still keep an eye on the dog so you can recognize any changes in their body language.When you are in this position, you lose some of your ability to get up and leave the situation quickly. You should not try to approach the dog if it is displaying any signs of aggression, and only get on their level when you are confident that they will react well.
Keep your face away from the dog’s face when you’re in this position. This could put in you in a compromising situation if the dog begins to feel unsafe and reacts negatively."

Just spend the morning or the late afternoon checking out a new mountain, park, or nature-filled area with your dog and enjoy exploring the outdoors with him. Keep your dog on a leash unless you’re in a safe area where it’s okay for him to run free. Make sure the hiking area allows dogs in advance, and that you have some water and treats on hand for your favorite creature.Making a routine of going hiking with your dog at least once a week can help strengthen your bond.
As you hike together, pay attention to what your dog likes or dislikes. See if he prefers climbing up mountains, playing in wooded areas, or exploring the ground near water. Don’t make him do something he doesn’t want to do.;
, Dogs love being outside, and if you want to bond with your dog, you should find as many ways to be outdoors with your dog or your whole family as possible. Take your dog out to a nice, pretty park on a warm day, bring some dog-friendly food, and some regular food for your family, and have a nice time bonding with your pet. Just make sure that you’re giving your dog the attention he deserves if you’re with other people. You can even take your dog for a walk around the picnic area.This can also be a great time to play Frisbee or catch with your dog, or just to let your dog run free. Any time you’re letting your dog be happy and free, you will be strengthening your bond because he’ll associate you with good feelings.

, When you take your dog for his daily walks, don’t chat on the phone the whole time, scroll through your phone, talk to your friends or neighbors, or let your mind drift. Instead, talk to your dog and let him know what a good boy he is, take the time to pet him, and even try to get your steps in sync with your dog’s in order to deepen your bond.


Look at your walking time with your dog as a time to be together, not as a time for you to multi-task.
You can also go running with your dog, if he likes doing this with you. Running and breathing in sync can really make you feel connected.

, He’ll love playing this game and will be rewarded with the treat once he finds it. You can tell him what a good boy he is for playing the game and for being so smart. If he can’t find the treat and starts to get frustrated, then let him have it so he doesn’t start resenting you or feeling like he can’t win the game.If you have just three spare minutes a day, that’s all you need to play this game. You can make this ritual a part of you and your dog’s bonding routine.

, Another way to bond with your dog is to play Frisbee with him. Take him out to a park or to your yard, if you have enough room, and spend at least 15 minutes tossing the Frisbee to your dog, letting him catch it in his mouth, and waiting for him to bring it back to you. This game can give both you and your dog a great workout and can make you feel even closer to each other.


You can make a ritual of it by taking your dog to a park every weekend, letting him know that this will be your “Frisbee time.”

, If Frisbee is too fancy for you and your dog, you can always play catch with him, whether you’re using a baseball or an old bone. Whatever treat or toy you’re using, make sure your dog really likes running after it and bringing it back to you. If he’s a puppy, you may have to spend some time teaching him to properly play.


Playing catch lets your dog see that your time together isn’t all about business, and that sometimes, you just need to have some good clean fun together.

, Another thing you can do to deepen your bond with your dog is to pet him with purpose. Don’t just pet your dog absentmindedly when you’re staring at your computer, talking to a family member, or watching TV. Let your dog see that you really care about him by petting him while looking him in the eyes and telling him he’s a good boy and making sure to give him a little love.You can even call him toward you to begin the petting session. Using his name as you pet him reinforces your bond with your dog.

, Another thing you can do to reinforce your bond with your dog is to let him pick out his favorite toy at the pet store. Take him to the store and give him a few minutes to explore the options and to pick the toy that he’s the most drawn to. Often, it won’t take very long for your dog to zero in on a new addition to his toy bin. Take the time to let him pick something out, buy the item for him, and then go home and play with it. This will show your dog how committed you are to his happiness.You don’t need to get him a new toy very often, either. This won’t necessarily help you bond, but taking the time to pick out the perfect toy every once in a while will strengthen your connection.

, Building a bond with your dog shouldn't be hard. Doing tricks with your dog teaches them new things.This can build your and the dogs self-esteem. Being a teacher to your dog can make them feel greatly about you.

, Feed your dog or give your dog water, this shows your dog you love him/her. Take them on a walk. Unless they are old, have leg/hip problems then this is fun for you and your dog. It gives you both exercise and can make you happy. Give them a bath. Even if your dog doesn't like it, it gets them use to you and builds trust.

, The best thing you can do to bond with your dog is really to spend some quality time with him. Just carving out the time to really pay attention to your dog and to give him the love that he so badly deserves is the best thing you can do to strengthen your bond. Though trying new activities to keep things interested and to keep your dog happy can make a difference, the important thing is that you’re spending time with your dog, whether you’re watching TV in bed together, going for a walk, or just hanging out in the yard.It can be hard to make time to be with your dog, especially if you have a demanding work or school schedule. Though giving your dog your full attention when you’re together is the best thing you can do, being around the home when he’s there while doing something else is better than nothing. If you can find a way to do some of the work or studying that you would normally do away from the house at home, your dog will appreciate it and will feel closer to you.

, Being consistent is just as important when you’re disciplining a child as it is when you’re trying to bond with your dog. If you want to develop a strong relationship with your dog, then you should make sure to be consistent in your words and deeds. If there’s a certain part of the house where your dog can never go, don’t forbid it one day and then him go there the next, when you’re too tired to enforce rules. If you give him love and snuggles and positive verbal reinforcement when he does something good, like go to the bathroom in the right place, then make sure you always do that so your dog doesn’t get confused about whether or not he’s doing something right.


Dogs love having a routine that they can follow so they can better understand the world as well as your relationship. Try to be as consistent as possible in everything you do, from giving him praise to trying to teach him a lesson.

, Another thing you can do to strengthen your bond with your dog and to give him the love he deserves is to be affectionate with him. Pet your dog, tell him he’s a good boy, scratch him behind his ears, or do whatever else you need to do to let him know that he’s really special and that you care about him. If you let him get in bed with you, then do that and snuggle up close to him, to let him see how much he means to you.You can be affectionate in your words as well as your actions. Tell your dog that he’s a good boy whenever he deserves it, and shower him with praise as well as snuggles. You may not think so, but your dog really will be able to tell the difference between your voice when you’re feeling upset and when you’re happy with him.
Be encouraging. When your dog is trying something new and fails, let him know that he’s a good boy and show him that he should try, try again.

, Though it may not be possible to always remain calm, especially if your dog has done something to really upset you, you should work on maintaining your cool while letting your dog know he’s misbehaved when he does something wrong. If you start yelling, losing your temper, or throwing things, then your dog will be scared of you and may feel like he can’t really trust you. If you feel yourself getting angry, take a deep breath, walk away, and return to your dog when you feel more calm.Dogs are very intuitive. They’ll be able to see that they’ve upset you and will feel bad about it even if you don’t yell or lose your temper.
Make sure to communicate clearly with your dog. Instead of getting emotional, tell him what he did and make your rules clear to him.

, If you want to deepen your bond with your dog, then you should be careful about your body language. You want to be approachable and non-threatening to your dog, and to make him feel as loved and as welcome as possible. You may not even realize that you are sending him negative signals without meaning to. If you want to have positive body language when you talk to your dog, here are some things you can work on:Get down on eye level with your dog when you talk or play with him as much as you can.
Maintain upright posture when you’re training your dog, so he knows you mean business.
Don’t hit your dog or point at him in a negative manner, or he’ll be scared of your hands.
If your dog is small, don’t tower over him or crowd him, or he’ll feel suffocated.
Don’t stare right into your dog’s eyes for more than a second or two. He may take this as a threat or a challenge.

, If you really want to be able to bond with your dog, then you should get to his personality. Dogs are just like people. Some are shy, some are more outgoing, some are mellow, and some are easily excitable. Get to know what your dog is like, from when he tends to get the most tired to what drives him crazy, whether it’s your neighbors, loud music, or a certain type of food. Taking the time to get to know your dog will help you strengthen your bond because you’ll feel more equipped to deal with him.If your dog is more outgoing, then you should spend time hanging out with other dogs and people. If he’s more shy and needs a while to warm up to people, then he won’t appreciate it if you try to introduce him to fifty of your friends at once.
Get to know your dog’s energy peaks and valleys too. If he’s more hyper in the mornings, make sure you get in a lot of activity then instead of forcing it in the evenings, when he will be more mellow and may just want to lie down.

, Most people don’t take the time to give their dogs a massage. Though it may sound silly, just spending 20 minutes once or twice a week giving your dog a nice, relaxing massage can help deepen your bond. Massage him as you would a human — behind the ears, on the neck, on his back, and anywhere that seems to make him feel good. Start off gently and deepen your massages if your dog seems to like it. This will be a great way for you to physically connect with your dog.Every dog is different. Some like to be massaged, while some may wrangle out of your grasp. Get a feel for what your dog likes as you try this new bonding activity. If he just prefers to be petted, then don’t force it and stick to that.

, If you work in a more hip office that lets you bring your dog to work, then take him to work with you once in a while, if you can swing it. Though you’ll have to tend to your dog a bit and may not be able to have him there the whole day, just taking the dog to your workplace can reinforce your bond in a completely new environment. Make an effort to incorporate your dog in other aspects of your life. If there’s a dog-friendly bar or restaurant in your neighborhood, bring your dog there once in a while, so you can have fun with your friends while letting your dog roam a bit.


Making the effort to take your dog out with you will help you bond because he’ll be happy that you don’t want him to be cooped up all day.
Plus, your dog may meet other dogs at these bars or restaurants that he may like to play with, so he’ll love the extra social time.

, If you have trained your dog well and think training competitions are the way to go, then another way for you and your dog to bond is for you to enter him in competitions. You can then spend more time grooming your dog, teaching him tricks, and traveling with your dog as well. Though this isn’t for everybody, if you’re committed to training your dog, this can be a great bonding activity.


Entering your dog in competitions will mean that you have to spend a lot of quality time with your dog. What could be better than that?

, Though it may sound silly and your dog won’t really know that he’s watching a dog on television, you can have a nice time watching a dog-themed movie with your dog. You can watch Lassie, Homeward Bound, Lady and the Tramp, or a number of other dog-themed flicks while hanging out with your favorite creature for a few hours. Pay attention to your dog while watching the movie and make sure to give him lots of affection, petting, and maybe even a few treats.


Setting aside some time to watch a movie with your dog will let you slow down and just hang out with your dog without creating a bunch of elaborate plans for your bonding time. Though activities are nice, so is just hanging out, the same as it is when you’re hanging out with people.

, Some nursing homes or hospitals have programs that allow you to bring in your dogs to help cheer up sick patients. Look into your neighborhood hospitals and nursing homes to see if you can bring your dog to one of these programs. This can be a great way for you and your dog to share the love with people in need and to bring joy to their lives. Your dog will love the social time and the attention and will appreciate the effort you’ve made to bring him to a new environment.


It’s a win-win situation. Not only will you be helping out your community, but you’ll be bonding with your dog in a new way.

, Another thing you can go to go above and beyond in your bond with your dog is to go on a road trip with him. You don’t have to go very far — just a weekend trip or a long drive to a lake or a park will do. Let your dog sit in the front or back seat, roll down the window, and let him feel the breeze on his face. Your dog will appreciate this special time you spend together and will love the freedom of the open road as well as the time you spend together.


Take the trip to a fun, dog-friendly destination like a park or a beach. Make the experience all about letting your dog roam free while having fun with you.

Speak in a calm and soft voice.,
Offer a treat, if you have permission.,
Repeat these positive interactions.",How to Get Along With an Abused or Unfriendly Dog3," Before you try to reach out and pet an unfriendly or abused dog, you need to give the dog a few moments to become used to you and sniff you. Keep your hands at your sides and do not maintain eye contact with the dog.When you are trying to get along with the dog, you want the dog to feel comfortable throughout the entire process.Back away and end the interaction if the dog ever begins to display signs of aggression.

, Once the dog has had an opportunity to become acclimated to your presence, you can hold out your hand for them to sniff. Dogs use scent to become acquainted with new people and to learn things about them.This will be very important in any future interactions with the dog, since they will remember and recognize your scent.


Move your hand out slowly. An abused dog may be hand shy, since they may associate human hands with being abused.

, Avoid petting the dog on the top of their heads, and try to pet their backs, or gently under their chins. If they move backwards and away from you, do not try to still touch them.Move your hand very slowly when you go to pet them and do not make any sudden movements. Be very gentle when you pet the dog and keep your hand relaxed rather than stiff.


Do not try to touch the dog if they do not seem receptive, interested in you, or show any signs of aggression. It may take a few interactions before the dog feels comfortable enough to let you touch them, especially if they have been physically abused., Keep your voice low and quiet while you are talking to the dog. You can say reassuring things like, “What a good puppy,” or “You’re being such a good girl.” These reassuring phrases can let the dog know that you are relaxed and calm, and that it is safe for them to continue interacting with you.Never raise your voice or yell at the dog. An abused dog may associate raised voices with the abuse they have suffered and become agitated or afraid. This is not the type of response you want to elicit, so avoid making loud noises.

A healthy relationship with the dog is built on mutual trust and respect for each other’s boundaries.


As the dog becomes more comfortable with you, you can try to engage in new ways. For example, once the dog is more comfortable, you could pet them on their head or try to play a game like fetch with them.

Give it a chance to get to know you and approach you first. Try sitting down on the floor, and letting the dog come over to you as it explores the room. Running up to it and grabbing can be scary for a pup.This step may be easier to do in a friend's house or in a breeder's home. However, shelters may also allow you to visit several times.
At a shelter, you might just sit near the dog's cage to let it get used to you.;
, Before you ever touch or even move towards the pup, give it a chance to smell you and explore you thoroughly. Once it's smelled you, try touching it lightly on the nose, just to get contact started.If you're at a shelter, sit outside the cage before letting it smell you. Reach out a hand near the cage so the dog can sniff you.

, If the dog seems interested, try petting it on the head. Show as much affection as the dog seems to enjoy. You can also talk to the dog in a calm, low voice. Continue petting the dog until it runs off.Stop petting the dog if it seems upset. If the dog is growling or running away from you, let the dog take a break.If you're at a shelter, ask an attendant to open the cage so you can try petting the dog.

, Don't expect to build up a bond with a puppy in one meeting. It takes time to start building a bond, so expect to visit several times before taking the dog home. Each time, you're going to need to let the dog get used to you again.For example, with a breeder, you could say, ""I'd like to spend some time with my pup before bringing it home. Do you mind if I visit a few times?"" You could say the same with a friend's house.
At a shelter, you may only have a chance to visit once or twice, since puppies tend to move out more quickly than older dogs. In other words, you may need to take it home sooner because the dog is at risk for being taken by another family.

, If your puppy is going to be a part of the family, it's good to bring the family along to one visit. Prepare your kids ahead of time by reminding them that a puppy is not a toy but a living, breathing animal that can be hurt. Also, teach them to let the puppy come to them, as you let it come to you.


At a shelter, let them sit outside the cage quietly, letting the dog get used to them and their smell before moving on to petting.

, Leaving a piece of clothing behind that you have worn will give the dog a chance to get familiar with your scent. You can even have other members of the family hold the piece of clothing to add their scent to it. If you have other pets, then make sure to rub the clothing on them as well. This is called a scent handshake and it is a good way to help a new dog get familiar with the scents of their new home.

You can also rub a piece of clothing on the puppy and bring it home for your other pets to sniff.This may help to make the transition easier when you bring the puppy home.

, During one of your visits with the puppy, ask if you can take them for a short leash walk. Doing this will be a good bonding opportunity for both of you and it will help to create a positive memory for the puppy. This may help to make bonding easier after you bring the puppy home., Each visit, shower the dog with affection as much as it will allow it. You want the dog to associate you with happy times, and affection generally equates to happiness for most dogs. Praise the dog, and call it by the name you've chosen to start the bonding process.That is, pet the dog if it will let you, and give it praise.

, If the dog is old enough to have treats, bring some with you to offer the dog. If the puppy isn't old enough yet but is starting to eat some solid food, you can try letting the dog lick some solid food off your fingers to help build trust.As the dog approaches you, either at the shelter or someone's home, offer the dog a treat. Continue offering treats throughout the time you're there, as the dog will come to associate you with positive things.
Be sure to ask if the treat is okay for the dog. Some dogs may not tolerate certain foods well or even be allergic to them.

, Watching how your pup behaves can help you create the right environment for it when you bring it home. If your pup is an explorer, you need to puppy-proof your home more thoroughly. If your pup is more reserved, you need to make sure the environment is quiet for it when you bring it home.For instance, if the dog hides in the corner when you visit and takes a great deal of coaxing to get it to come out, you may have a more reserved pup. If the pup bounds up to you every time, it may not need as quiet an environment.

, When you're ready to take your puppy home, make sure you spend some time getting to know the dog that day, too. Let the dog come up to you, and play with you. That way, the dog will feel more comfortable going home with you.That is, treat this visit like your other visits. Let the pup come to you, then pet it and praise it. Have a few treats ready to remind the pup that you're a friend.

, It is important to praise and reward the puppy with treats and play time to let them know they are doing good. For example, if your puppy goes potty outside, be sure to call him a “good dog” and pet him as well. If your puppy sits and waits patiently for his dinner, then praise him for the good behavior., Leaving your puppy alone for long periods of time can make him feel anxious, and puppies also have a harder time holding their bladders than adult dogs. Be sure to have someone who your puppy is comfortable with come by and check on them if you will be gone for more than a few hours. You might even consider hiring a dog sitter to come by and take your puppy for a midday walk or at least let them out and play with them for a little while., Once you've gotten the puppy home, give it room to explore and play. As it comes up to you to investigate, shower it with attention as you did when you visited it. The puppy will remember you, and gradually come to accept you as the giver of affection.That is, try not to approach it too much. Let the dog come to you, so it can get to know you better at home.

Listen to the pitch of the bark.",How to Decode Your Dog's Barks2," There is a big difference between the message being communicated by a short or a long bark. A short bark signals urgency, while a longer bark is less urgent.

For example, a dog that thinks there is an intruder coming into your home will bark very loudly to get your, and the intruder's, immediate attention.When judging the amplitude of your dog's bark, keep in mind that you are judging its strength only on your dog's usual barks and not the barks of other dogs. Is the bark you are assessing your dog's normal volume or is it loud and more persistent? This can tell you about how serious the dog thinks its message is.

, Pitch is another part of your dog's bark that can give you a lot of information. This aspect, however, can be harder to identify, so it may take you some time to be able to differentiate between a low and a high pitch, especially if you do not hear very well.A low pitch will usually indicate fear or aggression in a dog. This pitch signals strength and that a trespasser should fear the dog.
A high pitched bark signals excitement or joy.

Watch how your dog moves while it barks.,
Look for conditions that might be influencing your dog's barks.,
Take note of barks that signal specific bodily needs.",How to Decode Your Dog's Barks3," While barks alone can tell you a lot, looking at body language in combination with barks can tell you a lot more. If you are able to, look at your dog's body while it barks in order to make a better assessment.For example, a dog that is barking repeatedly and loudly may be excited or it may be guarding against someone or something. However, if you see that the dog is in a defensive stance and showing its teeth as well, then you know that it is guarding.

, If your dog is barking you should try to figure out what it is trying to communicate to you. If you understand the conditions that are prompting a specific bark, then you may be able to switch that around next time the dog does that bark and understand that it signals that condition.


For example, it may be telling you that someone is at the front door. If you can identify the specific bark your dog does when someone comes to the door, then the next time your dog does that bark you will know that someone is at your door.

, Barks can be very connected to what your dog wants or expects at certain times of day. If you know that your dog is barking for a specific reason, take the time to identify exactly how that bark sounds to that you can identify it in different circumstances.For example, if your dog needs to be let out to go to the bathroom every morning, pay attention to what that bark sounds like so that you can identify that same bark later.

Feed your dog on a routine.,
Take your dog to obedience training.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Stay calm.",How to Bond with a Needy Dog2," Instead of leaving food out all day, you may want to adopt a food schedule for your dog. Routine can help lessen anxiety for dogs, and allowing them to rely on your for food can strengthen the bond.Try to choose two to three times per day when you can easily feed your dog each day. This helps your dog expect food from you at the same time each day.

, Training your dog is a great way to bond with them, and can help you work on increasing your dog’s independence. Try taking your dog to obedience training classes, where you both can learn the basics of training.Make sure to be consistent with your training at home. This helps build routine and stability for your dog.
Avoid reinforcing negative behavior by giving your dog attention when they are doing bad things.

, Another way to bond with your needy dog but help develop independence is to use treats as positive reinforcement. You can increase your distance from your dog as you sit in your home by using treats to get them to stay at certain places in the room.You can also use treats when you leave. Give your dog a treat right before you leave. This helps them associate you leaving with positive things.
You can train your dog to realize you won’t be gone forever by leaving the house for short periods of time, then returning.

, Dealing with a needy dog can be very frustrating. You may want to yell or lash out because they are being too needy and annoying, but this is not the way to respond. Instead, keep your cool.Getting upset, yelling, or being angry will just cause your dog to freak out more and cause more anxiety.

Encourage the whole family to spend time with the dog.,
Be clear with commands.,
Avoid making a big deal out of leaving and arriving.,
Socialize your dog.,
Consult your vet.",How to Bond with a Needy Dog3," Needy dogs tend to have separation anxiety. Because of this, you should encourage your entire family to spend time with your dog. This helps reduce the risk that the dog will bond only with you.Other people can feed the dog, play with them, exercise them, and help with training.
Make sure you are not the only one showing your dog affection.

, One way to bond with your dog is through communication and training. Being consistent is especially important with a needy dog. Make sure you follow through with commands, and don’t confuse your dog by letting them get away with something one day and then punishing them the next.For example, your needy dog may try to get your attention by whining, barking, or acting out. Do not reward this behavior with attention. Instead, ignore them.
Only reward behavior you want to enforce in your dog.

, Needy dogs suffer from separation anxiety when you are not there. They get upset when you are not in the room, and worse when you leave the house. To help with this, try not to give your dog too much attention when you leave or when you return. Instead, act normally.You may even consider ignoring your dog when you leave or come back.

, Needy dogs need to lessen their attachment to you. To help with this, you can try to socialize them more. Take them to dog parks and let them play. Bring friends or family around and encourage them to interact with your dog. You may try just walking your dog around other people and dogs more often.Keep your dog on a leash around new people. If they act aggressive, try to socialize them more slowly.

, If you are unsure how to bond with your dog, you can talk to your vet. Your vet can give you tips on how to improve the relationship, and they can also check the dog over to make sure there are underlying medical problems.


Try saying, ""Dr. Harmon, Buddy seems to be having separation anxiety when I go to work. How can I help him stay calm?""

Get the owner’s permission to approach.,
Explore the immediate cause of unfriendliness.,
Approach in an arc.,
Keep your eyes averted.,
Get on the dog’s level.,
Be careful when patting.,
Go slowly.,
Offer treats.,
Ignore a timid dog.",How to Become Friends with an Unfriendly Dog1," If the owner is present, make sure to ask if it is okay to interact with their dog. Some dogs are being trained or are too fearful to be touched, so it is best to check first. If the dog is running unsupervised, then you must follow your judgement regarding to approach or to call an animal rescue for assistance.When speaking with the owner you might say, “What a cute dog! Is it alright if I pet him?”;
, When you first notice that the dog is behaving in an aggressive or standoffish way, look around you to identify possible external causes of this behavior. Are there lots of cars around which could cause anxiety? If you determine that you are the cause of the unfriendliness then you will need to approach with even more caution.At this point you might ask the owner (if there is one) for any tips about how to interact with their dog. They might suggest, for example, that you keep your distance for a bit.

, When you do decide to make friendly contact (whether for the first time or after multiple interactions) avoid coming at the dog head on. This places the two of you in a confrontational position and can heighten the dog’s defenses. Instead, come at the dog very slowly and slightly to the side, moving in a soft arc., Refrain from making direct eye contact when you interact with an unfriendly dog. Holding a dog’s eyes can be seen as a dominant move and can make them withdraw from socializing with you. Instead, flick your eyes up occasionally but generally keep them elsewhere. It might help to focus on the dog’s ear, for example.

, When you spend time with the dog try to do so at their level. Crouch down or bend down on your knees to face them. This puts you in an equal position with your potential canine friend. It lets the dog know that they have power as well, which takes away some of the pressure of these interactions and allows them to relax.Once you get into a crouching or seated position you lose much of your ability to retreat quickly. It is not advisable to assume this position if the dog is acting overtly aggressive.

, Once you are in position, slowly extend a single hand out, palm up for the dog to sniff and inspect. Leave your hand hovering in air within reach of the dog’s head. Do not immediately move to pet the dog. After the dog sniffs a bit you can then remove your hand and repeat the process.When the dog finally loosens up you can move your hand forward for a gentle pet. However, continue to avoid the facial area. This makes a dog feel vulnerable. Instead, gently rub their side or back.
If at any point in this process the dog bares its teeth, wrinkles its nose, or growls you should retreat and try again later.

, Whenever you are trying to befriend an unfriendly dog you must proceed methodically and slowly. You are on their timetable. If you try to rush the process the bond won’t be as deep and the dog might retreat back into aggression or shyness., If the dog’s owner has treats then ask if you can offer a few to their pet. If the dog is running solo and you have treats, then feel free to offer them as well (with caution). It is best to give an unfriendly dog treats in an indirect way. Toss a few treats to the ground in front of the dog while looking slightly away.If the dog begins to associate your presence with food, then you are making progress in the battle of bonding.

, Another option is to pretend that the dog is not there and go about your business as usual. You can do this for a brief time or you can act like this over several separate interactions before you build up to an attempt at petting. If the dog sniffs you, just stand still and let it happen. It is a good sign that they are curious about you."

Name your dog.,
Work on the basics.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Begin with a simple command.,
Work on more advanced commands over time.,
Practice again and again.",How to Encourage Your New Dog to Listen to You1," Part of getting a new dog to listen to you is to give it a name and teach your dog this new name. To begin, start by getting your dog’s attention through positive reinforcement. Say your dog’s name and then give it a treat. This will help your dog associate its name with a positive reward. After a few days of this, start transitioning from treats to praise so that the positive reinforcement is still there.When your dog is not paying attention and you say its name, it should turn toward you. In these situations, say “yes!” and give the dog a treat or praise.;
, Start small with basic commands and try to practice perfecting these. Don’t get too ambitious in the beginning. It may just confuse your dog and make it harder for your dog to listen to you in the future.Consider starting with the “sit” command. This is typically an easy one for new dogs to learn, and a good one to build on with other commands.

, Your dog will have a hard time learning to listen to you if there are too many other things happening around them. Try to work on training your dog in a quiet place where there are few distractions.Try working in a room away from the rest of your family. Or work in a quiet park or other outdoor space (like your backyard).

, Start with a basic “sit” command, by pressing firmly, but not super hard, on the dog's rear end. Say ""sit"" as you do this.After a couple of days of doing this, try it with a hand motion. If the dog doesn't listen, it doesn't know the word.
Eventually you will be able to make your dog sit without hand motions.

, Follow these steps again with more advanced commands. As your dog masters one task, move on to another one. This will keep your dog learning, listening to you, and looking to you for commands.For example, once your dog learns how to sit and you have practiced it repeatedly, start teaching your dog how to come. This new command will build on the old one.

, Don’t get lazy with your training. Be sure to stay on top of your training and practice it daily with your dog. Being consistent and doing things over and over will help your dog learn to listen to you more than anything.If you have certain rules or commands, make sure you stick to them all the time. For example, if you don’t want your dog to get on the bed, never let it get up there. Don’t get lazy one day or decide you want to cuddle with your dog and make an exception. This will only confuse your dog and make it wonder what you want and when to listen to you.

Know your dog’s history.,
Interact in a calming environment.,
Be patient at all times.,
Let your dog approach you first.,
Provide positive encouragement.,
Enjoy low-key activities.,
Participate in an obedience class.",How to Become Friends with an Unfriendly Dog2," Abuse or lack of socialization can help to create an unfriendly dog. It helps to gather as much information as you can about what your dog experienced in the past. This will allow you to bond with the dog while working on their trouble areas, but avoiding obvious behavioral overt triggers.For example, if your dog was physically abused by their previous owner (who was a man) then (if you are a man) you may face an even steeper uphill battle in building trust. Remind yourself of this and be even more patient when initiating touch with your dog.
If your dog is only unfriendly around food, for instance, then you might want to leave it alone at these times. Try to make bonding inroads during other moments.

, Some dogs are unfriendly because they are suffering from sensory overload. To minimize this and lower everyone’s stress, make your home as soothing and relaxing as possible. Keep the TV turned down low. Avoid blasting the radio. Try not to yell if you need something. Ask other members of your household to help out with this goal.Part of this will also push your dog’s “re-set” button and signal that this is a new environment requiring new types of interactions, as compared to their previous one.

, Your dog will likely make mistakes and these will be tests of your bond and your friendship. You must react patiently and calmly when your dog has a mishap. Offer a gentle but firm “No” and then move on., While you are interacting in your home leave your dog alone for the most part (at least until they start to shed their unfriendliness). Expect your dog to approach you at random moments to ‘check you out’ by sniffing. It is best to stand still at these times and let your dog complete the inspection.For this to work you truly will need to stand still. Don't make a movement. Don't try to pet your dog. Don't reach out.

, It is hard to be positive if your dog resists touch, but you can still be a supportive presence in their lives. Instead of offering a hug directly to them you might hug one of their toys before setting it down in front of them. Don’t be afraid to use treats as well. Most dogs respond positively to small pieces of chicken or other tidbits.You can gently toss the treat to the floor or you can place it in your open palm for your dog to take.

, Exercise can sometimes loosen up an unfriendly dog but it can also stimulate aggression in some cases. So, use caution and stick to low-key options for the best results. Take your dog on a long walk or hike. Play Frisbee in your backyard. Just lay around and watch the sun set., Learning new things together can bond you to your dog. However, you must keep the stakes low and make any classes that you take a laidback event. Finding and enrolling in a local obedience class is one way to possibly change your dog’s outlook. A Certified Dog Trainer can often craft unique activities that will highlight your dog’s unique strengths while working on their weaknesses.To find a good obedience class you can check your veterinarian or you can call your local pet store. You can also look online by typing in your city's name and ""obedience classes.""

Give positive reinforcement.,
Avoid negative reinforcement.,
Get your dog to stop chewing things.,
Encourage your dog to stop peeing in the house.",How to Encourage Your New Dog to Listen to You2," Once your dog starts responding to your commands as you want it to, be sure to reward your dog with something positive. Positive reinforcement reaffirms your dog’s behavior and makes it more likely that your dog will continue to listen to you in the future.You should begin the positive reinforcement with treats as you are training your dog, but eventually you should move to just praising your dog and petting it when it listens to you correctly.

, This kind of behavior modification relies on creating a relationship of fear and submission between you and your dog. You don’t want your dog to obey you simply because it is afraid of you and how you might react.


Behaviors to avoid include yelling, hitting, inflicting physical pain in any way, or punishing after the fact when the dog doesn’t know what it is being punished for.

, New dogs need to learn a lot of things before they can coexist with you in your home. This includes learning what kinds of things you want them to chew on and what types of things you don’t want them to chew on. Chewing is a normal activity for dogs, so be sure to provide them with plenty of bones and chew toys that you make clear they are allowed to chew.You should also try to doggie-proof your house by putting valuable items out of reach of the dog until you are sure it can control its chewing behavior.
Try to monitor your dog as much as possible so that you can help it learn what things you don’t want it to chew.
If all else fails, you can try spraying chew deterrents on things you don’t want your dog to chew on.

, If your new dog is having trouble with house training, try creating a smaller space for the dog inside. Dogs like to keep their personal areas clean, so they usually won’t have an accident if they are in a smaller space or a crate.You should try to keep your dog away from carpeted areas and rugs. Dogs are less likely to go to the bathroom on a hard surface.
Additionally, you should clean the area thoroughly if your dog has an accident in the house because they might smell their previous accident and think that this is now a place to use the bathroom. Cleaning the spot will make it less likely that your dog will go there again.

Build a bond with your dog.,
Release excess energy.,
Take your dog to the vet for regular checkups.",How to Encourage Your New Dog to Listen to You3," Your new dog will listen to you better once it feels comfortable with you. Make sure your dog is happy and satisfied in its new home. Play with it daily, give it a lot of attention and affection, and make sure to feed it regularly.You should feed an adult dog twice a day at the same time – once in the morning and once in the evening, according to your veterinarian’s instructions.

, A hyperactive dog has trouble following commands because they have too much energy that needs to be expelled. They can’t focus on listening to you as well if they are trying to deal with all of their pent up energy and excitement. If you want your dog to listen to you, give it plenty of exercise daily to help release the excess energy.Depending on the breed, you should try to take your dog for a walk for at least 30 minutes every day.
After your dog has had its walk or a good play session with you, it should be able to focus on training and listen more attentively.

, Keep your dog up-to-date with its vaccinations and yearly health checks to make sure it remains healthy. If the dog persistently has trouble following your commands, you may want to check with your vet that there are no problems affecting your dog, such as a problem with hearing.When you get a new dog, you should take it to the vet within the first few weeks to make sure its vaccinations are current and that there are no obvious medical issues that need to be addressed.

Respect your dog’s space.,
Stick to consistent rules and routines.,
Calm your dog without coddling them.,
Make your dog comfortable with your other pets.,
Keep your dog comfortable around your kids.",How to Bond with a Shy Dog1," Provide your dog with a comfortable bed and place it in a quiet area of your home. If you’ve just brought a new dog home, allow them to hide, withdraw to their bed, and explore their surroundings at their own pace.Try to avoid any coercion or negative experiences with a newly adopted shy dog. Give them some time to settle in and, over the course of the first several days, try to work on developing your new routine together.;
, In general, living without a set routine is stressful for dogs, making them prone to shy or stressed behavior and less open to bonding. Try to offer meals, walks, and other activities around the same times every day. If you’ve just adopted a shy dog, make developing a regular routine your first priority.Consistent rules, like routines, will also help your shy dog become more open to bonding. If you don’t want your dog on furniture, don’t make an exception one moment then yell at them the next. Try to be consistent about your house rules and avoid making any exceptions.

, Your breathing offers your dog interpretive cues and helps set the tone for their behavior. Try to breathe deeply from your belly when your dog exhibits shy or stressed behavior.Yawning for a couple minutes when your dog is nervous is also a helpful calming technique.
Show them that you’re a calming presence, but avoid petting, picking them up, and other forms of coddling when the dog is shy or fearful. Coddling will only encourage future shyness or fear., If you're introducing your shy dog to your other pets, be gradual and let animals get to know each other at their own pace. After introductions, be sure to give equal amounts of attention to your pets, as coddling your shy dog or showing preference for another pet can cause dominance rivalries.Be sure to use treats to reward your shy dog when they act socially or calmly around your other pets. Avoid forcing them to interact with your other pets if they resist.

, Talk to your children about respecting the dog's space. Show them how to allow the dog to sniff their hand and to gently pet the dog's back instead of grabbing and overwhelming the dog. Have them offer the dog a treat and, if the dog knows command words, have them tell the dog to sit or stay."

If the owner gives you special instructions that differ to the ones told here, follow them. If the owner lets you pet the dog, ask the owner where the dog likes to be petted.;
, If you see a dog with no owner loose on the street, proceed carefully and stay in position to defend yourself if necessary. Dogs chained up or left in a yard or other location with limited space may be more likely to bite, as are dogs eating or chewing on something. Approach these dogs with caution, and abandon attempts to pet them at any sign of aggression, as described below.

, Signs of aggression include growling, barking, a tail standing straight up, raised hackles, growling, or a body held in a rigid position. Signs of discomfort, fear, or anxiety include lip licking, showing the whites of the dog's eyes, avoiding eye contact, holding the tail low, yawning, or pulling the ears back.If the dog does not calm down or approach you within thirty seconds, abandon the attempt.

, Invite the dog to take the first step by squatting down closer to their level. More confident dogs only require bending over slightly, but don't bend directly over the dog, as this could make them feel threatened.


Never squat down near a dog without an owner, or a dog that is acting aggressive (see the signs listed above). Remain standing to defend yourself in case the dog attacks.

, If squatting down still hasn't attracted the dog, and it is acting shy or skittish (running away or hiding), look away since eye contact can be threatening.Make gentle, quiet coaxing noises; it doesn't matter what these are but avoid loud noises or noises that seem to startle the dog. Turn your body to one side to appear smaller and less threatening.


Ask the owner for the dog's name and use it to coax the dog. Some dogs have been trained to respond to the sound of their name.

, If the dog seems receptive to petting after these steps, or at least appears relaxed and shows no signs of aggression or discomfort, offer your fist for it to investigate. Hold the fist out towards its nose, but not directly against its face. Let the dog approach and sniff the back of your hand for as long as it likes.


Do not offer your open hand, as an unfamiliar dog may bite your fingers.
The dog sniffing you is evaluating you, not asking to be pet. Wait until the dog is done sniffing before moving on.

, If the dog's muscles are loose (not stiff or tense), or if it makes brief eye contact, or if it wags its tail, it is probably comfortable with you.Move on to the next section, but stop petting and offer your stationary fist again if it tries to move away.

, If the dog still shows no sign of aggression, slowly stroke or gently scratch the base of the dog's ears. Approach from the side of the dog's head, not from above its face., If you have been successful up to this point, and the dog isn't trying to shy away, continue to other areas. You may move your hand across the back, or move it to the crown, and gently scratch there with your fingers.


Many dogs enjoy being scratched at the top of their back, on either side of the spine. The front end near the neck and shoulders has a lower chance of making the dog anxious than the back end near the tail and hind legs.
Friendly dogs may enjoy being pet under the chin or on the chest, but others dislike strangers reaching near their jaw.

, Be aware that some dogs are ""head-shy"" and do not like being petted on top of the head. Some dogs dislike having their hind-ends petted, or dislike other areas being touched. Any growl, tail down or sudden moves should signal that you need to stop what you are doing immediately and stand still. If the dog calms down again and moves towards you, continue petting in a different spot.

, Don't scratch suddenly or vigorously, don't pat or slap its sides, and don't move rapidly to a different area. If the dog enjoys an area being pet, you may move from stroking to light scratching, or from one hand to two hands. Keep it gentle, though, as you don't know how this unfamiliar dog may react to more energetic pets. Fast or vigorous petting can make even a friendly dog overexcited, and cause it to jump or snap at your hands.

, As you get to know a dog, find out which types of petting it enjoys most. Some dogs like belly rubs, while some like their legs massaged. Others will growl if you get near these areas. Pay attention to the dog's body language and concentrate on areas it enjoys most. A wagging tail, relaxed muscles, and whining when you stop and move away are signs that the dog is enjoying the petting. Drooling can be a sign of excitement, although this doesn't always mean the dog is relaxed., When a dog is lying on its back, it may be scared and trying to appease you, not asking for pets. Even a friendly dog that enjoys belly rubs might sometimes be performing this action for another reason. Don't rub the dog's belly if it appears nervous, tense, or unhappy.

, Dogs are often nervous around children, even ones they've grown up with, because children can be clumsy during petting. Make sure any children in the house know not to hug, grab, or kiss the dog, as these actions performed too clumsily can stress the dog or even cause it to bite the child. Teach children never to pull on a dog's tail or throw objects at the dog.

, Every so often, take 10 or 15 minutes to rub a familiar dog from head to tail. Use a circular motion to cover the dog's face, under the chin, and chest. Move on to the top of the neck, the shoulders, and back all the way to tail. Some dogs may let you massage down each of its legs.Besides giving the dog an enjoyable massage, this will help you keep track of which ""bumps"" are normal and always present, and which are newly developed and could be signs of health problems.

, Some dogs may not let you touch their paws, but if you can safely pick up the paws, gently rub them to improve circulation and locate grit or sharp objects causing the dog pain. If the pads of the paws appear cracked and dry, ask a veterinarian for a moisturizer suitable for dogs and rub that on your dog's feet.Massaging puppies on the feet can make later nail trimming much easier, as the puppies get used to having their feet touched.

, Young puppies may let you massage their mouth and feet if they know you well. Mouth massages often feel great for a teething puppy, and help the puppy get used to being handled here. This can make later dental work much easier.To massage a puppy's mouth, gently rub the cheeks and jaw in a circular pattern. To massage its gums as well, use a ""finger toothbrush"" from a pet store or vet office."

Assess the situation.,
Call local animal control authorities.,
Find a treat or something to attract the dog.,
Turn sideways and kneel down.,
Make calming sounds and movements to soothe the animal.,
Confine the dog in a crate or small space.,
Locate identifying information about the dog.",How to Approach an Unfamiliar Dog1," Look around and make sure that the dog is actually unattended and not just running around without its leash while its owner waits to the side. Pay attention to the dog’s demeanor: if the animal appears openly aggressive, do not attempt to approach it. You can keep an eye on it from afar while waiting for animal control authorities, but take no further measures.If you’re in the car, make sure you can pull over safely. No matter how frightened a stray dog looks, causing a traffic accident won’t help them out.;
, Even if you’re confident that you can capture the stray dog, you should try to call local authorities first to see if they can come handle the situation in a timely manner. These officials will have special equipment and training in order to bring the animal in safely, so they’re always the better option for this scenario.


In a big metropolitan area like Chicago, there are hotlines and special impounds set up for this event, so check online listings for the appropriate numbers to call.If you’re in a more rural area, you might need to call the local sheriff or police office to get connected to the proper resource., If you can’t get a hold of animal control authorities and the dog appears reasonably docile, you can try to make contact with the dog yourself. The best way to do this is to get the dog to approach you and not the other way around, so feel free to use some food to appeal to the animal. If you’re in the car, see if you have any food stashed away which you could offer to the stray.Anything with a crinkly bag like potato chips will be particularly useful to get the dog’s attention to and encourage them to come over to you., When the stray comes nearer, get down on your knees and turn sideways to appear more welcoming.By observing this canine etiquette, you can begin building trust between you and the frightened animal. If you found any food to lure the animal, you can drop some on the ground and act like you’re picking it up or eating it.

, You can gain further trust from the stray dog by using body language and sounds that dogs understand. In addition to averting your eyes and kneeling down, you can speak in a low, slow manner, lick your lips, and yawn exaggeratedly.Dogs use this gesture to calm themselves down, and they understand it in others as a sign of friendliness and reassurance.

, Once you’ve managed to make safe contact with the animal, put it in a crate, your car, or other barricaded area where it can stay until you take the next step in the process. Make sure it has food and water so that you keep building its trust.


Don’t worry too much if the dog paces anxiously or whines for some time after it is penned up. This is natural behavior and should subside once the dog understands it is safe where it is., Once you’ve captured the stray, your next step is to find out how to return it to its proper home. Or, if it turns out to be a feral dog, you want to help find it a new home. The easiest way to identify a dog is through an ID pendant on its collar. Call the number on this tag and see if you can meet the owner to return their pet.


If the animal does not have a collar or ID tag, you should check to see if the dog has a microchip implanted under their skin around their shoulders. Your local shelter or veterinary clinic should be able to scan for a microchip and give you any identifying information it yields."

It's possible that you haven't done anything wrong to provoke this reaction from a dog; sometimes dogs are fearful of humans because they need to be in order to survive.


Some dogs are fearful around humans because of previous or ongoing abuse. It's possible a fearful dog you encounter is hurt, and is acting aggressively so that he does not appear weak and vulnerable.NEVER approach an injured animal that you do not know. It is very likely that the animal may perceive you as a threat and attack to defend itself.;
, A frightened dog may tense up his body, and raise his hackles (the row of hair along the dog's back). If a dog you are approaching turns suddenly, locks his body into a firm position, and has raised hair on its back, it's best to stop where you are and let the dog see that you are not a threat to him., A dog that feels threatened will often stare an approaching person in the eyes. It's a way of asserting dominance and letting you know that he feels threatened by your presence. Any time a frightened dog stares at you, you should avert your eyes to show the dog that you are respecting his boundaries., Bared teeth and growling are two of the biggest tell-tale signs that a dog feels threatened or uneasy, and may attack if you proceed.Growling does not necessarily mean that the dog will attack you, but it does mean that he may attack if you continue to make him feel threatened., It's possible that you are the cause of a frightened dog's anxiety. But it could also be that the dog is bothered by something in his immediate environment, and your presence is not a factor in his fear.Always assume that you might be the stimulus that is causing a dog to feel frightened or nervous, especially if it is not a pet you are familiar with.

, If it's a dog you know and encounter regularly, you may observe multiple situations or stimuli that seem to upset the dog. Understanding what triggers this response can help you avoid those triggers, or expose the dog to those triggers in a controlled environment.If you know the dog, scan your surroundings for things that might be upsetting the animal. Things that we take for granted, like a certain sound, a foreign object in the yard or house, or a new and unfamiliar odor, could cause a dog to act fearful or nervous.If the dog belongs to you or someone you know and you suspect that an environmental change is the reason the dog is upset (a vacuum cleaner, for example, or a new piece of furniture), expose the dog to that new element in short, controlled sessions. Allow the dog to become familiar with that object and to recognize, in his own time, that the object is not a threat.Examine the dog for injuries from a safe distance. Do not force close contact. Take note of whether the dog is limping or hiding one side from you, keeping his ears flat against his head, excessively licking an injured area, or whimpering., Approaching carefully, and knowing when to back away, are crucial for a successful interaction with a shy or frightened dog. Remember that if the dog does not know you, he may perceive you as a threat., Animals pick up on body language much more sharply than humans do. If a dog is shy or fearful, especially a dog you do not know, managing your own body language may be the most important thing you can do to calm and reassure a frightened dog.Never approach a frightened dog head-on or stare at it. Approach from the side, looking at him with your peripheral vision, so that the dog does not think you are approaching him with malicious intentions.Walk slowly around a frightened dog. If you rush towards him, or even appear to be rushing towards him, he may view you as a threat.It's best to crouch down while still a safe distance away, making yourself appear smaller and less intimidating. Keep your side to the dog, even while crouching, and take caution not to appear as though you are ""looming"" over him.Do not reach out to the dog. Hold out your open hand from a safe distance, and allow the dog to choose whether or not he wants to approach you.If the dog has an owner nearby, always ask the owner's permission before approaching the dog, and wait for the owner's response., Move slowly around the dog, and verbally praise him if he appears to be willing to approach you. This will let the dog know that you respect his boundaries, but are willing to offer him praise and kindness if he is willing to get closer.Speak softly. Never raise your voice around a frightened animal., Every dog has a ""safety zone,"" an area around him which he will not allow strangers to enter if they could pose a threat. Remain a safe distance away, and do not approach the dog or enter his safety zone if he is showing signs of frightened aggression.There is no absolute when it comes to a dog's safety zone. Every dog is different. Cautious trial and error is the only way to determine a dog's boundaries., If you or someone you know owns the dog, consider offering treats to the dog as a reward for behaving calmly around you. Praise him every time he comes up to you without hesitation, and offer him a treat, if it's okay with his owner.This should only be done if you know the dog and are certain he does not have food aggression issues. Offering food to a dog with these issues could provoke further aggressive behavior.

, If you believe you've found a dog that may be lost or injured, the best thing to do is to call animal control. In rural areas without an autonomous animal control department, you should call the police.Give your contact information to the animal control or police dispatcher, so they know how to contact you in case of any further developments.Give the dispatcher your precise location so that the responders can locate you easily.Ask for a time estimate on when someone will arrive. If it will be a long time, the dispatcher may ask you to remain near the dog, or to follow and observe him from a safe distance., There are a number of reasons why a dog may be excessively shy around people.


Some dogs are frightened or shy around people because they were not properly socialized as puppies.Some dogs are simply prone to anxious behavior, and will always be shy around people for no real reason., If your dog is shy whenever he meets new people, expose him gradually, but make sure that he is having exposure.


If your dog clings to you whenever other people are around, try to ignore his pleas for attention. Eventually your dog will realize that he will not be rewarded with attention or affection until he is willing to interact with other people., Some dogs are shy because they never learned how to interact with people. If your dog is shy of humans but gets along well with other dogs, try having your shy dog spend time with a more social dog. Your dog may, over time, learn from his canine companion how to behave around humans., Once the dog has shown some progress in being around other people, have someone he is becoming more comfortable around offer him food. This should only be done with dogs that do not exhibit signs of food aggression, for the safety of all parties involved.Have the person crouch low or sit on the floor.
While avoiding eye contact, have the person hold out the dog's bowl with food in it.
Do not force the dog to come eat; let the dog come when he is ready.

, Reward your dog with treats and verbal praise every time he comes out of his shell enough to interact with other people. Rewards should be given immediately, to help establish the reward as being related to his behavior."

Pay attention to body placement.,
Watch the teeth and eyes.,
Look the dog’s tail.,
Consult with a veterinarian.",How to Become Friends with an Unfriendly Dog3," If the dog that you are interacting with starts to crouch down, as if preparing for an attack, then you need to back off immediately. Or, if the dog is behaving loosely and then stiffens suddenly it is possible that they will respond aggressively as well. Lowering their head or moving around behind you for a better angle are also negative signs., A dog that is pushed beyond its limits will most likely start to growl and bare its teeth. This is a warning that often comes immediately before a biting move if left unheeded. You will also see the dog attempt to make and hold direct eye contact with you. Break this contact while keeping a close watch on the canine., A happy, friendly dog will usually be wagging his tail and wiggling overall. The tail moving in big, uncontrolled circles is generally a positive sign. If the dog starts to position their tail in a more stiff way this is a sign of building tension. The tail might still be moving or “wagging” but this is a movement borne of agitation and not a friendly wag., If you’ve been working with your dog and just can’t seem to break that bonding barrier then it may be time to talk with your vet. They can suggest some behavioral tricks that may help you. They can also look into possible medical causes for any persistent unfriendliness. Your dog may be in pain due to a seizure disorder or other condition and this could be the root cause of the problems.Even a change of diet has been shown to lessen the anxiety in some dogs, leading to a more positive experience for their owners.

Avoid forcing your dog to face their fears.,
Start teaching basic commands.,
Train your dog not to shy away from petting.,
Consider obedience or agility training classes.",How to Bond with a Shy Dog2," Coercion is counterproductive to a lasting bond with your shy dog, especially when you’re just getting to know each other. Whether your dog is shy around you, other people, or loud sounds, try to minimize their encounters with whatever intimidates them.Rather than force them to confront a scary stimulus head on, gradually introduce your dog to whatever triggers their shyness. Use rewards to build their confidence and teach them to associate their triggers with positivity.
For example, if your dog is shy around kids, avoid taking them to your nephew's birthday party. Instead, start with having them interact with only one child for a short amount of time. Instruct the child about how to calmly interact with the dog without pulling their fur or petting them roughly. Have the child offer the dog a treat to teach them that kids can be a positive interaction.

, Teaching your dog commands and other forms of training are effective ways of boosting your shy dog’s confidence. Use positive, reward-based training techniques to build your dog’s self esteem and encourage them to trust you.Train for very short periods of time, but train very often.


Begin with a basic command such as sit. Hold a treat over your dog's nose and move the treat backwards, over their head, to lure them into the sitting position. As the dog's butt hits the ground, say the cue word ""Sit"" and give them the treat. Practice this several times or for a few minutes, but stop before the dog gets bored.

, If your dog doesn’t tolerate being touched, sit calmly on the floor with a treat in one hand and your other extended. Consider rubbing the treat on the hand you extend so it smells extra appealing to the dog. Say “Come,” and give your dog time to approach your hand.


When the dog comes near you to smell your hand, give them the treat and say “Yes!” with encouragement. Repeat the sequence, eventually withholding giving the dog the treat until they make actual nose contact with your hand.
If your dog responds well to the “come” command and becomes less shy around you, use similar strategies to encourage them to accept petting and being handled., Whether or not you run into trouble with training on your own, think about enrolling your dog in a training class. A professional trainer can teach you bonding techniques first hand and help develop a confidence-boosting program for your individual dog. Ask dog-owning friends and family or your dog’s vet for a referral to a local certified trainer.Group classes can benefit some dogs that are shy around other people or animals, but consult with the trainer to be sure. A large group might prove to be counterproductive for your individual dog.
Agility and obstacle courses are also effective ways of building a dog’s confidence. Ask your dog’s vet for a referral to an agility trainer or search online for one in your area.

Observe your dog and note their triggers.,
Use treats to help your dog gradually overcome triggers.,
Get your dog to bond with other members of your household.,
Get help from a friendly dog.",How to Bond with a Shy Dog3," Keeping a journal can help you understand what exactly intimidates your dog, especially if they cling to you but resist encounters with other people or animals. Jot down as many details as possible whenever your dog appears shy, fearful, or stressed.Note physical descriptions of people involved, any interactions involved, the time of day, what the dog ate, and how much exercise they had that day.
For example, keeping a record of shy behavior might help you determine that your dog is shy around people with beards, is afraid of children, doesn’t like strangers, or is less likely to be anxious after it’s had enough daily exercise. This information can then help you develop strategies for dealing with specific triggers.

, Once you’ve identified a specific trigger, expose your dog to a less intense version of it. Use gradual, reward-based desensitization training to ease their shyness.For example, if the busy streets in your neighborhood stress your dog, consider playing a recording with traffic sounds on low volume inside your home. Practice command words or play a game with your dog to build a positive association with traffic sounds.
If your dog is shy around other dogs, think of any friends or family you might have with a small, calm dog. Bring the two dogs within visual range, but consider separating them using a baby gate. Ignore your dog if they bark at the other dog, and calmly get the other dog out of sight if your dog doesn’t calm after several minutes. If they do quiet down, offer a food treat as soon as they become calm to create a positive association.

, If your dog is shy around other members of your household, have that person feed and walk your dog. If your dog depends on you for comfort and confidence, try to withhold giving the dog attention while you’re acclimating them to the person that intimidates them. The dog will gradually build new positive associations with the person who used to make them shy.Try to take note if the intimidating person has a booming voice, is a rough handler, or does anything else that might make your dog shy. Tell the person, “I think there’s a chance the dog gets scared around loud noises. Maybe you could try speaking a little softer.”

, If your dog is shy around you and other people but likes other dogs, schedule a playdate with a friend or family member’s social dog. Seeing another dog comfortably play around you and the other dog's owner can help encourage your dog to overcome their shyness.If they’ve never met before, introduce the two dogs slowly, and consider first offering them objects that smell like the other dog before letting them make visual contact.

Ask the owner of the dog for permission to pet it.,
Slowly approach the dog.,
Let the dog take the last few steps.,
Extend your arm slowly and keep your hand relaxed.,
Allow the dog to sniff your hand and arm.,
Don't stare into the dog’s eyes.,
Stroke the dog’s ears or neck.,
Watch for signs that the dog is agitated or wants to leave.",How to Approach an Unfamiliar Dog2," Not all dogs are friendly: some are skittish around strangers, some are highly protective of their owners, and some are just plain cranky. The dog’s owner will know about their dog’s habits, so have them let you know what to expect. If the dog isn’t accompanied by an owner, stay away.Even if the dog approaches you and looks eager for your attentions, don’t extend your hand or lean forward before you get an answer from the owner.
Be especially careful if you have any children with you. For many different reasons—for example, their diminutive stature, unpredictable behavior, voice volume, and eagerness—some dogs are particularly hostile to children, so make sure you keep your children close when they spot a dog nearby. Make sure they don’t run up to the dog without warning, and always ask the owner how the dog responds to children specifically.

, With the owner's permission to pet the dog, walk over at a moderate pace from a slight angle. Canine etiquette perceives head-on approaches as disrespectful or potentially challenging, so keep this in mind when approaching from afar. You also want to keep your pace slow and manner staid in order reassure the dog that it can watch you approach and that you won’t make any sudden movements.Pay attention to the dog’s response to your approach and stop if it looks unwelcoming or shies away., If a dog is interested in becoming acquainted, it will meet you halfway. You can turn sideways and avert your eyes while it walks up to you in order to give further signs that you’re following canine guidelines of politeness., Once the dog has come up to you, you can reach out to the dog.This will signal to the animal that you are friendly and not threatening.


There are varying theories regarding the appropriate way to hold or position your hand. Some experts claim that one should clench the hand into a fist so that it appears smaller than an extended hand, while others claim that the hand should be extended with the palm facing upward or downward.In the face of conflicting advice, the best rule of thumb is to extend your hand with the palm down and fingers curled under, as it will protect your fingers from getting nipped., Holding your hand steadily beneath the dog's nose will let the dog get used to your scent. This is essential for a dog when meeting someone unfamiliar because they rely on their sense of smell in the way that humans relay on their eyesight., Unfamiliar dogs can take prolonged eye contact as a threat or challenge, so you should keep your eyes averted until you become comfortable with one another.Also be sure not to hunch or bend over the dog, as this can make it seem like you’re cornering the dog and thus presenting a threat., Use a light touch so that you don’t seem overly forward or abrupt. Stay away from touching vulnerable areas like the flanks and legs, as this can cause the dog to instinctively lash out to protect itself from a perceived threat.Once the dog feels more comfortable and shows that it wants further contact, you can scratch under its chin or on its back.

, There are many ways a dog can signal that it feels uncomfortable or that it simply wants to cease contact, many of which are fairly obvious and easy to detect. Some overt signals of agitation or anxiety include growling, barking, and pacing.A dog can also show their discomfort in more subtle ways, though, so keep an eye out for these signs as well. For example, a dog holding its tail high, looking into your eyes, or yawning can mean that the dog is warning you off or trying to calm its anxiety.If a dog shows signs of aggression or hostility, don't turn your back on the dog, as this will just encourage it to chase and attack. Rather, slowly back away from the dog until it visibly relaxes and you can turn around and walk normally away."

Consider what your new dog has been through.,
Give your dog plenty of treats.,
Kneel down to the dog’s level.,
Take your new dog for a walk.,
Speak in a low, soothing voice.,
Give your dog space.,
Keep it low-key.,
Introduce your dog to family and friends.",How to Approach an Unfamiliar Dog3," Whether you’ve adopted a dog from a shelter or bought a puppy from a breeder or pet store, chances are your new friend has gone through quite a bit of stress in the relocation process. Take a minute to think about what it’s been like for your dog, and it will help you figure out how best to act and get acquainted.It can help to ask a shelter or store employee for any relevant background that may help you in the transition period. For example, you should know if your dog was abused by children in its past home, or if it lived on the streets for awhile before being brought to the shelter.

, While you’re still at the shelter or pet store, you can begin giving your new dog treats. Hand them over when the dog gets close to you and when they get in the car to go to their new home. This will show them that they get rewarded for positive behavior, and that you are a friendly, generous provider.All treats are not created equal, so check out the ingredient list of the treats before you start feeding them to your dog. Look for whole food and organic ingredients, as well as a protein as the top ingredient in the list before any carbohydrate or meal filler., It will help to earn your dog’s trust by getting down to the dog’s level during your first interactions, as it lets you and the dog inhabit the same space without being confrontational.Avert your eye contact and keep your touches respectful and light until you get comfortable roughhousing with each other.

, One of the best ways to get acquainted with a new dog is to take them for a walk, so you should do this before you even enter your new home. This will tire the dog out and make them less energetic when entering your household, as well as help the two of you open lines of communication and begin to build trust.Make sure that your leash and collar fit your dog properly and don’t chafe uncomfortably. You also may want to avoid long or retractable leashes until you and your dog are used to one another and know each other’s habits.

, Your new dog will respond much more positively if you make sure that your tone of voice is friendly and calming. Even if you’re stressed or feeling a bit frazzled, be sure not to shout, scream, or bark orders, as this will agitate the dog and make it feel on edge with you.Be particularly careful with sudden noises and shouts which would alarm the dog while it’s doing something else. Just one shock while chewing on a toy or entering a crate can make the dog associate that particular action or place with fear, so it’s important to keep your volume controlled., Getting acquainted with you and moving to your home causes a lot of stress for your dog, so you should let them move in at their own pace. Have a comfortable bed or crate set up in a quiet place in your home so that your dog can withdraw whenever they want and have some quiet, alone time., In addition to having a quiet, solitary space for them to sleep and rest, you should also maintain a calm atmosphere in the household while the dog gets acclimated. If you usually have a lot of friends over or loud music playing, hold off on these habits for the first few days.As children are generally noisier and rowdier than adults, they should be particularly well supervised if living in the home where you’ve brought a new dog. Try to keep their interactions with the dog limited until they become well acquainted.

, After a day or so, you can start introducing your new family member to other family and friends. It’s important to do this early on, so that the dog comes to know their presence as customary and familiar.Carry out introductions one at a time, though, so that your new housemate doesn't feel overwhelmed by all the new contact and personalities.


This is particularly important if your new dog belongs to a breed which is typically territorial. While these dogs are often aggressive later in life when new people are brought into the home, this behavior can be avoided by introducing the dog to these people early in life or soon after adoption.

Be consistent.,
Introduce new things slowly.,
Avoid getting angry with your dog.,
Focus on small tasks.,
Show your dog exactly what you want.",How to Be Patient with Your Dog1," Losing patience with your dog can cause them to be confused. Your dog may not know what you want or how you will react if they do something. By being consistently patient, you help keep your dog from getting confused.For example, if you are patient one day while doing something with them, but then yell and get frustrated the next day, the dog will be confused and not know how to act.;
, Dogs don’t always accept change easily. Sometimes they are resistant to new things or new commands. Don’t give up or get frustrated. Instead, introduce new things slowly. This can help get your dog adjusted to the new item or command.For example, if you want your dog to wear a collar, let the dog wear it for a few minutes if they resist it. If your dog doesn’t like you brushing their teeth, rub your finger along their teeth for a few seconds. After they get used to wearing the collar or having you rub their teeth, you can let them continue the activity longer.
Just remember, your dog may not adjust overnight. Be patient and after a few weeks, your dog will be more accommodating.

, Dogs mostly want to do what their owners want them to do. However, they don’t automatically know what that is. You have to help your dog learn what they are expected to do. Since this takes time, you need to be patient as your dog figures out what you want from it.Don’t get mad if your dog does something wrong. Instead, calmly correct the behavior to help show the dog what is expected. Being patient helps your dog understand what you want from them instead of yelling at them or getting mad.

, Another way to help you remain patient with your dog is to keep the tasks you are working on small. You may also want to work on one thing at a time. This keeps you from trying to do too much, which can frustrate you. Sticking with short tasks or lessons helps you see improvement instead of just reasons to get frustrated.For example, don’t try to house train your dog while teaching them to sit and stay off the furniture. Instead, work on all these things separately.

, To teach your dog anything, you need to show them exactly what you want. This takes a lot of patience on your part. You may have to put your dog in a specific position, correct a behavior, or give them a treat when they do the right thing.Taking the time to show your dog exactly what you want makes it clear for them.

There will be plenty of things it does that will make sense to you without explanation. Just as every person is unique, so is your dog.


Be aware that much of a dog's language or communication techniques are subtle.
By learning canine communication, you will be able to respond to any problems your dog expresses before a situation escalates. Not noticing small signs of stress or unhappiness can soon lean to more aggressive or distressed behaviors.
Remember that this is a two-way learning process. Dogs have to learn our behavioral cues as well, and you should be careful about your own gestures and posture. Dogs also do not understand English. It is important that you teach your dog what you mean by ""no"" or ""sit"". Just saying ""sit"" over and over again won't make him learn it, and will make him think it's just part of the random nonsense you say during the day. Luring your dog into a sit position and then rewarding them heavily for doing that task will make him eager to sit, and then saying the word as he sits will make him connect the dots that the word ""sit"" means ""put your butt on the floor"".
Note that a dog's ability to signal may be hampered by the breed in question. For example, if your dog has squat ears or a docked tail, some of the signals may not apply to him/her.;
, Consider how you feel when someone stares at you directly rather than using normal eye contact. Just as you find it confronting, dogs also feel confused and threatened by direct head-on staring because it is a threat stance for them. A dog that looks away in this situation is actually being polite and is seeking to avoid confrontation. Alternately, training your dog to make eye contact to communicate is extremely helpful for keeping his focus on you. The most effective forms of dog training are positive reinforcement and clicker training. These are the most consistently proven type of training shown by scientists, veterinarians and animal behaviorists. Punishment is frowned upon because it is proven that dogs have very short memories, and likely do not connect situations like them pooping on the floor to your dissatisfaction. In fact, dogs do not feel guilt. Their owners simply stop being as mad when they ""look guilty"" and it becomes rewarding for both the owner and dog for the dog to offer signs of ""guilt"". The dog learns you dislike it when poop is on the floor and when you come home, they ""act guilty"" in order to appease you. They do not in fact relate their action of pooping to you being mad.






Clicker training is the idea is to lure your dog into a position and indicate instantly they have done the right thing, and reward them for that behavior.
Dog behavior is driven by the most rewarding or least punishing option they have in every situation. If the most rewarding option is to chew on your shoes, they will do so. If you reward them for not chewing on your shoes, they will choose to do that even when you are not around. In contrast, punishment or dominance suggests showing the dog who is boss, which simply results in the behavior being done when you are not around.
Dogs are highly reward based and the dominance theory has been disproven. Dogs act in ways that are most rewarding, not based on trying to ""dominate"" you or another dog. Be the most rewarding thing in your dogs life and he will be eager to do whatever you say.






Rolling over and exposing the belly is a gesture to appease you, and giving a belly rub serves as excellent reinforcement for this behavior.
An exposed belly can also indicate passive resistance to a perceived threat.Mounting (or humping) can be a sign of stress in a dog, especially where a low-confidence dog is trying to establish allegiance with a higher-confidence animal.
Dogs use a variety of gestures and postures to express discomfort, including excessive/misplaced sneezing or yawning, licking of the lips, avoiding eye contact, cowering, whale eye (seeing the whites or their eye) and a stiff body. When a dog is showing discomfort, the best thing to do is to stop what you are doing and not do it in the future. If you need your dog to be comfortable with something, make it very rewarding by giving them tons of treats and introducing them to the uncomfortable thing slowly. Soon your pooch will be offering to do those things for a treat!
A dog can show many emotions with his tail. A wagging tail and wiggly butt mean pure joy. A slowly wagging tail means a cautious nature. A stiff tail held high is a sign of alertness, a low tail is a sign of content. A tucked tail means they are scared.

, The ways in which a dog holds its body can tell you a great deal about its mood and emotions. Many of the signals will be subtle and it can take some time to learn all of its expressions but it is well worth the effort.

, Dogs communicate easy confidence and a desire to play through posture and body signals.


Confident stance: A dog that is feeling confident will stand tall, have its tail up and probably wagging slowly, its ears will either be pricked up or relaxed, and it will generally look relaxed. Its eyes will have smaller pupils as they are also relaxed.
Bowing: Facing you and with head and chest dipped low to the ground, front legs splayed out, and with rear end and tail up is a clear invitation to play. This is known as the ""play bow"".It can be mistaken by owners as an attack stance but it clearly denotes playtime.
Hip swings: Hip swings or nudges are another sign of play.This involves the dog swinging around another dog and knocking them to the ground using the backside (the end of the dog without teeth!).When the dog's rear is presented to you, it is an indication of trust and depending on your dog, it might mean your dog wants a scratch. Wiggling its rear end is a sign of excitement and friendliness.If a dog is stretching with his butt in the air, front legs and paws stretched out in front, and head close to the ground, he is probably feeling playful.
If your dog raises his/her paw to touch your knee or another part of your body, the dog wants to get attention, make a request or ask for something, or indicate a wish to play.The gesture begins as a puppy with kneading associated with obtaining mother's milkbut becomes similar to that of offering a hand for a handshake – it's about connecting and friendship.
Repeatedly pawing at the air is often used by puppies as an invitation to play.
If a dog’s tail is in a neutral (level with body or slightly lower, he is most likely feeling secure and friendly.If your dog’s tail is fiercely wagging and his/her tail up, he/she is feeling mischievous and inclined to bother and annoy you or a fellow canine! It could also signal swatting away another animal.
If your dog is slowly or slightly wagging his/her tail and watching you, he/she is relaxed but alert and is anticipating, ready to play.

, Knowing when your dog is uncomfortable or feeling insecure can help you meet the animal’s needs and provide comfort and reassurance when necessary.


Pacing can be a sign of nervousness, but it can also be a sign of excitement or boredom. If your dog gets plenty of exercise and entertainment, watch for other signs of nervousness that may accompany the pacing.
A dog who feels threatened may raise his/her hackles. This tactic, which involves the raising of the strip of fur running down the middle of the dog's back, is a dog’s attempt to make itself appear larger than normal. It is not necessarily an aggressive stance but one of ""high alert"", making itself ready for whatever may come next. A scared dog can bite, so be extremely careful around a dog raising its hackles.
A dog who is frightened or insecure may cower or crouch down. A slight crouch can denote submissiveness or nervousness. A similar stance can be an arched back, slightly bent legs, and the tail down (but not tucked under), and looking at what is concerning it.
A dog raising one paw while keeping most of the body away from the person, animal or object creating uncertainty, and backing away is showing uncertainty or puzzlement. If the dog’s head is tilted to one side, this means that the dog is listening, or is uncertain and puzzled and is awaiting more information.
A slow tail wag with the tail slightly lowered can indicate that the dog is confused and is asking for an explanation, or is investigating a non-threatening new object.
If your dog’s tail is slightly lowered and still, he is alert and watching. If the tail is lowered and is barely moving, it can also indicate insecurity.
If there is slight movement with a low tail, this can indicate that the dog is either sad or not feeling well.

, Aggression may lead to unwanted dog fighting or attacks. Recognizing early warning signs of aggression can help your deescalate a situation before it gets worse.


A dog whose tail is lowered or tucked between its legs is showing anxiety, fear, and uncertainty.Wagging can still occur in this situation, which can lead to the misunderstanding that the dog is happy. This position can also indicate a need for reassurance or protection.
A dog that suddenly freezes in the middle of an action is feeling unsure of itself and would rather be left alone, or is preparing for an attack. This is commonplace when a dog is holding a bone; don't get between the dog and its bone!
If your dog leans forward and appears very rigid, he most likely feels aggressive or threatened. This occurs in response to what the dog perceives as a threat or a challenge. The tail will usually be tucked down or under, or wagging in a quick and frantic manner.
When a dog is considering an attack or feels threatened, the whites of his/her eyes will likely show as the dog looks at the perceived threat.
A dog that was showing signs of aggression but who then shakes the head and shoulders may be signaling the end of a certain level of tension, such as being alert to a threat or an anticipated event that doesn't occur.

, While we're not able to do much with our own ears, a dog's ears can be incredibly expressive. Be aware that dogs whose ears were clipped as a puppy may not have the full range of motion to express themselves through their ears.


A dog whose ears are pricked forward or straight up is fully engaged in play, hunting, or concentration. This ear position can also indicate curiosity and can express the intent to do something, as the dog is turning to catch sounds. It is an obvious ear position in the early stage of a chase.A dog’s ears being flattened, sitting against the dog's head, indicates that the dog feels afraid or threatened. Ears that are forward but close to the head can also indicate aggression.A dog’s ears part way back but not flattened may be feeling unhappiness, anxiety, or uncertainty., A dog's eyes express as much as human eyes do, and just as you learn to interpret people's eye signals, you can also learn to interpret your dog's. Here are some of the more common eye signals:


Eyes wide open: this means that your dog is feeling alert, playful, and ready.Staring: staring indicates dominant, challenging behavior.
Avoiding eye contact: a dog trying to look away from your face can be showing politeness, deference, or submission.
Blinking or winking: these indicate that your dog is being playful.
Narrowed eyes: this can indicate that your dog is feeling aggressive and is preparing to attack.This gesture may be accompanied by staring.

, Dogs often show how they are feeling with facial expressions. Understanding facial expressions can help you interpret your dog’s feelings and communicate with your canine companion.


Smiling: believe it or not, dogs can smile. While it can be difficult to differentiate a smile from a snarl, checking other body language for signs of play or aggression can help you determine whether your dog is happy or feeling aggressive. If everything else adds up to a happy dog, then your dog is smiling, and this means it's happy and relaxed.
Yawning: the meaning of a dog’s yawning is dependent on the context, just as it is with humans (humans yawn because we're tired, need more oxygen, we're feeling stressed or embarrassed, or we notice someone else yawning). For dogs, yawning appears to be contagious just as it is with humans.Indeed, if you yawn in front of your dog, it may interpret it either as you being stressed (in which case, it will likely turn away from you to give you some space), or it will respond in kind and yawn too.Dogs also yawn as a way to ease tension, to show confusion or when they feel slightly threatened especially when meeting new situations or new dogs or animals.
Mouth position: a dog that has its mouth stretched back, closed or just slightly open, is showing that it is very stressed, in fear, or in pain.This may be accompanied by rapid panting. If its mouth is stretched back and open, it is a neutral or submissive sign. A dog that is alert and content will have its mouth closed or slightly open, with the teeth covered.Lip licking: if your dog licks its lips in combination with a yawn, this can be a clear indication that it is feeling stressed, under pressure, or facing a threat.It's a commonplace gesture shown by puppies around adults, but the behavior should not continue into adulthood. In mature dogs, licking can also be part of the dog's sexual behavior as it finds chemical signals on grass, carpet, and the genitals of other dogs.A dog that is licking another dog's lips is showing deferring behavior.
Bared teeth: a dog whose lips are curled out and his teeth bared is signaling aggression and an intention to use the teeth for biting. This doesn't mean that every flash of teeth means aggression though, and you must take care to note the other elements. If the teeth are bared and there is no wrinkling of the muzzle, this is a warning and a sign of dominance and territorial defensiveness. If the lips are curled, the teeth are bared, the muzzle is wrinkled, and the dog is snarling, this indicates that the dog is angry and ready to fight, and there is every chance that it will bite.

, Barks, growls, yelps, and howls all carry their own unique language indicators that can take time to learn but are also an important part of understanding your dog's overall behavior. Many people think a bark is a bark is a bark. As you begin to really listen you will hear very distinct differences in the types of vocalizations.


Note that a lack of barking or other dog noises can indicate a predatory state, aimed at not alerting the prey. This may also be accompanied by sniffing the air, keeping low, remaining rigid, ears flicking forward and backward to catch sounds, mouth closed and eyes wide open.Equally, no noise can indicate a submissive dog seeking approval.

, Dogs bark for different reasons, and observation and listening can help you learn to differentiate your dog's distinctive barks in different situations.


A loud, high pitched, rapid bark can be either aggressive or territorial.A short, frequent guttural alert bark is aimed at warning the pack (wolf or human) of potential danger. It may be accompanied by snarling or growling.A crisp, short bark is usually a form of greeting from your dog.
A high-pitched bark is often delivered when your dog is being playful. A short, high bark is a sign of friendliness, and may be accompanied by whimpering or yapping.A sudden high-pitched, sharp yelp may be an indication that your dog is in pain.
A low-pitched, single or spaced out bark is another warning to back off.

, Growling in a strange dog can be somewhat frightening, but not every growl is aggressive. Your dog may growl as part of play or as an alternative form of verbal communication to barking. You should use caution, however, with any dog growls because even a playing dog that has become too boisterous and carried away in play may still snap at a human who intervenes or gets too close.


A low, quiet growl indicates that the subject of the growl needs to back off. It is a sign of assertiveness in a dominant dog.A low growl ending with short bark is the sound made when your dog is responding to threat. It can be a prelude to a snap.
A medium growl, leading to or combined with bark indicates that your dog feels nervous, and possibly aggressive. You should proceed with caution.
Low sustained growl or 'woofing' is an indication that your dog is feeling either anxious or suspicious.
A low murmuring grumble is a lovely sign of contentment. Soft growling is generally play growling;assess it by taking in the context and the general stance of your dog. Play growling will often be accompanied by excited barking.

, Knowing the different reasons that your dog may howl can help you respond to his/her needs. There are several different kinds of howling that have different meanings.


A long, sustained howl indicates separation or loneliness. If your new dog or puppy was separated from other dogs to join your home, he/she may howl at first. Keeping his/her close to you can help his/her feel less lonely.
A short howl with rising pitch generally signals that your dog is happy and/or excited.
Baying is a hunting signal and can be common in breeds who are bred to hunt, even if your dog has never had any training as a hunting dog.
A siren howl is a response to another howl or a sustained noise. You may notice that your dog howls in response to sirens going by your home. If your dog howls at night, he may be howling in response to other dog howling that is out of the range of human hearing.

, Another type of vocalization given by dogs is whining. Like barking, howling, and growling, whining or whimpering may mean different things in different contexts.


Short whines accompanied by short barks indicate that your dog is eager, curious, and excited.Short whimpers are often a sign of fear or anxiety.
A low-pitched whine indicates that your dog is mildly anxious or submissive.A persistent, high-pitched whine can be a plea for attention, reflect intense anxiety, or indicate severe discomfort or pain.

, Dogs understand your language to some extent, but it's very important to understand how you appear to your dog and how some of your gestures may be causing your dog distress, fear, or worry, even though you're completely unaware of this. Always be aware that your dog is watching you, learning, and seeking to predict your routine, habits, and preferences. Withdrawal of your gaze and your arms at the same time informs your dog that you have decided not to touch his/her anymore and he/she may respond negatively.Yawning can indicate to your dog that you're distressed and cause his/her to move away from you. It can be a good idea to cover your yawn around your dog if he/she seems to respond negatively to the action.

, Some actions that we see as normal or loving do not translate well from “human language” to “dog language.” Avoiding activities that make dogs uncomfortable can help strengthen your relationship with your pet.


Staring at your dog can be viewed as a threat. Some trainers used to believe that a dog looking away from a stare was showing disobedience, but it is better understood now as being a sign of politeness or submission.Punishing or reacting negatively to signs of fear in a dog will serve only to increase the dog's sense of fear and does nothing to instill better behavior from our perspective. Do not interpret signs of discomfort or fear as signs of guilt.
Many dogs do not like being patted directly on the head. However, this is something a dog usually needs to learn to tolerate.You should never pat a strange dog on the head until you're more familiar with it, but if you live in an urban environment where people are likely to want to pet your dog, early training (with treats) to help your dog tolerate head patting is essential.

Hugging and cuddling is often another action that dogs do not like. Nature has programmed the dog to believe that being held in close proximity means one of two things: one, that it is trapped as prey, or two, that it is being mounted.Since neither of these actions brings on happy responses, a dog that is not used to frequent cuddling and hugging may respond by fleeing, wriggling, and snapping. If this is the case with your dog, be patient and take a gradual approach to getting it used to a loving embrace. Ensure that children who hug dogs always keep their faces away from the dog, and monitor the dog's reaction so that you can intervene quickly if needed.
Dogs are social animals and need contact, so you should avoid making them feel overly isolated. The first nights of having a puppy in the home are essential. Try to stay near the puppy (such as having its crate in your room), then gradually move his/her to where he/she will sleep permanently. This will reassure the dog that all is well. Do not share your bed with a dog unless you want this to become a permanent arrangement. Doing this creates a permanent expectation in your puppy's mind.

, Being clear, consistent, and concise with your commands and direct communication with your dog can help your dog understand what you want him to do. Most dogs want to please their owners, so they will try to adapt their behavior to your expectations.


Always repeat commands using the same words and tone so that your dog knows his name and understands that he should be listening to you.
Alter your tone when communicating different emotions to your dog. Dogs have instincts that help them discern if we are happy with them or upset with them. If you smile and tell your dog good dog in a happy tone, he will know that he has done something right. Likewise, if you correct him in an angry tone, he will know that he has done something wrong. This is an important thing to take in consideration when training.
Remember that dogs forget things frequently. However, they will remember things that they have been trained about, where certain things and people are, who you are and who their friends are, getting praised, and surprising things (good or bad) that happen.
Shouting at your dog, gesticulating wildly, or shaking ""weapons"" like a broomstick at your dog will seem like crazy behavior and does nothing to change your dog's behavior. It can, however, upset an already insecure and fearful dog even more. Spare your energy and stay calm. Keep your communication tactics clear and reasoned.
Keep this in mind while correcting a dog. If you come home to a destroyed sofa, yelling at the dog will not achieve anything, as the dog will not make the connection between the destroyed sofa and the correction.

, Having a 2-way communication relationship with your dog will help both of you maintain a healthy relationship. Keeping the lines of communication open and showing your dog that you understand his/her will help you know when to step in if something is wrong.


Research how dogs communicate with each other. Modeling your own communication strategy on dog-to-dog communication can lead to more successful communication.

, Never run, this is a dogs trigger to attack.

, Don't touch the dog quite yet.

, If they kiss your hand (lick it), then you can lightly pet its back. If not, leave your hand out and if it doesn't whimper, bark, growl, you can lightly pet its back.

, It will show that you are not meaning any harm. Ask the owner if you can give the dog a treat (if you don't have one, ask ""Do you have a treat I can give him/her?).

Be calm around your dog.,
Be observant of body language.,
Establish a safe space for your dog.,
Respect your dog’s individual likes and dislikes.,
Establish a feeding routine.",How to Become Close With Your Dog1," It’s not always easy to tell if your dog came from a place where it was loved or closely cared for, like a puppy mill or kill shelter. If you adopted from a shelter then you know at one point it was left alone. Be aware of the emotional (and sometimes physical) baggage your dog may carry when interacting with you. Try to be a tranquil, calm, and unthreatening presence.For example, speak in soothing tones and avoid any quick hand gestures or movements when near your dog.;
, Dogs communicate through their bodies. If you pay attention to how your dog moves then you will get an indication as to its feelings. Your dog may consistently wag his tail, only stopping when it feels scared. Your dog might also narrow his eyes at a potential threat. Knowing these cues allows you to better respond to your dog’s needs.A dog that is fearful or stressed out may lower its ears and body, preparing for a possible defensive strike. The dog's eyes may dilate and it may begin panting in a rapid pace. Nose wrinkling is a sign of aggression possibly triggered by fear., Almost all dogs crave privacy at one point or another. Designate a dog bed, folded blanket, old chair, or crate as the territory of your dog. This is a place where your dog can go to relax or chew on a bone. You might also leave treats or toys there as well. Giving your dog the space that it needs will only enhance your bond.Make sure that the rest of your home is safe for your dog as well. Relocate all toxic chemicals to an inaccessible area. Hide any electrical cords. It may be necessary to use safety gates to cordon off certain areas., Not all dogs are the same. After you spend some time with your pet you will start to see certain preferences emerge. Your dog may hate (or love) to walk on concrete. Your dog may be afraid of the snow or rain. Your dog may enjoy dry food, but not wet. Remember these preferences and act on them in the future.Part of this is also about setting your dog up to be successful. Don’t put your dog into situations that are obviously uncomfortable for him. For example, it is probably not a good idea to take your dog to a fireworks show., This routine will very much depend on the preferences of your dog. Most dogs need to be fed twice a day while others do better with only one feeding. Experiment with various food brands and types until you find one that your dog enjoys the most. Make sure that you are the only one doing the feeding and your dog will bond with you even more."

Realize that changing behaviors can take months.,
Have reasonable expectations for your dog.,
Avoid giving your dog negative attention.,
Find a way to be calm.",How to Be Patient with Your Dog2," As you train your dog or try to break bad habits, you must realize that behavior changes in dogs don’t happen overnight. However, if you are patient and continue training your dog, after a few weeks or months, your dog will begin to obey.Giving up after a few days or a week because you see no change won’t lead to your dog’s desired behavior. You need to keep calm and keep persisting.

, Whether you have just adopted a dog or are trying to be patient with a long-time pet, make sure you have reasonable expectations from them. If you’ve just adopted a dog, be patient as they adjust to a new home. Give them plenty of love while giving them some space, and remain calm as they learn the rules of your home., Often, when we get frustrated, we give the dog negative attention. This may be in the form of yelling, swatting them, responding to them, or giving into their wants. You should be patient and ignore your dog during their unwanted the behavior. It may take a few weeks, but eventually, your patience will pay off and your dog will understand the behavior isn’t getting your attention., Being patient can be hard when your dog is engaging in unwanted behavior. You may need to deliberately calm yourself so you don't lose your temper or yell at your dog. Use your favorite calming technique to help keep yourself in check.


Try going to a different room and ignoring your dog.
Taking deep breaths to keep calm. Breathing in and counting to five can help you calm down before you get angry or upset.

Love your dog.,
Be mindful of your dog’s circumstances.,
Be patient with your family as they learn to interact with the dog.",How to Be Patient with Your Dog3," One way to be remind yourself to be patient is to remember that you love your dog. Even if you get frustrated with them, be kind and loving. Don’t yell, hit, or act out against your dog. Take a deep breath and remember how much of a good companion your dog is.You can be firm with your dog by correcting them with verbal commands. This takes patience. But losing your temper and yelling does not take patience.

, One key to being patient with your dog is knowing their personality and limitations. This can help you keep the situation in perspective so you don’t get frustrated so easily. Think about your dog’s age, background, and personality before you get too frustrated.For example, if your dog is young, they may not be able to completely understand what you are trying to teach them. If you have a senior dog, they may have cognitive difficulties that cause them to learn things slower. Dogs who have been abused may take longer to pick things up, and overly hyper or easily distracted dogs can take longer to train.

, You may not be the only person who will interact with and train your dog. If you live with roommates or family, they will be an influence on your dog. Be patient as you explain to them how to correct your dog’s behavior, what things are acceptable for the dog to do, and other rules for your dog.For example, your family may not know how to correct a dog’s behavior or may not realize you don’t want the dog on the furniture. Stay calm as you work with your family to get on the same page about the dog.

Chill out at home.,
Take long walks or hikes.,
Play.,
Go out on the town.,
Break from routine.,
Reward positive behaviors.,
Offer gentle correction for negative behaviors.",How to Become Close With Your Dog2," If you are cooking or cleaning the house, get your dog to tag along with you. If you are lounging on the couch watching TV, have your dog jump on up and snuggle with you. You can even talk to your dog during these moments as that will help you both to bond too., You can tailor your outdoor experience depending on your dog's breed. A small dog can participate in a hike if carried in an open pack whereas a large dog can probably trot alongside you. Dogs enjoy the outdoors because there are so many new smells and sensations. Paying attention to what your dog finds fascinating will also help you to view the same old path in a new light.Keep safety in mind when venturing outside with your dog. Make sure to apply repellent to your dog's fur if you are hiking somewhere with ticks or other pests. Offer water frequently to your dog and watch out for overheating or dehydration, often signaled by a slight shaking or excessive panting.
To keep your dog interested in the outdoors feel free to try out new places. Don't get stuck in a routine that may be boring to you both.

, Try to discover what types of play your dog enjoys the most. Some like to play fetch whereas others prefer hide and seek. Be creative and mix up your play time to experiment with new activities. Just be careful that your play does not bring out feelings of aggression within your dog, as tug of war can sometimes do.When you are playing and bonding with your dog, make a point to put your cell phone away.
To keep your play sessions fresh you may want to rotate out toys every week or so. There are even subscription services online that, for a fee, will send you fresh toys at set intervals. To find a service like this search online for ""pet toy delivery.""

, Hit your favorite dog friendly restaurant or café. Go to a festival or public park with your dog in tow. Take a walk in your local pet-friendly outdoor shopping area. Try to incorporate your dog into your regular social activities. You will find that it is much easier than you think.With all of this running around just make sure to offer your dog ample water.

, Dogs do well with a schedule, however, it is sometimes useful to mix things up a little. This is especially the case if your dog appears bored. So, do your same routine with a slight variation. Go to a different dog park. Change your walking path. Introduce a new toy. Your dog will then trust you to get them safely through this new experience., You can praise your dog by offering verbal encouragement or even treats. Just keep the positive reinforcement coming. This shows your dog that their good behavior is noticed and that they are an important part of your family. A confident dog is a happy dog. It is easy to offer praise when you first get a pet, but make sure that you keep this up over time too.Offer up positive encouragement for minor actions as well. If your dog waits patiently at the door or doesn’t beg at dinner there is nothing wrong with offering a quick treat. Couple this with a smile and a happy, “Good job!”Remember that treats don’t have to break the bank. Most dogs will be satisfied with a few frozen peas or a small piece of cheese., Your dog is also bound to mess up and when this happens it is your job to stay calm and instruct them in the proper behaviors. When your dog misbehaves it is enough to simply say, “No,” in a firm voice. Do not, under any circumstances, use physical force to correct your dog."

Take a basic obedience class together.,
Prepare for the Canine Good Citizen Test.,
Train for sport.,
Master a set of tricks.,
Pursue additional specialty training.",How to Become Close With Your Dog3," This is a great starting point for dogs unfamiliar with a class experience. Many pet stores offer obedience classes geared to particular groups of dogs from puppies to seniors. This is a great way to build a bond of trust with your dog as you learn about obedience techniques in tandem.Continue to get bonding benefits by practicing what you’ve learned once the class is over. Work on the basic commands of sit and stay with your dog. Make these exercises even more challenging by practicing in a public place, such as a park.

, This test is offered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and reflects a dog's ability to interact with its surrounding in a peaceful and productive manner. You can prepare your dog for this test by taking classes emphasizing socialization in public settings. This process will make your dog more comfortable being with you in public places, allowing you to spend even more time together.For more information on Canine Good Citizen classes, visit the AKC website. This site will direct you to class options while providing you with more information about the testing process as well.

, You can work with your dog to develop agility skills or even the speed necessary to do well at flyball (a relay race sport involving chasing a tennis ball). These are also great ways to meet other dog owners and exchange information and advice. Your dog will also be happy to meet new canine friends.Note that many canine sports have age restrictions in place for competitions. For example, a dog generally must be over 2 years old in order to compete in a flyball tournament., You’ve probably already tried some version of this with your dog. Trick training focuses on teaching your dog a set of interesting skills that can be performed, such as shaking hands. Use positive reinforcement and frequent treats to get your dog to enjoy the process and learn at the same time. When you are confident in your dog’s skills take him to the park to show off a bit.Make time for a bit of a nap (for you and your dog) after a training session. Learning new trick moves can be exhausting for your pet, even in a low pressure setting., Consider enrolling your dog in a therapy program. This is a great way to help others while bonding with your pet. Search online for a good Pet Therapy program near you and contact them for additional information.

Identify the physical signs of abuse on a dog.,
Identify the mental/emotional signs of abuse on a dog.,
Identify the environmental signs of abuse on a dog.",How to Remove a Dog from an Unsafe Environment1," Physical abuse, also called direct abuse or prolonged abuse, is the unlawful act or practice of physically using force on an animal; and not for illegitimate reasons. Physical abuse is considered the worst among any other form of abuse, because it can cause prolonged or long-term problems on any animal, including a dog. If you can identify the signs of physical abuse on a dog, you might be able to present this as helpful evidence to the court when suing an owner, making it more likely to be believed.

Signs of physical abuse include, but are not limited to, large bruising anywhere on the dog's body that are clear and visible, scarring, marks that appear and reappear on a regular basis, or bald spots on the dog's fur that do not go away and constantly appear. If you suspect physical abuse, you should contact the Animal Abuse Hotline as soon as possible to get help, especially if you are repeatedly seeing it.
A physically abused dog may also appear to be limping; in some cases, this is considered to be normal. However, if you suspect a dog is constantly limping on a regular basis, this will raise a red flag. Call for help; the longer you wait, the worse it becomes.
Do not assume a dog isn't suffering from abuse just because a certain area looks safe to you. You might be missing the reality of the situation.;
, In the worst case scenario, a dog can be emotionally influenced by the abuse its owner inflicts, and unfortunately this is almost always the case with every abused animal. If a dog is influenced, it becomes more difficult over time to bring the animal back to reality. While not necessarily vital, it may help you to further assess the situation and get the dog out of there and to safety.

Signs of mental/emotional abuse in a dog include: unusual or abnormal changes in a dog's impairment, excessive barking, and abrupt behavioral changes, such as prolonged aggression. Aggression, in this case, is very important, and should not be taken lightly.
Prolonged or repeated aggression strongly signals a problem, even if a dog has not shown any type of aggression in the past. A dog can be emotionally driven from abuse to act differently and may begin defending its territory excessively. You should pay extra close attention to the dog's body language and visual impairment.
An abused dog can also act frightened or scared whenever you or someone else comes near. If you suspect this, it will raise a red flag and indicates a huge problem. If the dog is being repeatedly abused, it will show excessive shyness and by all means should not be ignored.

, Environmental, while not particularly as dangerous as the other forms of abuse, can still have a huge impact on an animal's health. Environmental abuse occurs when an animal is forced to live in unsafe conditions. In some cases, it may even influence a dog to respond differently.

Environmental abuse typically is identified whenever an animal lives around an environment with poor or unstable conditions. This means that if you suspect this type of abuse on a dog, you should take it seriously; assume the dog is living in a poor environment.
If you see any dog that is constantly being tied or chained up outside on a regular basis, even in inclement weather, that is a sign of environmental abuse and you should be able to report it immediately.
Also note the signs of neglect; while not serious, it does pose a harmful effect. If you suspect the owner is failing to give an adequate supply of food and water to a dog, if the coat of a dog appears matted or tangled, if the dog looks extremely emaciated, etc. you should report it as soon as possible. If you can, take pictures from your phone or a camera to present as evidence.

Do not confront the owner.,
Call Animal Abuse Hotline.,Ensure that you have successfully rescued the dog.,Whatever the officials tell you to do, do it.",How to Remove a Dog from an Unsafe Environment2," In the worst case scenario, you may be tempted to defend an abused dog by yelling and putting the owner in his place, but don't. Not only is this method potentially dangerous and life-threatening, but the owner might view you as an obvious threat and use your own words against you in court. It is always better to report the owner to the police over the phone and let them handle it, rather than confronting the owner directly and risking your life.

If you confront the owner directly, you are far more likely to be in immediate danger than anyone else. Don't consider the possibility, even if you believe the dog's life is at risk.
Also be aware that if you choose to confront the owner directly, you may end up being forced into doing something you didn't expect.

, This is a program designed to help you remove an abused animal from its home and to safety, like a local shelter. Ensure that locals will come to help you get an abused dog to safety; wait for them and be patient. By doing this, you will be using a different approach without actually managing to get in harm's way.

Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to rescue the dog yourself. Not only is it dangerous, but you might end up facing a huge fine for trespassing. Just wait for officials and don't risk it. This is especially true if the owner of the abused dog is a man, a predator, or is otherwise threatening.
After the officials arrive, you can direct them to the abusive owner's house and seek out the abused dog to rescue it. Do not go alone; there's safety in numbers.
Encourage the officials to be as quiet as possible to avoid surprising the dog. Do not go inside the house; this is just plain common sense.
If the police are able to detain the owner, have them come as well. In the unlikely event of the owner noticing your presence, you'll be glad to have the police around.

Take the dog to the vet.,
Start an animal abuse fundraiser.",How to Remove a Dog from an Unsafe Environment3," This is a big one; the vets are going to check for worms, prescribe medications, weigh the animal, etc. Ensure that you have the medical records up-to-date. The vet will also give shots to the animal, if needed.

If you choose to adopt the dog, you will have to be prepared for the long term commitment. Buy it toys, bowls, dog food, water, etc. and make sure you have plenty of room in your home for it to roam.
If you choose not to adopt the dog, it will be sent to a local animal shelter to be adopted by someone else. Congratulations, though; you've just saved a life!

, If you love animals, you will probably be tempted to contribute to the environment.

Get plenty of people to bake goods, make money, and have fun. You can also check out books on animals at your local library.

You will need a marker specifically for cattle tags or the dye will wear off.;
, To have each cow's number fit on its tag, number will need to be written tall and narrow. Note how each number is uniform in height and also width., Do this by shaking it vigorously and then pressing the end of it hard into the paper towels. This will let down the ink into the tip of it.

This procedure is also helpful for when the tip starts to dry up.

, If you saw your livestock getting injured, you should write down your memories as soon as possible. By writing your memories down, you can remember them better. Also, you can refer to your notes at a later date to remind you of what happened.


Be sure to include all relevant details. If you saw a person harming your livestock, describe their appearance: height, weight, what the person was wearing, etc.
If a dog attacked your livestock, write down a description of the dog: breed, size, color, and any distinguishing characteristics.

, You should call a vet to come out to your place and check your livestock. The vet can treat your livestock and save their lives. Even more, the vet’s records will come in handy when you file a lawsuit, since the records are proof of the injury.


Hold onto the vet’s bills. You can be compensated for any veterinarian treatments needed to treat the injury., In many states, injuring livestock intentionally is a crime.Because it is a crime, if your livestock have been injured, you need to contact the police. If the police find the individual responsible and prosecutors press charges, they may be found guilty and sentenced to jail time. In addition, they may have to pay fines.


If the person responsible is found guilty of a crime, it will also help your civil case. Therefore, it is important to contact the police and pursue criminal charges when possible.

, You might not immediately know who is responsible for your livestock’s injury. However, in order to bring a lawsuit, you need to identify someone as the defendant. Accordingly, you should ask neighbors if they saw anyone around the livestock and ask if they know the person’s identity. You also might want to call the police to investigate.


The defendant might have harmed your livestock directly. For example, if someone shot your horse, then he is responsible for the injury. Typically, you will rely on eyewitness testimony that someone directly harmed your livestock.
The defendant might also have hurt your livestock indirectly. For example, if someone broke into your barn and left the door open, then he could be legally responsible if your animals escape and are injured. To help prove this kind of indirect injury, you should take photographs of your barn and the broken door. Also gather evidence of how close the road is to your barn. If the barn is close to the road, then a reasonable person should know that livestock would wander out to the highway if the barn door was left open.
A defendant’s dog might also have hurt your livestock.The owner is responsible for an injury caused by his or her dog. You will typically rely on eyewitness testimony that the dog attacked your livestock.

, You should meet with an attorney before filing your lawsuit. In particular, you will want to discuss whether bringing a lawsuit is worthwhile. You can certainly sue for an injury, no matter how small. However, lawsuits are time-consuming, and you might not want to bother with a lawsuit if the injuries were not serious.To find a lawyer, you should contact your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program.
After you get a referral, schedule a consultation with the lawyer. At the consultation, you can talk with the lawyer about your case. The lawyer might also give you pointers if you decide to represent yourself in court.

, There aren't any federal laws protecting livestock from injury.Therefore, you will have to sue under your state's livestock laws. However, you may still be able to file in federal court if you have diversity jurisdiction. To have diversity jurisdiction, you and the other party must be citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000.State courts can hear almost any case involving events that took place in that state. Think about the following when deciding where to file your case:Which courthouse is closer to you
Which court has more favorable court rules
Which court has more favorable judges
Which court will have better jury pools

, If your lawsuit isn’t worth much money, you might want to sue in small claims. Small claims court has a maximum that you can sue for, which depends on your state. Typically, the maximum ranges from $5,000 to $10,000.If you choose small claims court, then you don’t need a lawyer. It is set up so that people can represent themselves.
Many small claims courts also have non-traditional hours, which allow you to attend court in the evening or on weekends.
However, some small claims courts don’t allow juries.And some don’t allow you to appeal if you lose your lawsuit. If having a jury or the right to appeal is important to you, then you might want to file your lawsuit in regular civil court.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. A complaint identifies you and the defendant and explains the factual circumstances surrounding the livestock injury. In your complaint, you also ask the court for money damages as compensation.If you have a lawyer, he or she will draft a complaint and file it. Be sure to ask your lawyer for a copy of all documents filed in your case.
Many courts now have printed “fill in the blank” complaint forms for you to use. If you are representing yourself, then stop into your court clerk’s office and ask for a form. If no form is available, then ask if they have a sample that you could use as a guide. If no sample is available, then think about hiring a lawyer.

, You should provide all requested information. Print neatly, using black ink. Alternately, you could enter the information with a typewriter. Each complaint form differs, but you will generally be asked for the same information:your name and address
the defendant’s name and address
how much you are suing for
the facts surrounding the dispute (“who, what, when, where”)

, After you have finished the complaint, you should make several copies. Take the copies, along with the original, to the court clerk’s office. Ask to file the original.The clerk should stamp your copies with the date. Keep one copy for your records. You will serve another copy on the defendant. If there is more than one defendant, then each defendant gets a copy.
You will probably have to pay a filing fee. The amount will vary by court. Call ahead to ask the court clerk the amount and acceptable methods of payment.
If you can’t afford the fee, you may qualify for a fee waiver. Ask the clerk for a fee waiver form and fill it out., You have to give the defendant a copy of your complaint. The court clerk will also help you get a “summons,” which is a legal document commanding the defendant to respond to your lawsuit. You should ask the court clerk what are acceptable methods of service. Generally, you can make service in the following ways:Have the forms hand-delivered by anyone 18 or older who is not a party to the case. You cannot make service yourself.
Pay to have the sheriff or a private process server hand-deliver the papers on the defendant.
Mail the papers to the defendant. Someone (not you) should mail the papers first-class or certified mail to the defendant’s home address or, if the defendant is a business, then to the defendant’s business address.

, The person who makes service also has to prove that they made service. They can do this by filling out and signing a proof of service or affidavit of service. You can get this form from the court clerk and give it to the server.


After filling out the proof of service, the server returns the signed form to you. You must then file it with the court.Always keep a copy of every form you file with the court.

, After you serve the other party with the lawsuit and they respond, you will enter a period of discovery, which is a time to collect and exchange information about the case. Discovery can be time consuming and expensive. The process can take months, or even years, and it can often take up a majority of the case budget. During discovery you will gather facts, speak with witnesses, collect documents, and assess the case. You will do these things by utilizing the following discovery tools:


Informal discovery, which will include interviewing witnesses, collecting public documents, and taking photographs.
Interrogatories, which are written questions that will be answered under oath. These can be used in court.
Depositions, which are formal interviews with relevant individuals. They are taken under oath and the answers can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are used when you want access to documents that are not publicly available (e.g., emails, text messages, internal memos).
Subpoenas, which are court orders requiring people to produce documents or answer questions., Throughout the legal process you (or your attorney) will be responsible for attending various pre-trial conferences. These conferences keep the judge apprised of updates. Some conferences will be about scheduling. Other conferences will help foster agreements (a.k.a., stipulations)., Once you have a good idea about how your case is likely to proceed (i.e., after discovery), the defendant may file a motion for summary judgment. In their motion, which will include affidavits and supporting evidence, they will try to show the judge that there are no disputed material facts and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.


In other words, a judge will analyze their motion and make every factual assumption in your favor. Therefore, to defend the motion, all you have to do is provide evidence and affidavits that show the judge there are disputed issues. If you can do so, you will defeat the motion and move forward with your case., In a last effort to avoid trial, you should try to settle the case with the other party. To do so, sit down with the opposite side and discuss your concerns. Let them know what you need and why you need it. In return, the other party will tell you what they expect and why they believe what they believe. If you can find some common ground and find areas of agreement, you may be able to settle the case.

, You shouldn’t be late to your trial. The judge can dismiss the lawsuit if you are late. Plan to arrive at least fifteen minutes early so that you can find parking and pass through courthouse security.


Remember to dress professionally. You should look like you are going to a professional job interview.Do not bring food into the courtroom. You should also turn off all electronic devices before entering.

, If you have a lawyer, then your lawyer can handle the entire trial. You would then possibly testify and offer your advice to your lawyer, but your lawyer will handle all of the nuts and bolts of the trial. However, if you are representing yourself, then you will need to make an opening statement.


The purpose of the opening statement is to provide a sneak peek of your evidence. You shouldn’t argue or draw conclusions.Instead, simply tell the judge what you will show during the trial: that your livestock was injured and that the defendant took some action that caused the injury.
For example, you could say, “As the evidence will show, at 5:30 pm on August 22, 2015, my neighbor, Allison Smith, heard barking coming from my property. And as the evidence will also show, Mrs. Smith watched as a 100-pound pit bull bit into a horse's leg.”

, Your evidence will consist of witnesses and documents. For example, you can introduce photographs taken of your livestock. You could also call the veterinarian as a witness.


If you don’t have a lawyer, then you should have written out a list of questions to ask the witness ahead of time. Remember to stick to the focus of the trial—what happened to your livestock and who injured them. You can only have people testify to what they saw or heard first-hand.Witnesses can’t testify to rumors, nor can they guess.
For example, you can ask a neighbor if she saw a dog attack your livestock. But she can’t testify that someone told her whose dog it was.
For more tips, see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself.

, You may testify at trial as well. You can only testify about events that you have personal knowledge of. For example, if you saw the defendant hurt your livestock, you can testify as to what you saw and heard. To be an effective witness, remember the following:Listen closely to the question and only answer the question asked. Don’t volunteer extra information.
Never answer a question you don’t understand. Ask the lawyer to clarify or rephrase.
Always tell the truth. It is against the law to lie, and you will only hurt yourself if you are less than truthful.
Never argue with a lawyer. Always project calmness.

, If the defendant has witnesses testify, then you or your lawyer will be able to ask questions during cross-examination. You should listen closely to what the witness says.


The defendant might testify, so you can cross-examine him. You should try to get helpful information from the defendant.
For example, if the defendant’s dog injured your livestock, then you will want to get the owner to admit that he owns the dog. You can show him a picture of the dog and ask him whose dog is shown in the photograph. The witness should admit that it is his dog.
You can use the same picture with all witnesses. For example, your neighbor might look at the picture and identify the dog as the one that attacked your livestock.

, After all evidence has been presented, you will need to deliver a closing argument. Your goal is to draw together all of the evidence to show that the defendant is responsible for the injury to your livestock.


Remind the judge of specific pieces of evidence. Your trial might have been spread over a couple days, and people can forget evidence submitted early in the trial.
For example, you could say, “As you remember, you heard testimony from Mrs. Smith that a pit bull, about 100 pounds, started attacking the horse. And she identified the dog in this picture as the dog that attacked the horse.”

, If you have a jury, then the judge will read the jury its instructions before they retire to deliberate. If a judge is deciding your case, then he or she will probably deliver a ruling immediately from the bench.


In many states, you can win a lawsuit without a unanimous jury.You can typically win if at least three-fourths or five-sixths of the jurors agree with you.If your jury has 12 members, only nine or 10 would need to decide in your favor.

Start with a calf so it is easier to teach.,
Build a relationship with the calf.,
As you get the animal used to your touch and your trust, try putting a little pressure on the animal's back each time, by pushing down with your hand, then progressing to planting your arms and chest on the animal's back so your legs are off the ground.,
Once the animal is used to your weight on his back, you can now climb on.,
When the calf starts getting used to you being on its back, take it out to a small enclosed area.

,
Make some reins by putting a halter on him and attaching the end of the lead to the halter.

,
To train the animal to respond to the reins.,
Continue to practice.",How to Train a Cow to be Ridden,";
, You want the calf to feel comfortable around you, and you also want to be comfortable around it.


This means getting it eating out of your hand and getting used to you touching and petting it. This may take several weeks, so be patient, yet consistent.
This is also a good time to halter-train the calf, and teaching him to stand tied.

, Do this briefly, but repeat every time, make sure to give the calf praise every time that it calms down.

, The animal may try to jump around a bit or move away from you, but you also need to persist until he learns that you are not trying to hurt him.

,,, Have him face a wall or fence, and climb on his back. Pull left or right on the reins and he will have to go either way you tell him because he can't go forward.

, This will take quite a bit of time to get from the initial training to actually riding the cow.

Use verbal restraint first.,
Use a collar to restrain your dog.,
Use a harness to restrain your dog.",How to Restrain a Dog1," Many dogs know obedience commands. Of course, you will know if your own dog knows commands such as sit, down, stay, and no.Communication can sometimes be the key to better understanding and a problem solved.


Verbal restraint is very valuable in those instances where a dog might get loose and start running. A well trained dog can be recalled with ""come"" if it is running towards danger. Proper training at an early age can help you gain this valuable restraint over your dog.
Use verbal communication first but it can also be combined with other restraint techniques.;
, Collars can be used to restrain dogs if the animal just needs general restraint. However, collars can be slipped out of, as dogs can twist trying to get away and hurt themselves or the people handling them.


Never hold the collar around the neck of a dog with protruding eyeballs (like Pugs.) If they struggle you can literally cause their eye balls to pop out of the socket, injuring the eyes and in extreme cases causing blindness., Harnesses, which fit around the dog’s chest in front of and behind the front legs, are a great choice for restraint. They do not put pressure on the dog's neck like a collar does. This is a big plus for dogs with trachea that collapse or for dogs that pull very hard when on the leash.A dog is less likely to slip out of a harness than they are with a collar. In general, a harness gives a more secure and safer hold on a dog.

"
"
Avoid common mistakes.,
Muzzle the dog.,
Restrain the dog.,
Ask your veterinarian, or veterinary technician, to demonstrate these restraint techniques.",How to Restrain a Dog2," If a dog needs some serious restraint there are some things you should avoid for your own safety. These include:


Never put your face at the dog’s level without absolute control over its head. You can get bit that way.
Don't expect an injured dog to behave as it normally does. An injured dog can bite out of pain and fear, even its beloved owner.
Do not do attempt to restrain a dog if you do not feel confident in how to do it.

, Gauze can be used to muzzle a dog in a pinch. Cut a length of gauze (about 1 foot for small dogs and 2 feet for large dogs) and make a loose knot in the middle. Put the loop of the knot around the dog’s muzzle. Tie it off snugly on top of the nose then take the loose ends and tie them behind the dog’s ear snugly.Alternatively, there are muzzles that you can purchase that are made of fabric or nylon and work in the same manner. Gauze muzzles and basic nylon muzzles will leave the nostrils and mouth exposed allowing the dog to breath normally.
Sometimes the surprise of being muzzled keeps the dog distracted enough to perform procedures like nail trims, ear drop placement or any other minor medical procedure with relative ease.
If you have a “pushed in” face dog (like a pug) you can use a thick towel as a temporary muzzle. Fold the towel into a rectangle and place the center part on the mouth with the ends twisted snugly around the neck. If you do this you must make sure the dog is able to breath out the nose and be sure not to apply too much pressure to the neck. If the dog struggles too much, abandon this technique and consult your veterinarian for advice.

, Dogs can be restrained while they sit or stand by placing one of your arms underneath the neck, so the dog's neck rests on your elbow. Then your other arm should be placed around the dog to draw the dog’s body close to your body.Alternatively, the arm can be placed under the dog’s belly to keep it standing.

To lay a larger dog on its side have the dog stand in front of you. With your arm near the head of the dog, reach around to grab the lower front legs together. Place your index finger between the legs. With your other hand do the same to the back back legs. In one motion gently life with gently lift the dog and let it slide to the ground onto its side using your body as a “slide” for the dog.
Then you will need to place your forearms on the neck and body of the dog to gently hold the dog on the floor or counter. During this the dog may struggle so you need to have a firm grip on the dog and move quickly before the dog starts to struggle. If you do not think you’re capable of this have your veterinarian or veterinary technician demonstrate this technique to you first.

, Veterinarians, and the people who work in veterinary offices, are well versed in restraint techniques. Ask for advice the next time you are at the vet. Knowing how to safely restrain a dog could come in very handy in the future.

Place a hand under your puppy's chest.,
Support the back end.,
Lift the pup up.,
Place the puppy down the same way.,
Never grab a pup by its neck or tail.",How to Pick Up a Puppy1," Start by using your hand to support the puppy's chest, where the rib cage is. You can also use your forearm once you pick the puppy up. You'll need to go in from the side and place your hand between the dog's front legs., As you lift the puppy up, use your other hand to support the back end. In other words, your other hand or arm should be under the puppy's back legs and butt., Once your hands are in position, lift the puppy up. Make sure you continue to support both its chest and rump as you hold it. However, you can place one arm underneath the rump, and one arm around the torso, pulling the pup towards your body once you have it at chest height. Hold the puppy close to your body, not out away from you, as it can wriggle out of your arms., When moving the puppy back to the floor, make sure you still support the puppy's chest and rump. Also, never drop the puppy. Gently lower it all the way to the floor., While you may know not to yank on a pup's tail or pick it up that way, you should also not do that with the puppy's neck, even if you're holding it by the scruff. You could injure or even kill the puppy. Also, don't try to pick up the dog by a leg, as you could hurt the leg."

Place one hand under the chest.,
Place your other hand under the dog's rump.,
Slowly lift the dachshund, keeping his body level.,
Continue to support the dog's back as you hold it.,
Transition to a ""cradle"" hold if you wish.,
To set the dachshund down, slowly lower him to the floor.",How to Hold a Dachshund Properly1," Picking up a dachshund is different than the way you'd pick up other breeds, but it's not especially hard once you learn the right method. Start by slipping a hand under the dog's upper body to support his chest and ribcage. Don't lift up yet.


Spread your fingers out so that you support as much of the dog's upper body as possible. The wider the area you can spread his weight over, the gentler it will be on his spine.;
, Gently slip your free hand under the dog's rump — either directly behind it or just in front of the dog's rear legs to support its lower body. Get ready to lift up.


Here, again, it is best to spread your hand to give the widest base of support possible.

, Now, simply lift the dog up. As you go, try to keep the dog's lower body from hanging or drooping beneath his lower body. A little bending is fine, but you'll want to keep the dog's back as flat as possible to keep from putting stress on it., As you move around or play with your dachshund, make sure his lower back is well-supported at all times. Dachshunds aren't like other dogs — letting their lower bodies dangle is uncomfortable to them and can contribute to painful back problems (like slipped and ruptured discs) over time.


Luckily, with a little practice, this should become second nature after a while. Eventually, it will feel ""wrong"" to pick the dachshund up in the incorrect way.

, As long as the dachshund's back is well-supported and his body is fairly straight, it doesn't really matter how you choose to hold him. If you'd like the convenience of being able to hold your dachshund with one arm, try shifting to this alternate hold once you've picked him up correctly by following the steps above:


Gently shift the dog's weight so that it comes to rest on the forearm of the arm that you were using to support his rump. Use your full forearm to support his weight.
Tuck the dog against your body for added support and comfort. This should feel a little like how you would cradle a baby or hold a football.
Use your free arm when needed to help the dog balance and keep him from squirming or wriggling free.

, If you've had experience with other dog breeds, you may be used to ""dropping"" or gently heaving them back to the ground when you're done holding them. With dachshunds, instead, you'll want to lower the dog all the way to the ground before letting go. As always, keep his back well-supported as you lower him down.


Ideally, you'll want his feet to be touching the ground before you let go. As you'll read below, even a drop of a few inches can put stress on the dachshund's back and joints."
"
Crouch behind the dog with your legs hip width apart.,
Slide one hand under the dog’s chest.,
Put your other hand under the dog’s hind quarters.,
Pick the dog up.",How to Pick Up a Small Adult Dog1," To ensure your back is supported, take a stance behind the small adult dog with equal weight in both feet. Make sure your feet are hip width apart. This will ensure you can lift the small dog without putting your lower back at risk. Then, crouch down until you are at the dog's level.You can crouch down so you are at the level of the dog's body, with your arms relaxed at your sides. You may need to keep your heels off the ground when you crouch for comfort.;
, Use your non-dominant hand to support the dog's upper body by sliding your arm through the dog's front legs until your hand is under their chest. You may put your hand under their chest and cup it to support the dog or wrap your hand lightly around one of the dog's legs.The dog's head and neck should be free to move around when the dog is in your grip. You want to support their upper body with your hand without constraining them too much.

, Place your dominant hand underneath the dog’s hind quarters, or butt. Have your hand pointing forward with your fingers between the dog’s back legs. This will create a good support under their body and make it easier for you to lift them up.Make sure you have a good grip on your dog’s hind quarters with your arm and your hands. Having a solid hold of the dog will ensure they do not slip out of your grip when you pick them up.

, Once you have your arms in position, lift the dog straight up from a crouching position. Use your legs to raise yourself and the dog up. Hold the dog close to your chest as you lift them up. They should feel sturdy and secure in your arms.Once you have lifted up the dog, you may then carry them a short distance and place them back down on a solid surface.

Sit down with your pup in your lap.,
Soothe the puppy.,
Turn him over on his back.,
Have other people pick it up.,
Hold the pup even when struggling.,
Try kibble.",How to Pick Up a Puppy2," One good way to start getting your puppy used to you is to sit on the floor and place the puppy in your lap. If you can't sit on the floor, sit in a chair, and place the puppy in your lap.Try to hold on to the collar so he doesn't run away. You can simply put a finger in the collar.

, Rub the puppy's head. Use gentle, soft strokes, running all along the pup's head. In addition, gently rub his chest. Another good place to rub is at the base of his ears.You can also talk to your pup in a soothing tone, telling it all is well, and that it is safe and comfortable.
Continue your soothing patting and talking until the puppy is completely relaxed.

, Once your puppy is relaxed, you can turn him on his back, still in your lap. Gently rub his belly in circular motions, making sure to not be too rough. You can also rub where the thigh meets the tummy.Start with short sessions first, under five minute. Get your puppy used to it.
After your puppy can relax, make the time it spends in your lap longer each time.

, You don't want to only socialize the puppy with you. You need to also socialize it with other members of the family. Additionally, try having anyone who visits the house socialize with your pup by picking it up and holding it for a few minutes.Teach them how to soothe the puppy, so it will feel safe in the person's arms.
Socializing your dog with a variety of people will help when you take the puppy out in public, as it won't be as wary of strangers. Also, it helps when you go to the vet, as your pup will be accustomed to being restrained by strangers.

, If you let the puppy down when it struggles, it learns that is the way to get down. Therefore, if your pup struggles during a cuddle session, hold on. Place his back to your stomach, where the pup cannot bite you in the face. Have a hand on his stomach, pressing it up to you and another hand on the collar.Hold the pup in this position until it calms down, then try petting it again.
However, you may not want to put friends or family who visit through a struggling pup.

, Another way to help encourage socialization is to use food. When it's time for the pup's meal, have someone touch an ear or a paw, for instance, then give the pup a piece of it's food. The pup will associate the touching with positive reinforcement."

Have a tag and collar with you.,
Have a dog carrier with you.,
Bring someone along.,
Ask about a feeding schedule.,
Complete the paperwork.,
Put your puppy in the carrier.,
Have someone sit in the back with him.,
Secure the carrier.",How to Pick Up a Puppy3," Get a tag with your contact information on it. Pick up an appropriate collar. That way, when you go to pick up your puppy, you can put it on the pup. If the pup escapes on the way home, it will at least have your information on it., While it's tempting to just hold a puppy in your lap, a puppy is safest traveling in a carrier or crate. If you can fit it in your car, you can use a crate that you plan to crate your puppy in at home. If not, consider a smaller carrier to help keep your puppy safe.Have a towel or blanket in the carrier for your puppy. It can help the pup feel more comfortable, though be aware that it may use the bathroom on the way home.

, When bringing a dog home, it can be helpful to have someone else along. That way, you or that person can sit with the puppy in the back on the way home., When you get to the place you're picking up your puppy, ask when the puppy is normally fed and how much. You should also ask what kind of food the dog eats. When you get the pup home, try to keep it on the same schedule and food, to make it less confusing for it., For adoptions and dog purchases, you'll need to fill out some paperwork. Plus, you'll need the registration for the dog. In addition, you'll likely need to pay a fee before leaving., Once you've filled out all the paperwork, it's time to take your pup home. Put the pup in the carrier you've brought, making sure the pup can sit or stand in the carrier.

, Have the person you brought sit with the puppy. Also, keep everything calm. Don't blast music, for instance, but just let everything be quiet and calm for the pup.If the pup starts whining, the person sitting with it can put his or her hand up to the gate or talk to the pup in a soothing voice.

, For a small carrier, your best option is to set it on the floor behind your seat, as buckling the carrier in could cause problems in a crash. If the carrier is larger, then place it in the back seat. The back of an SUV is not a great option, since that area is often considered a ""crumple zone"" in a crash, meaning it is the area that designers allow to crumple for the purpose of protecting passengers."

Make sure your house is ready.,
Have supplies ready.,
Talk about house rules.,
Set up the crate.",How to Pick Up a Puppy4," Puppies can and will get into everything. Therefore, you need to make sure your home is ready before you bring your dog home. That way, you protect both your new puppy and your home.For instance, you can start by sectioning off where the dog will be at first, using baby gates. You may not want a puppy in carpeted areas, for instance, as you'll need to potty train it.
Move any dangerous items out of the area. Take out any chemicals the puppy could get into or put them up high. Take out plants, rugs, and anything else the puppy could destroy or be harmed by.
Tape up any electrical so your pup can't chew on them.

, Before you go and pick up your dog, you need to make sure that you have everything you need for a dog. You'll need a food bowl, a water bowl, a leash, toys, and a crate, if you plan to crate-train your dog. A dog bed or a blanket dedicated to your dog is also a good idea., That is, establish who is going to feed him and when. In addition, decide who will walk it and clean up after it. Also, make sure you establish what rooms the puppy is allowed in.It's also important to determine which commands you're going to use. You don't want one person saying ""Sit!"" and another person saying ""Butt Down!"" for the same action because that's just confusing for the dog. Print out a list of commands to put on the refrigerator so everyone remembers., Crates give dogs a place to call their own. Plus, having a crate can help you train your puppy. If you decide to get a crate, have it set up before your puppy comes home.Pick a crate that's large enough for your dog to grow up in. When your dog is full-grown, it should be able to stand up, stretch out, and sit in the crate."

Don't pick up a dachshund by his upper body.,
Never drop the dachshund back onto the ground.,
Never make a dachshund bend or twist when you pick him up.,
Don't ignore any signs of distress from the dog.,
Show family and friends how to hold dachshunds properly before letting them play.",How to Hold a Dachshund Properly2," Many are accustomed to picking up dogs as if they were human babies by putting one hand under each of the dog's ""armpits."" However, this is unsafe for dachshunds. This puts an unnatural stress on the dog's back — the spine simply isn't built to support his long body without any other support.In general, you will want to avoid any sort of hold that supports only half of the dog's body length. This is true even if the dog is already standing on one set of legs — like, for instance, if he is propping himself up on his hind legs while looking over the top of a sofa. In this case, you'll want to lean down so that you can support his rump before picking him up.

, As noted above, dogs should be set down gently, not dropped. A dachshund's legs are very short compared to other dog breeds'. This means that they can't bend very far to absorb the shock of hitting the ground, which puts most of the impact stress on the leg joints and back. Getting rid of the dog's ""fall"" eliminates this danger.Don't trust your dog's body language here. Dachshunds don't know that their skeleton can't support falls, so they may be perfectly willing to jump out of your hands. Even if this doesn't cause them immediate pain, it can lead to painful problems if continued in the long-term.

, Dachshunds' long, slender spines are especially vulnerable to injury, which is why it's so important to keep their bodies straight when you pick them up. You will definitely want to avoid any activities that put a twist or bend in the dog's back, as this increases the stress on it and can contribute to conditions like slipped discs.


For example, one way you might accidentally do this is by scooping the dachshund up suddenly when he doesn't expect it. If you startle your dog, he may wriggle or twist out of one of your hands, putting an unnatural bend in his spine as he hangs. Make sure your dog is calm and aware of you before you attempt to pick him up.

, Dachshunds, like all dogs, are generally pretty smart about letting you know when they are in pain. If your dog looks or sounds uncomfortable when you pick him up, he probably is, so set him back down and re-evaluate the way you're holding him before you try again.


Some signs of pain in dogs are obvious, like yelping, whimpering, etc. However, others a little more subtle. The following are nonverbal signs that a dog may be uncomfortable:Trembling (without another explanation, like coldness)
Trying to get away
Unnatural amounts of affection or aggression
Holding the mouth closed (rather than having a natural, ""happy"" look)

, Nothing's more frustrating than when you take the time to learn how to hold your dachshund properly, only for well-meaning relatives to come over and treat him like an ordinary dog. To avoid problems, be sure to educate any visitors about the proper ways to hold your dog before they play with him.


This is especially true for children, who can sometimes be too rough with dogs by accident. It's a wise idea to supervise children when they first interact with your dachshund until you're confident that they know how to play safely.

Place the other hand around the dog’s hind quarters.,
Lift the dog straight up.",How to Pick Up a Small Adult Dog2," If you are trying to lift up a small adult dog that is injured, you should move carefully around the dog. Make sure you are standing behind the dog with your legs hip width apart. Then, crouch down so you are at the dog's level.When you are crouching behind the dog, you should observe any sensitive areas on the dog and avoid touching these spots when you lift them up. If you notice bandages around the dog’s ear, for example, you should make sure you avoid touching that spot when you lift the dog up.

, Place your non-dominant hand under the dog’s head, cupping their chin in the crook of your arm. You may then place your fingers on top of the dog’s head or around the side of their face.Be careful not to put your hand too close to the dog’s mouth, especially if they appear agitated or upset when you touch them. Hold your fingers in a fist if you want to keep your fingers out of the way.

, Use your dominant hand to support the dog’s hind quarters. Cup your hand under the dog’s butt, using your open palm as a support. Make sure you have a good hold of your dog’s hind quarters with your hand.If you are not comfortable lifting the dog with your hand, you may slide your arm under the dog’s hind quarters and use your arm to support this area.

, Once you have a good hold of the dog with both hands, raise the dog up from the crouching position. Lift with your legs so your lower back is protected. Keep the dog close to your chest as you raise them up.


You should be able to carry the injured dog a short distance using this hold.
If the dog has an injury on one or more of its limbs, you should try to put the dog down on a safe, solid surface as soon as possible, as carrying the dog for a prolonged period of time can make the injury worse.

Crouch to one side of the dog.,
Keep the dog calm using the leash.,
Place one hand under the dog’s head.,
Put the other hand around the dog’s abdomen.,
Pick up the dog and bring it to a safe place.",How to Pick Up a Small Adult Dog3," Start by standing to one side of the dog. Make sure the stray dog is not displaying any signs of aggression, such as growling, baring its teeth, or barking. If the stray dog seems docile, you can crouch down beside the dog and position your legs hip width apart.Do not touch or pick up a stray dog that appears aggressive towards you or others. You may be putting yourself at risk of injury if you get too close to an aggressive stray dog.

, To keep the dog calm and make sure you are not at risk of injury, you can use the dog’s leash as a makeshift muzzle. Make sure the leash is clipped onto the dog. Then, bend down at the waist and wrap the leash one to two times around the dog’s mouth. Keep the leash firm but not too tight around the dog’s mouth. Throw the rest of the leash over the dog so it is out of the way.If you do not want to muzzle the dog but need to keep the dog calm, use your non-dominant hand to grab onto the leash right at the dog’s collar. Hold the leash firmly at the dog’s collar with your hand so the dog cannot move around.

, Once you have calmed down the dog using the leash, place your non-dominant hand under the dog’s head. Support the dog’s neck and head in the crook of your arm. Make sure you keep the leash in your hand as you do this so the dog cannot move around.Wrap your hand around the dog’s head or keep your hand away from the dog if you are worried about the dog nipping at you.

, Wrap your dominant hand around the dog’s abdomen, supporting the dog with your arm and hand. Your arm should be between the dog’s back legs to ensure they are supported.You should have a good grip on the dog’s abdomen, enough that you could support the dog’s weight with your arm and hand.

, Once your hands are in position, rise from the crouching position using your legs to lift yourself up, keeping the dog close to your chest area. You can then hold the dog comfortably in your arms and bring them to a safe place nearby.You may keep the dog in the makeshift muzzle or hold the dog at the collar as you hold them until you find a safe place to put down the dog.

Use a towel or short leash.",How to Pick up a Dog Properly," Most people should avoid lifting a dog of 40 pounds or greater by themselves. Every person will have his own weight limit for lifting, so please think of the safety of your pet and yourself when deciding to pick up your dog.


Animals will struggle more if they feel like they may fall because they are not supported properly or you are fumbling to hold body parts.;
, Even if your dog weighs less than 20 pounds, it's important to pick him up carefully. Locate your dog's chest right behind the dog’s front legs. Support the dog here when you start to lift. Use your right hand to hold on to the dog’s collar or leash. This keeps him from running away and lets you control his head. Bring your left arm over the top of your dog’s back and lift him from under the chest.Bring the dog under your left arm or “wing.” Hold him to your body to minimize wiggling.

, If your dog weighs more than 20 pounds, pick him up with one hand under his neck and the other scooped under his rump. At the same time, lift like you're lifting a board.For dogs over 40 pounds, get another person to help. One person will be at the head of the dog with one arm under the neck and the other under the chest. The other person gets a hand under the belly and their other hand scoops under the rump. Lift at the same time.


The person at the head of the dog will “call the shots” and give directions when to lift at the same time. For instance, you can count to “three” and lift the dog together on “3.”

, For a dog in advanced pregnancy, one that has an obviously distended abdomen, avoid the belly area. Lift from under her neck/chest and under the rump. Or, if you suspect your dog has an injured back, lift the dog keeping its back completely level and straight from under the neck and the rump.


Definitely get another person to help. This will keep everyone safe.

, Don’t forget to bend at the knees and lift with your legs. Don't bend over the dog to protect your back from injury. Place your arms around your pet to securely lift the dog.


Bending your knees will bring you closer to the dog’s level. This means you won't be leaning over the dog which most dogs find frightening.

, Try to avoid picking up your dog when he's jumping all around and wiggly. You may have to work on training your dog to be calm.


Establish a routine and begin short training sessions. Begin by keeping your dog in a seated position for several minutes. Gradually teach him to lay down. Practice having these calm periods of time., If you have to pick up a wiggler, use a short leash to keep a hold your dog. Or you could place a towel over his head and use it to hold his limbs.


If your dog is actually injured, protect yourself by muzzling the dog (with an actual muzzle for dogs or use a leash to wrap around the snout). At least use a towel over the dog’s head before you pick up the dog.

In turn, his ‘fight or flight’ response will be activated, causing him to turn and run away from you. Staying still will allow him to see that you are not a threat to him.If he approaches you when you are standing still, allow him to smell you.Do not hold your hand out for him to sniff it. He may bite your hand out of fear.Resist the temptation to pat your leg to get the stray dog to come to you. He may interpret that as a threatening movement.Even if the dog is displaying aggressive behavior, remember that he is likely more afraid of you than you are of him.;
, Depending on how long the dog has been a stray, he may been called repeatedly by people—even his owner—trying to catch him. Over time, he may have developed a negative association to being called. Thus, if you call him to get his attention, he may run off in fear.If you are trying to get his attention, consider using noises that are more calming, such as clearing your throat or faking a sneeze.You could also lick your lips or yawn to convey that you are not a threat to him., If the stray dog is demonstrating erratic or aggressive behavior and you become fearful, fight the temptation to run away. If you start to run, chances are good that he will chase you. In addition, if you run away from him, you will have your back to him, which will put you in even more danger.If you want to distance yourself from him, walk away slowly and do not turn your back on him., If you are uncomfortable around the stray dog, or are unsure of the safest way to catch him, call your local animal control or a professional dogcatcher. Provide as much information about the dog as you can, such as the location of the dog (e.g., landmarks, street signs) and his breed. If you can, send photos of the dog to the animal control center or professional dogcatcher.Leave your phone number with the dispatcher, and inquire about how long it will take someone to come to you. Keep your eye on the dog until help arrives.Make your own safety a priority—do not attempt to interact with a stray dog that is displaying erratic or aggressive behavior., Food is a great way to encourage a stray dog to come closely enough to you to catch him. Fill an empty, crinkly bag of chips with treats that a stray dog would likely love, such as hotdogs or bits of pizza.Where the dog can see you, loudly crinkle the bag and drop the food on the ground.Pretend like you are picking the food off the ground and eating it yourself. The stray dog will likely become curious at your actions and begin walking toward you.To appear less threatening, sit on the ground while you are enticing him with food.Be aware that stray dogs may have a decreased sense of smell. Therefore, he may not be enticed by the food, no matter how tasty or smelly it is.If you are driving and happen to see a stray dog by the side of road, pull over safely and try to entice him into your car with food.

, A dog catch pole is a humane way to catch a stray dog. However, you should use it only if your own safety will not be at risk when using it. Before trying to catch a stray dog in this way, set up a crate nearby in which you can place the dog after catching him.


Make the crate comfortable by setting blankets inside of it, along with some food and water.
If you can entice the stray dog with food, allow him to come closely enough to you where you can quickly hook the pole around his neck.Move him quickly to the crate when you have hooked him. Release the pole when he is safely in the crate.Do not make eye contact with the stray as you are catching him.The stray would perceive this as a threat.
If your local pet store does not carry dog catch poles, ask the store’s staff about where you could purchase one.

, If you are not able to transport the stray dog to an animal shelter yourself, call your local animal control center. If you were able to entice the stray dog into your car with food, call animal control immediately. It can be dangerous to drive with an unrestrained stray animal in your backseat., Traps come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations.A store that sells hunting equipment will likely have traps available for purchase. If you do not want to purchase a trap, consider calling your local animal shelter or animal control center to inquire about renting or borrowing a trap.When asking someone for help to obtain a trap, provide as much information as you can about the dog. This will help you select the appropriate trap size and configuration.

, The trap should be in an area where the stray dog frequents.Ideally, this area should be where the stray dog would be comfortable approaching without feeling threatened.In addition, you should place the trap where you could monitor to it without trespassing on personal property or being otherwise obtrusive.Set the trap on a firm, flat surface., It is important for the trap to be inviting to the stray dog. If he does not feel comfortable around it, he may approach it but not walk in it. For example, cover the trap with blankets—this will help him feel safer when he steps inside of it.Also, place several layers of blankets on the bottom floor of the trap for increased comfort.If you set the trap directly on grass, place a sturdy waterproof barrier under the trap to keep water from getting in and soaking the blankets.A dog-catching expert could advise you on what type of barrier would be best.
Place tasty food in the trap. Examples of good food include pizza, hot dogs, and various meats (e.g., boneless chicken, beef, liver).
Hide the trap mechanism with blankets. The trap mechanism is like a hill. If the stray dog sees it, he will not step on it. With enough blanket cover, he would step on the mechanism and not even realize it, thus securely trapping him within.Clear away any objects (e.g., rocks, pinecones, leaves) from the trap entrance that could prevent the door from closing.Set the trap out when the stray dog is most likely to start roaming: dusk, dawn, or midnight., Be sure the trap closes properly before leaving it for the stray dog. To test the trap, use your hands to apply pressure to the trap mechanism. If you have a dog that is a similar size as the stray, have him walk into the trap.If you think the stray dog is too small to set off the trap mechanism, place an extra weight (e.g., rock, brick) on the side of the mechanism., Check the trap the day after you have set it up for the stray dog. If you see him in it, contact your veterinarian, a local animal shelter, or your local animal control center for further instruction. If you are able, transport the stray (still within the trap) to your veterinarian, shelter, or animal control.If the stray is not in the trap when you check it, prepare the trap again for another day.
Keeping your eye on it will be important to keep other animals from going inside the trap. If other animals are in there, the stray dog will likely not go near it., In many places, you cannot automatically assume ownership of a stray dog.There are several ways to report that you found a stray dog: contacting your local animal control center or animal shelter, putting up ‘Found’ signs throughout your community and in your newspaper, and posting a picture of the dog on animal rescue sites (e.g.,https://www.petfinder.com/)., If the stray dog has a collar with an identification (ID) tag, look for his name, along with the name and contact information of his owner. If you do not see an ID tag, take him to a veterinary clinic, animal shelter, or animal control center where he could be scanned for a microchip.If you can obtain the owner’s contact information, contact the owner immediately to let him or her know you found his or her dog. You can then arrange a time and place for the owner to pick up the dog.
You should make every effort to reunite the stray dog with his original owner.

, If you are unable to find the stray dog’s owner, but do not feel like you can care for the dog, transferring him to animal shelter or animal control center may be a reasonable option. However, either of these places will likely have significant budgetary and resource limitations.Animal control centers or shelters may not be able to house rescued animals for long time periods, and may have a policy to euthanize animals who are not claimed or adopted within a certain timeframe.Research different shelters to find out which ones have available space. You may also want to consider transferring the stray dog to a ‘no kill’ shelter.

, Adoption is another option if you are not able to locate the stray dog’s owner. Before claiming ownership, there will likely be certain requirements you will have to meet. For example, you would need to wait for a designated holding period—the period during which the dog’s original owner can claim him.Ask at your local animal control center or animal shelter about how long the holding period is.If the owner has not claimed the dog within the holding period, you would proceed with establishing yourself as the legal owner of the dog. You would purchase a collar and ID tag, make sure the stray dog is properly vaccinated, and have him licensed.Consider the expense of adopting the stray dog, especially in terms of veterinary care. You would be responsible for veterinary care expenses, so determine if you would be able to take on this financial commitment before deciding to adopt.If you decide to adopt, create a comfortable and stress-free home environment for the stray dog. It is also important for you to show him love and attention, and allow him the space and time to become more comfortable with you., Stray dogs are usually hungry,so you may be very tempted to start feeding him. Apart from enticing him with treats, feeding him may not be a good idea for several reasons. For example, a stray dog has likely become accustomed to eating scraps or hunting for his food. Feeding him commercial dog food may lead to digestive problems.The stray dog may have rabies. If he bites you when you are offering him food, there is a real danger of rabies transmission."

Erratic behavior could be a sign of rabies.Growling or snarling would indicate that he is feeling aggressive.The dog may tense his muscles or walk stiffly if he is fearful.;
, Observing the dog’s body language is a good way for you to decide if you can, or should, catch him. If the dog is fearful, but does not seem threatening or overly aggressive, you may be able to catch him. However, if his body language suggests that he is not afraid to attack or bite, contact your local animal control or police to catch him.


Call the police if you are in a rural area where there may not be an animal control center close by.When you contact the authorities, provide as much information as you can: your name and number, and precise information about the location of the dog (e.g., landmarks, mile markers, road names).Also, ask for an expected time of arrival.If you can, keep a close eye on the dog until the authorities arrive.

, If you see the dog in a populated area, such as a neighborhood, consider asking some of the residents if they are aware that a dog is missing.If no one is aware that a dog is missing, recognizes the dog, or knows who the dog’s owner is, you will need to proceed with either catching the dog on your own or contacting the local authorities.


If you see a dog that looks lost in a neighborhood, it could be that he has wandered only a short distance away from his owner’s house., This is particularly important if you see a dog by the side of the road and want to get him in your car. Because the dog is already in ‘fight or flight’ mode, attempts to catch him may cause him to run into traffic and possibly get hit by a car.Try to create a barrier between him and oncoming traffic using such materials as a crate, a long piece of cloth, or a length of rope.Signal to oncoming traffic to drive around the secured area to keep both you and him safe.It may help to put your hazard lights on.
If you see the dog in a neighborhood, use tasty dog food lure him to a contained area, such as a fenced-in yard, where he could not easily escape.You may need the assistance of several people to do this. Keep in mind that it will be difficult to move him to another area if he is not comfortable with you.

, Your ability to catch the dog will depend on how comfortable he is with you. If your first move is to walk towards the dog, no matter how slowly and carefully, you will probably scare him off.Rather, you will need to present yourself as non-threatening from a safe distance away.


Consider licking your lips or yawning.Act like you are eating food off the ground. Crinkle an empty bag of potato chips and, with the dog watching you, pretend that you are dropping food on the ground and kneel down as if you were eating the food. Say ‘Nummy!’ as you are ‘dropping’ the food.Sit down on the ground, or maybe even lie on your back if it is safe for you to do so.The closer you are to the ground, the less threatening you will seem to the dog.
Once the dog sees that you are not a threat, he may approach you simply out of curiosity., Even if your intentions are good, some of your actions will probably stir up the dog’s fear and adrenaline and cause him to run away. For example, do not the call to the dog.Chances are that people have been repeatedly calling to the dog in attempts to rescue him.


Being called to yet again will make the dog even more fearful.Avoid patting your leg or walking towards him.Do not make eye contact with the dog., Although the dog may no longer be frightened of you, he may still be wary of approaching you. One of the best ways to get him to walk towards you is with tasty morsels of food, such as hot dogs, canned food, and meat-based treats.The trick is to give the food to him in small bits—this will keep him wanting more.If you give him a big chunk of food, he may just take the food and run away again.Soft food with a strong aroma is ideal.You can either toss the food towards him or hold the food in your hand. Either way, try to appear disinterested in the food—your disinterest will likely pique his interest.If the dog refuses to come closer to you, you can either contact the local authorities or try to catch him in a humane trap.

, Provided the dog is willing to come close to you, you can try to catch him with a leash. Before you put the leash on him, leave it limp on the ground for him to approach and investigate it.Keep feeding him tasty food and showing him you’re not a threat.


When you go to put the leash on him, you will need to be calm and swift. Any sudden or jerky movements could make it very difficult for you to get the leash on.It may be helpful to make the leash into a slip lead by threading the clasp through the leash’s handle and placing the large loop of the leash over the dog’s neck. By creating a slip lead, the loop will automatically tighten as the dog tries to pull away from you, giving you a little more control.If the dog refuses to let you put a leash on him, stop immediately and call animal control or the police.Do not risk injury to yourself.

, Once you have caught the dog with a leash, check to see if he has a collar with an identification tag.If he does not have a collar, then a veterinarian or animal shelter staff can scan the dog for a microchip.A microchip is a small chip placed under a dog’s skin, usually between the shoulder blades. The chip's number links to an electronic database that has the owner’s contact information., If you are able to get the dog safely in your car, take him to a veterinarian or animal shelter right away.Dog owners commonly go to animal shelters when they have lost their dog,so you may prefer to take the dog to the nearest animal shelter first. The decision is up to you.


You may need to put some tasty food in the backseat of your car to lure him in.
Do not attempt to transport the dog if he becomes agitated once he is in the car. His agitation could make driving very dangerous for you. Keep the car doors closed and contact the local animal control or police to come pick up the dog., If you were able to catch the dog, you will now need to decide what you are going to do with him. As heartwarming as it may sound to adopt him, you should first explore your different options. One option is to surrender him by taking him to an animal shelter.


If you surrender him to an animal shelter, the shelter will place a ‘stray hold’ on the dog before making him available for adoption. This holding period, usually between three and 10 days, is a legal obligation that ensures the dog will not be adopted out if his original owner claims him within that timeframe.Surrendering the dog at the animal shelter may make it easier for his owner to find him.Be mindful that your veterinarian’s office may not be able to house the dog. In fact, some veterinary offices serve as pick-up locations for animal shelters., If you choose not to surrender the dog, then you will need to foster him temporarily and attempt to find the dog’s owner. In most places, you are legally obligated to do your due diligence to locate the dog’s owner before rehoming the dog.The amount of time required to search for the owner may vary by location. Check with your local animal control about the requirements for your city and state.


Your efforts to find the dog’s owner must be documented.Contact your local animal control center or animal shelter if you decide to find the dog’s owner on your own. This lets them know you have the dog in case the owner contacts them.If the dog has an identification tag or microchip, contact the owner directly.
If you cannot contact the owner directly, post flyers in different locations (e.g., veterinary offices, supermarkets, newspaper). The flyers should have a picture of the dog, information about where and when you found him, and your contact information.Do not include every detail about the dog on the flyers. That way, when people start to contact you, you can ask more specific questions to identify the actual owner.Consider posting the dog’s information on animal rescue websites, such as Petfinder., If the period of due diligence has passed and you are unable to locate the dog’s owner, begin to find the dog a new home, whether it’s your home or someone else’s. If you want to adopt him, you will need to prove that you are his new owner by obtaining a new license, collar, identification tag, and providing proof of vaccination.If you have other pets, consider if they would get along with the new dog. The time you spent fostering the dog would have let you observe the interactions between the dog, your current pets, and other household members.
If adopting the dog will not work for you, work on finding another owner for the dog. Take him to your veterinarian for some initial care (e.g., vaccinations, deworming), then start putting the word out in the community through friends, neighbors, and social media.Contact local animal shelters and rescue groups for help with finding a new home for the dog."

The first thing that you’ll need to do is to make sure you have all of the things you need to take care of your puppy.At the very least, you’ll need to buy puppy food, food and dish bowls, collar and ID tag, leash, dog bed, toys, and treats.
Make sure to include your puppy’s name and your phone number on your puppy’s identification tag. You may also consider including your home address.
Choose a dog food that is intended for consumption by puppies because these foods are specially formulated for growing puppies who need extra energy.
You might want to get one dog bed for the living room and one for your bedroom if you plan on letting your puppy sleep in your room at night.
You may want to purchase a crate if you plan on crate training your dog. The crate should be big enough for your puppy to stand up and turn around in comfortably. Remember that your puppy will probably grow quite a bit in the coming months, so you may have to purchase several different ones to accommodate its changing size.;
, Start preparing your house for your puppy by putting puppy pads down. Whenever your puppy goes to the bathroom off of the puppy pads, scold it. The puppy should not use the bathroom on the floor.Setting up puppy pads is a great way to start house training your puppy.

, Puppies are cute, but they get into everything. You need to make sure that there is nothing within reach that could potentially hurt your puppy. Spend some time putting all chemicals and food products up out of reach so your puppy can’t get to it.This includes things like cleaning products, hair products, car maintenance supplies, and other food goods that could harm your puppy if ingested.
You may also want to hide all electrical cables to the best of your abilities. You don’t want your puppy to chew on it and get electrocuted.

, Having a puppy is a big responsibility that can affect every single person who lives in your house. Make sure each person is aware of how you expect them to treat the puppy and what each person will have to do in order to care for and train the puppy.


Make it clear that you don’t want to feed the puppy human food from the table because you don’t want to train the dog to beg for food.
Talk to your roommates or family members about letting the puppy outside to use the bathroom whenever the puppy goes near the outside door.
Make sure everyone knows that puppies often bark and howl during the night, but they usually grow out of this within the first couple of weeks.

, Put the puppy pads near the door you use to take the dog outside to the bathroom. When the puppy uses the puppy pads, pet the puppy and give the puppy a treat. If the puppy starts to use the puppy pads all the time. you can start taking puppy pads away one at a time. Soon you can take the puppy outside to let it go to the bathroom outside all the time.Remember to take your puppy outside to use the bathroom regularly. The puppy pads should just be there for cases of emergency when the puppy can’t get your attention. You want the puppy to learn to go to the bathroom outside, not just on the puppy pads.

, If your puppy starts ripping up or chewing on the furniture, spend some time playing with. Destructive behavior usually means that your puppy is full of energy and needs to get it out.Take your puppy for a walk or spend some time playing with it using a chew toy. You can even just chase your puppy around the room.

, When the puppy starts to rip up the furniture, give it a timeout on the dog bed or in a kennel. Over time your puppy will learn that you don’t want them to engage in these behaviors. Taking away your attention will be a good punishment to help the puppy learn your expectations.If the puppy still doesn't listen after the timeout, then put it outside for a while and scold the puppy.

, Use positive reinforcement to help your puppy learn what kinds of behaviors are acceptable to you. When your puppy does something you like, give it a treat or praise the puppy. Pet it and love on it so that you can help build the bond between you and show the dog how to act.Don’t yell at your puppy, especially for something that happened hours ago that you just found out about. Your puppy won’t have any idea what you are yelling at it for.

, A puppy needs a well-balanced diet in order to maintain a happy, healthy life. They usually need to be fed more frequently than adult dogs. Consult your veterinarian for breed-specific recommendations regarding how much you should feed your puppy.6-12 weeks: Puppies this age need to eat food that is specially formulated for puppies to meet their nutritional needs. Feed your puppy around four times per day, with serving size varying depending on the breed and size of your puppy. During this time, you can add a little milk or water to the puppy food to moisten it.
3-6 months: Decrease the feeding schedule to three times per day, but continue with the same serving size, as recommended by your vet.
6-12 months: Begin feeding your puppy twice a day and begin transitioning to adult dog food.

, Regular access to drinking water is one of the most important things you need to give to your puppy. Make sure that there is always a bowl of water that your puppy can drink out of.You may want to have a backup source of water available too in case your puppy knocks over the other bowl of water.

, Puppies need love and affection to grow up and turn into well-rounded loving dogs. Spend lots of time with your puppy so you can build a strong bond between the two of you. Cuddle your puppy and let it sleep on your lap. Show the puppy that you love it and make it feel safe around you.Take your dog with you when you go places – like in car rides around town, to your friends’ houses, or to the park.
But never leave your puppy in a hot car unattended.

, Puppies have a lot of energy, so you need to spend a lot of time expending that energy through exercise. Take your puppy on a walk or to the dog park. You can even just run around your house with the puppy.Taking your puppy to the dog park will also help socialize your puppy with other dogs. This means that your puppy will probably get along better with other dogs as it gets older.

, Raising a puppy requires a great deal of patience and love. Give your dog time to learn how to act and interact in its new home. Try to understand that, even in the most frustrating moments, your dog is not actively trying to upset you.


Try your best to remain calm, even when your puppy doesn’t behave the way you want it to. Remember that the dog wants to please you, but it just needs a bit of time to learn how to fulfil your expectations.

, When you get your new puppy, you need to take it to the veterinarian to get some puppy shots. This will probably require several trips, but it is one of the most important things you need to do for your puppy’s health.Puppy shots help protect your dog against diseases like canine distemper, hepatitis, heartworm, corona virus, parvovirus, and rabies.
Puppies usually need shots at 6-8 weeks, 10-12 weeks, 14-16 weeks, and then annually after that.

Bend down to the puppy’s level.,
Place one hand under the puppy's bottom.,
Place one hand under the puppy's chest.,
Rise up slowly to a standing position.,
Speak in soothing tones to the puppy.,
Avoid picking the puppy up by the scruff.,
Expect the puppy to go limp.,
Release the puppy if you feel resistance.",How to Carry a Puppy1," Approach the puppy from the side of their body, so that you don’t pose a head-to-head threat. Slowly bend your knees to the ground or lower yourself into a squat when you are near the puppy. Hold a few moments in this position with your hand extended to let the puppy sniff you a bit.If the puppy acts agitated at this point by growling or attempting to bite, you may want to wait a few minutes and then approach again.;
, Gently slide one hand around the rear area and under the tail of the puppy. You want the puppy’s behind to rest firmly on your forearm and hand. It is important that you place both hands on the puppy at the same time. Move in a deliberate and efficient way., At the same time, slide your other hand across the puppy’s chest to support its back and front body. If the puppy is squirming a bit you can also move your hand into the space between its front legs and use your forearm to help with the holding as well. If you do this, slide your other arm further around the rear to provide a counterbalance on the outside of the puppy’s body.Most people prefer to carry using their dominant arm and hand to hold the front part of the puppy. This can give you better control over the head area too.

, Push up from your knees at a snail’s pace. Moving too fast at this point can startle the puppy. As your rise, pull your puppy’s body towards you until there is no space between you. Cradling it against your body will have the effect of adding even more stability (and a sense of comfort for the puppy too).As you start to walk, keep the place slow as well and try not to multitask while holding the puppy. You don’t want to run the risk of dropping it while you are distracted.

, It may be helpful to say calming statements, in a soothing tone, throughout this process. Dogs and puppies often respond positively to their owner’s voice, in particular. You might say, “It’s okay,” or, “Be calm.”

, In the past, many people would pick up a puppy by grabbing a handhold of neck-scruff and lifting. This practice has gone by the wayside as can be potentially harmful to a puppy. It is also a bad idea to “shake” or “alpha roll” your puppy with their scruff to ensure submission.Do not pick your puppy up by the forelegs either. This offers no spine support and can contribute to a host of health problems for those breeds that suffer from genetic joint problems., As you lift and carry your puppy you may observe that it goes almost completely limp, relaxing its body against yours. This is a good thing and is part of the natural process. The puppy may assume that you are protecting it in some way and doesn’t want to inhibit your progress by squirming., If the opposite occurs and your puppy acts agitated try to calm it for a few seconds and then gently bend back down toward the floor. When you are close to floor level slowly set the puppy down so that it stands upright."

Find the cow or heifer.,
Observe what stage of birth she's in.,
Restrain the cow, if necessary.,
Clean your hands and arms from your shoulders down.,
If the calf is in normal position or in a position where you can pull from, put a set of calving chains or a rope (not twine, as twine is often too thin and too sharp to be used on a calf) on the front legs of the calf.,
Once the calf is out, you must try to get it breathing right away.,
Once the calf has given signs that it is breathing and alive, carry or drag it to a pen with clean straw, then let the new momma cow out to be with her young.

,
Leave the cow and her newborn calf alone for a while to allow the cow to mother-up to the calf, clean the calf off, and urge him to start nursing.",How to Help a Cow Give Birth," Usually a female that is in labour will go find a secluded spot away from the herd to calve out. Make sure, during the defined calving season, that you have the heavily pregnant cows close by so that you, nor they, have a long distance to travel in case any of them need assistance.;
, A female that is in her first stages of birth will be pacing around, getting up and laying down repeatedly. When she is very close, you will see a water sac hanging down from her vulva: it's a yellowish spherical sac. Usually, soon after you see the water sac, both the front feet will appear, soon followed by the nose. A calf in normal presentation will have the base of the feet pointing to the ground. If the base of the feet are pointing up, then you have a breach calf.


If she has been in that position for the last hour or two, and hasn't progressed any further, then it's time to get her in the head gate and help her out.

, If she's down on the ground and is tame enough to let you near to start to help her pulling out the calf, then you can do the assistance right there. If not, if you have a head-gate set up nearby, get her in that where you can easily and quickly pull the calf. If you don't have a head gate, use a gate (preferably 10' or more) to restrain her. However, a head-gate is a more safer and better option for calving out cows, because it prevents them from backing up on you if they start to panic.

, If you have shoulder gloves on hand, then you should put those on. After you have put some lubricant on the gloves, reach inside the cow or heifer (through the vagina or birth canal, not the anus) to see how the calf is positioned.



For backward positions, don't bother trying to twist the calf around. Put the calving chains on (with the handles) or a good flexible rope and pull the calf out as quickly as you can. But only do this if the hind feet are presented.

For breach positions (where the calf is arriving tail-first), you will need to bring the hind legs up so that they are positioned in the birth canal. To do this, push the calf forward into the uterus as much as you can. Next, push the flexed hock outward (or away from the calf), and swing the flexed fetlock (of the foot) back inward. Keep the fetlock and hock joints tightly flexed and bring the fetlock joint and foot over the pelvic brim (which is towards you) into the birth canal. Repeat with the other leg. Then put the chains or rope on and start pulling.

For head-back or head-down positions, push the calf back into the uterine cavity, cup your hand around the calf's nose and with the other holding the calf stable, bring the head to the normal position. If you can't quite reach the head, you can hook your fingers in the corner of the calf's mouth to bring it part way around. Then you can do the rest as explained previously to bring the head around.

For fore-leg-back positions, push the calf back into the uterus, grasp the upper leg and pull it forward enough to bring the knee forward. Then flex the knee tightly and pull it forward. With the knee now tightly flexed, cup the hoof with your hand and gently but firmly bring it up to normal position.

For bent-toe or caught-elbow positions, you will need to push the calf back to reposition the foot or elbow. For the bent toe, pushing the calf back may help correct the malpresentation itself. For the caught-elbow, when you have pushed the calf back into the uterus, grab the leg that is more back than the other and pull it forward. Once corrected, the calf should come easily.

, Use a double half-hitch knot to put the chains on: one loop on the fetlock, the other just below the knee. Pull out and down when the cow is straining, and rest when the cow is not straining. If you have a calf-puller handy, use that too, though be careful of how quick you pull the calf out, as you could easily cause more damage if not handled correctly.



The calf puller should have the U-shaped part braced against the rear of the cow, with the chain attached to this part up behind the base of the cow's tail, with the calving chains that are attached to the legs of the calf, and the leaver to ratchet the calf out upwards. Tighten up the tension on the chains. Once you have reached tension, ratchet slowly, and work with the cow's contractions. Once you have made more tension to ease the calf out, move the puller down then back up, then increase the tension again. Repeat until you no longer need the puller (which is when the calf is half-out), then quickly unhook the chains from the puller and do the rest by hand.

, Clean out the calf's nose with your fingers to get all the amniotic fluid out. Tickle it's nose with a clean piece of straw or hay, put some water in its ears to make it shake its head, or if necessary, you may have to perform artificial respiration to get the calf going. A calf should start to breath within 30 to 60 seconds after birth.

,, Make sure there is some hay and water for the cow to keep her happy while she gets to know her new youngster.

Place the puppy in a small basket.,
Put the puppy into a dog sling.,
Use a dog backpack.,
Place the puppy into a travel carrier.,
Be mindful of the time.,
Avoid makeshift carriers.",How to Carry a Puppy2," Many people will use a modified basket to carry their puppies as they ride on a bike or take a brief walk. Just make sure that the basket isn’t too large and that the puppy can reach its head out for air and to look around. Practice with your puppy at home before taking basket-riding public.It is best if you buy a basket specifically designed to carry an animal. These will often come with some sort of safety leash or instructions regarding safe use.

, This is a piece of fabric that you position and wrap across your body. You then place the puppy within the fabric in front of you with its head peeking out. The way that you wrap the fabric around your body provides a tightness that will then serve to support and hold the rest of your puppy’s body.These can be purchased in pet stores and look very much like slings used to hold babies. In fact, some people say that you can use baby slings to hold puppies--just be very careful to watch for head clearance.

, A dog backpack is exactly what it sounds like, although they can come with a variety of modifications. Look for a backpack that is the most comfortable for you both. It needs to be adjustable so that you puppy won’t sink down in it and lose airspace. It should also be at least partially machine washable.One drawback to using a dog backpack is that you lose visibility of your puppy while they are on your back. You can remedy this by wearing the backpack on your chest instead. Or, you can wait until your puppy is large enough to see if you turn your head around while wearing the backpack.

, If you will be carrying your puppy onto a plane, train, or other moving vehicle you may want to use a soft-sided travel carrier. This carrier will give your puppy a bit of room while providing protection at the same time.Check your airlines website for exact size requirements and restrictions regarding pet carrying cases.

, If you choose to carry your puppy in a carrier, be aware that it is only a matter of time before it will need to use the restroom. You can get a general estimate as to how long your puppy can wait by adding a 1 onto their age. So, a 4-month-old puppy could probably wait for five hours, although a quicker break would be better., If you have a small puppy it may be tempting to simply place it in your purse and go, but that can be quite dangerous. Your puppy can suffocate or ingest dangerous materials while sitting in your purse. Puppies can also simply fall (or jump) out of makeshift carriers.

Fulfill the parental role by carrying your puppy.,
Enhance your puppy's socialization through touch and carrying.,
Protect your puppy from disease.,
Prevent your puppy from becoming exhausted.,
Use carrying as a puppy selection tool.",How to Carry a Puppy3," The puppy period lasts up until three years of age, and during that time they will expect their owners to take on the role of “mom.” This means giving affection and discipline, but also protection. When a puppy is picked up it often assumes that a danger is nearby and that you are taking it to a safer place. So, picking up and carrying your puppy is an expected and important part of their development., Holding your puppy is also a good way to increase its ability to tolerate and enjoy social interactions. Puppies have a window for social development that closes when they turn 14 weeks old, so it is critical that they are handled a great deal early on in their lives. Puppies that aren’t socialized properly can turn into aggressive and fearful adult dogs.To get the benefit of socialization, however, you must handle the puppy gently and create a positive memory of human interaction., Carrying your puppy is also a way to take it into public in the early months of its life before it is fully protected with vaccinations. Many vets will suggest that you either keep your puppy indoors prior to vaccinations or your carry it everywhere. The reason for this, in part, is that viruses, such as the parvovirus, can be picked up on the ground by unsuspecting puppies.The parvovirus is often spread through contact with the feces from an infected animal, which a puppy can encounter while playing on the ground in a variety of locations.

, Puppies simply don’t need to be exercised the way that adult dogs do. Making a puppy walk for longer than five minutes or so can actually be harmful to the development of their bones. If you want to walk around the neighborhood, carry your puppy for at least part of the way., It is very controversial, but some breeders and dog owners still use a puppy’s reaction to various holding positions to determine their final temperament. You can often judge if a puppy is more laid back by how they respond to your carrying attempts, but forcibly cradling a dog to watch for signs of acceptance (also known as the “Cradling Test”) is not a good idea. It can ruin the trust between an puppy and owner and make a puppy fearful."

Resist the urge to follow your dog.,
Call them with an enticing voice.,
Lure them with buzzwords.,
Run away from your dog.,
Drop to the ground, and make strange noises.,
Throw something interesting on the ground.,
Reward your dog upon their return.",How to Catch Your Dog when They Run After Another Dog or Person1," You want to keep your dog in sight, but running after them is likely to make them stray further. It will also make them think that you’re joining in the chasing game they're playing, which will only encourage them to continue running away rather than stopping., If your dog has good recall (that is, responds well to ""come"" commands), it may be enough to tell them to “come” in your calmest, “here’s-a-treat” voice. You want your voice to communicate that there will be a reward if they immediately stop their pursuit and return to you.Don’t yell or let panic into your voice since this will very likely only agitate your dog further instead of encouraging their return.

, If recall doesn’t work, try enticing them back with words they associate with their favorite things, like “treats” or “dinnertime” or “catch.” Again, keep your voice calm and friendly to make the prospect of returning more attractive.If you are trying to lure them with the promise of treats, you can also try putting your hand in the pocket where you’d normally keep them so it looks to your dog like you’re reaching for delicious rewards.

, It might seem counter-intuitive, but if your dog is chasing something, you can encourage them to chase you instead by running in the opposite direction. Be sure to make noise and flap your arms up and down as you run to make yourself as distracting as possible.When your dog gets near, simply let yourself be “caught,” and re-leash them when you are.

, Since your dog is distracted, you want to re-distract them away from whatever they’re chasing. If you behave in a manner that is strikingly out of the ordinary, you will not only recapture their attention but also encourage their immediate return to investigate what’s going on.Dropping to the ground is unusual behavior for humans. When you pair that action with an unfamiliar noise, like singing or sobbing, your dog will take note and be curious enough to find out what you’re doing.
Stay on the ground avoiding eye contact with your dog until your pooch is right next to you. Don’t make any sudden motions to capture them, since that might scare them away. Just calmly reach out, and grab their collar when they’re within reach.

, Try re-routing your dog’s chase by giving them something more fascinating to investigate. Call their name and throw something in a direction that will steer their path away from whatever they’re chasing.If you have a ball, frisbee, or other toy on hand, try throwing that to engage your dog in a game of catch or fetch. If you don’t have an obvious thing to throw, improvise by throwing their leash, your jacket, or a nearby stick or rock.

, Once you have your canine companion under control once more, greet them with love, lavish praise, and treats if you have them. That way, your pooch will associate coming back to you with high rewards, making them less likely to be repeat offenders in the future.Never punish or discipline your dog when they come back. While you may want to communicate that your dog was wrong to run away, if you scold or punish them upon their return, they will associate that negative treatment with returning to you rather than with running away from you. Thus, it will actually have the opposite of the intended effect, making your dog more likely to continue chasing things.

Follow the dog.,
Whistle or call to gain the dog’s attention.,
Entice the dog with tasty treats.,
Approach the dog from a side angle.,
Move at a medium pace.,
Entice the dog by running away.,
Ignore the dog.,
Watch for traffic dangers.",How to Catch a Runaway Dog1," If you are with the dog when it runs away, go after it and try to keep it in eye sight. At some point the dog will stop to check out a smell or dodge a person and that is a potential time to move in closer. Try not to make it obvious that you are tracking the dog or it will see your pursuit as a game of chase and run even faster., There is some controversy about this step. If you are dealing with an outgoing dog it is fine to call their name or clap your hands to get their attention. If you are pursuing a shy dog these actions can be seen as threatening and may cause it to run even more. All things considered, your best bet may be to make high-pitched yipping noises. This will make you sound like potential prey and the dog may turn around to check you out.You can also experiment with saying a few words, such as “Come,” in a low and deep tone. Sometimes this is off-putting enough to get a dog’s attention., Food is your secret weapon. Get out the smelliest, most noticeable treats that you have and take them with you on the hunt. You can simply toss a few in the direction of the dog or you could place a few on the ground and bend down to check them out. This action might trigger a dog’s curiosity and cause it to come over to see what you are looking at.If your dog makes a habit of running away it may be helpful to keep a bag of treats in your car for emergencies., Never approach a dog directly as it will cause them to freeze and then turn tail and run. Instead, try to flank them a bit and head into their peripheral vision. This may also trigger their hunting instinct and they may try to catch you instead., You may have to be a bit patient as your chase could take upwards of 45 minutes in some cases. Keep trying to close the distance between you and the dog without seeming frantic. This may mean that you maintain a brisk walk as you continually reposition yourself., Bursting out with an unexpected jolt of movement can cause the dog to take notice and try to chase you. You may get the best results if you yip a bit, jump around, and then sprint away. Run in the direction of a safe space., If all else fails you might try to adopt a submission posture, sitting on the ground and waiting for the dog to approach you. This will only work, of course, if you have the dog in your direct line of vision. Waiting the dog out can be a good option when you are trying to catch a runway dog in an enclosed area., Try to steer the dog way from busy, traffic congested areas. But, keep an eye out for your own well-being too. Some dog owners or good Samaritans have been hit by cars while trying to assist runaway pets."

Monitor animals.",How to Treat and Prevent Nitrate Toxicity in Cattle," Nitrate toxicity is basically a form of ""anti-quality factor"" that is associated with animals consuming plants that have a substance that creates health issues in them, just like with bloat is an anti-quality factor, or sweet clover poisoning, or grass/winter tetany. With nitrate toxicity, plants have to be injured by frost, hail, drought, or even sudden cool and cloudy weather conditions and grazed when the nitrate levels have reached excess to what the animals can tolerate. These plants have to be either grazed or harvested in order to have a negative effect on livestock, particularly ruminants like cattle.

Nitrate toxicity or poisoning occurs mainly in ruminant animals. When animals consume feed containing excess nitrates (NO3-), they are converted into nitrites (NO2-) by rumen bacteria. These nitrites cross the rumen wall and enter the bloodstream, combining with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin to interfere with the red blood cell's capacity to carry oxygen to body tissues.

Normally nitrites, when nitrates are at low levels in the feed, are converted into ammonia by bacteria, which is a detoxification process because nitrites are 10 times more toxic than nitrates. This detoxification occurs more slowly than the conversion of nitrate to nitrite.

When the microbial capacity to convert nitrite to ammonia is overwhelmed by the higher nitrite level in the rumen, initial development of poisoning will occur. Nitrates and nitrites cross into the rumen wall and interfere with the iron ions of the red blood cells.

The ferrous iron of hemoglobin converts into the ferric form, thus forming methemoglobin. Methemoglobin does not have the same oxygen carrying capacity as hemoglobin, thus tissues do not get enough oxygen and begin to suffer from oxygen starvation.




The change in hemoglobin in the red blood cells are affected by four main criteria:

The rate of nitrate intake (how much nitrate is in the feed and how quickly it gets consumed);
The rate of conversion of nitrite into ammonia in the rumen (or lack thereof);
The rate of digestion of feeds and the subsequent release of nitrates (which tends to occur in a positive feedback loop);
The movement of nitrites out of the rumen via feed passage rate (how quickly the feed, and the nitrates in it, enters the rumen).


A positive feedback loop occurs if the animals continuously have access to high nitrate-feed. While nitrates in the bloodstream–which do not create toxicity problems initially–can get recycled back into the rumen via saliva or intestinal secretions, and get converted into nitrites, high nitrate feeds exacerbate the problems because nitrates are continually being flooded into the system and either rapidly converted into nitrites in the rumen, or enter the bloodstream to be recycled back into the rumen again and reabsorbed into the blood as nitrites.

;
, Basically, there has to be a large application of nitrogen-based fertilizer (urea, anhydrous ammonia, ammonium nitrate , mono-ammonium phosphate, and others) or manure (primarily from horses, cattle, or pigs) to the field to increase soil nitrogen (nitrate) content and thus increase nitrate availability to the plant. When there is a high soil nitrate concentration, surplus quantities of nitrates are taken up by the plant, where accumulation occurs., A plant's metabolic activity level will influence how much nitrate is used by that plant. Nitrate will combine with carbohydrates during a plant's metabolic processes to form amino acids glutamine and asparagine. Both amino acids are the base units for all other plant amino acids and subsequent proteins. Nitrate brought into the plant accumulates in the stems and leaves when glutamine and asparagine pathways become saturated. Plant enzymes require nearly perfect conditions in order to function at or near maximum capacity. The pathway of nitrate-utilization depends on 1) adequate water supply, 2) energy from sunlight, and 3) warm temperatures. If any or all aforementioned conditions are not ideal, the rate of conversion for nitrate to become amino acids is impaired; the plant uses up all its available sugars, thus resulting in accumulation of available soluble nitrogen as nitrate and ammonia.

Plants accumulate nitrates from the soil through the roots up into the plant. Young, growing plants are more likely to store more nitrates in their stems and leaves (or rather, throughout the entire plant) than with mature plants. Most nitrate accumulation in mature plants occurs in the bottom third of the stem; almost none are found in the top of the plant, like in the grains or fruits, making any grains and seeds nitrate-free.

, Any time that plants become stressed, as in drought or with hot dry winds, when they become damaged by frost or hail, or even cool cloudy weather conditions, are most likely to accumulate nitrates. Basically, anytime a plant's photosynthetic capacity is compromised or impaired, nitrates are prone to accumulate to excessive levels.

Roots are unaffected by most climatic events, so they are going to be pumping up the same amount of nitrates into the rest of the plant as they would if the plant wasn't injured or compromised. This is what gives rise to excess nitrates after a plant is stressed and/or injured.
The highest nitrate accumulation levels don't peak immediately after being injured by hail or frost, but rather 4 to 5 days afterwards. Safe harvest times are the first two days after, or 10 to 14 days later.

Prussic acid can be confused with nitrates because it too is an anti-quality factor, mainly associated with warm-season grasses. However, prussic acid peaking times are different from nitrates in that they peak immediately after a plant feels stressed where photosynthesis is impaired, and go back to normal levels two weeks after.



, Several cultivated crop species and weed species are commonly known as nitrate accumulators.


Cultivated crop plants:

Barley (as greenfeed)
Oats (as greenfeed)
Wheat (as greenfeed)
Corn (standing grazing)
Rye (as greenfeed)
Triticale (as greenfeed)
Sorghum (standing crop for grazing; prussic acid also a problem)
Sorghum-sudan grass (standing crop for grazing; prussic acid also a problem)
Johnson grass
Sudan grass
Millet (most species/cultivars)
Tall Fescue
Crabgrass
Bermuda grass
Rescue grass
Rye grasses
Beet tops
Flax
Canola plants



Weed plants are:

Bull Thistle
Russian Thistle
Canada Thistle
Kochia
Lambs quarters
Mustards
Pigweed
Smartweed
Wild Sunflower
Firewood
Nightshade
Jimsonweed
Carelessweed
White Ragweed
Dock
Cud weed 
Horsenettle


Pasture plants, and all legumes (cultivated crops and perennial forage) including alfalfa are significantly low to non-risk for nitrate accumulation. Most pastures are not fertilized heavily enough or see excessive amounts of manure to pose a nitrate toxicity risk. However, the risks shouldn't be ignored especially if pastures are grazed or managed so that they see plenty of manure (at least 50 lb per acre) being deposited annually.
Access to nitrogen-based fertilizers can also induce onset of nitrate toxicity, or urea/ammonia poisoning.

With the latter type poisoning, blood ammonia levels are the major cause of toxicity issues, not methemoglobin levels. Ammonia prevents carbon dioxide from being released by red blood cells. Symptoms include dehydration, abnormally high body temperatures, laboured breathing, muscle tremors, appearance of sunken eyes and looser-than-normal skin, and a fluid-filled rumen.

Drenching 4 L of vinegar into a mature cow every 20 to 30 minutes until the symptoms disappear is the best antidote for urea or ammonia poisoning.





, Sheep, goats, bison, elk, deer, and other ruminants are as likely to suffer from nitrate poisoning as cattle are. All classes of cattle, regardless of gender, age, production stage or type, are equally likely to suffer or perish from nitrate toxicity.

Sheep are the least sensitive to nitrate poisoning compared with cattle, which are the most sensitive. Sheep are more adapted to converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and nitrite to ammonia than cattle are, which is why they can be fed feeds that are higher in nitrate content.
Monogastric animals like horses and pigs are much less likely to be affected by nitrate toxicity because nitrates are converted to nitrites primarily in the intestine, which is closer to the end of the digestive tract making for reduced opportunity for nitrites to become absorbed into the bloodstream. However, nitrate toxicity in these animals is still a risk, but not nearly as significant as in ruminants.

, Feed containing 0.5% nitrates or less is generally safe for ruminants. Recent research, though has discovered that cows have had no adverse effects if nitrate levels are between 0.5 and 1%. However, subclinical or chronic nitrate toxicity can develop when levels get between 0.5 and 1% so you need to be cautious when feeding out feeds that contain these nitrate levels, especially with animals that have not become acclimatized to nitrates that are above even 0.5%.

If you are interpreting two other test methods besides the percent of nitrates (as %NO3), such as Nitrogen Nitrate (%NO3-N) or Potassium Nitrate (%K-NO3), then the values are slightly different. The maximum allowable %NO3-N is 0.23%; safe levels are 0.12% or less. Between these two values, you must be cautious with feeding nitrate-heavy feed. Maximum allowable %K-NO3 is at 1.63%; safe levels are at 0.81% or less. Like with nitrogen nitrate, you must be cautious with feeding any feed that comes back with %K-NO3 levels between 0.81% and 1.63%.
The dangers with nitrates exist especially when animals are not acclimatized to being on such feeds. When animals are slowly introduced over time, they can slowly become acclimatized to eating feed that is even at least 1%, but the thing that must be remembered is very slow introductions to such high-nitrate-containing feed!

, Acute toxicity signs and symptoms include rapid and weak heart-beat, subnormal body temperature, muscular tremors, weakness and ataxia (as in staggered gait, disorientation, etc.). Brown/bluish-grey mucous membranes, excessive saliva and tear production, laboured and rapid breathing, frequent urination, as well as vomiting (more common in monogastric animals), diarrhea or scouring, and an inability to get back up from laying down are also frequent. Death soon follows within a few hours after animals have been fed.

The main cause of death is via asphyxiation with a lack of oxygen being supplied to bodily tissues.
Subacute nitrate toxicity is often corresponding with abortions, reduced weight gain, reduced feed intake, reduced milk production, increased susceptibility to illness and infections, and reproductive problems such as silent heats and reduced fertility. Often signs and symptoms of subclinical or chronic nitrate toxicity go unnoticed or are not related to feed quality.

Animals can go without showing signs of distress for several days to several weeks while consuming nitrate-containing feedstuffs. By this time they can appear belligerent, uncoordinated (especially hind-quarters), develop diarrhea, eye lesions, and symptoms similar to pneumonia, such as interstitial pulmonary emphysema (fluid accumulating in the lungs). Prolonged exposure to nitrate-containing feeds coupled with cold stress and poor nutrition can lead to downer cow syndrome.

At this time, cows are also likely to abort or give birth to stillborn calves, regardless of the stage of pregnancy they are in.





, The section above has already mentioned that feeds with high nitrate levels (above 1% NO3) can kill an animal in a matter of 2 to 3 hours after feeding. With beef producers who only see their animals once a day or once every few days, the only symptom that producers can go off of to tell if their animals have nitrate poisoning is if they have dead animals. Dairy producers are more likely to catch their cows before it's too late, When animals are exhibiting signs of laboured, rapid breathing, bluish-grey mucous membranes (lips, tongue, and nose), weakness, rapid and weak heart rate, lethargy/depression, excessive salivation and tear production, and a staggered gait and disorientation, you may have animals with nitrate toxicity on your hands.

As mentioned above, you may be feeding feeds that have nitrates that are less than 1% as tested, and may not see any symptoms develop until days or weeks after the start of feeding that nitrate-containing feed to your animals.

, Keeping them on that nitrate is only exacerbating the problem, not solving it. Removing them from the feed will help get the nitrates and nitrites eventually out of their system, allowing the microbes in their rumen to catch up to converting the nitrites to slightly less harmless ammonia and urea., They will need to come out to assess and confirm that you indeed have animals with nitrate poisoning, and if you have dead livestock, to perform necropsy/autopsy on them., This is a very dangerous situation because the nitrites in the system are already taking up valuable oxygen, making it difficult for the animal to breathe. If the animal is pushed too hard, this could cause a ""downer cow"" situation that needs to be remedied faster than ever. Move them easy and slowly, and let them take their time to get them where you want to go.

Do not move any downer animals, as this will also cause more stress to their system than they're already going through with the bad feed.

, Methylene blue needs to be mixed with distilled water or isotonic saline to be effective, and should be given at a dose of 4 to 22 mg/kg or more (or 0.004 to 0.022 cc per kg of body weight (if using pounds, remember 1 kg = 2.205 lb)), depending on the severity of poisoning. Lower dosages may be repeated in 20–30 minutes if the initial response is unsatisfactory. If additional exposure or absorption occurs during treatment, re-treat with methylene blue every 6 to 8 hours must be considered. Rumen cleansing (via drenching or tubing) with cold water and antibiotics may curb the continuous microbial production of nitrite.

The lower dosages of methylene blue can be used in all species, but only ruminants can safely tolerate higher dosages.

, But keep the animal in a smaller corral so that you can keep an eye on it, and others that have been treated, for the next 24 hours or so., While doing so, severely limit how much they get daily, and feed another nitrate-feed for the time being., You may need to re-test your feed, or purchase additional feed to hold them over for the rest of the winter.

Cows can become acclimated to high-nitrate feeds, but only if they are introduced to the forage slowly over a few weeks at a time.

, As already mentioned in the ""Learning About Nitrate Toxicity"" part above, nitrate accumulation happens anytime a plant feels stressed and when photosynthetic capacity is impaired. The highest risk for nitrate accumulation occurs when plants are stressed or damaged by hail, frost, or drought. Less often, except in warmer locations, will excess nitrate accumulation be more often associated with damp weather and cool temperatures (at 55ºF ).

Nitrates are always going to peak a week (or around 5 days) after being injured, before returning to normal levels 10 to 14 days after which the injury occur.

, As mentioned already, nitrates are not going to peak immediately after the event their photosynthetic abilities become compromised, so a narrow window to harvest or graze occurs immediately after the frost or hail event. This window is generally only 1 to 2 days long. After that, do not harvest nor graze until two weeks after the event has passed.

If you decide to wait a week after, you will instead target a time when nitrates are going to be at their peak and at the most dangerous levels for your animals.

It is an opposite story with plants that are also affected by prussic acid levels; Prussic acid will peak immediately after a frost, hail, very hot or suddenly cool weather event, and go back to normal after a week.

Warm-season grasses like bermuda grass, sorghum, sorghum-sudan and others are the greatest risk for prussic acid poisoning to livestock.




Frost events can be tricky with regards to nitrate accumulation. A light frost (-1 to -4ºC) will allow plant tissues to recover, but killing frost (-5ºC or lower) will outright kill a plant. The trick to remember with killing frosts is that if they occur a week after the latest light frost, nitrates are going to be ""locked in"" to the plant material, or stay put in the plant material no matter how much time has passed. However, if a killing frost occurs two weeks after the last light frost, then the nitrate risk is going to be low to non-existent because the plant material will be dead, so much that nitrates are not likely to accumulate in the tissues.

Nothing can be done to the plants if a killing frost occurs a week after the last light frost, because the nitrates are going to be there in the dead plant tissues. Same thing with harvesting; if you've harvested forage with potential for nitrate accumulation a week after a hail or frost, you will be ending up with feed material with higher nitrates than what your animals, if unacclimatized, could handle.
If the killing frost happened two weeks after the last light frost, then you shouldn't have to worry about excess nitrates in the feed. A killing frost destroys plant tissue and membranes so that nothing can be drawn up from the roots; harvesting and grazing can commence for as long as necessary.

This is all in a perfect world. Ideally, though, Nature doesn't do what we expect, so precautions should be taken before harvesting or grazing by testing first, or severely limiting the feed until test results come back showing nitrates are at safe levels to increase amount fed.





, Crops that have seeded out and are at almost the stage where seeds have matured are less likely to have nitrates throughout the plant than with immature, growing plants. Seeds and fruits have virtually no nitrates in them. Mature plants, however, do have nitrates in the lower one-third of their stem., When baling up crops for greenfeed, moisture level should be less than 18%, otherwise the bales will heat. Heating exacerbates the nitrate levels, turning the nitrates into nitrites which could make the feed much more toxic.


Ensiling crops or even making bale silage will not reduce nitrate levels if the silaging process is done properly. Nitrates will decrease if silage wasn't packed or sealed properly, but this also leads to a decrease in quality in the feed.

Crops that are ensiled with a high soluble sugar content (like with cereal grains) undergo a rapid fermentation process. The rapid drop in pH, though, does not promote the rapid degradation of nitrate during ensiling. Rather, the nitrate levels in the silage as it is being stored will either not change or possibly go through some conversion of nitrate to nitrite. It is best to grab samples as the feed is coming to the pit or bunker and send it in to a lab that will test for both nitrates and nitrites.



, When manure or nitrogen applications are applied at 50 to 100 or more pounds to the acre, nitrates are more prone to accumulate than if less fertilizer/manure was applied, or even none at all. When nutrients are applied at less than 50, and the crop is harvested at or close to maturity, then there's a chance that the growing crop will have used up most of the nitrates--converted to ammonia, which is used for making amino acids that the plant needs--during growth, and little is left when crops are damaged by frost or late-season hail. However, hail and drought damage earlier when plants are growing will be of more concern during the growing season., Methods to test depend on the type of feed you have. If you have bales to be tested, use a 36"" bale corer. Deeper samples need to be taken if you have a silage pile, at 4 to 5 feet deep. If you are testing standing plants, take 10 to 15 plants from the field in random places, cut them 4"" above the ground surface, and bag them up. Taller plants with thick stems will need to be put through a wood-chipper or silage harvester, and gather a collection enough to fill about half a bread-bag or so.

Swathed plants make it easier for gathering; just pick several random points in the field to take some plants from and bag them up.
If you cannot send a sample in right away, put it in the freezer to keep for longer.
Your local fertilizer dealership will know where to send samples for nitrate testing. You can also contact your local ag extension service to find out which local feed-testing laboratories you can send your samples to.
As mentioned in the first section above, there are three testing methods for nitrates: %NO3, %NO3-N, and %K-NO3. The 0.5 to 1% levels are from the %NO3 method. With %NO3-N, levels should not go above 0.23%. The method of testing %K-NO3 dictates that any levels below 1.63% will cause issues.You may also be able to purchase nitrate test strips to use to test your feeds. Normally these strips are used for water, but they can be used on dried-down feed samples that are soaked in waterIf using reading in terms of mg/kg or ppm, note that 10,000 ppm or 10,000 mg/kg = 1% NO3.



, You can either send in a sample in a vial that seals up properly, or use nitrate test strips to test the water yourself.

Fresh water from the well does not have nearly as significant a risk of nitrate (or rather, nitrite) toxicity problems as with water from dugouts, ponds, depressions, or any water-collecting location that receives runoff from the feedlot area. Certain species of algae growing in water supply can also produce nitrates that may have levels that can be problematic for livestock.

, How much to limit depends on how heavy in nitrates the feed is and how acclimatized your animals are. If your animals are not acclimatized to high-nitrate feeds, then they will need to be fed nitrate-rich feed at lower levels. For unacclimatized animals (from Midwest Laboratories on Nitrate Toxicity and Nitrate Poisoning in Cattle University of Florida):

0.0 to 0.3% NO3 is considered safe to feed under all conditions (frost, hail, drought).
0.3 to 0.6% NO3 is safe for mature, non-pregnant animals under all conditions, but limit to 50% of total dry matter of ration to pregnant animals and very young animals.
0.6 to 0.9% NO3 must be limited to 50% or less of the total dry matter in the ration
0.9 to 1.5% NO3 should limit to 35 to 40% or less of total dry matter in the ration; subclinical affects in unacclimatized animals may be seen in a few weeks (or 6 to 8 weeks) following the start of feeding feeds with this level of nitrate.
1.54 to 1.76% NO3 should not be used on pregnant animals. Limit to no more than 25% of total dry matter of the ration.
1.76% NO3 and up should not be fed. Feeds with this amount of nitrate or greater are considered toxic to livestock.

, Keeping an eye on the animals when feeding or introducing nitrate-containing feeds will help so that you avoid a potential train-wreck in the future.

You may need to improve the mineral program by adding a little more sulphur (at 0.1% of daily ration), and potassium and magnesium to avoid any nutritional problems, and reduce the risk for nitrate poisoning.
Have the veterinarian on speed-dial in case of emergencies.

Day 0 - Standing heat.,
Ovulation.,
Days 1 and 2 - Alteration of cells that line the Follicle.,
Days 2 to 5 - Growth of the Corpus Luteum.,
Days 5 to 16 - Continuation in Development of Corpus Luteum.,
Days 16 to 18 - Follicles on the Ovaries begin growth again.,
Days 18 and 19 - Corpus Luteum Becomes Non-functional.,
Days 19 and 20 - Heat again.",How to Tell when a Cow or Heifer is in Estrus2," Increased levels of estrogen are produced by a maturing follicle in the cow's ovaries. Secretions along the reproductive tract allow for easier breeding and aid for sperm to travel through the uterus to the ovum. Standing heat usually lasts for 12 to 24 hours, after which ovulation occurs.;
, The mature follicle ruptures and the ovum travels through to the fallopian tube where it awaits the arrival of the sperm. Ovulation occurs in response to a surge of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland in the cow's brain. Ovulation occurs 12 hours after the cow goes out of heat.

, These cells regenerate and grow to create the corpus luteum (CL) in the area where the mature (now dead) follicle had ruptured and release the ovum.

, The growing CL produces high levels of progesterone which causes other follicles to regress and prevent from further maturation. During the early part of this phase, a portion of the lining over the caruncles (which are small protuberances on the inner uterine wall which the placenta attaches itself during the gestation period) becomes engorged with blood and bleeding from smaller capillaries may occur. Bloody discharge may be seen 2 or 3 days after the female has experienced estrus, which is caused by the sudden decrease in estrogen in her system. If you haven't seen the cow in heat, this is as good an indication as any that she had just been in heat a few days ago.

, The CL usually maxes out growth by the time days 15 or 16 arrive. This period is called Diestrus (or, ""between estrus"") because it is the longest phase of the estrous cycle. Progesterone secreted by the CL block any LH release from the pituitary gland, resulting in the ovaries being relatively inactive. No follicles are able to mature or ovulate. The cervix is closed up tightly and there are also no secretions from the reproductive tract during this time.

, Estrogen secretions stimulates the uterus to secrete prostaglandins, causing rapid regression of the CL.

, Very little progesterone is released, which means that progesterone and other reproductive hormones are no longer able to have any blocking effect on anything else. Several follicles on the ovaries begin to grow; one becomes dominant, secreting increasing levels of estrogen as it reaches maturity.

, An increase in estrogen and corresponding decrease in progesterone brings the cow back into heat again, starting the cycle back to 0.

Walk out to the pasture or corral where you are keeping your cows and/or heifers.,
Find some place to sit where you can easily watch the behaviour of your cattle but at the same time, don't really attract the attention of your animals.,
Look for behavioral signs if estrus: (Note that the herd is highly sensitive to when even one female is in heat!),
Also note any physical signs of estrus:


Clear discharge from her vulva; the discharge would be so viscous it has the consistency of egg white.,
Record the tag number or name of the cow that is in heat or has been bred in your notebook.

",How to Tell when a Cow or Heifer is in Estrus3,"


The best time to observe any behaviours is in the morning and the evening.

, Bring your binoculars and a notepad to do any recording of what you see.

,


She may be acting restless and mooing a lot
She will be wandering around the pasture or corral in search of a mate
She may travel thrice or four times as much as she does when she's not in heat
Sniffing or nudging may occur in the vulva region between her and other cows
More vigorous interaction may be observed between that female in heat and her herd-mates, from excessive licking to even fighting.

Usually if you have a group of cows that are in heat at the same time, they will be sticking together, fighting and mounting each other.


She may attempt to ride other cattle, and stand for them to mount her. Putting her chin on the back or rump of another cow to test whether that cow will stand for her may be seen. If the cow stands, she's also in heat. If she doesn't, and turns around to give her a good bunt with her head, she's not in heat.
If there's a bull around, she will also mount the bull before she stands to let him mount and breed her. During her early heat period, she will often let other cows mount her before she lets the bull service her.

During this time, before she lets him mount her, the bull will be sniffing and nudging her vulva region, and doing a Flehmen response (where he curls back his nose, raises his head in the air as high as it can go, smelling the pheromones she's emitting in her urine and vaginal secretions). He will also rest his chin on her rump or loins to test if she'll stand for him or not.



, You will see it hanging from her vulva in a long string.
Her tail may be slightly raised and off to one side.
Her vulva will also look enlarged and swollen red.
If she's in with other cattle, the hair over her rump, hipbones and tailhead will look ruffled.
She may also have a bit of dirt or mud on the rear part of her sides from other cattle mounting her. This may not be as evident if they are out on a clean pasture with no mud patches to speak of. However, during springtime when she is shedding, there may be hair that has rubbed off from other animals mounting her, and she may have abrasions and raw areas over her tailhead and hips if she was mounted quite frequently. This usually happens when you have more than one bull in the herd and there was a bit of competition going on.
If she was actually bred, she will hold her tail out and her back will be arched for several hours or even days. This is because of the vaginal irritation she experiences from the bull thrusting his penis in her. This physical sign will usually last for 24 hours or more, especially if she's been serviced repeatedly by more than one bull.

Avoid repeat offenses.,
Keep your dog on a leash.,
Manage your dog’s environment to prevent them from chasing.,
Give your dog plenty of appropriate exercise and play.",How to Catch Your Dog when They Run After Another Dog or Person2," The more you let your dog chase things, the more they will want to repeat that inappropriate behavior. If your dog has run after something once, it’s important to prevent them from doing it again. Address the behavior immediately by eliminating opportunities to chase things and by training them to resist the impulse altogether., If your dog loves to chase things and has not yet been trained to deny that impulse, always keep your pet on a lead when they are in a public or unenclosed area. Doing so is the only way to ensure the safety of your dog and your community.

, You can head off you pooch’s inappropriate behaviors by anticipating them. If you are approaching something that you know your dog loves chasing, head in another direction or give it a wide berth.


For instance, if they love chasing cars, choose a path that will avoid traffic or drive them directly to a park where there are no cars present.

, If you give your pooch an alternative, healthier way to express their energy and instincts, they will be less inclined to go chasing after things for fun and stimulation. This means that you need to be sure that they’re getting enough physical exercise to tire them out and enough mental exercise to keep them engaged.If your dog is high-energy but has a tendency to run away, you can still exercise them by running them in enclosed, designated off-leash areas.
To stimulate them mentally, give dogs chew toys, play fetch with them, or have them sniff out treats that you’ve hidden.

Expose your dog to a chase-worthy distraction in a controlled environment.,
Remove your dog to a safe place each time it misbehaves.,
Reward your dog for good behavior.,
Practice the same exercise off-lead.,
Be patient.,
Seek professional help if necessary.",How to Catch Your Dog when They Run After Another Dog or Person3," You can stop chasing behaviors by teaching your canine to focus on you when they’re tempted by distractions like joggers, cars, or other dogs. If your dog loves to chase cats, closely manage their encounter with one. Put them securely on a leash, and lead them into a room where they can see and learn how to appropriately react to a cat.If you're worried about your dog getting loose, it might be a good idea to put the cat in crate at first so that you can protect the cat and control their encounter even more.

, If your pooch growls, barks, and/or lunges at the cat, immediately remove your dog from the room. It’s best to do so calmly but firmly and to bring your dog to a safe space like their bed or crate to reset their behavior.Once they’ve settled down, lead them back to the room with the cat to face it again. They will only learn to not react through repetition.
Do not react negatively or punish your dog for their bad behavior. It will only make them more agitated and could make their behavior worse rather than better.

, You want your dog to associate choosing the appropriate behavior with gaining a reward. Thus, as soon as your dog ignores the thing it wants to chase, you should immediately give it a treat. Each time it focuses on you instead of the cat, lavish your pooch with their favorite treats and affectionate praise., Once your dog has proven that they are able to face a distraction and not react at least three times in a row, perform the same ritual without having them on the lead until they can prove that they can control themselves without you physically restraining them.Even when your dog graduates to off-lead training, be sure that you continue to expose the dog to distractions within an enclosed environment in case they slip up.
Once your dog has one distraction (like cats) down, introduce them to a different distraction (like a dog) in the same way to ensure that the lessons are taking hold more broadly.

, Impulse control is a difficult thing to learn. Repetition over time is the only way to ensure the success of your lessons. It will take several training sessions over the course of several days (and potentially longer) to ingrain these alternative behaviors in your dog., If your dog’s chasing behavior persists in spite of your best training efforts, call in a professional trainer for a one-on-one consultation. They will assess your pet’s behavior and offer alternative techniques to control and change your pooch’s bad habits. Since chasing can be so dangerous, it’s well worth investing in a private training session or two to prevent it in the future.

Secure the leash.,
Establish a gentle fur hold.,
Offer the dog a few treats to encourage compliance.,
Place the dog in your backseat.,
Guide the dog home.",How to Catch a Runaway Dog2," When you get close enough to the dog make a slip lead with your leash and place it over the dog’s head. Use this new lead to direct the dog back to safety. If it is your dog don’t bother making collar adjustments at this point; wait until you are back in a secure location., If you are without a leash, the dog has long hair, and it is acting overly friendly you may be able to reach down and gently place your hand on its fur. Use your hand to exert slight pressure to direct the dog back to a safe direction.


With a small dog you may just be able to pick it up. However, if this is a new dog to you make sure that it is not acting aggressively before you try to lift it or you may get bitten.

, As you are securing the dog and making your way back, place a couple of treats on the ground in front of the dog. This will encourage them to keep moving and will associate their capture with positive memories instead of fearful or negative ones., If you must travel by car with the dog, gently load it into the backseat. Try to keep an eye out for any signs of agitation, such as growling. You should also note that if your dog likes riding in the car you can sometimes capture them by simply driving up and saying, “Get in!”, If you are walking home with the dog, just try to keep a moderate pace. If you go too slow, the dog may get restless and try to run again. If you go too fast, you may trigger the chase or hunting instinct as well. Aim for a brisk, determined walk.

Look in the usual places.,
Ask a passerby.,
Alert your family or friends.,
Notify a rescue organization.,
Call animal control.",How to Catch a Runaway Dog3," If it is your pet that has run off, think about where they might have gone. Is the dog park nearby? Is there a neighboring dog of interest? Consider your search diameter to be just a few miles initially, but expand it to 20 miles if your dog stays out for the entire day., Call out to other people that you see on the street and tell them that your dog is out. Or, draw their attention to the stray dog that you’ve just noticed. Make hand gestures or verbally ask them to help you catch the dog. If your dog has gone loose at a grooming facility or a similar dog-related place, go inside and ask the employees for help., Send out a quick text message or a make a phone call asking everyone to head over quickly to help. Time is of the essence, so the quicker they arrive the better. If they are also dog owners you can ask them to bring their dogs along as you may be able to use them to lure your dog back.Only use other dogs as bait if you know that they are friendly and non-aggressive. Otherwise, you could create a potential dog-fight situation.

, Search online with your location and “lost dog help” to find a rescue group near you. They may be able to lend you manpower right away or they may give you live traps to use in the long run. They can also offer some tips regarding dog behavior that may lead to an immediate recapture., This is generally a last resort, especially if the shelter performs euthanasia. But, if the runaway dog presents a mass safety risk to others, is about to be injured, or is already injured it may be a good idea to make the call. This is the case, for example, if a dog is running in the middle of a major freeway."

Mark out the area of fencing you will need in the field and/or on a map of your place.,
Buy your supplies at a local feed supply store or any other store that sells electric fence supplies.,
Clear the area of brush, grass, deadfall and trees.,
Install fence posts.,
Install the wire.,
Wrap the wire in the hooks the first insulator at least 10 times before stringing the rest along each insulator and hooking them in to each temporary post.,
Install the electric fencer and ground rod.,
Connect the lead-out wire and electric wires to the fence charger.,
Turn on the fencer, and test the voltage of the wire.,
Gather up your equipment and spare wire, posts, etc.

,
Let the animals out and watch them for a bit, especially if they don't know what an electric fence is.,
It's best to check on the wire once every couple days, or however many times you need to switch the animals from one paddock to another.

",How to Install and Use a Temporary Electric Fence for Cattle," Base your calculations and estimates on the topography and area of land you wish to have your cattle grazing on.


If you are wishing to install a temporary electric fence in a way where you can practice rotational grazing in a pasture, you will need to put posts in areas where you can both stabilize the fence and provide a point of fence-movement. You can also choose to have one or two fence lines as a more permanent electric fence and one or two corner posts as your baseline for the rest of the more temporary fence.
You will need to calculate the amount of wire needed, depending on whether you want to have it as a single-strand or a double or even triple-strand electric fence. Also calculate for the number of posts you will need, remembering that electric posts should be spaced 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) apart.;
,


Choosing the type and power of your electric fence charger is important. Don't get one that is too weak (like those used for horses), or one that doesn't carry the charge a far enough distance. For cattle, the best charger is one that carries the charge for over 18 to 25 miles (29 to 40 km). It will go up to 60,000 Volts, which is hot enough for any bovine to notice! You can choose to buy a fencer that is battery charged (you will have to replace the car or truck battery every few months or so), or a powerful solar powered fencer. Gallagher is a good electric fencing company that often has good quality materials for your electric fence; spending your money on a good electric fencer will often save on the labour of repairing broken wire!

, This will minimize the risk of shorting out the fence, thus significantly reducing the charge.

, You will need to install the more permanent posts first (i.e., treated wood posts) before you decide to put in the step-in temporary posts.


Make a corner brace (if necessary, as you may be attaching your electric fence to an existing fence line) by pounding in three posts in a right-angle form: one post with two posts 90 degrees adjacent to that post, pointing in the desired direction that the fence will be going. The posts should be 6 feet (1.8 m) apart, or as wide a part as the top post (acting as a brace) will be.


Mark the area on the post that needs to be trimmed before adding the brace. With the chain saw, cut a grove into the top of each post, going down then out, making sure each part that is cut out in each faces each other.
Put in the top brace by pounding in the top brace with a mallet, working each end until it is down snug in the grooves. Repeat for the other post adjacent to the one just completed
With high-tensile or telephone wire, make 5 or 6 diagonal loops from the top of the outside post to the bottom of the main corner post. Take a stout stick (one that is around 3 feet long) and twist the wire until you can't twist anymore (not until the wires break),locking the stick against the side of the post that keeps it from loosening the wire.


Pound in the permanent posts spaced 100 feet (30.5 m) apart, put in at almost exactly 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep. It's best to make a mark on the base of each post to get a more uniform set of posts being installed.

If you wish to make the fence so that it runs in a straight line, take a roll of baling twine, tie the twine to one corner post and run the twine from that corner all the way down to the other corner that is on the same side.


You could ignore the other steps above and get right to putting in the temporary posts. These posts don't require a post driver, since they have a part at the bottom of the posts that allow you to put your foot on it, and stand on it, using your weight to put in the posts. Make sure they are relatively straight. Space the posts approximately 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) apart.

, Depending on how many strands you wish to have for your fence, it is usually best to start from the top down. The top wire should be at nose-level with your cows (which is around 32 to 36 inches off the ground). Often the step-in posts that you bought are made so that the wire does run nose-level to a cow, making it less of a hassle to install it. Using an insulator, insert a nail through the part of the insulator that allows the passage of a nail, and pound that to the wood post. If you have installed wood posts, repeat for every post, remembering the number of wires you are planning to install.


If you are only using a single-wire fence, then the insulators only need to be installed exactly level with those step in posts, or around 32 to 36 inches (81.3 to 91.4 cm) off the ground. All three wires (if it's a three-wire fence) should be spaced around 12 inches (30.5 cm) from each other. A two-wire fence should have both wires spaced around 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart.

, Pull the wire so that it is not too taut, but not loose either. Wrap the wire at the terminal insulator on the other side of the line until either enough wire has been wrapped in it, or enough so that you can move down to the bottom insulator and continue with your bottom wires. To attach another strand of electric fence, use a reef (or thief) knot to secure both strands together.


Fiberglass posts have the kind of hooks where the wire simply snaps in.
Pig-tail posts, however, require a different way of putting in the wire. Pull the wire down so that it is just below the loop, then insert it into the loop. Then position the wire so that it goes over the hook portion of the loop. Repeat for all other pig-tail posts.
A gate is useful, especially if you have large machinery to put through to mow or hay a paddock. Allow 20 feet (6.1 m) of length between the corner post to the next post. Install eye-screws into the post at their predetermined height mentioned above. Attach insulated handles to the electric wire, using a double or triple knot to do so, and tying the wire so that it doesn't stick out when a person grabs the handles. The wire should also be tied up enough so that the wire stretches taut (not so that it reaches breaking point though), enough that you can use your strength to hook the handle to the eye-screws.

, The round rod should be pounded in so that 99% of it is in the ground, with only a couple inches poking up, enough to put the ground rod clamp on. The ground rod should be placed no more than 15 feet (4.6 m) from the electric charger, with high tensile or telephone wire running from the ground rod to the charger. The ground rod or lead-out wire should not be touching any electric wires.

,


If the charger requires a car battery, then attach the charger to the battery according to the manufacturer's instructions.
If you are using a solar powered fence charger, it may be best to locate the charger in an area of partial shade. This is so that you don't cook the charger too quickly in full sunlight, but it still gets enough of the sun's energy and light to maintain a powerful charge on the fence.

, Test at the following locations: near the fencer, mid-way down the fence line, and at the furthest part of the fence. If the power at each point is the same, then it is working properly. If not, you may have to find the source of the problem, especially if it's shorting out somewhere. Sometimes if a single strand of electric wire is touching something metal like the wire on the barbed wire fence, or even a tree twig, these need to be fixed and/or moved so that it doesn't interfere with the electric current.

,, Keep an eye on the animals for an hour or two to see how they react to the fence. When you see one or more animals touch the fence with their noses and jump back with a sudden bawl or snort, and don't see any animals that are testing the fence nor have attempted to get through because of the sudden shock they got from the wire, then you know the fence is doing its job.

Cull cattle in breeding herds if they are prone to bloating.",How to Treat and Prevent Bloat in Cattle," Also known as ""primary ruminal tympany,"" frothy bloat is primarily caused by pasture legumes (predominantly alfalfa and clovers), and other high quality forages such as young green cereal crops, canola/rapeseed, kale, turnips, and legume vegetable crops (peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils, etc.)

Rapid degradation of highly digestible plant matter will cause a sudden release of cell contents that are available for microbes to digest. This sudden increase in nutrient availability causes microbial blooms, which in turn doubly increase rate of digestion.

Soluble proteins and carbohydrates make up a large part of the cell contents, as do small particles which are actually parts of the plant cell walls these microbes attach themselves to. Any excess carbohydrates that microbes do not break down are stored as ""slime"" over their cellular bodies. This slime is highly viscous and very stable.


Microbes also release a lot of gas with fermentation and digestion of these plant tissues. But with the additional build up of slime, gas is trapped in these highly stable, slimy bubbles. Rumen pressure increases the more slime and gas is produced.

Just as with free-gas bloat below, the more pressure that builds up in the rumen, the more pressure is put on the lungs. If not treated promptly, the animal eventually dies of suffocation from not being able breathe.


Frothy bloat is also seen in feedlot cattle that have been on a high-concentrate ration for 1 to 2 months. The cause is uncertain but it's thought that certain rumen microbes may create the stable slime, or conditions where increasing feed intake of grain is done and/or grain is fed as too fine a particulate matter; this makes conditions where there's too much concentrate and not enough roughage in the diet.;
, This type of bloat is commonly associated with a blockage or something (like swollen lymph nodes) restricting the esophagus preventing the animal from normally burping up gases from normal process of rumination. Veterinarians call it ""secondary ruminal tympany.""

It is also associated as a secondary issue related to an acute or clinical case of grain overload or acidosis when a drop in rumen pH causes an inflammation of the rumen and esophagus that interferes with normal eructation (burping).
When cattle have an allergic reaction to a particular drug or substance, this can also cause secondary ruminal tympany if an animal experiences anaphylaxis as a result.
Milk fever can also create a case of free-gas bloat.
If animals are in a position where they cannot get up; like if they are laying out on their sides or have been put onto their backs for an extended time where they cannot roll over and get up (as in handling facilities, irrigation ditches, or crowded transportation vehicles), they can actually die of bloat because the rumen puts significant pressure on their lungs.

, The first and most important sign you need to be looking for in bloated cattle is an unusual distention of the upper left side (left flank) of the animal. The whole rumen may be enlarged resulting in a large distention of the left side.

The left side is where the rumen is situated, and where you are most likely to see how much an animal is bloating.

, Bloated cattle will often kick at their bellies with their hind legs, act restless (laying down and getting up frequently), defecate often, and even roll over as an attempt to relieve the discomfort., Animals will try to breathe through their mouths because it becomes more difficult to breathe with the distended rumen pressing onto the lungs and diaphragm. These animals will also have excess salivation, their tongue protruding like they are panting, and head extended to get the most air into their lungs as possible., Death can occur quickly once an animal begins bloating, but it usually doesn't occur until 2 or 4 hours after first onset.

Death occurs because of the distended rumen pushing up against the diaphragm of the animal preventing inhalation. Bloat that becomes severe enough will cause an animal to collapse and die quickly, almost without struggle.

Have a vet to come out to do a necropsy on your dead cattle to verify if they died of bloat. Regardless the cause of death, a bovine's rumen will swell after death because of the continued fermentation occurring well after the animal has died, resulting in a misdiagnosis without getting the vet to perform a post-mortem exam.


Dead animals are more likely to occur with pastured beef cattle than dairy cattle because dairy cattle are checked more often.

, The next section talks about how you can relieve bloat in an affected animal as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Treatment does depend on how severe the animals are bloated. Mild cases just need animals to move around. But severe cases will require a visit from a veterinarian as soon as possible.

, All animals, not just the ones that are bloating, need to be removed so that bloating does not progress any further that it already is.

Move them onto a non-legume pasture or a sacrifice lot area for the time being.

, Bloat cases range from mild to severe.

Mild cases show a distention of the left flank but the animal does not appear to be in distress.
Moderate cases show a more obvious distention of the rumen, particularly on the left side. Animals appear uncomfortable but are not yet showing signs of laboured breathing.
Severe cases show a gross distention of the abdomen, a lot of discomfort, and a protruding tongue with obvious signs of laboured breathing.
If you can get the animal to where you can try tenting the skin, then note that mild and moderate bloat cases will allow you to grasp the skin and tent it. You won't be able to do so with a severe bloat case.

, Tell them it's an emergency and that you need them to come out now.

Or, if you can load up the affected animalin a trailer to ship them to a local veterinary clinic, then do so as quickly as possible, even if it means having to load them up right in the pasture.

If you have chosen and have the means to do the latter alternative, then the following steps are not necessary to follow. But, if you can't ship them to the veterinary clinic, the the next steps will be important to follow to save your animals.



, There will be no possibility of being able to treat a bloated animal out in the field without restraining it in a working alley or holding chute so that it can't move back or forward or try to turn around. A squeeze chute is ideal, except in this instance squeezing the sides may help only if you can put the sides in so much that they're not going to put too much pressure on the animal's already painfully-distended sides.

It's better if the animal is standing when things like tubing, putting in a trocar, or in worse-case scenarios, doing a rumenotomy, is needed to save these animals.

, These animals have less time to live and deserve priority treatment to survive. Never hesitate to attend to these animals first.

First thing you need to do is to try to relieve the pressure with a stomach tube. The animal may have free-gas bloat that can be easily relieved with a stomach tube. Other more invasive methods, which are more effective but traumatic, should be used only if the stomach tubing doesn't work.

, The following steps are just like giving cattle oral medications, and should be followed in a very similar manner. Stomach tubing should also be seriously considered as a means to relieve gas pressure in the rumen on a severely-bloated case and should be first priority, because it is the least traumatic method available to save a bloated animal. It is a method most used and most recommended by the majority of cattle producers.


1) Insert the Frick tube into the animal's mouth. Go in by nudging into the corners of the mouth to get the animal to open its mouth. Don't really force the tube in, but only go in so much until the animal starts swallowing the tube. Keep going until there's only a little over 2 inches (~6 cm) of tube outside the mouth. Don't let go of the tube!

The Frick speculum or metal tube (a stiff 1-1/2-inch to 1-1/4 inch PVC pipe will also work) which is ground off at the ends to prevent damage to the mouth and esophageal tissues is a 3-foot long hollow tube. It is needed to prevent the animal from chewing on and damaging the stomach tube.



2) Keeping your hand on the tube, insert the stomach tube. The stomach tube should be passed through the Frick speculum into the esophagus, where it's swallowed by the animal and goes into the rumen. You can tell you've enter the rumen by the smell coming from the tube. You will not need to put the tube in all the way, rather so that about 1 m (3 feet) is still sticking out.

The stomach tube must be 6 feet (2 m) long and has an inside diameter of 1.5 to 2 cm (5/8 to 3/4 inches). If you don't have a stomach tube like that offered through veterinary supply, a 3/4 to 1-inch (2 to 2.5 cm) diameter garden hose with the metal coupling removed will work, or a 5/8 to 3/4 inch (1.5 to 2 cm) heater-hose from an auto-parts store; both with their ends ground down so that the edges are smooth.



3) Move the hose in and out to locate and free the pockets of gas in the rumen. Once the hose enters the bloated rumen the hose will become blocked with froth. You may also need to blow through the tube to free the froth from the other end.

With frothy bloat and tubing it may be next to impossible to reduce the pressure. It's a different story if your animal has ""free-gas bloat."" With free-gas bloat, once the tube enters the rumen the gas is quickly released in less than a minute.



4) Administer an anti-foaming agent. Attach the free end of the hose to the drenching gun and pump the mineral oil-water mix (or straight mineral oil; ideal dose is 300 to 500 mL (10 to 12 oz. per dose)) into the rumen.

5) Remove the stomach tube, then the metal speculum. Release the animal when done, but keep it in an area where you can keep an eye on it for the next few hours. You may need to repeat after a few hours.

, In these situations, though the animal is showing signs of laboured breathing and quite distended, he doesn't appear close to death quite yet. Also, a trocar is necessary when a stomach tube is not enough to expel the gas in the rumen (next steps below).


1) Make a small incision into the skin in same area as the previous step. The incision should only be 1 centimetre (0.39 in) long so that the trocar and cannula can be placed into the rumen. The hole also needs to be small enough so that the cannula will stay in.

2) Insert the trocar (cannula attached) through the abdominal muscles into the rumen through the hole just made with your knife. Grasp the top of the handle of the trocar and with one move inward, punch through the abdominal muscles into the rumen.

This will take a concerted effort (done right and only once) because the abdominal muscles are not soft like cookie dough. It will hurt the animal, but remember this is done not for the purpose of hurting the animal, but rather to save its life.



3) Remove the trocar and leave the cannula in the hole. Doing so allows the froth and gases to escape from the rumen. Some cannulae offered are plastic with ridges around the top so that once the rumen is punctured, the cannula is screwed into the animal so that it cannot come out. This is an advantage over the

4) Insert a piece of wire 1 foot (30 cm) to 2 feet (61 cm) long to stir the froth. The froth tends to be quite thick and heavy (or viscous) and difficult to break up, which is the reason why it's been hard for the gases to escape from the cow normally, without any human intervention. Stirring the froth will release some more gas and help break up the bubbles.

5) You may need to administer an anti-foaming agent directly into the rumen through the cannula. Use a drenching gun to do so, adding around 2 US gallons (7.57 L) directly into the rumen. Adding an anti-foaming agent will help break up the bubbles a lot quicker.

6) Leave the cannula in place for several hours, or a few days if the animal keeps having bloat issues. Check the animal and the cannula regularly for any blockage that can occur when the froth solidifies via drying when exposed to air. Check with the vet as well, as you may need to inject an antibiotic like penicillin to ward off infection. Infection is inevitable with having a cannula in the animal for several days.
7) Have the vet out to remove the cannula and suture up the damaged tissues.
The trocar and cannula method may be less traumatic than a rumenotomy, but it's completely understandable if you are reluctant to do this method, even if you fully understand it means saving your bovine and not deliberately hurting it. Have a vet to come out and do this method for you. They will certainly show you what needs to be done and how to properly do it should you need to perform this procedure yourself in the future.

, When the vet is not close by and the animal is so severely bloated that you think you might lose him soon, then you will need to grab a very sharp knife and perform a rumenotomy to relieve the pressure and save the animals life.

The procedure you will have to do in an emergency situation is not going to be painless for the animal, but when it comes down to needing to save his life versus causing him more pain than he is already in with a nasty, bloated stomach ache that is progressively suffocating him to death, ethics should tell you that saving his life should be of far greater priority over being scared of causing an animal pain.


Do not be reluctant to have to perform the following procedure. It's a matter of life or death!!



1) Make a quick incision 6 centimetres (2.4 in) to 12 centimetres (4.7 in) long into the skin over the midpoint of the left flank. This region is also known as the hollowed triangle past the ribs and in front of the hip that can be easily found in a non-bloated bovine.
2) Continue to make the cut through the skin, through the abdominal muscles, and then into the rumen.

3) Stand aside when you cut into the rumen because there will be an explosive release of gas and rumen contents that will hit you if you are standing in the way! This will give the animal quite the relief, and allow him to breathe freely again.
4) Have the veterinarian clean the wound and do the standard surgical procedure of suturing up the rumen wall, abdominal muscles and skin to prevent peritonitis (toxic effects of stomach contents inside the body cavity).
This method is quite traumatic for the animal, and even the person having to do the procedure. If in doubt, contact your local bovine veterinarian and have them walk you through the procedure, or hope the animal will live long enough for the vet to come out to do it for you.

, Move on to the next animal with a bloat problem. But if you only have one, that's great. Just keep an eye on this animal for the next few days to see if bloat is recurring or if anything else needs to be done.

Keep your vet on speed-dial just in case anything goes wrong or if you have any questions that need answering right away.

, Before you introduce animals to an alfalfa pasture, no matter the quality, make sure they are filled up on hay first (alfalfa-grass hay preferably; or have free-choice access to hay) before introducing them onto an alfalfa stand.

When moving to a new pasture, move the animals when they don't appear interested in what's on the other side of the fence.

, You need to make sure your animals have a uniform and regular intake of legume forages both day and night. Do not use intermittent grazing (removing them at night and putting them back on in the morning or even mid-day) because this will encourage sudden bloat-outbreaks.

Researchers studying bloat actually use intermittent grazing to encourage bloat outbreaks for their studies. Intermittent grazing causes sudden outbreaks because the animals are taken off high-quality forage for several hours and then receive a sudden influx of high-nutrients when they go back on. This sudden introduction to high nutrient forages causes bloat.
It is impossible to control conditions where grazing will be interrupted by adverse weather (thunderstorms, hail, etc.), biting insects, or terrible heat waves that forces animals into the shade during the day. Animals will alter their normal grazing habits so that grazing is more shorter and intense, creating bloat issues.

In these instances, animals will need to be monitored and possibly even fed hay along with their grazing so bloat issues are reduced.



, If livestock where put onto a legume pasture where they could select-graze what plants they wanted to eat, bloat problems could arise.

Situations where animals have not yet acquired a taste for alfalfa and are continuously grazed will select first mostly grasses and other plants and try to avoid most alfalfa. When these plants have been depleted, they will then target the alfalfa, and as a result will bloat. This can happen a few days to a week or so after being introduced onto a legume-mix pasture.
With rotational or management-intensive grazing, livestock are managed so that they will graze a paddock every one to 3 days. This discourages selective grazing by the animals, and encourages leaving behind plant residue, especially when a ""take-half-leave-half"" system is used.

It's important to move cattle to a fresh paddock when they are not hungry, or do not appear interested in moving to a new forage stand. Doing so encourages plant residue to be left behind after each move. You can never really have too much residue left behind after grazing, because it's better to have ""lots"" behind that could be grazed more, than to move them when there's almost nothing left, and as a result they're quite hungry for the next paddock.



, Cattle tend to eat more in the morning than the afternoon, and heavy dew in the morning also increases rate of digestibility, which increases the likelihood for bloat., Pre-bloom or vegetative alfalfa and clover are a significantly higher risk for bloat than more mature plants. If you take a piece of stem and leaf in your hand of immature alfalfa and roll them into a ball, then squeeze, you will find that a lot of juice and froth will come out. This is a sign that it is very highly digestible. Plants that are in full bloom are higher in fibre and less digestible, thus lower risk for bloat., Lower moisture reduces bloat incidence., Check with your local veterinarian or livestock-farm supply store for an anti-foaming agent that can be given to cattle. Bloat Guard is one product that may be readily available. The detergent ""poloxalene"", the active ingredient in Bloat Guard, has been found to be very effective at controlling bloat. (It's not guaranteed to prevent bloat when offered free-choice when mixed with grain because of variable intake levels and time period between visits.)

Alfasure is another product offered via prescription from your vet that is effective at bloat-control.
Free-choice trace mineral salt may also help reduce bloat incidences.

, Bloat-safe legumes include cicer milkvetch, birdsfoot trefoil, sainfoin, and fenugreek. While these legumes are harder to establish than alfalfa or clover, once established they can be managed so that they help with reducing or eliminating bloat altogether in your animals.

For example, a stand that is at least 60% legume and 40% grass with the legume component made up of 25 to 30% sainfoin in an alfalfa-sainfoin legume mix will be enough to reduce bloat by as much as 98%. Sainfoin has condensed tannins that bind to proteins in the rumen and prevent their degradation by rumen microbes.
A legume stand made up predominantly of non-bloating legumes will also work well.

, You may have a stand that is predominantly clover and alfalfa and want to increase the amount of grass in there. Options to do so is to apply nitrogen fertilizer, seed grass into the existing stand, or heavy-graze the legumes.

Nitrogen fertilizer will encourage grasses to outcompete the legumes, and cause the legume nodules to be ""lazy"" and fix less nitrogen as a result.
Seed down grasses when stand has been grazed heavily or cut low, and harrow after to encourage seed-to-soil contact. Adding nitrogen to the stand will encourage existing grasses to also grow. Auto-toxicity from existing alfalfa plants will not affect the germinating grasses.
Heavy grazing will negatively affect the alfalfa plants. Impact to the roots and not allowing plants to reseed themselves can reduce alfalfa stands in the pasture, but increase grass. Be careful about overgrazing, though.

, Feedlot finisher rations should include at least 10 to 15% roughage. Grains should never be finely ground to where it is good for pig or chicken feed, instead they should be rolled or cracked., Current studies have shown that bloating is heritable, can can be reduced in a breeding herd by culling out those animals that have bloated, if natural occurrences haven't taken care of some of those animals for you (i.e., animals die of bloat).

Culling is less possible if you have a herd were culling is not an option, such as if you are custom-grazing or -feeding cattle. Careful management needs to be implemented to reduce risk of bloat in cattle. See the bulleted tips above.

Know the symptoms of Acute Acidosis as described below.,
Treat the cattle that are suspected to have acidosis, if you can before they up and die on you.,
It is best to visit your vet as soon as possible to get a proper dosage and any other necessary additional treatments needed.

",How to Treat and Prevent Acidosis in Cattle1,"



Symptoms: Cattle with acute acidosis may go into shock and die suddenly due to a result of overwhelming increase in acidity in the rumen.

Those that do not die quickly are listless and often lethargic, and wander aimlessly around the pen, or just simply don't get up from lying down. They also often appear weak and anorexic and dehydrated.
Related health problems may occur from an animal having acute acidosis. Rumen lining may be damaged from the sudden drop in acidity leaving the lining of the stomach to be damaged, causing rumenitis, or an infection of the rumen wall. Inflammation also occurs in the abomasum and intestinal walls, often destroy the villi that are responsible for nutrient absorption from the digesta.

Poor feed efficiency, slow growth, poor weight gain or a drop in milk production is often a result of this inflammatory damage.


Occasionally acidosis is responsible for a suppressed immune system which may prevent an animal's ability to ward off infection from airborne or communicable viruses or bacteria.
Founder (also called Laminitis) and bloat are also a result of this metabolic disorder.

Founder often leaves cattle permanently lame. This is a serious case for young bulls that are being feed-tested prior to sale, more so than in dairy cows or feedlot steers/heifers.
Bloat is a serious disorder that disables a bovine to release any gases that have built up in the rumen. The rumen can engorge so much that it crushes the lungs and eventually asphyxiates cattle if not treated immediately.


Liver abscesses are also common in cattle that had acidosis. Reduced feed intake, feed efficiency, weight gain and carcass yield is often a result of abscesses in the liver.

Liver abscesses often cannot be seen until the animal is slaughtered. Abscessed livers are condemned at slaughter, because they are not deemed safe for humans to eat.


Polioencephalomalacia (not related to the paralyzing human version of polio) is also a concern for cattle that have had acidosis.

;
,


Thiamine is often a highly recommended injection to give to cattle with acute acidosis, as it is very important in treating and stopping a sudden acidosis attack. Acidosis very often halts the production of thiamine through digestion, and an injection of Thiamine will reverse this process.

Baking soda will also work as a treatment for cattle with acidosis.

Order your blood test kit and have it shipped to you.,
Confine and restrain the animal.,
Raise the tail and locate the coccygeal blood vessels underneath the tail.,
Clean the area to be sampled.,
Insert the needle directly into the vein.,
Draw slowly back on the plunger of the syringe.,
Remove the needle the same way you inserted it.,
Take a rubber-capped test tube (called a ""vacutainer tube"") and insert the needle into the top of the cap.,
Label the tube.,
Put the tube back in its place.",How to Take Blood Samples from Cattle1," The number of samples that need to be taken should be one per bovine. Thus, the number of tubes needed will depend on how many animals you need to draw blood from.
, It makes taking blood much easier and safer for both you and the animal if the animal is confined to a head-gate or squeeze chute. For this method, a head-gate with a neck extender isn't really necessary., The tail needs to be raised right up in the air so that its perpendicular to the ground. The blood vessel of choice is located under the tail, which is where you will be taking blood from.

Note though that the vessels actually form an upside-down V from either side of the anus up a couple inches the tail. Where the V ends and the vessels continue parallel to the length of the tail is where you should take your blood sample from.

, Because the sample is being taken from under the tail, close vicinity to the anus, bacteria from feces could potentially contaminate the sample if the area is not swabbed with alcohol first. A cotton ball dipped in 70% rubbing alcohol will work, just by holding the cotton ball to the opening of the bottle and tipping the bottle nearly upside down to wet the ball. (You can also use a 4x4 gauze.) Rub, in an upward motion only away from the anal region, the area you will be inserting the needle into., The needle needs to be carefully inserted perpendicular to the angle of the tail; but not all the way in.

It is easier to put the needle in perpendicular to the tail rather than try to put it in parallel because it may be more difficult to puncture the vein when the needle is at more of an angle to the vein than when it's 90-degrees to that vein.
Use a short needle: an 1-inch, 18-gauge needle is good enough for this job. And as mentioned, only insert the needle slightly over half-way in, never all the way.

The syringe accompanying the needle should not be more than 5 cc; but, there's nothing wrong with having a 10 cc syringe, just note that you don't need to fill it up completely with blood.



, Allow 3 to 5 mL (or 3 to 5 cc) of blood to enter the syringe. Most labs only need a small amount of blood to do the test and to have some left over in case the lab technicians make a mistake., Apply pressure to the area to stem excess bleeding with a gauze or cotton swab. Then lower the tail when bleeding appears to have stopped., The vacuum-sealed tube will vacate the contents of the syringe without you needing to apply pressure to the plunger. Remove the needle when all contents have been vacated., The vacutainer tube must be labelled with the identifying number and/or name of the animal, sample number (Sample #1, 2, 3, etc., or Sample A, B, C, etc.), and name of your farm., Usually the box that contained the kit has a built-in tray to place the vacutainer tubes in. Place the tubes in that box with the bubble wrap surrounding each tube to protect them."

Fit him with a nose ring.,
Establish your position as the boss.,

Never treat a bull as a pet.,
Be safe.,
Have correct fencing.",How to Handle Bulls Safely and Responsibly," If your bull doesn't already have a nose ring, contact an experienced livestock veterinarian to add one. Handle the bull using a bull staff, a pole that snaps onto the nose ring and gives you more control and safety. Optionally, you can use a lead; however, bull staffs give you more control and are recommended, especially for dominant bulls.
, Stay calm and assertive at all times, and never hesitate. As with most animals, a bluff of dominance and superior strength can result in the bull regarding you as the leader; this must begin when the bull is young. Never engage in play with a young bull; this will encourage a belief of superior dominance. If your bull exhibits signs of dominance, seriously consider the most safe and responsible choice of selling him to a more experienced handler. Signs of dominance in bulls include:


Head butting/shaking; rubbing his head on the ground.
Pawing the ground.
Showing his side.
Staring directly at you.

, Bulls are not pets, and should never be considered as such. Recognize that by taking responsibility of a bull, you are dealing with an animal that is ten times your size and a hundred times your strength. Bulls may grow to behave compliantly, especially if these steps are taken, but this does not, under any circumstances, mean he is less likely to attack (and subsequently possibly kill) you., Never turn your back on a bull, and always carry a means of protection - examples are an axe handle, piece of PVC pipe, baseball bat, or a sorting paddle (with beads that make noise when the paddle is used). When feeding, feed from the other side of the fence; feed can inspire dominant behavior. Always be aware of exits when handling bulls!

, If bulls are trained to recognize electric fencing, two-strand electric fences can work. However, a more durable fence would likely be one with 2 1⁄2 inch (6.4 cm) pipe rails or 2x6 planks. Consider using electric fences in more isolated areas, and a durable fence for places where the bull getting loose would cause more damage. Exits should be easily available and well-maintained.

The most obvious preventative measure is to not have cattle on grain in the first place.,
Feeding grain often cannot be avoided, though, so gradually increasing the grain ration over time is the best way to prevent acidosis while still feeding cattle grain.

,
Always include roughage with the grain diet you are giving your cattle.,
Often Nature-caused interruptions like storms, hot- or cold-spells, and extreme weather, or change in schedules such as being handled or hauled to a new farm or ranch can cause cattle to reduce their feed intake or stop eating all together until the danger has passed.",How to Treat and Prevent Acidosis in Cattle3," This is because grain is not a natural diet for cattle, and often causes more issues and illnesses than grass or hay does. This is often one faultless preventative measure that a lot of producers can (and do) fall back on.

,, This helps with ease of digestion in the rumen, and also prevents the microbes in the rumen from digesting this high-concentrate ration too fast.


Roughage should not be finely chopped, as this will often defeat the purpose of preventing acidosis. Coarsely-chopped (or not chopped at all!) roughage is best.

, Then they over-eat to compensate for the loss of diet they missed during this interruption. Often during extremely hot spells cattle won't eat during the day, then eat their hearts out at night when it's cooler.


Thus, try to keep feeding schedules as routine as possible and keep feeding to several times a day to keep cattle from getting hungry between meals.

Assemble the needles with the needle holder (optional).,
Ready the double-pointed needle with a clean needle for blood-drawing.,
Restrain the animal.,
Find the jugular furrow and ""tap"" the jugular vein.,
Put the blood-letting needle into the vein.,
While the blood-letting needle remains in the vein, attach a vaccutainer tube to the needle on the inside of the double-needle holder (see step 1).,
Once you have obtained your sample, remove the vaccutainer tube from the needle-holder unit.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Cap the outside needle, and remove it into a biohazard disposal box.,
Label the tube.,
Place tube back in the box.,
Repeat for other cattle.",How to Take Blood Samples from Cattle2," You must use a fresh blood-letting needle for every cow, for reasons that include you make sure each needle is sharp for a clean puncture into the vein, and so that you don't risk contaminating the samples between animals. Assembling the needles just makes it easy for you to grab the next needle after disposing the last one just used.

The double-pointed needle holder is designed so that one needle is on the outside, as the ""blood-letting"" needle, and the other needle, pointing the opposite way, is housed inside a short open-ended tube that is wide enough to insert a vaccutainer test tube while keeping your fingers safe.

, Make sure you also have a needle inside the holder ready for the tube. Make sure you have the cap on the outside needle you will use to puncture the jugular vein., Just as in the method above, the animal must be restrained in a head-catch or squeeze chute for the safety of both the handler and the animal.

While the animal's head is caught, use a rope halter to tie the animal's head off to one side, exposing the side of the neck.

, The groove beneath the muscle of the neck (which is the top half to two-thirds of a cow's neck) is where the jugular vein can be felt. With the fingers pf one hand apply pressure to the jugular vein lower down on the neck, right below the biggest bulge of the neck muscle; with the other stroke the grove by starting from the start of the groove at the head and moving your hand downwards to almost your other hand. This will encourage the vein to pop out more, and make it easier for you to do the next step.

The jugular vein is actually quite large and especially noticeable when animals have their summer coat. You may even be able to see it pulsating if you look carefully.

, Keeping the fingers of one of your hands on the lower part of the neck (where the deepest jugular groove is and ends, as indicated in the step above), insert the outside needle into the vein at an angle that is perpendicular to the slope of the neck, and only at half of the needle's length.

Use a 1-inch 18-gauge needle for going into the vein.
Feel free to use your forefinger on the needle as a guide, though this is completely optional.
As in the method above, the reason to go perpendicular into the vein is so that it reduces the needle slipping and missing the vein completely. All needles are tapered at the end, not pointed like a spear. The greater the angle the needle was inserted (i.e., more parallel to the neck), the chance of the needle slipping and missing the vein completely increases.
You may put in the needle alone in first before attaching the needle holder, or puncture the vein while the blood-letting needle is already attached to the double-needle holder. Whatever you chose to do is optional, and your veterinarian may encourage the same.

, Allow blood to drain into the tube until you have around 3 to 5 mL of blood.

Once the vaccutainer tube is attached to the needle unit it takes only a few seconds for the tube to get full. You must pay attention to the tube to make sure you remove it before it gets too full.

, Then remove the double-needle holder unit from the animal, pulling it out in the same direction you put it in., Use gauze or a cotton swab to do so. Check about every 5 seconds to see if bleeding has stopped. It should only take 30 seconds or less for the area to stop bleeding., Obtain a fresh needle for the next animal, and keep it capped for now., Tube must be labelled with the identifying number and/or name of the animal, sample number (Sample #1, 2, 3, etc., or Sample A, B, C, etc.), and name of your farm., The box that contained the blood-sampling kit has a built-in tray to place the vacutainer tubes in. Place the tubes in that box with the bubble wrap surrounding each tube to protect them., Release the animal and move on to the next animal that needs to have its blood collected."
"
Obtain and/or maintain health records.,
Vaccinate regularly.,
Quarantine new animals.",How to Keep Cows Disease Free," This is crucial for knowing the disease history of your animals and what vaccinations or medications they have received upon first purchase. Keep these handy for your entire herd and keep records for each individual animal, if applicable.;
, Certain vaccinations exist in your area for the most prevalent diseases. The most common may be Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Clostridial diseases (blackleg, red-water disease), Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV, including shipping fever and pneumonia), Leptospirosis, Brucellosis and others. A few diseases in your area may not have vaccinations available, so be aware of what those diseases are and what can be done to prevent your animals from coming into contact with them.


Vaccinations come in either killed or modified live form. Whichever you choose to use depends on your animals, especially with the reproductive stage of your cows and age of your calves.
Time vaccinations according to how close to calving your cows are and the time of year they are going off or coming on to pasture.

, New animals must be quarantined or kept separate from your existing herd for at least a week or as long as your veterinarian recommends as a means to reduce risk of disease spread and to enable testing of new animals for communicable and contagious diseases that may affect your herd.

Memorize the details and characteristics of this breed.

,
Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Texas Longhorn cattle.",How to Identify Texas Longhorn Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Colouration: Longhorns come in a wide variety of colour patterns and colours, from black to white and everything else in between. Some will have white extending from their withers and their bellies all the way to their rumps and tail; others may be all white with black points in their ears, noses, and eyes. Some may be solid coloured, some roan, others a certain colour (black, brown, brindle, yellow, tiger-stripe, etc.) with blotches of white thrown hither-thither across their bodies.

Body type and characteristics: Longhorns are not as beefy or muscular as Continental breeds such as Limousins or Simmentals are, as most Texas Longhorn cattle have what's called a ""funnel butt,"" or lack of muscling in the hind quarters. However, lately TL breeders have been putting more emphasis on muscling in the longhorn breed than in the past, resulting in bulls and cows having more muscling and beefiness than they were originally selected for having. TL's have short hair, and don't develop much of a winter coat during the colder seasons, making them less adaptable to the winter seasons of the northern USA and Canada. Longhorns are a relatively middle-sized breed, and do not get overly big. Most bulls will weigh between 1500 and 2200 lbs; cows only around 850 to 1300 lbs.

Head characteristics: All Texas Longhorns have very long and large horns, though they are longer in length than in diameter than the Ankole-Watusi. Horn length, from tip to tip, can measure over 8 feet (2.4 m) or more, depending on the age of the animal. Horns curve out and up from the head. Young cattle initially start with horns jutting straight out level with the poll of their heads. TL's also have smaller ears than most breeds, noticed mostly because their large horns make it seem so.

Other characteristics: Texas Longhorns, though ""made in America,"" are actually the oldest breed and the original breed that came to America. They are descendants from the Spanish cattle that the Spanish conquistadors brought over in the early 1500s. Texas Longhorns, though very hardy on rough terrain with little highly nutritious vegetation, and in environments of hot dry and even humid weather, do not fare as well in the more northern climate where snow and temperatures often plunge (and stay) well below 0. Longhorns are quite docile when treated and handled right, and often require little in terms of supplemental feed because of their ability to be great forage converters. Longhorns have very little problems calving, are awesome mothers, and are relatively disease-resistant.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Speckle Park cattle.",How to Identify Speckle Park Cattle," Note that chances are you will not find information on Speckle Parks on many cattle breeds sites nor in many books on breeds of cattle. The best information on this breed that you can get are from breed association websites such as the Canadian Speckle Park Association website, or ranch websites such as the Legacy Speckle Park Ranch.;
, Note the following:



Colouration: Speckle Parks are actually a very pretty breed to look at. They are a breed that is predominantly black and white, with colour patterns varying from white with black points (black eyes, ears, nose, teats/scrotum and feet), leopard colouration, black with white topline, underline and hips, and black with a roan face, speckled hips and legs, and white on the topline, underline, brisket and dewlap. The colour pattern is typically speckled in some form or other. Speckle Park cattle may also be white (with black eyes, ears, noses and feet) or solid black. There is always a white belly, a white to partial white dewlap, and partial white stockings or ""socks"" on all four feet. Some whiter cows may have dark speckles on their legs.

Body type and characteristics: SP's are beef cattle, plain and simple. They are smaller framed than the bigger modern type beef cattle, with mature weights of cows topping off at 1000 lbs and around 1900 to 2000 lbs for bulls. They have the same body type as Angus and Shorthorns do, with not too much muscling, but enough muscling to make them highly sought-after in the feedlot and meat market.

Head characteristics:Speckle Parks are polled. They have a head type that is kind of mixed between Angus, Shorthorn and White Park, with that characteristic black markings on their faces and ears.

Other characteristics: Speckle Parks were actually originally founded in 1959 by pure accident. A red roan heifer thought to be a descendant of a Teeswater Shorthorn that carried a White Park gene was purchased by Mary Lindsay in because of its unusual colours. What's more, no matter what herd bull she was bred to, she produced calves that had a characteristic colour pattern. Some of these speckled cattle were purchased by Eileen and Bill Lamont (who were then Angus breeders) and put on their ranch in Saskatchewan, Canada and bred to Black Angus bulls. The resulting colour patterns ranged from leopard to white with black points, to black white white hips and even with roan faces. Interest grew and the Lamont's then decided to develop a new breed. This breed, however, didn't officially get recognized as a pure breed until 2006.

Speckle Parks are one highly efficient, very docile, heavy milking, very easy keeping and highly fertile grass-eating machine. This breed is also known to have highly vigorous calves which are up and suckling in a matter of minutes after birth; the cows have very few calving problems. Great temperaments make them a dream to work with, with breeders saying that cows have no problems with humans handling their calves, and even bulls are very good natured. They also have great conformation, excellent finishing ability and carcass characteristics off grain and/or grass, and are very hardy and tough, with little to no problems with sunburned udders or cancer eye, thanks to their dark pigmented skin.
SP's have over 70 breeders and 3,000 registered cattle all over Canada. Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and Ireland also have breeders raising Speckle Park cattle, with a second breed association established in Australia.

, Note the following:



Colouration: South Devons are a light red in colouration, though this can vary in shade and can sometimes appear mottled. The skin around the eyes and nose tends to be a lighter shade, though often not as obvious as in other breeds with the same characteristics.

Body type and characteristics: South Devons are the largest British beef breed, being quite robust and muscular with a large frame.  Bulls average between 2600 and 3300 lbs in body weight, cows being a few hundred pounds lighter.  South Devons have a strong curly coat and thick, loose mellow skin.

Head characteristics: The head of a South Devon tends to be broad, with more naturally horned individuals than polled, though the polled characteristic is also becoming more popular in this breed.  Some of you may think that the head of a South Devon looks quite similar to a Limousin, when in fact this is not entirely true.  This is because, for one, South Devons are much larger than Limousins, and secondly, South Devons lack the characteristic flat lip of a Limousin.

Other characteristics: South Devon cattle tend to be late-maturing, with some heifers being able to calve out by the time they're around 2 years of age, but most not until they're around 2.5 to 3 years of age. Bulls reach puberty around 15 to 18 months of age in which they are ready to be used for breeding. This breed is known for its docility, good mothering ability and milking ability,, longevity (cows can be productive to an average of 15 years),  great forage convertibility, good hardiness and adaptability, and good carcass characteristics.

South Devons originated in southwestern England around 400 years ago in an area of Devon called South Hams.  Originally they were a triple-purpose breed, being used for beef, milk, and draft work until the 20th century.

You can also order a book on shorthorns. One such book is: A Field Guide to Cows: How to Identify and Appreciate America's 52 Breeds.;
, Shorties (a slang term for shorthorns) tend to have the same kind of muscling that you will find in Angus, Red Angus, or Hereford cattle.


Shorties are a British breed and tend to be smaller, less muscular and not as lean. However, some bulls (often the best ones) can be quite deep, long, and muscular, with a lot of muscling on the hind quarters and shoulders.
Well-conditioned cows can be the same way, but are not as massive as bulls.
Bulls are medium-sized animals, typically weighing about 990kg. Cows weigh slightly less at 800kg.Shorthorn have moderate frames that are rectangular and low. Their backs tend to be wide and deep, as do their forequarters., Contradictory to their name, some shorthorns are naturally polled (without horns). Bloodlines vary greatly and are the determining factor for whether cattle will have horns or not.This breed is also less wide in the forehead, particularly between the ears.
Shorthorns look finer in the head and are somewhat longer from poll (horn) to nose.

, Shorthorns are still considered to be one of the best breeds to raise on ranch-like conditions because of their excellent forage convertibility, great maternal traits, and ruggedness.


This breed is also recognized for its docility traits. Though shorthorn bulls are considered quieter than other breeds, caution should always to be taken regardless of the reputation., Red shorthorns range from deep red to brownish-red and may have white specks on various parts of their body.


Look for white on their belly, from the brisket to the hind legs and possibly on their foreheads.
In crossbred cattle it's the red shorthorns, which are most often used to help maintain those solid colored cattle., The white shorthorn is most often used to breed with females, which is referred to as a crossing bull.White shorthorns are predominately white. However, they may have a few visible red hairs.
Look for their hair to be medium in length and soft.

, Roan shorthorns have a more interesting pattern. Most are red from their head to their shoulders, while the rest of their body is roan.


You can often find splashes of red and white on their lower body, legs, and possibly the rump as well.
There are all sorts of possibilities for coloration on the roan shorthorn cattle. Even Googling the word ""shorthorn"" and looking at the images will give you an idea of the variety of interesting patterns you may find on a roan shorthorn.
Look for a large star or diamond of white on their foreheads with red from the rest of their heads to the base of their necks.

, Do a Google search for, “local farms with shorthorn cattle.” Check out their website to see if they allow visitors.


If their website doesn’t mention visitation hours, call the farm and ask if you can come for a visit.
Explain that you’ve been studying different types of shorthorns and would like to take pictures if possible.
If there’s not a farm nearby, try looking for a cattle show. Visit: https://shorthorn.org/shows to learn more about shows near you.

, When you’re at the farm or fair, try your hand at spotting which types of shorthorn are present. Practice spotting white, red and roan shorthorns.


If you’re having issues differentiating between the cattle, ask the farmer or person showing the shorthorns.

, Bring your camera along to the fair or farm. Always ask the person in charge before taking pictures of the animals.


Don’t get too close. It may be best to bring a long-range zoom lens with you so that you can get detailed shots without getting too close.

, Note the following:



Coloration: Many Gerts (a short form of referring to Santa Gertrudis cattle; also referred to as ""Santa Gerts"") range from a deep cherry-red to a more reddish color. There are very often no white on any cattle of this breed, as the cattle of this breed are solid red. They have lighter colored noses, lighter pigment around the eyes, and also on the udder and scrotum of cows and bulls, respectively.

Body type and characteristics: Santa Gerts always look to be a cross between a European breed and a Brahman, which in fact they are. Santa Gertrudis are 5/8 Shorthorn and 3/8 Brahman. Bulls have a slighter more prominent hump over their shoulders than cows do, but it's not as big nor defined as in Brahman cattle. Most cows have a very shallow hump over their shoulders, whereas others may not have any hump at all. They have the loose skin and dewlap characteristic of a Brahman, as well as skin hanging loose from the navel in both sexes of this breed, but note that both characteristics are less defined in Gerts than in Brahmans. A Gert will look more blocky and less smooth over the rump than a Brahman.

Head characteristics: Gerts have what's referred to as ""less ear"" than a typical Brahman, thanks to the Shorthorn influence in this breed. They lack the dished nose of the Brahman, also due to Shorthorn influence, but still maintain the broadness in the forehead typical of a Brahman. Gerts can be horned or polled, with the horns jutting up, out and slightly back from the head.

Other characteristics: Known as a calving-ease breed, and one that is highly tolerant of a tropical climate and insect-resistant, but more tolerant of colder temperatures than the Brahman, Santa Gertrudis are a beef breed that are often known to have better meat quality than the Brahman breed, thanks to the Shorthorn influence in this breed. Santa Gertrudis is, like the Brahman, made in America, with the breed's foundations started on the King Ranch near Kingville, Texas. Santa Gertrudis may have the temperament of the Brahman, but it is known also that they are as docile as the Shorthorn breed from which 5/8's of the breed is created from.

, Note the following:



Colouration: White Parks, like British Whites, are white with black points--nose, rims of eyes, ears, hooves, teats/tip of scrotum, and tongue, but not the tail switch. The upper portion of the tongue should be black, while the bottom is pink. The intensity of these coloured points varies with each herd and each individual bovine, as some can be more speckled with black than others, and still others may have a black muzzle where others lack this colouration.

Body type and characteristics: White Parks are beefy animals, with the typical squarish body and muscularity in both the cows and bulls. White Parks are a medium-framed breed, with bulls weighing around 2100 lbs, and cows around 1400 lbs.

Head characteristics: All horned White Parks have horns tapering out and up much like that of Texas Longhorns, though they are half the length of a typical longhorn's, more the same length of that of a Highlander's horns. Registered American British White Parks are not horned. They are either polled or scurred.

Other characteristics: White Parks are an ancient breed of bovine, dating back to 2000 years ago when they were first mentioned in the old Irish sagas. They were later found again in Welsh law which was created at Dinefwr Castle in Deheubarth by a series of rulers dating from 856 to 1197 AD. More details of the history of this breed can be found at OSU Breeds of Cattle site on White Parks.

This breed, though listed as Threatened on the The Livestock Conservancy site, and Critical on the Rare Breeds Canada site, and Rare on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust site.
White Parks are known for their high meat quality and ability to increase heterosis in cross-bred calves since it is genetically distant from many other breeds. White Parks are actually more closely related to Highland and Galloway cattle than any other breed like British Whites or even American White Parks.

Colouration: Red Polls have a deep red colouration all throughout except on their tail switches, which is always white. Their noses are quite pink too, in contrast to the colouration of the rest of their bodies.

Body type and characteristics: Red Polls are a British-type beef breed, with the same kind of muscularity that is found in Angus, Shorthorn and Hereford cattle. They are a medium to small-framed breed, like all British breeds are.

Head characteristics: Red Polls are naturally polled.

Other characteristics: This breed was originally made as a dual purpose breed in England in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. They are a fairly old breed, first described by Rev. Arthur Young in 1794. Red Polls are very docile, making them great to work with, and they are heavy milkers with the ability to drop small but weighty beefy calves; these same cows have excellent calving ease. They are a breed that is great for grass-only operations because of their excellent foraging ability. Cows and bulls are long-lived, able to breed well into their 'teens, minimizing the number of replacements needed for raising this breed. They are a tough, durable breed, that can thrive quite well in colder environments (if they're fed properly of course.)

, A little cow that could raise a calf and provide the family with milk, produce a bullock to pull the wagon or plow; got breed to many native breeds. The breed has strong trait of white in the tail, poll (takes horns off most) and is an easy keeper. Being calm natured was important to many pioneer families and she often was the only cow on a small farm. This trait of being o.k. with being alone without others is uncommon; but a trait of this breed.

Recognizing eating habits of Welsh black cattle.,
Know where Welsh black cattle are sold.",How to Identify Welsh Black Cattle," One of the most obvious and distinguishing features of Welsh Black cattle is the color of their coats. Most Welsh Black cattle are all black, but there is an increasing variance in coloration that is now common, even among pure-bred Welsh Black herds.There is a certain degree of deviation in the shade of black that most Welsh Black cattle exhibit. Some are a rusty shade of black, while others are jet black.
Some Welsh Black cattle have a recessive red gene. They are still acknowledged as being Welsh Black, but those that show red do not have any genes for black coloration.Many Welsh Black cattle have a subtle white underline. These cattle are still considered Welsh Black, so long as the white is confined to the underside below the navel.;
, The coat on a Welsh Black will look very distinct, especially during colder months. It should appear appear thick, long, and shaggy. In fact, some breeders describe the Welsh Black winter coat as ""mossy"" due to its scraggly appearance.The winter coat of Welsh black cattle developed as an adaptation to the harsh environments that they have historically inhabited.Many Welsh Blacks that reside in warmer regions have lost this distinguishing feature, and predominately appear as short-haired varieties.

, In summer, Welsh Black cattle lose their thick, mossy coats. Some Welsh Black cattle who live in warmer climates may never have shaggy coats. A short-haired Welsh Black, whether in summer or in hotter environments, has a smooth and sleek coat. It may be almost glossy in appearance., Welsh Black cattle are considered a medium-sized breed.Mature cows weigh an average of about 1,100 pounds (about 500 kg). However, they can get much larger. It's not abnormal for mature Welsh Black cows to weigh anywhere from 1,300 to 1,750 pounds (600 to 800 kg), while bulls typically weigh 2,000 to 2,500 pounds (950 to 1,150 kg).They are not a very muscular breed, which is typical of Continental cattle breeds., The majority of Welsh Black cattle have horns.However, some Welsh Black cattle are naturally polled, meaning they are born without horns. This has been an increasing trait among both black and red Welsh Black cattle.The horns should be moderately long, with the tips fine and pointed.
Horns should start straight from the head and extend outward. There is no official direction in which horns should turn, though upward-turned horns are often preferred by breeders., The hooves of Welsh Black cattle are generally uniform. They tend to be tough and hard, and they're usually all black.Red Welsh Black cattle may have slightly lighter-colored hooves. Regardless of coloration, the hooves of Welsh Black cattle are not very prone to injury and are built for rugged terrain.

, Welsh black cattle tend to grow much faster than other British breeds of cattle. Not only does their rate of growth exceed that of most other breeds, they also tend to have the highest average weight at any given age among their British counterparts. Because of this, Welsh black cattle could potentially be identified with a trained eye by their size and growth over time., Welsh black cattle are generally able to forage through fields, eating grass and other naturally-occurring plants. They do not typically require the costly feeds that many other breeds of cattle rely on, due in part to their hardiness and the landscape in which they've evolved over time., Welsh black cattle are native to Wales, of course. But breeders have managed to raise and transport them around the world, and they've successfully held populations in the rest of the U.K., as well as Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and Jamaica.Breeders who specialize in Welsh black cattle should offer a pedigree certificate upon sale of the cattle.You can purchase Welsh black cattle semen from specialty breeders, especially in the U.K.In the U.S., many breeders select for polled (hornless) cattle.However, horned Welsh black cattle are still bred in North America.

,
Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Salers cattle.",How to Identify Salers Cattle,""";
, Note the following:



Colouration: Salers come in a deep mahogany-red. Some cattle may be a deeper red than others, and other cattle may also be black. Black colouration, just like in Simmentals, Charolais, Gelbvieh and Maine Anjou cattle, is from the infusion of Angus genetics in this breed to take advantage of flexibility in a producer's breeding program.

Body type and characteristics: Salers are an average-sized breed, but a lot of animals today are quite large-framed, and very blocky. Salers tend to be quite tall, in leg-to-body ratio, and long in body like Limousins. The breed also tends to be very deep from the rump to the shoulders, in both cows and bulls. Cows are relatively good milkers, though not as much as the Holstein, but generally may have a larger udder than other breeds like the Herefords. Salers also tend to have a lighter tail switch, and may have a curly hair coat throughout. Bulls typically have a curly forehead, much like Charolais do.

Head characteristics:Traditional Salers are horned, since the males are primarily used as oxen in France. Their horns tend to curve out and up, like a longhorn's, but are not nearly as long as a longhorn's nor a highlander's. Polled Salers can be confused with Red Polls and Red Angus, however the best way to tell Salers and Red Polls and RA's apart is by noticing how much more rugged and coarse a Saler's head is than an RA's or RP's. RA cows are much more feminine-looking than Salers are, and RA bulls always have either a black face with black on the front of each leg and a black line down the back and tail, or have lighter points on either side of the poll. RP's also have the more refined look than Salers, and come in a deep cherry red, not a mahogany red. Both breeds are naturally polled, unlike most Salers.

Other characteristics: Unfortunately, Salers, like Limousins, are notorious for being very nervous and flighty. Though most European Salers are less wild, not much has been done for the North American Salers that exist today. But this is only a general rule, as you may come across one or two Salers breeding operations that have quite calm and docile cattle. Salers are known for their great carcass characteristics and ability to survive on rugged mountainous terrain and range-lands with little supplementation. They are good mothers, have great milking ability, and are relatively more free from diseases than other breeds.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Red Brangus cattle are red, varying from a brownish red to a deep red with black on the face, topline, legs, and tail.

Body type and characteristics: Red Brangus cattle are beef animals, with large blocky bodies similar to that of Beefmasters and Santa Gertrudis, with loose skin and neck folds. There is a slight hump on the shoulders in bulls, and even less slightly in some females (thanks to the Brahman influence in this breed). Like the Beef-masters, the rumps are more rounded than what you would get with European-type cattle like Red Angus. The breed is moderately-framed, with cows topping out at 1400 lbs and bulls reaching around 2200 lbs. Calves come out small, with a surprising birth weight of around 50 lbs.

Head characteristics: The head is very similar to that of Red Angus cattle. All cattle are polled, and they have the typical large ears of the Brahman, though not nearly as large.

Other characteristics: Red Brangus cattle are 3/8's Brahman and 5/8's Angus. Originally, the breed was created by crossing Black Angus cows with white Brahman bulls to get these red calves. Malcolm Levi of Spicewood, Texas was the first man to create this breed back in the 1940s. They are a solid breed with good maternal characteristics including calving ease, milking ability, mothering ability, and calf survivability. They are also a good terminal breed, having calves that have noted to out-compete British-type calves both in the feedlot and even on grass-finishing pastures. Their loose skin make them able to tolerate heat, insects and drought, but are not too sensitive to be unable to resist the colder temperatures for those Red Brangus cattle that are raised in Canada. Longevity, early maturing and good docility are also great qualities of this breed.

, Note the following:



The Red Angus breed is very similar and closely related to Angus except that these cattle are red instead of black. In the United States, even though there are two separate associations for Angus and Red Angus cattle, in Canada, Red Angus is considered the same or similar breeding of Black Angus cattle, even though they are recognized as two ""different"" breeds.

When breeders breed Black Angus and Red Angus together, they will always get black calves. In Canada, these Black Angus calves (yes, they're still considered as Black Angus!) can be registered as purebred stock and still be used as breeding animals. It's a different story in the USA, though, as the Angus cattle that do get registered at the American Angus Association cannot be heterozygous for red. (Genetically speaking, heterozygous means that an animal has two different genes that could be passed on to offspring: one is black colour, the other is red. Black is a dominant allele, which means that, physically, it allows itself to be present visibly, and overrides the recessive red allele.) They can, however, be registered as Angus Source stock instead.



Colouration: As was mentioned above, Red Angus are comprised of one colour: red. Most animals vary from a reddish brown to a brownish red, with the bulls having lighter points on near their polls, and may or may not form a lighter saddle on their bodies (see the picture above in Introduction). Some Red Angus cattle may have blackish colouration on their lips and around their noses. Other Red Angus will have a black face, a black line running from the nape of their necks all the way down to the tail switch, have black on the front of each lower leg, and even black hooves. The rest of the body is red.

Body type and characteristics: The body type is closely similar to Angus cattle, with not as much muscling as the Continentals do, but are overall blocky, beefy animals.

Head characteristics: Again, head conformation is very similar to Angus cattle. They are naturally polled, and also have this classic ""Angus look"" to them, from their polls to their noses. (See How to Identify Black Angus Cattle for more.)

Other characteristics: Like Angus cattle, Red Angus are highly adaptable and one of the best breeds to have on ranch-like conditions. However, Red Angus may have the upper-hand in adaptability because they do not have the black hide that would otherwise hinder them in hot, humid climates. The red coloured hair (not to mention thicker skin) make the Red Angus a bit more adaptable to hotter climates than what their Angus cousins can withstand. Red Angus are, though, more popular up in the northern areas of North America (from central and northern USA up to Canada) because of their ability to brave the cold temperatures. Red Angus are great mothers with good milking ability, good fertility, great calving ease, and a great ability to gain weight on just grass and hay alone. Reds are somewhat slightly more docile than Angus cattle, though they still can be a bit nutty in comparison to more docile breeds.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Pinzgauers are primarily a deep chestnut red color, and have white on their topline, barrel, tails and rump.

Body type and characteristics: Pinzgauers are large-framed cattle; mature bulls average at least 2000 lbs, and mature cows average around 1000 to 1600 lbs. This breed is a beef breed with the characteristics to be quite beefy like Simmentals are. Pinz's have smooth hair and firm flexible skin that helps prevent tick and other insect infestations.

Head characteristics: Pinzgauers can be polled or horned. In comparison to other breeds, the head of a Pinz tends to be not as fine as Angus, but more robust and coarse like that of Simmentals or even Charolais. They also tend to be long in the face like Simmental or Chianinas.

Other characteristics: Pinzgauer cattle originated in Bavaria, but were not recognized as a breed until the 1600's when the designation ""Pinzgauer"" is derived from the ""Pinzgau"" district in the province of Salzburg, Austria. There are also records of pinz's being exported to Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in the 1820's. In the early 1900s a number of breeding animals were exported to South Africa, which now has the second largest fullblood Pinzgauer breeding herd in the world.

Pinzgauers are more of a beef-type animal than dairy, although this breed can be considered as a dual-purpose breed. This breed is able to produce, on average, 4000 to 5000 kg of milk per year. Pinz's tend to eat a lot of forage, yet have good temperament, maternal qualities, and fertility, and easy calving ability. They also have good carcass qualities, with a slaughter yield of 56-58%.

Take pictures of cattle you believe to be Maine Anjou cattle.",How to Identify Maine Anjou Cattle," A traditional MA is a deep, dark red colour with white on the belly, head, tail and hind legs. However, some of today's MAs are black and white, all black, or all red.White on the hind legs can be seen to begin from the flanks of the animal down to the hooves. The white on the front legs almost always runs from the top or middle of the canon bone down to the top of the hooves. Some may have no white on the front hooves at all. #*White coloring can also be found on the lower half of the tail, and sometimes as a diamond or half-moon on the top of the forehead.
Some animals can have white over other parts of the body, like over the loins and/or over the shoulders.;
, Maine Anjou cattle are large, tall cattle, with long legs in proportion to the rest of their body height.


They are not fine boned like Limousins, but are long in body like this breed.
MAs are beefy, robust and rugged cattle, though they are not as rugged as other breeds that were created in more adverse conditions, such as Herefords.
Mature bulls can weigh from 2,200 pounds to over 3,100 pounds. Cows can range from 1,500 to over 1,900 pounds.

, These cattle tend to have a narrower forehead and longer heads than others such as Angus cattle. MA cattle can also have horns or be polled, meaning they have no horns at all.

, In North America, MA cattle are primarily used as a terminal beef breed for producing calves for market, though they are notorious for extremely high birth weights and poor calving ease, more so than Charolais or Simmentals are known for.

, Maine Anjou can sometimes be confused with Pinzgauers. However, if you remember that a Pinzgauer has a white strip, which extends along their toplines (the very top of the animal, where the spine is) from their shoulders to their rears, you should be able to avoid this mistake.


Use the height, and large size of MA cattle to distinguish them from other breeds that also come in black.

, Maine Anjou cows are great at producing high quality milk, and are often able to wean calves when they are six to eight months of age.Additionally, the meat they produce is of great quality, and is sought after by many chefs.Because of their high quality meat, you are most likely to find MAs on cattle ranches that breed cattle for meat production.

, Maine Anjou cattle are known for their docility, which makes them a popular breed. However, if they are frightened or feel threatened, they can be aggressive. Anjou cows tend to be great mothers, and the calves grow well and quickly.Be aware that while they are great mothers, this means that they can become very aggressive if they feel that their offspring are in danger. If you encounter a mother cow and her offspring, it is best to keep your distance. Do not attempt to approach the cow or her baby, as she may charge.
Because bulls often have to fight one another to establish dominance, they can be particularly aggressive; however, this is not specific to MAs. If you encounter a bull, do what you can to stay away from it. If there is a fence, make sure it is between you and the bull.

Things such as loud noises and chasing animals, such as dogs are frightening to cattle, and can lead to a defensive reaction.



, The Maine Anjou breed originated in the northwestern part of France. The breed came into existence when, in 1839, a French farmer successfully crossed a Durham animal with a Mancelle animal.However, at the time, these cattle were known as Durham-Mancelle until 1909 when the breed was renamed Maine Anjou in reference to the river valleys in France., Traditionally, MA cattle were bred for draft work, meat and even milk, though more emphasis was put on milk production and meat production than draft work. In many herds, half the cows were used for milk and the other half for producing beef calves for the market, which is still practiced in Europe today.In North America, MA cattle are primarily used as a terminal beef breed for producing calves for market.

, If you want additional information about the history of the Maine Anjou, do a quick google search.


Try searching with the term: ""Maine Anjou"", or ""information about Maine Anjou"".
In the United States, there is an association dedicated to MAs known as the Maine-Anjou Association. If you cannot find answers to any questions you have about MAs, you can consider calling or emailing them to see if they can offer help.

, Visit your local library or bookstore to find books related to cattle breeds. This way, you can learn about the Maine Anjou and compare it with pictures of other breeds as well.

, The best way to learn to identify the Maine Anjou is to see them in person. If the rancher has time, ask them to explain to you how you can identify an MA in a herd of cattle. They may also be able to show you specific examples of the different markings described in part 1.


Try searching on Google for MA cattle ranches. Simply search for ""Maine Anjou cattle ranch"", and you will find several ranches who raise Maine Anjou cattle. Explore their websites for information about the Maine Anjou, as well as for any information about visiting the ranch.
If you wish to visit a ranch, be sure to contact the ranch owner first.

It may be best to contact them via email, if their website offers one. They could feel put on the spot if you call them and may refuse outright. Sending an email will give them an opportunity to consider your request carefully and may make it more likely that they can find time in their schedule.
When contacting the owner, be polite, and explain why you are interested in visiting. Help them understand what makes you interested in learning to identify this particular breed. They may be more willing to help if you can demonstrate why it is important for you to identify this breed correctly.
Understand that ranchers have tough and time consuming jobs, so be aware that they may not have time to accommodate your wishes. If they refuse, search for another ranch that may be able to help you.


If a Maine Anjou rancher does invite you to visit their ranch, consider bringing along a small gift to show your appreciation, such as home made cookies. They will be taking time out of their day to help you, so it is nice to demonstrate your appreciation.

, If you see a herd of cattle, and if you are allowed and it is safe to do so, snap a few pictures to look at later. You can then compare them with pictures of MAs on the Internet and in your cattle breeds book.


By taking pictures of cattle you believe to be MAs and then comparing them with pictures of cattle you know to be MAs, you can begin to notice the subtle differences between MAs and other, similar breeds.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Jersey cattle.",How to Identify Jersey Cattle,""";
, Note the following:



Colouration: Jersey cattle coat colour ranges from a light fawn to almost black. Some Jerseys may have white on them, from diamond-shaped patches on their shoulders or hips, to white legs and a stripe from the top of the shoulder down to behind the elbows. Black Jerseys almost always has a tan-coloured saddle in the middle of their backs, from the withers to the top of the loins. They also have lighter colouration around their noses and eyes, and on the inside of each leg. A lot of fawn-coloured mature cattle have a darker face from just below their poll or just above their eye-brows to just before their noses. There will often be lighter colouration around their eyes and noses. Bulls often have darker colouration from the base of their heads to their shoulders. All Jerseys have dark eyes and dark pigmented skin around their eyes and their noses. They also have black hooves and a dark tail-switch. Those dark noses and dark eyes in Jersey calves make them look adorably cute, much more so than any other bovine calf of any other breed.

Body type and characteristics: Jerseys look to be more finer-boned and bodied than most any beef breed or even Holsteins. Just like Holsteins, though, Jerseys are quite angular in body type because they are selected to be a milk-producer and not a beef-producer. They have the same funnel butt characteristics that Holsteins have, and are quite thin and bony as well. Jerseys are a lot smaller than Holsteins though, a bit more than half the size, with a mature weight of only around 1000 lbs for cows and only 1500 lbs for bulls. Jersey cows have a large udder on them to accommodate for the demand for producing more milk than their calves would normally receive.

Head characteristics: Jersey cows are very feminine looking animals, with a finer, more feminine head than Hereford or Angus cows, with a similar head-shape (though a little less robust) as Shorthorn cows do. Jerseys are a naturally horned breed, though there are genetics for polled cattle as well.

Other characteristics: Jersey cows are quiet and very pretty animals, but are often known to have quite the sassy-girl attitude at milking time! This is because they are known to be kickers when you're trying to prepare their udders before milking, or just when you're trying to milk them out. But, even though they are notorious kickers, they have milk that is more rich in butterfat than any other dairy cow, which is great to use for dairy products like cheese, butter, and ice cream. Jersey bulls are infamous for their aggressiveness and unpredictability, and are often more dangerous to handle and be around than even Holstein bulls.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Highlanders range from a light fawn/buckskin colour to brown to black. All animals come in one color.

Body type and characteristics: Highlands are smaller cattle, similar in size to Dexters or low-line cattle. They have very long and shaggy coats. Highlands are not tall cattle, as they tend to have seemingly shorter legs in comparison to the rest of their body than other breeds. They are also not as long in length as other larger breeds like Angus, Charolais, or Limousin. Bulls, however are more muscular and thicker than cows. Calves, when quite young, look like little fur-balls with four legs, as they are quite fluffy, almost like that of a teddy bear.

Head characteristics: All registered Highland cattle have horns, which taper out and up; older cattle have horns that also taper out at the tips, similar to longhorn cattle. Calves typically have no horns at birth, but will start to sprout horns as they get older. Highlands have a long forelocks that extend down past their eyes, making it seem their eyes are hidden from the rest of the mass of hair they have. Bulls have a broader forehead than cows do, with a bit of a dewlap hanging down from their chins.

Other characteristics: Highland cattle are highly disease resistant, and also are very hardy in climates that are quite cold, snowy and wet. They also require very little, if any, supplements in the way of grain and bagged feed, and do just fine on grass and hay. They are a very docile breed, despite their unusual appearance and intimidating-looking horns. Highland cattle originated from the rugged and remote moors of Scotland, where hot, dry summers are a rarity.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Most Holsteins are black-and-white. This colour pattern always is patchy, with big black, rounded patches over the animal's body. Some Holsteins may be more white than black than others, and other Holsteins may be more black than white than others. Occasionally you may see a cow that will be all black with very little white in her, or be all white with very little to no black on her.

There are actually exceptions to the black-and-white colouration here. There is a recessive gene in Holsteins (just like in Angus cattle) that can make a cow red-and-white. Red Holsteins are actually shunned by many Holstein breed associations because they are not considered a ""pure"" breed as the ""real"" B&W Holsteins are. However, a Red Holstein can be just as good a milk producer as her black relatives. You may be lucky to see one or two Red Holsteins in with a herd of B&W cows if you drive by a dairy farm.



Body type and characteristics: Holsteins are a dairy breed. Dairy cattle are always thinner and more angular than beef cattle. Holsteins, like all dairy breeds, have more angle over the hips, tail-head and shoulders than beef breeds. A lot of Holsteins will look more fine-boned than other beef breeds like Herefords because they lack the muscling ability of your typical beef cow. Holsteins show more bone and less fat and muscle because they have been specifically selected to produce milk, not beef. Holsteins have what are called ""funnel-butts;"" this means that, from the pin bones (of the hips) to the hocks, the hind quarters form a funnel-type angle from the pelvis to the legs; this is quite evident when looking at an animal from the side. Being ""funnel-butted"" means that these animals, as was mentioned before, lack muscling over the hind quarters. Another characteristic that is typical of all dairy breeds is the huge udder between their back legs.

Head characteristics: A Holstein cow's head is quite long. The long nose bridge gives this look, and is quite unmistakable when comparing to other dairy breeds like Jersey. Holsteins are a naturally horned breed, so you will often see as many horned (more de-horned than horned!) as polled cows.

Other characteristics: Holsteins are originally from the Netherlands, a country that is known for producing large quantities of milk, much more than any country in Europe. Holstein-Friesians are the highest-quantity producing dairy cow in the world, and are thus far more commonly sought-after and used in commercial dairy operations across the world. It is known that Holsteins are capable of producing as much as 50 gallons (189.3 L) of milk per day! Holsteins are actually the largest dairy breed used in dairy operations, a little bigger than Brown Swiss, and more so than Jersey, Ayrshire, Guernsey, Randall and Canadian breeds. A mature cow can weigh around and over 1500 lbs.

,, Take pictures of what you thought were Holstein cattle, and compare them with pictures of Holstein-Friesians on the Internet and in your Cattle breeds book. Holsteins are actually one of the easiest breeds to classify, because their black-and-white colouration is made legendary among the media, cow-related merchandise and the entertainment industry almost everywhere. When you see a black-and-white cow like that pictured above in Step 1, you will know for sure it's a Holstein.

, Note the following:



Coloration: Murray Grey cattle range from a light silvery grey to a dark grey, though the primary preferred coloration is silver grey. The skin should be heavily pigmented or dark colored as this keeps away problems such as sunburned udders and cancer eye. The genetic standpoint of the coloration of this breed is not well understood, since multiple gene effects make it difficult to get a true breeding condition. It is thought that in addition to the basic color genes that are involved, dilution or modifying genes also play a definite role in this color pattern inheritance.

Body type and characteristics: They tend to be fine-boned but beefy, with the same muscling characteristics of a Shorthorn. They are a medium framed breed, similar in size to a medium-framed Angus, and do not get overly big like Continentals would.

Head characteristics: They tend to have a small head in comparison to the rest of their body size. They are naturally polled as well, with head shape similar to that of an Angus.

Other characteristics: They are originated from New South Wales, Australia, where a roan Shorthorn cow was bred to a Black Angus bull and was found to produce only grey calves from this cross. Interest grew in this grey cattle, and they way they out-performed Angus and Shorthorns, and efforts continued to make this into a breed. Consequently, Murray Grey cattle excel in the feedlot as well as in the pasture on only grass, and butchers started paying a premium for Murray Grey beef. Popularity grew, and so did the breed. Today, they can be found not only in Australia, but also in the USA and Canada.

They are also known for their small thrifty calves that grow like weeds once they hit the ground. Cows are great milkers as well, and this translates to great growths in the calves. They are highly adaptable, able to thrive and survive in a variety of climatic and environmental conditions, still keeping their condition and raising good calves. They are also very docile, which make them favorable in intensive grazing and feedlot conditions.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Limousins come in two colours: the traditional golden-red to brown colour, and black. Limousin typically have lighter colouration around their eyes and muzzle. They also are deeper in colour around their neck region (more defined in bulls than in cows).

Body type and characteristics: Limousins are very blocky animals, but they have a fine bone-structure over all that muscle. This is more evident in photographs than in real-life. Their body often forms a defined rectangular shape, from the rump to the chest and brisket. They are also very muscular, bulls showing a lot of muscle around their necks and shoulders and their hindquarters, with very little fat on them. This is because the breed is genetically quite a lean animal. Cows do not show as much muscularity as bulls do, but they have the same rectangular and powerful-looking shape and qualities, respectively, as their male counterparts.

Head characteristics: Historically, Limousins have been known to be horned, but you will find many more Limousins with no horns (or are polled). Bulls are more broad in the forehead than cows are. A very interesting feature that truly sets the Limousin breed apart from other breeds is their lips. If you look at the side of their mouths, on their lips, you will notice they are more trimmed-looking, or flatter than other breeds. The lips do not form a half- or quarter-moon shape like other breeds, but instead are flat or form a straight line. No other breed has this trait.

Other characteristics: The Limousin breed is a French breed just like the Charolais. Limousins are known for their ability to have average to good calving ease (or, ability to give birth to small calves), great mothering ability , adequate milking ability, and excellent growth rates with great carcass characteristics. However, Limousins are also known for their excitable and high-strung temperament which makes it a breed not a favourite among producers who like calm, docile cattle. High-strung cattle make themselves very dangerous for producers to work with, but Limousin breeders have been working hard to cull out this bad trait and select those that are more quiet and docile.

, Note the following:



Coloration: All Herefords are red and white, with red varying from a deep cherry red to a light buckskin-orange colour. Cattle of this breed will have white running from their faces to behind their ears and down their chest, dewlap and brisket to between their front legs, all along the lower belly, covering the flanks, and end at the point tween their legs. Most will have this white stripe running from the back of their heads to their withers (which is located behind the shoulders on the top of the animal). Some Hereford cattle may have less of a white mane than others; many of the modern Herefords may lack this. Some Herefords will lack white behind and below their ears and behind their jawline; others may have these red side-burns running just behind their ears down to almost their dewlap; still others may lack both these characteristics. Many Hereford cattle may also lack the white running from their chins down to the brisket, and may instead have a bit of red on the upper-middle portion of the chest, with the white starting on their briskets. Some Herefords may also have a red patch or reddish pigment around their eyes. On the back of the ears, there may be a small white patch running from the top of the ear to the bottom, with a lot of white in their ears Others may have a straight-red colouration instead, but retain most of the white in the ears.

Body type and characteristics: Herefords are not as muscular nor massive as the Continentals like Limousins or Simmentals. They are quite blocky in appearance, but are more smooth down their rump, loin, thighs and shoulders. Bulls are more masculine than cows in this respect, often having more muscle mass in the shoulders, neck and hindquarters than in cows, but this muscle mass is often less defined in Herefords than in Continental breeds like Charolais or Limousin. Herefords also tend to be smaller in frame and body size than many of the more larger breeds, though there are those ranches that may have large Hereford cattle. Hair on Herefords range from short, slick and smooth to short and curly. This breed will also form a thick hairy coat during winter or colder seasons, depending on where they live. Herefords that live further north where snow and winter predominate tend to develop a thicker coat than those that live near the Equator and only experience cool rainy seasons.

Head characteristics: All Hereford cattle have a white face. Pigmentation can also be noticed around the eyes, and some may also be seen to have a roan-like or speckled face as well, which is often the physical evidence of breeders selecting for more maternal characteristics in the breed. Bulls almost always have curly hair around their foreheads, more so than with cows. Cows and bulls may have a broad forehead, but it's often not as broad as other breeds like Brahmans. Mature adults always have a wide-looking mouth, with the upper lips always overlapping the lips of the bottom jaw. Herefords also have big wide noses too, to accommodate for the width of the top jaw. Cattle come as polled or horned. The horns of bulls and cows, if not corrected with weights, will grow up and forward. If corrected with weights, the horns will grow curving down and towards the inside.

Other characteristics: Herefords are one of the most highly adaptable breeds of cattle in the world. They can be found as far north as the northern reaches of Alberta or Saskatchewan (Canada), in desert-like conditions like that in Arizona, in tropical climates like that in Brazil and Uruguay, on rough terrain and vegetation like that in South Africa, or on wet and cool climates like the place where they originated from; Great Britain. A Hereford's thick hide, light-and-dark coat color, and ability to live off of grass and hay alone, make it able to adapt so readily to the different climates it lives in. Herefords are known for their great temperament and docility (though there can be some crazy ones too), and because they require little management in terms of feeding, are one of the best breeds to raise on ranch or range-like conditions where most cows are selected to be able to fend for themselves most of the time.

Prolapses, sun-burnt udders and pinkeye are not a common problem in this breed if cows that have these problems are culled. Herefords are also known to be quite poor milk producers, but if a breeder is willing to do it, this can be fixed as well with more emphasis on maternity qualities such as milking ability, selecting females with higher milking ability to keep, and culling those cows that do not produce as well as those selected as keepers. Many producers in the parts of the world where they are closer to the equator have also been selecting cattle with better eyes and more pigmentation around the eyes so as to reduce incidence of cancer eye and pink eye.



, This should be pretty easy.

Pay attention to the body shape.,
Inspect the head.,
Determine the sex of the animal.",How to Identify Guernsey Cattle1," Guernseys are typically fawn to brown with white patches. Most white markings are found on Guernsey cattle on the shoulder or behind the elbows, up from the flanks and sometimes in front of the hips; though some cattle may have many more patches behind their shoulders on the rest of the body.Guernseys often have white on the belly and on each leg often below the knees and hocks.
Many other Guernseys will have a white diamond or star-shaped patch on the center of their foreheads.;
, Guernseys are a dairy breed, so they often have an angular body shape and large udders (in cows only, remember) Guernsey cattle are only slightly larger than Jersey cattle.Bulls also have the angular shape in the rump, unlike most other beef bulls.
Most Guernsey cows do not exceed 1200 lbs.

, Guernsey cattle can be identified by the unique characteristics of their heads as compared to other cattle breeds. Guernsey cattle are medium sized, with proportionate, but slight, heads.Guernsey males and females both have fairly feminine looking features when compared to other cattle like Red Angus.
Guernsey cattle are born both horned and poled (or naturally without horns).

, In order to properly identify Guernsey cattle, you will need to determine the animal’s gender. Gender is usually easily determined visually from a distance, but in the event the bull is malnourished, the differences between the genders may be less apparent.Males, or bulls, will usually have heavily muscled shoulders and much thicker necks than females.
Bulls also often have a hump just behind the neck that is easily visible from a distance.
Both male and female Guernsey cattle may have horns.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Galloways are primarily black, though they also come in dun (silver to brown), red, white with black points (ears, nose, eyes, teats) and the Belted (black, red or dun).

Belted Galloway are the same in characteristics and origin as Galloway, but are considered a separate breed and will be covered in a separate breed article.



Body type and characteristics: Galloways are beef cattle, and are moderate in size, much like other British breeds are: cows weigh around 1000 to 1500 lbs, and bulls around 1700 to 2300 lbs. In addition to their beefiness, they have long, shaggy hair much like Highlands do. The coat is double-layered, with coarse hair on the outside to shed wind and rain, and the soft fur-like undercoat acts as an insulation and waterproofing.

Head characteristics: Galloway cattle are naturally polled, and their heads tend to be a little larger in comparison to the rest of their body. They are also as shaggy as the rest of their body, with a bit of a shaggy poll between their ears as well.

Other characteristics: Galloways are docile, tough and hardy creatures able to thrive in colder environments that most other cattle would suffer in. They are, however, extremely protective of their young against pretty well any predator, especially dogs, coyotes and wolves. Some folks even report that just a couple Galloway cattle in with a herd of sheep will protect those sheep from predators much like livestock guard dogs, llamas or donkeys will. They are also an excellent grazer, able to thrive and graze coarser forage that would otherwise be shunned by other breeds; this makes them an ideal breed to use for any grass-fed-only operation. The dense hair coat influences this breed to have very little fat on their bodies, making the meat quite lean, yet tops the charts for the most juiciest, tenderest and flavorful beef than any other breed, according to tests done by the USDA, particularly in Galloway-cross cattle. Galloways are also known for their excellent maternal qualities, making them easy calvers, great mothers, good milkers, and the calves are very hardy and vigorous. The breed also tends to have quite the longevity, with cows being able to be productive well into their teens and beyond.

Galloways are one of the more ancient breeds that originated from Scotland, though its origins are not quite clear. The name originated from Gallovid or Gaul, which is a clan that occupied the southern lowlands of Scotland. They were first documented in the mid 1500's by Hector Boece and Ortelius. The Galloway breed wasn't officially recognized as a breed until 1878 when the Galloway Cattle Society of Great Britain initiated its own volume of pedigrees, separate from the Polled Herd Book that included Aberdeen, Galloway and Angus breeds.

Measure the cattle’s milk output.,
Note the cow’s temperament.,
Cross breed Guernsey cattle with other breeds.,
Understand the Guernsey cattle aging process.",How to Identify Guernsey Cattle2," Guernsey cattle produce around 40 pounds of milk per day. They haven not gained as much popularity in the dairy industry as Holsteins because of their relatively lower output, but the milk produced by Guernsey cattle is arguably more nutritious.Guernsey milk contains 12% more protein, 30% more cream, 33% more Vitamin D, and 25% more Vitamin A than traditional Holstein milk.
Guernsey milk also contains 15% more calcium than average milk does.

, Guernsey cattle are a docile breed and are commonly considered to have a gentile disposition. Other dairy cattle have been known to be more nervous or skittish.Jersey cattle, which are the closest to Guernsey cattle in relation, behave in a very similar manner, but are known to get nervous at times.
Guernsey cattle are considered great for beginner dairy farmers because of their disposition.

, Guernsey cattle make for such efficient and well-tempered cattle that farmers have often decided to cross breed them with other dairy cattle.Guernsey cattle can be cross bred with higher producing dairy cattle like Zebu to produce a cow that has a higher output but retains a higher protein content in the milk.
Guernsey cattle can be cross bred with Jersey cattle to create a cow that is hardier than either is alone.

, Guernsey cattle are able to reproduce at a relatively young age and live long lives. They are very hardy and adjust well to most climates, making this type of cattle among the most coveted among beginning dairy farmers.Guernsey cattle can begin calving, or procreating, at around two years of age: younger than many other breeds of dairy cattle.
Guernsey cattle have been known to survive for twenty to thirty years, allowing for a long life of milk production and calving.

, Note the following:



Colouration: North Devons vary in red colouration from a rich deep red to a light red or chestnut colour. A bright ruby red colouration is preferable for breed standards, hence the nickname ""Red Rubies."" They have light pink noses, and slightly less pink skin surrounding their eyes. They also tend to have a lighter coloured tail switch.

Body type and characteristics: Devons are moderate-framed cattle, with mature bulls weighing in at an average of around 1700 to 2200 lbs and cows between 950 to 1300 lbs. Devons are a well-muscled breed, but not in the extremes like a lot of Continentals are. Devon cattle are the breed that has the thickest hide in the world among any breed of bovine in the world, which makes them highly resistant to external parasites. They have short and curly hair which slicks off nicely in the summer and forms a dense coat in the winter.

Head characteristics: Most Devon cattle are horned, though more cattle are being bred to be genetically naturally polled. Currently, 50% of registered Devons are polled. Devons tend to have a long face, which seems to be more obvious in cows than in bulls.

Other characteristics: Devons are known for their fertility, calving ease, docility, hardiness and ability to adapt to temperature extremes. Devon bulls tend to have a much more well-developed heat-regulating system in their scrotums which make them surprising more able to remain fertile in extremely hot summer weather. Devons are also noted for their early maturity, excellent performance on grass-only-based systems, highly average daily gains, great mothering and milking ability, natural resistance to disease, and high quality carcass merits no matter what system of feeding their on.

North Devon cattle are considered the oldest breed in existence today, with some authorities considering the breed has its origin back in the prehistoric period. This comes from the assumption that the breed is descended directly from Bos longifrons, the smaller type of aboriginal cattle in Britain. In fact, according to the official reference material compiled by the Devon Cattle Breeders Society in Somerset, England called Devon Cattle - The Red Rubies, it appears that this breed may have actually contributed to the start of the Hereford, Shorthorn and other British breeds.
This breed was previously recognized as a dual purpose breed (providing meat and milk), but are now considered a beef breed through the process of artificial selection over the last 400 years.

The native home of the Devon breed is in southwestern England primarily from the counties of Devon, Somerset, Cornwall, and Dorset.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Like their cousins the Texas Longhorns, Cracker/Pineywoods cattle come in a wide variety of colours and colour patterns, from almost all white (with coloured points on the nose, eyes, ears and hooves) to red to yellow to black. Most cattle come in some sort of speckled pattern, but also come as roan, tiger-stripe and brindle, very similar to that of the Longhorn breed.

Body type and characteristics: Like Corrientes, Cracker cattle are small cattle (smaller than Longhorns) and generally a bit rangy, not overly beefy and big like the more modern beef breeds are (such as Limousins and Angus cattle). The mature weight of Scrub cows is usually under 900 lbs, with those of dwarf or ""guinea"" type animals being quite a bit smaller.

Head characteristics: Florida Crackers are horned, though the length of the horns are not as extreme as those in Texas Longhorn. However, the shapes can have interesting twists in aged cows and steers, from both horns curving out and down, to one curving to the side up and slightly forwards and the other curving down and in towards the head.

Other characteristics: Florida Crackers are very rugged and tough cattle, highly resistant to the heat, insects and humidity of Florida's long summers, and require very low inputs to grow and thrive. Heifers tend to come into puberty quite early, often before they are weaned, and consequently their fertility (as well as in other females of this breed) is excellent.

Quoted from the OSU Breeds of Livestock site: ""In spite of importation of purebred breeds of northern European origin beginning as early as the 1850s, large numbers of Florida Cracker cattle were found until the mid-1950s but were then nearly wiped out through crossbreeding with Brahman, Hereford and Angus. Several herds of Cracker Cattle in Florida as well as similar types in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia were preserved by families that appreciated their hardiness, heat tolerance and heritage. The State of Florida has been involved in preservation programs for Florida Cracker Cattle since 1970 and currently has herds maintained at four locations. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Cattle Breeders Association was formed to promote the preservation of Florida Cracker Cattle and over 400 animals were evaluated and registered to serve as foundation animals.""

, Note the following:



Colouration: Dutch Belted cattle are primarily black cattle though occasionally there's also red coloured and even silver-brown coloured cattle. All cattle have a characteristic white ""belt"" around their bellies, that starts at the mid rib and ends at the flanks, and goes all the way around them.

Body type and characteristics: Dutch Belted have the same angular-type body like any dairy breed does, with the typical ""funnel butt"" and finer bone structure than a typical beef animal would have. However, there are some herds of Dutch Belted cows that have the more beefier, fuller look to them than other cows will. The picture above of the cow in the background shows this exception. Cows average between 900 to 1500 lbs, and bulls average from 1350 to 2000 lbs. They have a slick coat in the summer like Holsteins would, but can get quite furry in the winter.

Head characteristics: They can be both polled and horned. DB's have the same kind of fine characteristics as a Brown Swiss would, that being a feminine, refined head in all females of this breed. Naturally, the bulls are quite masculine like any dairy bull would be.

Other characteristics: Dutch Belted cattle supposedly originated from Austria and Switzerland, and were very popular in the 17th century on many estates of the nobility during that time. This breed began to gain popularity in Holland in 1750. Dutch Belted cattle were once the most popular dairy breed in North America from 1815 to 1940. From then, Holsteins took over, and the Dutch Belted breed became quite scarce. Today, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy lists the Dutch Belted as Critically Rare since there are barely 200 registered animals in the country.

Dutch Belted compare favorably with Holsteins in terms of milk production, averaging about 20,000 lbs of milk per year on forage alone. Their milk tests at 3.3 to 5.5 percent butterfat. They are very easy calvers, quite friendly, have surprising good longevity, fertility, and high meat quality.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Traditional Gelbviehs are reddish gold to russet or black in colouration. Traditional German Gelbviehs tend to be darker on their necks than the rest of the body; this is more prominent in bulls than in cows. Red Gelbviehs can be confused with traditional coloured Limousins because of the same light pigmentation around the eyes and nose. Gelbviehs also have strong skin pigmentation, which makes them ideal for temperate to arid conditions.

Body type and characteristics: Gelbvieh are beefy, moderately-muscular cattle, with frame sizes ranging from medium to large. They are long and smooth-haired, with bulls averaging around 2300 lbs and cows averaging around 1300 lbs in weight.

Head characteristics: Though the traditional Gelbvieh breed was originally horned, this has been bred out in most of the modern-day Gelbvieh cattle. Cows have a moderately long face, not dissimilar to Simmentals, Charolais or Limousins, and bulls with similar head characteristics to the aforementioned breeds.

Other characteristics: GVs originated in the three Franconian districts of Northern Bavaria in southern Germany. Originally, when they were created in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they were bred for meat, milk, and draft work (triple-purpose breed). Gelbviehs first made their way into North America in 1971, and the American Gelbvieh Association (AGA) was organized. Today, females can be registered as purebred at 7/8 Gelbvieh and bulls at 15/16. This means that breeds like Angus and Red Angus can be infused into this breed for higher genetic variation and merit.

Gelbvieh, according to proponents of this breed, claim that this breed is great for its high fertility, freedom from genital defects, superior calving ease, mothering ability, exceptional milking ability, and high growth rates. Carcass characteristics have a lot of potential, since the breed is mostly lean, but can be crossed with breeds like Angus to get an exceptional carcass quality. Gelbviehs are also very quiet and docile, which is easily passed on to their offspring, crossbred or not.
They are also highly adapted to hot arid climates, with not only the skin pigmentation that makes them resistant to sunburn and able to stand out in the hot sun without any problems, but also their ability to restrict blood flow to the areas where they have been bitten by ticks, isolating the ticks and starving them. This is a characteristic that has been noticed and proven by South African Gelbvieh Association, and is currently undergoing more research.

, Note the following:



Coloration: Corrientes, like Texas Longhorns, come in a wide variety of coloration except white. However, most animals of this breed are primarily black.

Body type and characteristics: Animals of this breed are relatively small in comparison to other beef and sporting breeds, with mature cows only weighing up to 800 lbs and bulls around 1000 lbs. Yearling bulls or steers reach only around 400 lbs. They are narrow and fine in conformation, with well balanced head, neck, forequarters and hindquarters. They tend to have a dense coat and a heavy tail switch that often extends below the hocks.

Head characteristics: All Corrientes are horned (except calves, which start growing horns when they are about a month old), and all tend to have hair in their ears along with their dense coat. Heads are typically large in length and size in comparison with the rest of their body, making them an ideal breed for use in the rodeo circuit. Special attention is made to their horns, which, though smaller than the Texas Longhorn or Florida Cracker/Pineywoods cattle, grow out straight, curving up to the front and up slightly, and are set fairly wide apart.

Other characteristics: Origins of this breed can be traced back to the first Spanish imports that came to the Americas and the West Indies in 1493. They were used as a beef breed up until the early 1800's, and had extended in population from the southern US to California. However, ranchers started to improve their herds with the use of more modern beef cattle, and the Corriente lost ground, except for use in rodeos.

It is interesting to note that the word ""Corriente"" didn't exactly refer to a specific breed. In parts of northern Mexico, not only was this term often referred to cattle of various descendants of early Spanish cattle (in South America, these same type of cattle are called ""Criollo""), but it was also frequently used for any small cattle of indiscriminate breeding--not just for the type of cattle recognized by the NACA (North American Corriente Association). ""Corriente"" became the most common term used at the US-Mexican border to refer to those cattle that were purchased for rodeo use. Consequently, most cattlemen, bulldoggers and ropers knew this name, and so the NACA chose this name to be used in the registry of these small horned cattle.

Thus, this breed is used in rodeos for bulldogging (steer wrestling) and team roping competitions. They are often judged on strength, stamina, and performance qualities in the rodeo ring, which makes them a great sporting breed.


In Florida, cousins of these Mexican Corriente still exist, though they are referred to as Cracker cattle. In Louisiana, these same animals are often referred to as Scrub cattle.
Corrientes are small, yet very hardy and easy to tame. They are easy keepers (or good calvers), and tend to have a quality lean carcass characteristics. Because of their size, they easily out-do other breeds in terms of ability to live off of less feed and water required.

Colouration: Canadian cattle are primarily black, though some can also be dark brown or red. Most cattle have, if they are a dark brownish colour, a dark face that can be black to a blackish-brown colour, sometimes with a wide lighter-coloured saddle over their shoulders and rumps and lighter colouration at the poll, on the muzzle, in the ears and on the udder or scrotum. Eyes, nose and hooves are dark, and the skin is also darkly pigmented. Calves are born a pale colour, but turn dark with age. Occasionally, some animals are light to white on the udder, stomach and chest.

Body type and characteristics: Canadienne cattle are dairy cattle, much like Ayrshires, Dutch Belted, Jerseys and Holsteins. They are angular in body with the cows having large udders, but are more rugged and adapted to the rougher Canadian environment than the imported breeds like Holsteins are. This Canadian dairy breed is a small breed, with cows weighing no more than 1000 to 1100 lbs, and light-boned. They tend to have short hair in the summer which grows out in the winter.

Head characteristics: Canadian cattle are both horned and polled, with the horns being quite short. The head similar to a Jersey's but with slightly more defined ""eyebrows"" which can be see when viewing the head from the side. The head is fine, but rugged, with straight and tidy faces.

Other characteristics: Canadienne cattle is a Canadian breed, developed from breeds that were imported from Normandy and Brittany during the 1500s and 1600s. Stock were blended and crossbred from these different cattle and bred for longevity, hardiness, and excellent foraging ability in adaptation to the coarser forage that grows in Canada. They are exceptionally docile, able to produce good quantities of quality milk, and the meat is lean, with a high percentage of usable meat in relation to the total body weight. The breed is considered an endangered breed, with most of the herds that are being raised by breeders concerned about preserving this breed in the province of Quebec. In the late 19th century, the breed's characteristics became much less valued than those imported breeds that were less adapted to the local environment, and consequently the breed had to form a breed association (known as the Canadienne Cattle Breeders Association) to increase efforts at preserving this breed.

Some animals may have dark speckling over their ribs and neck. Some British White and American British White4 Park cattle can also be red pointed, though this is more rare in this breed than the black pointed characteristics are.

Body type and characteristics: British Whites and American British White Parks are moderate-sized cattle, with mature bulls weighing up to 2300 lbs and cows around 1400 lbs. They are a beef animal, but are also a heavy milking breed, making them a dual purpose-type animal. Bulls are built with the same muscling characteristics as Angus bulls are.

Head characteristics: British Whites and American British White Parks are polled. They are a typical European breed like Angus, Shorthorn, Hereford, Limousin, Charolais and Simmental cattle are, with shorter-length heads and wide muzzles similar to Herefords and Shorthorns.

Other characteristics: British Whites and American British White Parks are a very old breed, one of the oldest in Britain, with direct links to the ancient indigenous wild white cattle of Great Britain. This breed originated from Whalley Abbey, Lancashire, however was not officially named as such until 1946. It is considered a rare breed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, with only 1500 registered cattle recorded in 1990.

Charolais are not the only breed of white cattle, so be sure to observe the cattle's other characteristics as well.;
, In the United states, cattle can be considered purebred Charolais as long as 31/32 of their genetics are from Charolais cattle. This means that 1/32 can be from other breeds like Angus or Red Angus. As a result, it is possible for Charolais cattle to have red or black coloring, in addition to the traditional white or cream varieties.Some Charolais cattle also develop a red coat due to a gene mutation.In order to be registered with the American International Charolais Association as purebred, cattle must posses 31/32 Charolais genetics and be white, cream, straw, or red in color. This means black cattle are not eligible for the the designation, even if they meet the genetic standards.
Black and red Charolais may be more difficult to distinguish from other breeds of cattle because they lack one of the most distinctive features (the white color). For this reason, you may need to pay even more attention to the body composition and head characteristics than you would with a white Charolais.

, Charolais cattle have an adaptable coat that helps them thrive in variable climates. In the winter, their coats are long and thick, but in the summer, they are short and sleek., Charolais cattle are very broad and heavier than many other breeds. Cows weigh an average of 900 kg (1984 lbs), while bulls weigh an average of 1,100 kg (2425 lbs).In addition to being bulky, Charolais cattle are also rather tall. They have long legs compared to other breeds of cattle., Charolais cattle have long, sturdy bodies. Pay attention to the length and straightness of the spine to help you decide if the cattle you are looking at are Charolais.


Charolais cattle have straight backs that do not arch or round.Charolais cattle also tend to have longer spines than many other breeds., One of the main advantages to Charolais cattle is that they are extremely muscular. As you are observing cattle, pay particular attention to the muscle definition of the hindquarters, as this tends to be very defined in Charolais.You should notice a well-rounded second thigh on the bulls.The loins and haunches are also very muscular.Females have less muscular legs than males

, Charolais are naturally horned, but because many Charolais in the United States have been bred with other breeds, polled (hornless) Charolais are fairly common as well.Purebred Angus cattle do not have horns, but those that have some Charolais genetics might., Charolais cattle have wide muzzles and strong jaws. Like the rest of their bodies, their heads are large and powerful looking. Charolais cattle also have very muscular necks that hold their heads proud.

, Charolais cattle have large ears that stick out to the sides. Their eyes are set wide apart."

, Note the following:



Colouration: Brown Swiss (also abbreviated by BS) range in a deep brown that is almost black, to a light greyish brown. Cows and bulls can have lighter points above the eyes (where their ""eyebrows"" might be) on either side of the poll, sometimes taking up the entire forehead in a V-shape. Light points are also found around the nose, on the lips and sometimes just below the eye - though most BS don't have light points around the eyes like Jerseys do. They are lighter on the legs than the rest of the body and also have a lighter udder/scrotum than the rest of their body. BS cattle tend to be lighter in the ears as well. Bulls that are almost black will have a lighter saddle in the middle of their back similar to Jersey bulls, only the saddle is more of a greyish-brown than fawn. Cows and bulls that are a lighter brown (in between too dark and too light) will always be darker from their heads to the shoulders. Brown Swiss will also have a dark tail switch, dark hooves, deep brown eyes and a black nose.

Body type and characteristics: Brown Swiss cattle are a dairy breed, with a more angular body shape than their beef counterparts, the Braunvieh breed. Like Holsteins, Jerseys and Milking Shorthorns, they have very large udders, and can be quite thin due to their genetics pushing them to put most of their energy into milk production than into muscle and fat. Brown Swiss are larger than Jerseys, and slightly smaller than Holsteins, though some may argue that Brown Swiss are around the same size.

Head characteristics: Brown Swiss tend to have a long face like Holsteins do, and can be polled or horned. Their poll can be quite sharp and can overhang slightly, further enhanced by the hair that grows on there. A BS's ears tend to be a little long, though not as long as a Brahman's, and they can have a dished-looking face similar to the Jersey. A Brown Swiss cow's head is very feminine and refined, making her look quite pretty.

Other characteristics: Brown Swiss don't produce as much milk as Holsteins do, but can produce around 90 pounds per day. The Brown Swiss breed is originally from Switzerland, and are thus remarkably adapted to mountainous and rugged terrain in the Swiss Alps.

To qualify as Brangus, the cow must exhibit 3/8 Brahman and 5/8 Angus genetics., Bulls mature by two years, and can start breeding by 18 months. Heifers are ready to breed by 14 months of age. The bulls can breed through age 12, while the females can produce calves beyond the age of 14., Calves gain weight quickly, and are born about medium size. Mature Brangus bulls generally weigh between 1,800 and 2,000 pounds. Mature females weigh around 1,100 to 1,200 pounds., This breed is noted for its resistance to heat and high humidity as well as cold environments. Brangus cows can withstand changing seasons and are found in different parts of the world, such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia., Brahman cows were bred to exhibit disease resistance, hardiness, and strong maternal instincts. Angus cows are known for their superior carcass qualities and strong females, who exhibit superior fertility and milking ability.Together, the Brangus breed capitalizes on both cows' positive breeds.

, Brangus cows are known to be docile and to have strong maternal instincts toward their young. They exhibit moderate to late-maturing and gain weight quickly. They are hardy and exhibit strong parasite resistance."

However, there is a couple breed association or ranch sites you will come across that tell about the Black Hereford breed.;
, Note the following:



Colouration: Black Herefords are black and white. However, do not immediately think that Black Herefords are the same as Holstein cattle, because they are not. BH's have the same colour patterns as their Hereford-breeding does, with the white face, stockings on their legs, belly, brisket, tail switch, and sometimes the crest. It is also not uncommon to have some BH's that have additional black patches on their faces.

Body type and characteristics: BH's have the same body type as Herefords and Angus cattle do: blocky and square, but not overly muscular like Charolais are. Naturally, bulls are more bigger and muscular than cows are.

Head characteristics: Again, the head is very similar to the Hereford, with the same long broad face and broad muzzle to accommodate for their excellent foraging ability. However, unlike the Hereford breed, Black Herefords are predominantly polled. Some may have scours, but the breed, as influenced by their Angus genes, is naturally polled.

Other characteristics: BH's have the characteristics of both the Hereford and Angus breeding, with great carcass merits along with a great ability to be highly efficient on pasture. This breed is also known for its great mothering ability, calving ease and longevity, milking ability, fertility, and all-around adaptability to different environments.

Black Herefords are a fairly new breed (a Made-in-America breed), with the American Black Hereford Association first founded in 1994. The first Black Herefords qualified for registration was recorded in 1997. The BH breed didn't receive official international designation by the National Association of Animal Breeds until 2003, and in 2005, ABHA created their own EPDs for registered bulls, cows and heifers.

The American Hereford Association has never recognized the Black Hereford breed as a part of the Hereford breed due to the fact that they are not ""true Herefords,"" due to the black colour.

",How to Buy a Miniature Cow," Be sure you don't have any other things you have to do, and make sure you have the time. Do not buy a miniature cow if you don't have the time to care for it, or you can't for any reason.;
, They need plenty of space to graze and run in, and plenty of space for their fencing and shelter.

, Make sure it a safe place in that area where predators don't go in and your cow can't stray out of.

, Buy them before getting the miniature cow because if you bought the cow first, it may need care before you buy the supplies, but you won't be able to check on it because you need to buy the supplies.

, Fencing will keep out predators and keep your miniature cow from escaping. The fencing you get must be strong so predators or the miniature cow won't break through.

, Shelter is the most important part of all. Shelter will protect the miniature cow from bad weather and predators. It should have stalls and fresh bedding in them so that the cow finds a place to sleep at night. Remember to change it every time it's dirty.

, Miniature cows cost a lot of money, so it is a good idea to save money in order to afford a miniature cow.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Brahman cattle.",How to Identify Brahman Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Colouration: Brahmans come in two colours: White to grey, and red. Whitish Brahmans, especially the bulls, typically have much more grey around the neck, shoulder and head area than the rest of their body, with a grey tail switch. Red Brahman bulls typically have a deeper red to almost black tinge around their neck area with a black tail switch. The cows can be all white or all red, with black noses, tail switches and hooves.

Body type and characteristics: Brahmans typically have a more rounded appearance around their rumps, but the most distinguishing characteristics are the large hump over their shoulders, always more prominent and defined in bulls than in cows, and their loose hide. Bulls and cows always have a loose-looking navel compared to the European type breeds, and the dewlaps are very loose with many folds. All of these characteristics make the breed a very hardy breed in climates that are hot and humid with many insects that would otherwise drive a European-type breed of bovine completely mad.

Head characteristics: It is very difficult to miss those big floppy ears. The ears are often twice the size of any European type of bovine, like the Limousin for instance, and they always hang down along the sides of the head instead of up or level with the top of the head. Brahmans also have a broader forehead (more so in the bulls), and have a dished face from the point between the eyes to the nose. Many Brahmans are horned, with the horns up and out. A Brahman's horns are always short, much shorter than that of a Texas Longhorn's or a Corriente's.

Other characteristics: Brahmans are ""made in America"" with the infusion of the Gir, Nelore and Guzerat breeds from India. Brahmans are all commonly found in the Southern portion of the USA and Central America, as well as in South America, because they are adapted to the hot tropical climate typical of those areas. Temperaments in Brahmans range from very docile to very high-strung, with no real in-between characteristics. They tend to be highly responsive to how they are handled and treated, no matter if it's good or bad, and thus require kind, gentle treatment at all times.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Belted Galloway cattle.",How to Identify Belted Galloway Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Colouration: Belted Galloway cattle have a white ""belt"" or ""sheet"" around their bellies (varying in size, but often extending from the shoulder to the hooks) just like Dutch Belted cattle do. They are mostly black, but they also come in dun (silver to brown) and red.

Body type and characteristics: Belted Galloway are the same size and body type as Galloways, plus they also have the same thick, shaggy coat that make them quite tough and hardy in cold climates. However most breeders claim that BG's are a little bit larger than Galloways are, with bulls averaging between 1800 and 2100 lbs, and cows from 900 to 1300 lbs.

Head characteristics: All BG's are polled. They also tend to have a bit of extra hair sprouting from their polls like Galloways do.

Other characteristics: BG's share the same ancestry and origin as Galloways do (originating from the southern lowlands of Scotland). However, according to ""History of the Belted Galloway Society Inc."" The Herd Book of the Belted Galloway Society, Inc. (1951-1971) by A. Mims Wilkinson Jr., most historians believe this breed originated from the infusion of Dutch Belties with Galloways sometime in the 17th or 18th century. Yet, there are documents dating back to the 16th century in Scotland that first mentioned these ""sheeted"" cattle.

BG's have the same qualities of Galloways, but breeders claim that this breed tends to milk heavier, are larger, and grow more rapidly than their parent breed.

,
Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Chianina cattle.",How to Identify Chianina Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Coloration: Chianinas vary from white to steel gray in colour. Bulls are often a darker grey around their necks and shoulders, though there are many other bulls that are just as white as a Chianina cow is. Both sexes have black pigmented skin (covered by the white-to-gray hair), and have a black nose, eyes mouth, tail, slightly in the ears, and hooves. Those animals that are steel grey tend to have white and their muzzle and white on the poll. In those cattle that are horned, horns in younger cattle are black, but lighten at the base as they mature.

Body type and characteristics: This breed is a very large breed, with bulls commonly topping the scales at over 3000 lbs. They tend to have well-defined, heavy muscling, with the shoulders, back and rear being especially well-formed. They are quite tall, mostly because their legs are longer than most breeds, often most cattle exceeding 6 feet (1.8 m) in height at the shoulder. Their bodies are not proportionately as long as some breeds that have shorter legs, so they have this squarish look about them, when looking at them from the feet up and across from the tailhead to the shoulders.

Head characteristics: All Chianinas are horned. These horns are short and tend to curve forward and up.If you have any polled chianinas, it is not fullblood but crosses. The polled gene was not yet found in Italy where the chianina originate from. This breed also tends to have a long face (like that of a Holstein).

Other characteristics: Many cattlemen have recognized this breed as a terminal breed because of its ability to sire animals that are best for meat production and nothing else. This breed has an outstanding growth rate and carcass characteristics, but poor milking production, since it was mostly selected for draft and meat purposes, not milking purposes.But chianina have a very high protein content in their milk, that is resulting in the rapid growth of their calves. That are also the reason why their udders and teats are so small, with no problems for the calves to suck. Chianinas are docility, due to the fact that they was used as draught animals, and were always kept on small farms and spaces. This resulted in selection that see to it that no mad cattle were allowed in the breed. They are big and intimidating and very strong, but this should not be confused with bad temperament.

Chianinas are supposedly one of the oldest breeds of cattle that exist. They were praised by Georgic poets, Columella and Vergil, and were models for Roman sculptures. This breed originated in the west central part of Italy, and raised in a variety of environmental conditions.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Beefmaster cattle.",How to Identify Beefmaster Cattle," This can be done on the Internet or in a cattle breeds book.;
, Note the following:



Coloration: Beefmasters can be any color, and may have white mottled colouration on their head, and even have a little white over their shoulders, in front of their hips, but mainly on their bellies. There really is no set colour pattern like what you'd get with Hereford cattle.

Body type and characteristics: Beefmaster are moderately-framed, beef-type cattle. They are built much like Santa Gerts are, with the loose skin, squarish body and defined navel areas.

Head characteristics: Beefmasters have ""a lot of ear"" on them, meaning they have larger ears than the European breeds do. However, the ears are not as large and floppy as what Brahman cattle have, but more or less in between that of European type and Zebu-type cattle. Beefmasters can be polled or horned.

Other characteristics: This breed is the first composite breed created in America. Beefmasters were first established on the Lasater Ranch, then in Texas, in 1908 when Brahman bulls were purchased to use on Ed C. Lasater's Hereford and Shorthorn cows. Following his death in 1930, Ed's son Tom continued the breeding operation and creation of this breed. He combined the breeding of Brahman and Hereford cattle with some registered Shorthorn bulls, and after making crosses with Brahman-Hereford and Brahman-Shorthorn cattle, only then was he satisfied with the result enough to call them Beefmasters. These cattle were put under and handled under range conditions that were often adverse, and a culling program was put in place based on disposition, fertility, weight, conformation, hardiness and milk production. Very little emphasis was put on colouration and horns.

Consequently, those six essential traits are what make this breed the way it is today. It is referred to as a ""dual purpose breed,"" with excellent maternal traits and traits for growth and carcass quality. They are also heat-, drought- and insect-resistant. Cows are excellent mothers with good milking ability, fertility and hardiness, and raise growth calves that excel both in a feedlot and in a grass-fed environment. They are gentle cattle which make them a pleasure to work with.

, Note the following:



Colouration: Ayrshires are primarily mahogany-red with white. Ayrshires can be almost red to almost white, with rare roan or brindle colouration. Red Ayrshires can easily be mistaken for Guernseys because of the similar markings and colouration. However, Ayrshires are a bit larger and more reddish with more variation in color patterns than Guernseys are. Bulls can be so red they look almost black with the white patches they have on their bodies. They can also have variation of white colour patterns over their head and faces, with sometimes a long white blaze running from the poll down to the nose, and other times with only red patches over each eye. The red or white patches are quite irregular and jagged at the edges, and are often spread all over the body of the animal.

Body type and characteristics: Ayrshires are, just like any dairy breed, quite angular over the hips, and, on average, more thinner than beef cattle are. Purebred Ayrshires tend to be over 1200 lbs at maturity, putting them as being larger than the Guernsey breed.

Head characteristics:Ayrshires come as both horned and polled. They have less of a long face than Holsteins or Guernseys do, and tend to have a more rugged look about them than either of these breeds.

Other characteristics: Ayrshires are very rugged animals, ideal for pasture-based milk production and also the type of cow that is great to have when you cannot be spending too much on supplement feed for them during more difficult foraging periods; they are actually more adapted to rugged terrain and adverse foraging conditions than most major dairy breeds are. They have very little foot and leg problems, and also tend to have great udder conformation. Ayrshires originated from the County of Ayr in Scotland before the 1800s, which is the reason for their adaptability to adverse feeding or climatic conditions.

Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with American White Park cattle.",How to Identify American White Park Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Colouration: American White Parks are predominantly white with black points--nose, muzzle, eye rims, ears, hooves, teats/tip of scrotum--though it's not uncommon to find animals of this breed with red points as well. There may be some speckles on each animal, depending on each individual bovine and a herd's colour intensity.

Body type and characteristics: This breed is a beef breed, with the muscling and body characteristics similar to all other British breeds. American White Parks are a moderate-framed breed, with cows averaging around 1000 lbs and bulls around 1700 to 1800 lbs.

Head characteristics: Most American White Parks are polled, though there are 3 to 5% of cattle that can be horned in this breed. However, registered American British White Parks are not horned but are either polled or scurred.

Other characteristics: There is some debate as to where American White Parks originated from. Some think that this breed is primarily Angus in origin with some White Park genetics thrown in from some breeding pairs of White Parks that were brought to Canada in World War II. According to this theory the offspring of this original importation were sent to the Bronx Zoo, and from there they were split into two groups. One was sent to the King Ranch in Texas and formed the foundation herd of the White Park in the United States. The second groups was sent to Washington and played a part in the formation of the American White Park. Another theory states that this breed originated from British White cattle. No matter the theories, the American White Park breed association was first formed in 1975, and during that time (in which the association kept an open-herd book policy for 6 months) some British White sires were brought in to improve the breed and help introduce the bloodlines of this breed. This is where, supposedly, the polled version of the breed started and took over.

American White Parks have the same qualities of that found in British Whites: docile, great carcass qualities, great mothering, calving and milking abilities, excellent foraging ability, fertility, freedom from disease, etc.

Do a search on the Internet or a Cattle Breeds book on ""Angus"" or ""Black Angus"" cattle.,
Study the characteristics of the breed.,
Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Angus cattle.",How to Identify Black Angus Cattle,";
, Note the following:



Coloration: Angus cattle are all black. Angus associations allow some white to be present just behind the navel under the belly, but all animals that are registered as Angus cattle should be all black, from nose to tail.

Because there are around six other breeds that also have black cattle, this can lead to someone who has no experience with cattle or the breeds of this domestic bovine to have great confusion as to what really are Angus cattle and what aren't, not to mention why so many breeds have black cattle instead of following their traditional coloration and characteristics. The reason is this: Since the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) gave the go-ahead for the American Angus Association (AAA) to start a more aggressive campaign to market their beef, the only breed that could make the cut for this marketing campaign was Angus. CAB (Certified Angus Beef) is that marketing scheme that the AAA thought up of to market their cattle through. However, as far as the USDA was concerned, CAB had specifications that were for cattle that were black, no matter if they had a spec of Angus blood in them or not. It was this specification that allowed other breeds to try to infuse Angus genetics in their stock to create ""purebred"" (as in Charolais) or full-blood cattle that where black. Thus, we now see the breeds mentioned above having black cattle in them to meet these specifications and get a premium for these animals. The AAA also has a program called Angus Source® that allows Angus-sired calves, no matter what other breedthey are comprised of, to be eligible for a premium at the auction market and also be qualified to have their meat be sold as Certified Angus Beef.



Body type and characteristics: Angus cattle are blocky cattle (which is typical of every beef breed), but are not nearly as muscular as Charolais, Gelbvieh, Simmentals nor Limousins. Bulls should have a muscular crest over their necks, whereas cows should lack this and have an overall feminine look. Most Angus cattle are not big animals. Historically, Angus cows weighed only around 950 to 1200 lbs, and bulls weighed around 1800 to 2300 lbs. Today, you may find a fair number of herds with cows that may reach over 2000 lbs, and bulls weighing over 4000 lbs, however, there are still other herds that have retained the smaller size.

Head characteristics: Angus cattle have what cattle producers call ""Angus-looking"" heads. All Angus are polled cattle; you will never find a purebred Angus with horns. The ""Angus look"" means that Angus typically have perky-looking ears, a wide forehead with a more narrow and finer muzzle. They have comparably wide lips like the Hereford, but they're a little more finer and more trimmed than Herefords, with slightly smaller noses. Some may say that the head of an Angus looks a little more finer than other breeds like Charolais or Hereford, mostly because the head appears smaller in comparison with the rest of the body. However it is slightly wider across the forehead than a Shorthorn's, though, in bulls, forehead width between Shorthorns and Angus are quite similar. It is more noticeable between Shorthorn and Angus cows, though. The head also appears shorter in length than other breeds like Holstein, Charolais or Limousin.

Other characteristics: Angus cattle originate from Aberdeen, Scotland, where the climate there is not all that friendly to many breeds of cattle. Angus are typically hardy, adaptable, generally good natured (though most often less so than Herefords, Highlanders or Shorthorns), and resistant to harsh weather. They mature quite early, and are well-known for their excellent carcass qualities. They have great calving ease qualities, great forage convertibility, good mothering ability, good milking ability, and great ability to do well on their own with minimal management, making them an ideal animal to raise in ranch-like conditions. Their thin skin and black hide, however, make them less-than-ideal to raise in tropical climates because they are able to absorb heat too easily and thus suffer from heat stroke and exhaustion. Angus are, however, great animals to raise in climates with moderate summers and cold, snowy winters.

",How to Raise Black Angus Cattle,";
, Depending on your operation, you may wish to time your reproductive seasons with how Nature works, or work against it to time it with other markets like selling bulls and heifers when they're a year old, or to time it with the spring markets.


Have your calving season during a time that you can handle calving and manage calving cows and calves all at the same time when risking adverse weather conditions.
Calving management is crucial to ensure high calf survival from birth to when you sell them. During the calving season, cows and heifers should be monitored for any signs of dystocia or calving issues, and calves for any signs of cold stress, scours, injuries, pneumonia, or any other health issue. Calving out on pasture will minimize any scours, however calving in springtime can be a problem because of the risk of April snow storms that may occur, especially if you live near the Rockies or in areas where spring snowstorms will almost always occur in the springtime. Having adequate shelter, good bedding and plenty of feed is important during this busy time of year.


Know when a cow or heifer is ready to give birth. This is important in telling when and whether a female is going to be needing assistance or not.
Be prepared with the necessary equipment for dealing with dystocia or health or injury-related issues. Your large-animal veterinarian's phone number should be on hand as well.
Separate heavily pregnant cows from cows that have calved. It's easier to separate the heavily pregnant cows into a new pasture than it is vice versa. This is so that those cows that are ready to calve out won't be stealing another cow's calf. This occurs occasionally when hormones are raging during this busy time of year.



Breeding season should follow a few months (80 to 90 days) after calving, and last 45 to 60 days long to ensure fertility in the herd. It should coincide with your calving schedule so that you are calving out your cows and heifers the same time every year without any discrepancies.

Breeding management needs consideration. Will you be breeding your cows using artificial insemination (AI), or natural breeding, or both?

If breeding your cows naturally, choose a good Angus herd bull that will improve the genetic merit of your herd.
If you are wanting to breed your cows using AI, choose superior proven Angus sires with the EPDs (Expected Progeny Differences) that will improve your cow herd. A clean-up bull is good to have to make sure all cows are serviced in time for calving season.

It is highly recommended you semen test all of your bulls prior to breeding season. Nothing is worse than finding out that the main reason you had a lot more open cows than usual was because the bull or bulls you were using was or were shooting blanks, or had a reproductive injury (broken penis) or abnormality (corkscrew penis or abnormal sperm production) that was not caught at sale day.







Weaning should take place when the calves reach 6 to 8 months of age.

Preconditioning calves prior to weaning will minimize stress for the calves at weaning time.
It's also recommend to wean and sell calves when the market price is high, not when its low.



, Unless you have an extremely closed herd (nobody and nothing coming in to your herd from other herds, biosecurity, etc.), herd health management is important for the health of your cows and calves. Annual or biannual vaccination program for your calves, bulls and cows needs to be implemented to keep your herd healthy. See your veterinarian for an accurate herd health program for your herd.


The most important vaccinations for your herd include 8-way or 9-way Clostridium vaccine, and vaccines for BRSV, BRD, PI3, IBR, and Lepto. Some areas may require a vaccine for anthrax as well, if you are in an area that has historically had problems with anthrax outbreaks.
It's best to vaccinate cows at least 3 weeks before calves are born to minimize having to vaccinate calves when you have to tag and castrate them.

, This is very important to your herd. You can't have cows without having something available they can eat. Use the time from spring to fall to make hay, silage and/or grain for your cattle. Make sure you have enough land to make the feed for all animals combined, and that you know the average rate of intake of your cowherd and your bulls. Sometimes you may have to buy feed, but most produces like to shy away from that and put efforts in to produce their own forage.


Feed your cows according to their nutritional demands during their reproductive stages. For instance, a cow ingests 50% more when lactating than when she's dry. Feed that is high in calcium and protein is important to maintain good milk production. When she's dry (with no calf at side), lower intake and lower nutrition is optimum for her, but enough so that she doesn't lose weight nor starves on feed that is just gut-filler.

All cattle typically eat 2.5% of their body weight of dry matter ration. Lactating cows will eat around 3.5% to 4% of their body weight in dry matter ration. How much cattle eat on an as-fed basis ultimately depends on the moisture content of the feed.



, Know, according to where you are located and what type of operation you have, when the best time is to let cows out on pasture and when the right time is to switch pastures. Unless you are doing MIG or rotational grazing, it's best to graze your cows so that you can rotate them once every one to three weeks, allowing the pasture to rest for at least 30 days.


Do not let your pastures get overgrazed. The more a herd of cows graze a particular spot, the less productive it will be. Rotational grazing (or Managed Intensive Grazing) is a good management practice to consider if you wish to keep your grass and pastures as uniform and healthy as possible.

Knowing your stocking rates, stocking density and carrying capacity for your area will definitely help you in determining how many cows per acre (or acres per cow) is needed to stock your pastures.

AU means Animal Units, where one 1000 lb cow (with or without a calf) will consume around 25 lbs of grass per day. AUD is the amount of forage that an animal unit will consume in one day; AUM is the amount of forage that an animal unit will consume in one month.

Visit your local agricultural extension office (USA) or government of agriculture office (Canada) to get information on the stocking rate, stocking density and carrying capacity of your area.






Match grass quality with the animals you have, or what nutritive levels they're at. High quality pastures should be reserved for lactating cows and growing feeder/stocker calves and even bulls that need to improve their condition. Low quality pastures are for dry pregnant cows, cows that have just been weaned from their calves, or cows that have calves 3 months of age or older.
Keep an eye out for anti-quality factors such as bloat, nitrate toxicity, grass tetany, and fescue toxicity. Manage your pastures and your Angus cattle to avoid such anti-quality factors from occurring in your herd.

, Keep records of everything from calving to breeding to health and feeding/pasture management. You never know when you may need them. Keeping record of your finances will also help you immensely in the long-run.

, Cull for temperament, health, conformation, ability to raise and care for a calf, fertility, and forage convertibility.



Pregnancy-checking your females will help in determining whether some of your cows are open or not. Rectal palpation is the cheapest and often quickest way to preg-check your cows and heifers.

Body condition scoring your cattle will also help in determining which cows should be kept or not. It also tells you which cows are too thin to calve or to go into winter and which need more higher quality feed in the winter than others.

Understand why pain management is important.,
Consider lidocaine.,
Consider giving your cow Xylazine.,
Use ketoprofen for postoperative management.,
Keep your cow’s age in mind when considering pain management.,
Determine which method of dehorning you will choose.",How to Dehorn a Cow1," Dehorning is a painful operation because there is a sensitive nerve, the corneal nerve, that is present in the horn. This nerve runs from the base of the cow’s eye into the base of the horn. Before dehorning a cow, it is recommended that local anesthetics be injected into the corneal nerve to remove any pain that might be felt by the cow during dehorning.


The following local anesthetics and sedatives can be used.;
, Lidocaine is an anesthetic agent that acts by blocking the nerve signals between sensory nerves where it is applied or injected. It is a local anesthetic, which means that it can only be applied to areas where the procedure will be performed.


There is also a topical lidocaine that you can applied during milder procedures.
The dosage is generally 3 to 5 milliliters (ml) of 2% lidocaine, 10 to 20 minutes prior to the disbudding(the word used to describe the dehorning of the cow).

, Xylazine is a potent α2 adrenergic agonist, and is classified as a sedative and analgesic. It blocks certain nerve receptors in the nervous system, and will cause a depression of the central nervous system (CNS). This means that 10 to 20 minutes after injection, the cattle will become sedated and will feel less pain during the procedure.


The regular dosage for Xylazine is 0.1 to 0.2 mg per kg of body weight. It is injected intramuscularly 10 to 15 minutes before the surgical procedure.Xylazine is not approved for use in cattle in USA and has a withdrawal period of 7 days (12). Consult your veterinarian before using this drug in meat type and milking cows that are intended for slaughter and are already milking.

, Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has anti-fever, anti-inflammatory, and pain relieving properties.


The normal dose is 3 mg per kg of body weight. It can be injected intramuscularly.

, If possible, dehorn your cow within a week of her being born. Doing this will lessen the pain she feels because at that age, the horn bud is not yet attached to the base of the skull.

, There are two methods you can choose from: disbudding with caustic paste, or disbudding with a hot iron. Many farms in the United States use the hot iron to remove cow horns.


In the United Kingdom dehorning using caustic paste disbudding is recommended in cows that are a week old."
"
Select the paste you will use.,
Restrain the calf.,
Immobilize the cow’s head.,
Use a sedative if you do not have a chute to put your cow in.,
Locate the horn bud.,
Apply 3 ml to 5ml of 2% lidocaine into the base of the horn bud.,
Apply a protective layer of vaseline around the base of the horn bud.,
Apply the caustic paste.,
Allow the calf to rest.",How to Dehorn a Cow2," There are many pastes out on the market. Always read the labels of these products; many of these products can be used on calves that are up to eight weeks old, and can also be used on calves immediately after birth. However, some pastes may have an age limit, so always double check.

, The first step in using a dehorning paste is to restraint the calf by placing it inside a restraining chute. A restraining chute is a metal cage composed of metal tubes. It can fit one cow or calf at a time, and has a special space in front where the cow’s head can fit. Once the head is passed through the open space, special bars or tubes can be fixed and adjusted so that the cow’s head can be firmly held in place.

, Once the cow’s head is in place, have an assistant move the cow’s head towards the assistant’s thighs. To do this, have the assistant push the cow’s muzzle with his left hand so that the cow’s muzzle rests against the assistant’s thigh. For the right horn, the assistant would use his right hand.Another way to restrain a calf is by placing it in a chute and having an assistant push the calf forward so that the head protrudes outside of the chute. Another assistant can then use his left hip to push the head of the calf against the vertical post of the chute, making the head turn at a right angle with the vertical post of the chute. The left hand is then used to support and hold the back of the head. In this way the horn buds are exposed while the animal is immobilized.

, The calf can also be restrained by administering a sedative like Xylazine. Once the calf is sedated, the calf is gently laid down in a lying position and the front and hind limbs are tied down.

, Once the calf is sedated, feel for the horn bud on the calf’s head. Gently trim away hair on and around the horn bud. Lightly brush the horn bud with a small wire brush.


Do not brush the bud too hard or else it may bleed.

, Locate the occipital groove, which runs behind the cow’s eye and into the horn. Once you find the groove, inject the lidocaine at the base of the bud.


Make sure to hold the syringe at a 45 degree angle away from the eye. Wait 10 to 20 minutes for the medication to take effect.

, Apply the vaseline with your index finger and make sure that it does not get on the horn bud.

, Using a wood applicator or a syringe, apply a thin film of dehorning paste over the entire horn bud and over a small ring of adjacent skin. Only one application of the paste is necessary.


In calves that are one week of age or younger, the entire application area may only be the size of a nickel.
In calves that are older than one week, the application area may be the size of a quarter.

, Once the application has been placed on the horn buds, allow the calf to rest away from other animals and in a place protected from the elements.

Consider the benefits and disadvantages of using a hot iron.,
Select your dehorner.,
Make sure the iron is hot enough.,
Have an assistant restrain the cow.,
Administer the local anesthetic.,
Gently massage the anesthetic into the area around the horn bud.,
Apply the hot iron to the horn bud.,
Remove the horn bud.",How to Dehorn a Cow3," The advantage of using a hot iron for disbudding is that it is bloodless and can be used in calves that are up to four months old. The disadvantages are that is is more painful that caustic paste, and it requires more restraint of the cow in order to keep you safe., You will need a heavy duty electric hot iron dehorner. There are many dehorners to choose from, and some may be made for a specific size of cow. Check the label before selecting your dehorner to make sure you are getting a dehorner that will work on the calf (or calves) you wish to dehorn.


Once you have purchased your dehorner, plug it into an outlet to let it charge. It has automatic temperature control and maintains heat at 100 °F (38 °C).

, To do this, find a piece of wood and press the dehorner into it. If it makes a deep, dark ring in the wood within 10 seconds, it is hot enough.After the test, wait at least three minutes before using the disbudding iron on the calf.

, Have your assistant press the cow’s head against his thighs using both hands. One hand should hold the head against his thighs, while the other hand should restrain the muzzle.


When restraining the cow, use walls to restrict the cow’s movement. Do this by pressing your hips against the body of the cow and sandwiching the cow between you and the wall.

, Find the occipital groove, which runs behind the eye and up into the horn. Take the needle guard off and place the syringe in the flat of your hand. Use your index finger to stabilize the needle by pressing it on its base.


Use the other hand’s thumb to locate where the horn bud is, and inject the anesthetic at the base of the bud, making sure that the syringe is held at a 45 degree angle away from the cow’s eye. Inject 3 to 5 ml of Lidocaine per horn bud.

, Release the needle and use your hand to massage the horn bud and the area around the horn bud to help the anesthetic sink in.


Let the anesthetic sink in for 10 to 20 minutes.

, Place the hot iron over the horn bud and twist several times. Continue to do this until you hear the skin pop.


Look for a white ring, which means that you have burned enough of the bud.

, Take the horn bud out by using the iron like a scoop and flicking it so that the bud snaps out. Doing this will leave a clean circle that is sealed and does not bleed.Look for a small white circle around the depressed area where the horn bud used to be. You should also check for bleeding, though the hot iron should not have drawn any blood. When you determine that the horn has been removed successfully, consider giving your cow some pain medication (this will be covered in the next section) and release the cow back into the stall or out into the field.

"
"
Check the area where the horn bud was for any bleeding.,
Keep flies from landing on the wound by spraying disinfectants.,
Place gauze pads on the wound.",How to Dehorn a Cow4," If you notice that the area where the horn bud was is bleeding, apply pressure to the area using folded gauze pads. After several minutes of applying pressure, the bleeding should subside.


If the bleeding does not subside, you can use a hot iron to cauterize the area, or you can call a veterinarian.

, It is important to try to keep the dehorned area from becoming infected. It is particularly important to keep flies from landing on the area, as they can carry diseases and bacteria. Use fly repellents to keep the pests away.


Two different kinds of fly repellents that can be used in this instance are gusanex and negasunt.

, To keep the wound from getting infected, you can place gauze pads over the wound. However, these pads must be changed daily for ten days.


You can use an antibacterial dressing along with the gauze pads to give the cow extra protection against infection.

Start by typing in ""Cattle Breeds"" in a search engine like Google or Yahoo!.,
Study the pictures of each of the breeds you come across and take note of the following:



Colouration

This will involve a description of not only the various colours that an animal of a certain breed can come in, but also the location of where most of these colours occur, whether it's varied, or in a certain location like the black or red points found on British White, American White Park and Ancient White Park cattle.,
There are specifically two different types of breeds in the world: these are Dairy and Beef breeds.,
Compile all these different factors and physical characteristics together to identify each breed.",How to Identify Cattle Breeds," You will find many different links of pages that have many different cattle breeds, from Oklahoma State University's Breeds of Livestock website to discovering many common cattle breeds at CattleToday.com and on TheCattleSite.com.;
,



Body type and characteristics

This often includes hair type (short and sleek or long and shaggy), muscling tendencies and frame size in comparison with other similar breeds, length of leg and/or body in relation to body/leg size, and the average weight of both cows and bulls. This section also tells you if the breed being referred to is dairy or beef or both.

Remember that dairy cattle tend to be more angular- and thinner-looking with a more defined and larger udder (in cows only). Beef cattle tend to be more blocky and muscular than dairy cattle, with a seeming more rounded appearance, but at the same time not fat-looking (however there can be exceptions: see How to Judge Body Condition Scores in Cattle for more).





Head characteristics

This includes whether the breed can be horned or polled or both and the length and size of the horns (if any), the size of the head in comparison to the body, length of the face, and coarseness/fineness of the head.



Other characteristics

Often a brief history lesson and where the breed originates from is put into here, as well as the characteristics that make the breed what it is today. Such qualities as maternal qualities (e.g., milking ability, mothering ability and calving ease) and terminal/marketing traits (e.g., carcass characteristics and muscling) are mentioned.



, Cattle that are dual-purpose breeds like Red Polls, Dexters and Devon cattle, to name just a few, may be put into the beef category, seeing as they are not specifically dairy cattle but have the looks of a typical beef animal.


Dairy breeds include Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Guernsey, Brown Swiss, Milking Shorthorn, Ayrshire, Dutch Belted, Canadienne, and Randall.
Most North American cattle producers have a criteria for differentiating the different types of beef breeds. There are four types of beef breeds to remember: Continentals, British-type, Composites, and Exotics. This is because there are a large number of beef breeds that have originated from Great Britain (or the UK, as some of you may call it), and just as many other beef breeds that have originated from other European countries like Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. There are also a large number of beef breeds that have been developed by crossbreeding other breeds with each other to get composites with better characteristics than their parent breeds. This has and is being done in North America, South American, Australia, and Africa. Exotics are those breeds that are either not the main-frame of a country's dairy or beef industry, or have just been introduced into a country.


British-breeds include such breeds as Angus, Red Angus, Herefords, Devons, Dexters, British White, Ancient White Parks, South Devons, English Longhorns, Scottish Higlands Galloway and Belted Galloways, Welsh Blacks, Red Polls, and Shorthorns.

Continental breeds include Limousins, Charolais, Simmentals, Maine Anjou, Gelbvieh, Blonde d'Aquitaine, Chianina, Marchigiana, Piedmontese, Belgian Blue, Pinzgauers, Romagnola, Aubrac, and Salers.

Composite breeds include Beefmaster, Santa Gertrudis, Brangus and Red Brangus, Barzona, Bonsmara, Droughtmasters, Senepols, Brahmousins, Beefmakers, South Polls, Santa Cruz, Black Herefords, Texons, Beefalo, Rangers, American cattle, Hays Converters, Speckle Parks, Braford, Simbrahs, Bralers, American White Parks, Amerifax, Salorns, Murray Grey, Mandalongs, Luing, Chiangus, Charbray, Gelbray, Buelingos, Square Meaters, RX3 and Black Maximizers.

Exotic breeds in North America include Dexters, Ankole-Watusi, Florida Cracker/Pineywoods, Corrientes, and even Texas Longhorns. They can also include British Whites and American White Parks, English Longhorns, Dutch Belted and Highland cattle.

It is interesting to note that all the cattle that are in North America were considered exotics, from the Spanish longhorns that first arrived in the early 16th century, to the American Brahman that were first introduced or created in the mid- to late-19th century. In today's North American cattle industry, though, the term more often refers to those breeds that are not a conventional beef nor dairy animal. However, the term ""exotic"" can be quite blurred and marred to the point where there really is no definite definition, and can refer to pretty well any breed in any country.





, Once you have memorized them enough, you will know, off-by-heart, what breed each animal will be.

Assess the situation.,
Get extra help.,
Quickly gather what you need and bring it to where the cow is.,
Calm down the cow if need be.,
See if the cow needs to be cooled down.,
Lubricate the cow's neck area using conditioner and water.,
When the cow is struggling to get free before it actually can get free, calm down the cow and give it some grass or cow treats to distract it.
,
Dig up the dirt around and under the cow's head until the cow can get free.,
Continue digging, cooling, and calming the cow until it's free.",How to Get a Cow's Head Unstuck from Under a Fence," Take note of the cow's body temperature, stress level, thirstiness, and degree of being stuck.

If it's summertime and the cow is overheating, focus on getting water into it soon.;
, Find 3 or 4 people who are knowledgable with cows and have them help you. It's possible to free the cow by yourself but it'll be a lot more difficult.

You probably won't need to call a vet, but keep the vet's number handy just in case.

, Below is what to use to free the cow:

Shovels
Hand trowel
Buckets of water for refilling the spritzer
Clean water spritzer
Hair conditioner for lubricating the cow's neck
Cow treats or grass

, Talk to it quietly and if it's a tame cow, pet it to reassure it., If it's summertime and the cow's been stuck for awhile, you need to make cooling it down a priority.

Take the water spritzer and start spraying the cow's body, starting from the hooves and working your way up the body. Do this every few minutes so the cow won't overheat.
Use the water spritzer to spray water into the cow's mouth. This may take awhile but the cow will probably be glad for the water and hydration is important.

, Pour some water over the area around where it's stuck, and then pour conditioner over that. Don't put your fingers in between the cow and the fence unless you want to maybe lose your fingers.,, This may take awhile, so it's best if you can have other people calming the cow and cooling the cow while you work.

Starting with the shovels, dig up as much dirt around and under the cow's head as you can while being careful to not hit the cow.
Take the hand trowel and continue digging all around the cows head, all under the cow's head, and under the cow's throat area. Work fast but try to stay safe.
If you get to a spot where the hand trowel won't fit, use your fingers to dig. As much as possible, try to avoid putting your hands in places where the cow could easily hurt them.

,


Once the cow is free, keep an eye on it for 30 minutes or so to make sure that it's alright. Make sure the cow has easy access to food and water and call your vet if anything's worrying you.

Catch the calf.,
Put the halter on the calf.,
Connect the lead.,
Leave the halter on for a week or two.,
Be around the calf as frequently as possible.,
Tie up the calf.,
Get the calf used to being handled.,
Untie the lead from the post and begin trying to lead the calf.,
Take the lead in your hand and shorten it.,
Start walking forward, pulling the lead as you do to encourage the calf to move with you.,
Practice doing turns.,
Watch for signs of wanting to get away or turn on you.,
End each session on your own terms.,
Practice, practice, practice!",How to Halter Train Cattle," This is actually easier said than done, and there are several ways you can do this, depending on the age and size of the calf, and your available help (if you have someone helping you or you are doing this alone). Ideally, you should first have the calf in a 20' by 30' pen to make it easier to catch and to get near.


A young calf that is only a few days old can be caught by calmly cornering it or using a cane to catch its leg and pulling it towards you so you can grab the calf by hand. Calves this age are a little ""dopey,"" so it's easier to guide them to where you want to halter and hold them than to simply put a rope its neck and try to lead it. You could put the halter on right where you caught the calf. Just watch out for its mother, especially if she isn't halter-trained herself and isn't too happy with you messing with her calf. If she's giving signs of this, then consider putting the pair in an area where you can separate mom and calf briefly while you begin to introduce the halter to the calf.
Calves that are a week or so older will be harder to catch, but can be roped using a lariat. Calmly approach the calf close enough you can throw the rope to get a lasso on it. Loop over the neck so that the lasso of the rope catches the head. Lead the calf to the side of the fence or wherever you wish to put the halter on. Leading will be the fun part, because you will get a calf that will resist having itself pulled along by its neck and do everything it can to get free or be the one doing the pulling!
For calves that are quite used to being around people and aren't afraid of getting quite near to a person, you can simply use a lead rope to catch it and lead it to the fence to put the halter on. Dairy calves, or bottle-fed beef calves are most likely to be comfortable around humans, and would obviously be the easiest to catch, if at all. You probably won't even need to catch such a calf if you have its bottle with you and it is eager to try to drink fro it.;
, While still hanging on to the rope over the calf's neck, the halter, especially if it's a rope one, should be put on head/ears-first followed by the nose. Loop the calf's ears through the halter with one hand, letting the rope fall over the ears naturally instead of you just putting it on over the head and ears. The adjustable part of the rope halter (which is the nose portion) should be put as wide as possible so that the nose can also be looped in with the halter and the rope tightened to the calf's muzzle.


Leather or nylon halters would be put on the same way, and the head piece adjusted so that it is snug, not pinching. Usually with halter-training a calf, heifer or steer you would normally use a non-show halter first and foremost before introducing, and possibly wrecking the leather show halter.
If you are working with an older calf, or a calf that is typically unruly, you may need to confine its head first with a head-gate or head-catch (usually connected to a squeeze chute or cattle crush) so that you can put on the halter without the risk of injuring yourself or the calf running away on you with the halter hanging half-on. The crazier the calf, the more likely you should put it in the head-catch.

, Snap the lead in a metal ring that is attached on the halter under the chin.


With rope halters, this does not need to be done as a lead rope is already attached to it when the halter was made.

, The halter and lead should be left on for a week or so to allow the calf a chance to get used to it and to learn to respond to the halter's pressure points when it steps on the lead rope.

, This is much more important with calves that are not on the bottle and are a bit leery of you. Feed him range cubes or try to offer him range cubes from your hand, or even a little grain if that's more readily available. Repeat this as often as possible, and even during that time try to get closer to him. But do not try to corner him. Just let him come to you and allow him to figure out for himself that you are not there to cause him any harm, but rather be a bringer of good and pleasant things like food, and eventually rubs.


If the calf is not used to the range cubes, just put some in the feed trough if he does not accept your hand-held treat the first time. Once he gets used to the texture and taste it will be much easier to get him to come for them.
Clean up the pen of manure and old straw and such, careful not to crowd him or make him upset in any way. The best way to do this is to talk to him calmly while focusing on your job.

, Catch the lead rope and tie it up to a sturdy post in such a way that a couple of loops around the post are made, and secured with a quick-release knot. The rope should allow no more than 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) of length between the calf's head and the post, and be tied at the height of the calf's head.


The first tying session should last no more than around 30 minutes. You can increase the time the calf is tied over time.

, While tied, you can start getting him used to being brushed and rubbed. You can also feed him a couple cubes as a treat for being tied up.


Cattle love getting rubbed, but those who have not been handled before may try to get away from you. Just be patient, and rub and brush him over with your grooming supplies when he's staying still. Don't reward him with rubs when he's moving around. Start at the top, from the neck to the tail head (they absolutely love getting rubbed and scratched on and around the tail head area), down the sides and down the the dewlap to under the throat. You could also eventually try to get his legs, but work on that slowly. Most cattle don't like having their feet and legs handled at first.
Work on both sides, just like with horses. Cattle can be good with you doing grooming on one side but a little uncomfortable with the other. Make sure you pay equal attention to rubbing and grooming both sides during the training sessions.

, A younger calf is going to be easier to lead than a weaned calf, but you still may get a fight on your hands, so be prepared. Always lead your calf within the pen, not outside in a more open area. You shouldn't try to lead your calf in an open area until you are confident he won't try to get away from you and is leading properly.

, Take several lengths of rope into your hand (do not wind the rope around your hand) until your hand is several inches from the muzzle of the animal.

,


Always walk on the left side of the the animal.
Make sure you are not walking behind the head nor shoulders of the animal. You must be in lead. If the calf tries to get ahead of you, stop and collect the calf, or get the calf to have its head beside you again.
Do not simply drag the calf as you go along. Encourage it to walk with you by pulling first, then releasing when the calf begins to move, and repeating until you have the calf starting to walk beside you. This will take many attempts to get, and you won't get a calf walking with you on the first session.

, To turn the animal to the left by walking into the head. It will swing away from you as you do so. To turn right, bring the animal's head around your left side.

, If the animal gets jumpy or excited and starts jumping around, calmly keep a grip on the lead and jerk the lead until he stops.


If your calf bolts and starts to run, collect the calf again and bring it around to you. Do not let it get away, because if you do let him get away he will learn that he can get away from you whenever he wants. You do not want that to happen to you in the show ring! Even if it's a larger calf, make sure you hang on and don't let go. The calf should have already learned how to resist the pull of the halter from that time when he was walking around freely dragging the lead rope, and what pressure on the halter means, so even if he tries to baulk on you and get away, a pull or jerk on the lead will teach him that he can't get away even if he tries.
If he does manage to get away on you, get him back in your control as quickly, but calmly as possible. Do not end the session on his terms, this way you are definitely teaching him bad habits.

, You are the leader and the boss so it's up to you and you alone when the practice and training session should end. End it with rubbing and softly talking to him, letting him sniff you, whilst slowly dropping the lead or unclipping the lead rope. Then turn and walk away.

, Repeat these steps every day for 15 minutes to an hour a day to get it used to being lead and halter-broke. It may take you two to three months to get a calf, heifer or steer fully used to being on a halter and lead, and to want to walk with you. You may not be able to take the halter off the calf until it readily comes to you or willingly stands to be caught and haltered. Until then, keep the halter on for as long as possible.

"
Maintain good records of the cattle you own.,
Make sure all of your cattle have their tags and/or have been branded with the brand of your farm or ranch.,
Do a regular physical count of your animals.,
Ensure the proper location of your handling facilities or loading areas meet farm bio-security measures.,
Keep your possessions in a secure area.,
Keep an eye out for any suspicious activity.,
Let neighbors, family and friends you know you can trust to watch your farm for you if you have to be absent for longer than a day or two.,
Join a local/rural initiative or team targeting anti-theft of cattle if there is one in your area.,
Keep the police or sheriff informed if you see certain suspicious activity.,
If you believe it is important, consider buying a gun for your safety.,
Respond quickly if your cattle have been stolen.",How to Protect Cattle from Rustlers," Keep these records in a safe location; the best place to keep health, reproductive, purchase/sale and identification records of your cattle is in your own house or even in a safe. Keep them in a file where only you know where they are, and be sure to keep both hard copies (paper files) and software copies (records on your computer) in case one set is lost.


Keeping records of your cattle is a good thing to do, even if you're not at risk of having cattle stolen off you. But, in case you have to go to court against these rustlers, these records will serve as proof that those animals are rightfully yours and not mere strays.;
, Cattle without tags tend to be bigger targets for theft than those who have tags or buttons. Cattle that are not branded are also fair game; however, even branded cattle are still liable to be stolen, especially if the rustler has mastered the skill of switching brands just like rustlers were able to do back in the days of the Old West.


By comparison though, in today's world, time is money and a rustler would rather not fool around trying to switch brands. Instead he'd rather get in, get the cattle, get out and sell them as soon as possible. Therefore, brands on the cattle are a form of deterrent.

, As many times as you need to come out to check them, make sure you do a headcount to ensure that they are all there. This not only ensures that none been stolen, it also makes sure that none of your animals have found or made a hole in the fence and decided to make an escape or there is a sick or lame animal still out in the grazing grounds.


A headcount is also a good way to tell if you have an extra visitor or two in your herd that came from another farm. By returning such animals to neighbors, you build up a trustworthy rapport that will be returned in kind if needed.

, Your facilities should either be located close to your residence to make it difficult to steal without disturbing you, or far enough into your land that it takes, in the thieves' minds, too much time to travel to and fro. Permanent facilities that are located far away from the road or are quite literally hidden from view of the road tend to discourage most thieves than facilities evident near the road. This is simply because thieves need to be quick about their business, and having to drive a long way into your land can put a bit of a nervous edge on them. Facilities which are hidden might actually be inviting to the thieves, since they can load the cattle without being seen from the road. But it's a different story if there's only one lane going to and from your handling and loading areas.


Handling facilities and load areas must have only a one-way access to and from such facilities or areas. If your facilities have more than one way out and in, you will find out fairly quickly that it will be all too easy for rustlers to go in and get out without being noticed by you or your neighbors. It is ideal to have the exit and entry point of that one-way-access to run by your residence that is located on the farm. This is because you can easily and quickly know if someone is coming up your driveway at a time of night when normally no-one would even consider doing such a thing.
If you haven't done so already, install a heavy iron livestock gate at the entrance/exit where you or trucks must enter from the road to get to the handling facilities. This gate must be kept shut and locked at all times, except when you are around to keep an eye out for trouble and when it's needed ship cattle out or in.

Locked gates, especially those with a heavy bolt lock and not just a chain or latch, act as a deterrent to rustlers. They are also a great signal to alert you if a cattle thief did indeed attempt to steal your animals and was desperate enough to break and enter.


Make sure all access points to where your cattle, no matter if they're in the corrals at the home base or out on pasture, are secure. This means making sure the gates, both wire and swinging, are done up properly and securely. You may also want to consider checking them regularly.

, You should make sure most of your your vehicles, trailers, machinery and equipment are locked up in a secure building. Keep the keys with you in your house, and keep a set with someone you trust to keep them safe for you, especially if you have to be away from the farm for several days.


This is important to know because sometimes the thieves may be interested in more than just your cattle.

, This may be a lot harder to do if you live away from your farm; however, if you have neighbors that know you and are willing to watch over your farm for you, use this as an advantage to help keep an eye out for potential illegal activity.


If you do live on your farm or ranch, it is still wise to talk to your neighbors. Let them know or ask them about potentially suspicious activity, such as if they have noticed any strange vehicles slowing down or stopping to look at your animals or farm while you are away, or if they've noticed any strange activity during the night.

Many people who live out in the rural areas know the regular traffic that goes by there homes every day. Suspicions are always aroused if someone is driving more slowly than they should, if they stop by the side of the road for some reason, or suddenly slow down then after a few seconds, then take off again.


Signs of suspicious activity should also be accounted for. If you can and know how, look for tire tracks or footprints that show that someone has been a little too interested in your animals. But make sure you don't confuse these suspicious tracks with your own or those of other family members/ranch workers! You should know what tracks you make according to the treads on your vehicle tires and the shoes or boots on your feet, and verify those tire treads and footprints do, in fact, belong to you!

, This will keep your peace of mind and acknowledge the fact that you won't have anything to worry about except if your cows decide to make trouble for you while you're away.

, This can give you the benefits of group protection activities, as well as being a source of useful information about keeping your cattle safe. If such a group doesn't exist in your area, consider starting one with the support of other cattle owners., This is of particular importance if you notice activity within a couple days, especially during the night or even during the day. Sometimes they will dispatch a police officer to take a drive down to that particular area of concern to see what's going on or to even give warning to potential thieves that the police haven't forgotten about that particular corner of the country.

, Most producers already own a sidearm, or a rifle, but if you haven't already it may be worthwhile. Thieves really do not like it when the owner of that farm from where they are planning or attempting to steal from has a gun that that owner knows how to use. You do not need to use the gun to cause injury or worse, you just need to fire it over their heads to let them know you're around and you don't appreciate them taking what belongs to you.

, If you have found that your cattle have indeed been stolen, please talk to the authorities immediately. The sooner that the trail can be followed, the better. Contact your insurer as well, to see what is expected of you by way of follow-up––if you do need to seek compensation, you'll want to make sure you have done everything to assure this.

Make up and maintain a good delousing program for your herd.,
Schedule when you need to delouse your cattle, according to where you live, what type of cattle you have and what products you use.,
Treat all new animals before adding them to your herd.,
Cull any and all carriers that you may find in your herd.",How to Prevent Lice in Cattle," You will need to have to buy some delousing products from your local large animal veterinarian, depending on where you live, what animals you have and what's available.


There are topical and systemic treatments available. Often there are several species of lice on an animal at the same time, so you need a product that kills both the biters and the suckers.
Insecticides for lice can be sprayed on, poured on, or applied by the animals themselves via cattle oilers, back rubbers or dust bags.
Carefully read all the instructions and cautions on the label before applying any type of insecticide to cattle. There may be age or weight restrictions or withdrawal times if you plan on slaughtering the animal later.


Never over-dose or under-dose an animal. Over-dosing can lead to toxicity in your animals. Under-dosing will not kill all of the lice, and thus become a source for the rest of the herd. Under-dosing can also lead to insecticide-resistant lice.


Be very careful of what products you use if you have Brahman and dairy cattle. Some products can be toxic to such animals, resulting them collapsing and going into shock.;
, Often it's best to treat all of your cattle in the fall. Late fall is best, just when your animals start to build up their thick coats.

, This is important because you don't know if the new animals you bought are carriers or have even been exposed to lice.


Keep such animals isolated until they've had their treatment, or, if the product requires a double-treatment protocol.

, These are usually older cows that have always had high numbers of lice, even in the summer and after being treated. Carriers will always be a continuous source of lice for your herd, and thus treating such carriers will never get rid of all lice: She may be so infested that the lice will still be able to lay eggs before they die.


Thus, the sooner you get rid of such carriers, the better. If you do not get rid of such carriers right away, lice in your herd can build up very quickly after you treat them, which means you have spend extra money for additional winter treatments.

Let them be.,
Respect their flight zones.,
Talk to them in soft, quiet tones.,
Have a very calm, and relaxed demeanor about you.,
Let them come to you.,
Leave on a positive note.",How to Calm Cows," Quite often after cattle have been handled rough or have gone through some rough, stressful times, they will calm down on their own if you leave them alone. Simply leave them feed and water and don't do anything to them or with them for a few hours.;
, Never step nor push too far into a cow's flight or comfort zone otherwise you will cause unrest. It is preferable that you keep out of a cow's flight zone in order for her to remain calm and quiet.

, All animals respond better and more calmly to you and your needs if you are calm and quiet around them. Cattle have very good hearing and can hear you just fine when you're talking low. You may be the type that prefers to talk to them, or one that chooses to say little to nothing at all. It is your choice which you want to use to best get those animals to calm down.


Some cattle folk find that reading a book to a herd of cows will not only get them to relax, but to get them used to the sound of their new owner's voice, if the animals are stressed and panicked about the presence of a complete stranger.

, Don't think about anything or worry about anything. Just live in the moment, breathe deep, and think about literally nothing. When you're calm, they're calm.

, Let them choose when it is in their best interests to approach you. Cows are naturally curious, and when they've recovered their fears and curiosity takes over, they may approach you and sniff you over.


If it's safe to be in the same pen as them, simply standing in one spot will be sufficient to get them to come to you. They can smell you from a distance and study you, and make their minds up as to whether you're a threat or a friend. Remain calm throughout the whole process.

This may also be a good time to talk to them quietly if you feel the need to do so.



, Once they've calmed down or you feel they have relaxed enough for you to not be around anymore, it would be a good time to simply leave with a good frame of mind.

Understand that phobias are both common and usually easy to treat.Avoiding visiting a farm, getting close to cows, or giving yourself nightmares about them is not necessary as your anxiety can be cured.,
Learn the behaviours and body language of this bovine species.,
Envision being near cattle in a hierarchy of situations, numbered one to ten.Ten represents your worst fear, and one is the situation that makes you least anxious.,
Pay a visit to a farm or ranch that has cattle you can start working with to rid this fear.,
Relax and be calm.,
Breathe.,
Watch the cattle and their movements.,
See if you can give them (the ones that are being nice to you!),
Try to pet one of the animals that have come up to you for a treat.,
Walk away with the thought that you have made good progress with yourself.",How to Not Be Afraid of Cattle," Consider getting treatment from a mental health professional as well as taking the steps suggested in this article. Some of the therapies that have proven successful in treating phobias include cognitive behavioural therapy and Virtual Reality Exposure therapy; some people also respond to a combination of therapy and anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medications.Apart from the professional help though, it's really a case of facing your fear, which the rest of this article is aimed at helping you with.;
, Knowledge is the best way to put your fears behind you. Most of the time when a bovine comes up to you they're curious about you, or they think they're going to get some treats from you (like a handful of grass, for instance).


When a bovine is snorting, growling, or pawing the ground or throwing its head at you, or even giving you that look that looks like they're glaring at you, then move away from the fence and avoid eye contact. In the animal world, when you maintain eye contact with another animal that is visibly challenging you, that's deemed a threat. If you do not move away or make a threatening gesture towards that animal, this will often lead to an attack.
The ones to be most concerned about are: Cows that are protecting their calves or bulls that are growling at you. Head tossing, pawing, showing their sides, growling, etc., are all warning signs that if you don't get out of their way or away from their space, they will charge. If an animal is not showing any these signs, then it's best to not worry about being attacked. Often even thinking negative thoughts will lead to negative behaviour from an animal.

, So, you might envision the following hierarchy of gradual situations:


Ringing up a farmer or rancher and asking him/her to visit their farm
Arriving at the farm where you see cattle out in the corrals or pastures
Walking into a barn where there are cattle in stalls, or out to the pasture where cattle are grazing.
Watching him/her feed and interact with, as well as talk to you about their animals.
Watching the cattle being moved from the barn to the field, or from one pasture to another.
Walking up to the fence where the cattle are grazing
Calling out to the cattle while holding out some treats through the fence
Watching the cattle come over to you
Allowing the cattle to take the feed from your outstretched hand
Patting or petting a cow that the farmer reassures you is fine with human contact.


Remember, this is just an envisioning exercise, but it allows you to gradually work through the various levels of fear, especially in conjunction with thinking of a relaxing or peaceful image, then the anxious image, and so on, per each visualization until you feel comfortable with all of them.

, Nothing works better than facing your fears. Doing so makes you a stronger and more confident person! Call a local farm or ranch and let the owner know what you're hoping to achieve; be polite and explain yourself clearly so that you don't leave the farmer wondering what the issue is. Make arrangements to go to the farm or ranch and spend some time around cattle. Be sure to ask the producer if they can spare some moments to be with you while you observe their cattle; they may be able to talk you through and teach you some bovine behavior to help ease your nerves.


The farm or ranch visit should be at least 40 minutes in duration.Even longer would be better.
If you can't make it to a farm or ranch, wait for a local animal show or agricultural fair to come near you, and visit the cattle in their stalls or pens as they wait to be showed.

, There are two factors to remaining calm. The first is that all phobia therapy teaches you to relax and breathe. Using both relaxation and breathing techniques will allow you to relax more effectively and breathe at will.Secondly, animals are much more sensitive to your energy than you think! You need to be calm and relaxed when working with and being around animals.


If you are nervous, tense, excited, anxious, angry, frustrated, frightened, depressed, etc., then they will mirror your behaviour. An animal will always tell you what you are feeling by the behaviour they exhibit because they live in the present, never the past nor the future.

Humans are the only animals that are able to live in the future or the past. Most phobias are enhanced by a person worrying about what is going to happen in the future, thus causing tension, anxiety and fear. If you learn to not anticipate what is going to happen in the future nor think negative thoughts, things will work out better than you initially expected.

Thus, the key to being relaxed is to never anticipate the bad things. Always think happy thoughts, or just don't think at all and just live in the now.





, As already noted, breathing properly is an important part of controlling a phobia. If you are starting to feel tense or nervous or anxious, take a deep breath and let it out. Stop for a moment and let yourself calm down.


Practice deep breathing techniques to help you to stay calm.

, You've done the learning about cattle behavior, and now is the perfect opportunity to put your knowledge to the test. Are they just standing there staring at you, or are they milling about? Is there just one at the fence line acting aggressively (see above for indicators), or are there several that are not threatening you and merely following you as you walk along the fence?


If you see a herd of cattle standing at the fence staring at you and starting to follow you when you walk away, these animals are not acting dangerous. They just want some handouts from you!

Such a herd will also be swinging their heads back at the flies or to lick themselves, switching their tails nonchalantly, scratching themselves on a fence post, or, if they're relaxed enough, even start chewing their cud. After 15 to 20 minutes, if you haven't given them anything of interest, they will start to wander off and continue what they were doing.


If you only have one animal (like the herd bull or a single cow) that's acting like he or she is agitated about your presence, then simply ignore them and move further away from the fence. Once you have moved a safe distance away (both to you and to them), then they will turn away and go back to where they were ""stationed.""

Remember, you have a higher chance of getting hurt by such an animal if you are in the same pasture or corral as them. If you stay on the opposite side of the fence from the threatening bovine and practice avoidance techniques, then they will eventually leave you be.



, a treat of some hand-picked grass growing on the other side of the fence. Chances are you won't get one eating from your hand right away, but if you're patient enough, you might. But if not, just drop the grass on the ground where they can see it and move away a little to let them eat.


The way you hold out your hand with grass in it is not like you would with a horse. Cattle grab grass with their tongues, not their lips, so if you hold your hand out with your fist enclosed over the part of the grass with lots of stems, you both enable the animal to get the grass from your hand and from not being bitten. Just remember to let go as soon as you think the bovine has a grip on it.

, Scratch them under the chin or jaw, on the cheek or even on the neck. Even under the ear or behind the poll is a good place to touch them. If they shy away at your hand reaching out to them or jump at your touch, you can either stop doing it, or try again. If the same thing happens on your second attempt, then stop.

, Maybe you'll want to come back and try it again! If you do, repeat with the same herd or with a different herd until you have no fear (but hopefully a lot of respect) of cattle.

Note Simmental cattle’s weight and size.,
Identify Simmental body types.,
Check for common Simmental head characteristics.,
Recognize general Simmental coloration.,
Identify Fleckvieh-Simmental cattle.,
Recognize modern Simmental cattle.,
Identify Fullblood or Straightbred Simmental cattle.,
Monitor the cattle’s behavior.,
Recognize early sexual maturity in Simmental cattle.,
Check for Simmental’s particularly maternal behaviors.",How to Identify Simmental Cattle," Simmental cattle are quite large, and notably rugged in physical composition. They have a heavy bone structure, with visibly strong feet and legs.Mature Simmental cows will weigh from 1,100 to 1,500 pounds or more.
Mature Simmental bulls, which will show more muscle mass over their shoulders and hindquarters, usually weigh somewhere between 2,200 and 2,800 pounds.
Simmental can gain weight particularly rapidly, increasing in weight by four to five pounds per day when in a favorable environment and well fed.;
, While all Simmental are noticeably blockish, they are not as rectangular as some other breeds, such as Limousins. Simmental cattle tend to have more loose dewlap – the skin that hangs beneath their chin and their underside – than many other common types of cattle.Use the identification of an especially pendulous dewlap to distinguish Simmental from other breeds that are also often black, such as Charolais, Gelbviehs, Maine Anjou, Salers, and Limousins.
Simmental cows tend to have a larger udder than most other cattle breeds - though Holstein have recognizably larger udders.
Simmental cow udders will have prominent forward and rear attachments to the underside of the cow, with equal-sized quarters and small, uniform teats that are evenly spaced.

, On all Simmental, the head will be longer and larger than many similar breeds. They have particularly larger ears, which protrude from a low location on their head.Simmental cows have noticeably angular and feminine-looking heads, necks, and shoulders.
Simmental bulls have curly hair on their foreheads, some more noticeably than others.
Simmental bulls may be horned or polled, the latter being more common.
If horns are present, they will be quite short, and point out and upward.
Simmental lips and mouths are relatively trim and refined-looking as compared to other breeds, especially in comparison to Herefords.

, Most Simmental cattle have a white face with a brownish-red body. Other Simmental cattle will be lighter in color, while some will be all black, and others mostly brown or mostly red. Some that are otherwise all black or all red will have a white face.In the U.S., where certain traits have continuously been selected for, Simmental are characterized by a wider range of color patterns.
While American Simmental are mostly black, they may actually be any color or color pattern – from all black, to spotted or patchy, to all white.
European Simmental are red or yellow with lots of white.
All Simmental start life as greyish calves with shades of red and yellow hair.
Pigmentation around the eyes, as well as the udder and scrotum, are common, especially in the U.S.
Nearly all Simmental cattle will have ears that are the same color as their body.

, Flechvieh-Simmental cattle will range in color from a light buckskin-yellow to a brownish-red. They will have a white face that almost always has a border line just before the jawline, and a white underbelly.Some may have a patch over each eye; others may have one patch over one eye.
White will likely show on the flank and elbows, sometimes forming a stripe from behind the elbows or from the flank all the way up to the topline.
They will have a lot of white on their belly and legs.
The tail of a Simmental-Fleckvieh will usually be all white or white half-way down.
Simmental cattle do not have a white stripe down the nape of their necks, nor white dewlaps. If these are present, the cattle are likely Hereford.

, Some more modern breeds of Simmental will have less white markings and will be mostly darker brownish-red to black. If they do have some white, it will likely be lower on the leg.


White faces are common in modern Simmental, though they may have different colored eye patches and less white overall.
Some Modern Simmental cattle may still have a recognizable white stripe from the shoulder down to the elbows, or from the top of the loins to the flanks.

, These will likely be all black, all red, black and white, or mostly black or red but with a white or mostly-white face.


Fullbloods are often bred with Red Angus, Angus or Hereford cattle. Simmental bulls that have been crossed with Angus and Red Angus breeds will often look like Angus at first glance.
Distinguish Simmental from Angus cattle by noting ear and dewlap coloration, as well as muscularity, to decipher key differences between an Angus bull and a Black Simmental bull.

, Simmental cattle tend to be docile and even-tempered, as these traits have long been selected for by breeders. Since Simmental are often bred for environments in which they are heavily managed by humans, they are noticeably calm., Though it takes about four years to reach full size, Simmental cattle are known for experiencing early sexual maturity.Cows begin menstruation when they’re only 650-700 pounds, or as early as 9-12 months old.
Bulls reach sexual maturity by 15 months of age and will readily breed with 25 cows in one season.
Mature bulls will happily breed with about 50 cows in a seasons if environment permits.

, Simmental cows' docility and high milk production allow for roughly annual births. A Simmental cow will maintain a yearly calving cycle for as many as a dozen years.Cows can conceive as young as 15 months old.
Simmental cows will happily breed while nursing.

Properly carry out one of the recommended methods of choice to euthanize a cow.,
Confirm that the animal has been properly stunned or rendered unconscious.,
Confirm death using a combination of signs exhibited by the animal.,
Dispose the animal's body properly in according to provincial/state and federal jurisdictions.",How to Humanely Euthanize a Cow1," The three primary methods of euthanasia are overdose with barbiturate, penetrating cap-bolt, or gunshot with a firearm. These methods are explained in more detail below. Secondary euthanasia methods to be used after one of the previously mentioned methods is exsanguination, pithing, or a rapid IV injection of potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate. These will also be explained in more detail below., Training will be needed before you go ahead and use any equipment on an animal that requires euthanizing. Not only will you need to know how to handle the equipment properly with both your and others' safety in mind (this is of utmost priority), you will also need to know how to take care of it before and after use, from cleaning and loading to safe storage, among other details. Knowing where and how to aim is also very important, especially if you are handling a firearm.


Safety training before using a firearm is highly recommended, and should also be required before even owning and operating a firearm. Countries vary in their laws with respect to training, permit-carry, and other details. Some have more strict laws than others. Please check with your local state or provincial department of justice (and your federal one) to see what the laws are for gun ownership are for your area. Also ask if they know of any potential times and places (or who puts them on) for firearm safety training.
You may also require some training with handling a penetrating cap-bolt gun. Though there is not the kind of training as with fire-arms, it's highly recommended to read the manual that comes with it before use and familiarize yourself with how it handles, how to take it apart to clean and lubricate it, safe handling, and other useful information.

Remember to treat a cap-bolt gun just like a regular handgun. It can be just as dangerous if mishandled. It is a tool to stun large animals with, but if improperly handled it can turn into a deadly weapon.


Another skill requirement is target practice. In order to be successful at euthanizing an animal that is 10 times bigger than you and just as strong, you must be proficient at where to aim to make that kill-shot, and, most importantly, how to aim.

If you are not confident with your aiming skills, then do not attempt to euthanize an animal yourself. Get someone that is more competent to do the job.




, The target site is never between the eyes, but rather just above the eyes. An invisible X drawn from the outside corner of the eye to the base of the opposite horn or between the base of the ear and the poll. Aim at a 45º angle (or perpendicular to the skull) so that the bullet or cap-bolt penetrates the brain.

This ""angle of attack"" and point of target is similar for adult cows, heifers, steers, and bulls.Calves younger than 6 months are very similar with target region., A plan includes the following criteria:

Who is primarily responsible for conducting euthanasia;
How soon after veterinary diagnosis or own judgement that an animal should be euthanized to reduce prolonged and unnecessary suffering;
What are the various specific situations that euthanasia may be needed and how would the animal be dispatched as humanely and safely as possible;
What method of choice is most practical according to a specific situation, personal preference, if a veterinarian is readily available/accessible, tools available, human safety, aesthetics (especially if you live or your pastures are right by a road with regular traffic), cost, skill level, etc.;
What tools are easily accessible and ready to use when needed;
What other tools or equipment can be use to keep yourself and others safe in case things don't go to plan;
Where and how the carcass is to be disposed.

This may include the considerations of what may possibly make this carcass suitable for consumption or not. Times when euthanized animals are not suitable for meat is when they are killed before the drug withdrawal period has ended, or they have a communicable disease that may pose a food safety hazard if the meat is consumed.



, There are five primary indications where euthanasia is required :

An animal's unlikeliness to recover from a disease;
An animal's failure to respond to treatment or convalescent protocols;
An animal has chronic, debilitating and/or severe pain and distress that cannot be relieved by treatment even in emergency medical situations
An animal is unable to get to or consume feed and water; or
An animal shows continual weight loss or emaciation despite continued efforts to correct the problem.
Other indications include the following, which can be a combination of the primary indications mentioned above:An animal has a fractured leg, hip or spine which is not repairable and results in immobility and/or inability to stand;
An animal experiencing emaciation and/or debilitation from disease or injury resulting in an animal being too weak to be transported or to get to or consume feed and water
An animal experiences paralysis from traumatic injuries or disease resulting in immobility and inability to get to or consume feed and water;
An animal has advanced eye disease (i.e., cancer-eye or lymphoma in cattle);
An animal has disease condition where cost of treatment is prohibitive or impractical;
An animal has a disease condition where no effective treatment is known (i.e., Johne’s Disease in ruminants, Foot and Mouth Disease, Mad Cow Disease, etc.), or the prognosis is poor, or the time to expected recovery is unusually prolonged and stressful for the animal; or
An animal is suspected of having rabies or another disease where there is a significant threat to human health.



, You may also consider the other alternative of slaughter, if the following criteria influences your decision on any of these three options:

Pain and distress of the animal (i.e., Is the animal in such pain and distress it is more crueller to try to save it and treat it, or if it can move on its own to be shipped to slaughter, or is the animal ""non-ambulatory"" );
The likelihood of recovery from the inflicting illness or injury;
The ability of the animal to get to feed and water;
Drug withdrawal time (i.e., an animal euthanized before a 30-day withdrawal time has ended is not suitable for consumption);
Economic considerations (i.e., practicality to treat based on time and money that may be required for treatment);
Condemnation potential (i.e., drugs in system, stress and disease affecting meat quality, etc.)
Diagnostic information (i.e., is animal going to recover with treatment, or is treatment going to be ineffective; type of disease or injury, etc.)

, The following elements to help you decide which method is most appropriate.


Human Safety. This must be your first consideration. Using a firearm, for example, is the most risky method of euthanasia.

Animal Welfare. All methods of euthanasia must be effective in producing rapid death with no detectable distress or pain to the animal. The method selected must take into account both human safety and animal welfare that is appropriate for a specific situation.

Restraint. Appropriate methods of restraint should be used with euthanasia procedures. Methods like captive-bolt will require excellent restraint of the animal. Availability and quality of halters, cattle chutes, gates or other forms of restraint make certain forms of euthanasia more suitable than others.

Practicality. Appropriate euthanasia techniques must be practical to the situation and for you to use. Though you may be responsible for carrying out euthanasia you may not have quick or easy access to any tools needed for euthanasia. While this won't make euthanasia alone impractical, it may be necessary to call on a neighbour or veterinarian to do the process for you.

Cost. Cost varies with euthanasia options. Certain methods require a large investment initially which may pay for itself over time if it gets used often. This is certainly true with using cap-bolt guns or firearms.

Aesthetics. The appearance of a method being more humane over others may be an influencing factor in euthanasia method of choice. A lethal injection of barbiturate makes the death process appear more ""peaceful"" because of the lack of involuntary movements that are more associated with using a firearm or penetrating cap-bolt. To an individual inexperienced with bovine euthanasia, these involuntary movements may be easily misinterpreted as painful voluntary responses, which may be further misinterpreted as that particular method of euthanasia as being ""inhumane"" or ""cruel."" Thus when selecting a euthanasia method, the potential negative reactions by the animal and/or observershould be considered.

Diagnostics. If a sample needs to be collected for lab analysis, the selected method should not compromise that sample collection. This is especially true if a brain tissue sample needs to be sent in for BSE testing, for example.

Carcass Disposal. One of the more critical considerations to make when selecting a euthanasia technique. Appropriate disposal of the carcass prevents scavenging and potential toxicity issues among wildlife. Carcasses must be handled and disposed of according to state/provincial and federal regulations. Options include rendering, composting, incineration and potentially landfills. Cattle euthanized with barbiturate overdose may not be accepted in rendering facilities because the drug tends to persist in the residual material following the rendering process. In some areas regulations require such animals to be incinerated or buried instead. Methods including gunshot or captive bolt may be more viable since they provide a more wider range of options for disposal.

, These are, via the 2013 AVMA Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals:

Manually-applied blunt-force trauma to the head of calves or mature cattle, such as by a large hammer;

This technique is especially not recommended for young calves because their skulls are too hard for this method to be effective, as well as the method lacks consistency based on restraint and complications with positioning the calf for effective use of this method.

A purpose-built, non-penetrating cap-bolt stunner is an acceptable method of euthanasia for calves, provided a secondary euthanasia technique is carried out immediately after to ensure a quick death.




Injection of off-label chemical agents or substances not permitted for use as euthanasia agents (i.e., disinfectants, non-anaesthetic pharmaceutical agents);
Sedation with an alpha-2 agonist such as xylazine, followed by potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, or any other euthanasia method requiring the animal to be unconscious before its use;
Injecting air into a vein;
Electrocution with a 120 or 220 volt electrical cord;
Drowning;
Exsanguination of conscious animals.

, If you have to move or handle a cow prior to euthanasia, do so quietly and not more than what's necessary. You want to keep in mind that the animals be kept as stress-free and as calm as possible. Animals stressed prior to euthanasia are more prone to be dangerous and unpredictable. Keep the animal's and your safety in mind when choosing when and how to move an animal prior to euthanasia.


Do not forcibly move or drag downer cattle prior to euthanasia. This will certainly cause unnecessary stress in the animal.
Restraint--and in choosing what type--should also be done as safely and least stressful as possible.
If you have unmanageable or aggressive animals to work with, consult with your veterinarian on using sedation to facilitate euthanasia., The methods below will guide you through what needs to be done to successfully and humanely euthanize a cow using barbiturate overdose, a cap-bolt gun, or a firearm.

The first method, overdosing with barbiturate, should only done by a licensed veterinarian. This is primarily because all drugs used for euthanasia are not freely sold to any non-veterinary personnel since it is a powerful and potentially dangerous drug to administer. You would need proper veterinary training to be able to be qualified to administer this drug without needing a licensed vet to do so for you.
The proceeding two methods can be carried out by non-veterinary personnel provided they have the proper training and skills to do so.

, This is one of the most important steps because the first shot with a cap-bolt or firearm may not be enough to render the animal unconscious; soon followed by death. Be prepared to follow immediately with a second shot. The signs of unconsciousness shown by the animal are:

Immediate collapse of the animal when the cap-bolt or firearm is discharged;
No attempt by the animal to right itself following the stun or shot;
Body muscles become rigid immediately after, followed by varying degrees of involuntary movement of the limbs;
Normal rhythmic breathing stops;
Eyelids remain open with eyeballs facing straight ahead, not looking around; and
No vocalization is heard.

, Death does not occur immediately, but it is the result of respiratory and cardiac failure. This can take several minutes. Thus it is crucial that animals be rendered unconscious or insensible and remain insensible until death has occurred. Death is confirmed by all of the following:

Lack of heartbeat;
Lack of respiration (no sign of rise and fall of rib cage);

Respiration rates can be erratic or absent in unconscious animals, so be cautious about using respiration as a interpretation for confirming death.


Lack of corneal reflex (no response when the eyeball is touched);

Normally conscious animals will blink when the eyeball is touched.


Presence of rigor mortis.
The above criteria will need to be observed for a period of at least 5 minutes after euthanasia. An alternative is to observe the animal for several hours; lack of movement in addition to the absence of a heartbeat, respiration and corneal reflex over an extended period of time further confirms that death has indeed occurred.

, Your local municipality may also have laws in place that determines how dead animals should be disposed properly by way of rendering, burial, composting, and incineration."
"
Find the cattle that are in need of being treated or vaccinated;
,
Restrain the animal in a squeeze chute.,
Read the label.,
Find the injection site.,
Select the syringe or dosing gun.,
Give different injections in different places.",How to Give Cattle Injections1,", Make sure their heads are restrained in a head-gate. It is much easier to give injections to cattle that are restrained by a head gate or squeeze chute (also called a crush), or by a medina-gate that pins the animal to the fence or side of the barn, than if you were trying to inject them without any of this equipment available.


A squeeze chute or cattle crush is a narrow stall with adjustable sides that is just wide enough for one adult cow to be held. Here the side panels compress or squeeze the sides of the the animal so that she cannot move from side to side and is supposed to induce a calming effect on the animal. A gate at the rear keeps the animal from backing up and out of the chute, and a head-gate on the front has an opening wide enough for its neck, but not its head or shoulders. This makes its head accessible for oral medications, dehorning, and the neck easily accessible for injections. An alleyway or working chute leads up to the squeeze and can hold multiple cows at a time.
Restraint of the animal keeps both you and the bovine safe, and significantly reduces injury to yourself, your co-workers and the animal being handled. However, some farms or ranches are not equipped with squeeze chutes, and you may have to rely on some people with lariats and good cow horses to keep an animal down so you can give it the needed injection.

, Always read and follow the directions on the label of the medication or vaccination for required dosage and require routes of administration. The drug manufacturer is obliged by law to print instructions on the injection bottle and provide such information, as well as warnings, targeted micro-organisms, and other information.


If there is an option to choose between an intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SQ) injection route, always go for the SQ as it is less invasive, which means it is less likely to damage valuable carcass meat.However, some drugs do need to be given by IM injection in order to be properly absorbed (see Method 4 for information on which drugs should be given through IM).

, The required site for injection, particularly in beef cattle, is a site called the ""injection triangle"". However, for dairy cows, often injections are given in the skin between the tail-head and the hip bones (the pins of the pelvis on the bovine). This triangular area is located on either side of the the neck and contains few vital structures (like blood vessels and nerves). The injection triangle is broadest at the shoulder and tapers towards the ear.


The retail value of meat from this site is lower than the rump, so you are less likely to lose money if you are planning on selling the meat.The landmarks for finding the triangle are:

The upper boundary, located below the spinal column (below the nuchal ligament) following the line of the neck crest or top-line;
The lower or angular boundary, drawn along and above the line of the jugular furrow, located in the middle of the neck.
The posterior boundary (the one closest to the rear of the animal) follows the line above the point of the shoulder, which angles up towards the top-line or top of the shoulder.



, Injections are be given by either syringe or with a dosing gun. The difference between the two is that with a syringe, you manually control how much of the drug gets injected into the cow, while the dosing gun dispenses pre-set volumes of medicine for administering more than one animal.


A syringe is made up of three parts: the body (that contains the drug), the plunger (that fits snugly inside the barrel), and the needle. Syringes are plastic and often used no more than once or twice before they are thrown away. Plastic syringes come in 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 20, 35, and 60 cc (1 cc = 1 mL) sizes. Use the size of syringe needed according to the dose requirements for a single animal, and one dose in a syringe should only be used for one animal.
A dosing gun or pistol syringe similarly has a glass barrel (typically loaded with multiple doses) with a plunger that has a thick rubber washer at the end to form a vacuum, a needle and a handle-trigger that is the same as that on a caulking gun. Some guns have the option of attaching a bottle to it. Majority of dosing guns come in 5, 12.5, 20, 25, and 50 mL sizes.

, This is if you have more than one medication or vaccination to give. The next shot should be administered in a place that is at least four inches (about a palm’s width) away from the first shot site. If you keep putting medication into the same spot, the cow’s body will have a harder time absorbing it, because the medications could react to each other causing ineffectiveness, or an adverse reaction that may kill the animal.

Check to see if the diarrhea is yellow or white. If this is the case, treatment is probably not needed.;
, Calves that are lethargic or not participating much in the playful activities with other calves are a red flag to pay attention to. Calves that are also losing condition are also cause for alarm.

, You can check for dehydration by pulling on the calf's neck skin. If the skin ""tents"" this is a sign of dehydration.

, A normal body temperature ranges from 100.5 °F (38.1 °C) to 102.5 °F (39.2 °C). Anything outside of this range is a sign for treatment.

, You'll want to do this to avoid spreading the disease further.

, You may need to inject the fluids via IV or orally. Follow the package directions when mixing up the solution.


Feeding the calf water will not work because it will simply pass through his system and not be completely absorbed.

,, This may include providing shelter, feed and a warm place to sleep.


A drawback from providing shelter is maintaining infectious control. You will have to work extra to get rid of soiled bedding and disinfect everything that a calf will touch, from the floor to the fence panels and even the feed bucket.

Contact the veterinarian so that they can perform this procedure for you.,
Restrain the animal per the directions from above.,
Allow the veterinarian to perform the procedure.,
Dispose the carcass properly according to state/provincial or municipal jurisdictions.",How to Humanely Euthanize a Cow2," Only a certified, practicing veterinarian can perform this method legally because they are the only ones who have access to the drugs to do so. You cannot get sodium pentobarbital  yourself anywhere without a license as a practicing veterinarian, because this drug is under federal jurisdiction for use and storage.
, If the animal is ambulatory and unable to stand quietly while a needle is stuck into them, you will need to place them in a head-gate or squeeze chute (preferably one that has sides that open up for access to drag the deceased animal out afterwards) so that the vet can perform the task as safely as possible., Basically, the vet will be performing this method by giving the animal 60 to 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital intravenously. This will be enough to produce rapid unconsciousness and anesthesia followed by respiratory depression, hypoxia (oxygen deprivation in body tissues), and cardiac arrest., Animals overdosed with barbiturates cannot be used for human nor animal consumption because of the toxic barbiturates present in the tissues which can harm wildlife or stray animals. Carcasses must be properly buried or incinerated as necessary."

Restrain the animal as best as possible.,
Let the animal settle down.,
Place the muzzle of the cap-bolt gun at the meeting point (or just slightly above) between the invisible X formed on the forehead.,
Squeeze the trigger.,
Follow immediately with the secondary euthanasia method of choice.,
Dispose of the carcass properly.",How to Humanely Euthanize a Cow3," Make sure everything is functioning as it should, the gun has been cleaned well, and all pieces are together as they should be., These include, as mentioned above, exsanguination, pithing, or a rapid IV injection of potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate. The latter is done by a veterinarian, and the other two require a very sharp knife, or a steel rod that fits into the hole made by the cap-bolt gun, respectively., Excellent restraint will be needed to perform this procedure, using a head-gate and squeeze chute, or a medina gate with a head-gate attached. The restraint is so that the stunned animal does not harm you or the person handling the cap-bolt gun, or itself beyond collapsing with the stun.

Restraining by halter and lead is not enough, as this can pose significant risk to both you and the animal. If you are using a cap-bolt to euthanize, then avoid using a halter at all times.
The squeeze or medina gate must be able to open to the outside to easily access the animal with a tractor or skid-steer. It is extremely difficult to extract a euthanized animal through the head-gate due to both weight and body shape.

, An animal that enters the squeeze may be a bit afraid and panicked, so its best to wait until the animal has calmed down before proceeding with this method of euthanasia., The muzzle should be flush with the animal's forehead, and perpendicular with the angle of the animal's face itself.

It may help you to draw that X on the animal's forehead with a Paintstik® or Producers Pride® livestock marker crayon to ensure you are targeting the right spot.

, The firing mechanism in the cap-bolt will engage, sending the rod into the brain tissue of the animal through the skull. You will feel a sudden jolt, like firing a revolver, which means the gun has done its job. The rod will not stay in the brain tissue but come back into the gun via spring-action, and it's that rod that stuns the animal into unconsciousness.

This step and the one before must be done in quick succession and without hesitation. If you keep the muzzle of the gun to the animal's head for just a little too long, the animal may swing its head up suddenly and cause you to miss the shot should you fire at the same time.

Thus, if you're certain you're on the right spot, then immediately take the shot.



, This step is very important and must be performed within a few seconds--not minutes--to ensure death of the animal while it is still unconscious. The following secondary euthanasia methods and how to perform them are:


Exsanguination: Using a very sharp knife, like a 6-inch hunting knife or boning knife, insert the blade fully behind the point of the jaw and draw downwards until blood is freely flowing. The carotid artery and jugular vein must be severed for this to work effectively.

Another method of exsanguination or blood-letting is severing the brachial vasculature. Lift one of the forelimbs (one most easily accessible, as the animal will be laying on its side), and insert the knife deeply at the point of the elbow and cut the skin and vasculature until the limb can be laid back against the chest of the animal.
Chest-sticking is done to severe the vessels that extend from the top of the heart, like the vena cava and aorta. It is probably the most effective method of exsanguination because all blood flow to the head is stopped once these vessels are cut. A long blade (~6 to 8 inches, as mentioned) needs to be used; Insert fully into the chest in the mid-line where the brisket joins the ventral neck. Use a sideways slicing action in one direction and then the other to ensures that the vessels are severed.A third method is transecting the terminal aorta via the rectum so that blood pools in the abdominal cavity. This should only be done by a trained individual, like a veterinarian.



Pithing: Insert a pithing rod or similar tool into and through the entry site, and manipulate the rod deep into the head of the animal to destroy both brain stem and spinal cord tissue attached to the brain to ensure death of the animal.

Lethal IV Injection: A rapid injection of a saturated solution of either potassium chloride (KCl) or magnesium sulfate into the blood vessel will induce cardiac arrest. For most mature cows, an injection of 250 mL of KCl is appropriate, but the exact dosage for any animal may vary due to size of the animal. Solution must be given until death is confirmed.

Magnesium sulfate is delivered similar to KCl, but is approved for use only in anaesthetized animals, and results in much slower death.

Cattle must be unconscious or anaesthetized before this particular method can be used. It's also recommended to have a veterinarian perform this secondary euthanasia procedure.





, Depending on the secondary euthanasia method of choice and the state of the carcass, disposal is more flexible than when using barbiturates. If an animal does not have any drug residues in its system (from either euthanasia or prior attempted treatments), there is a possibility it can be butchered for meat. Check with your vet to be sure."

Choose a needle based on the animal's weight.,
Choose needle length based on the type of injections that need to be administered.,
Use a new, sterile needle.",How to Give Cattle Injections2," Needle size is measured in ‘gauges’. The gauge of a needle is inversely proportional to its diameter, such that the lower the gauge, the bigger the needle. For instance, a calf's skin is thinner than that of an adult cow, so a finer and higher gauge needle can be used instead. You should also try to use the finest gauge possible to make sure that the cow feels as little pain as possible, but not so fine that risk of breaking the needle is significant.


To give an injection to a calf weighing less than 500 pounds, an 18-20 gauge (g) needle with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) length is ideal.
For larger animals weighing over 500 pounds, you will need a 16-18 g needle with of 1 ½ inch length.
Breed can also play a part on determining needle gauge. Black Angus cattle tend to have thinner hides than Herefords, for instance, so you won't need a 16 g needle to pierce the thinner hide of an Angus cow, versus the more thicker one of a Hereford.

, Usually shorter needles are needed for subcutaneous injections, and longer needles are needed for intramuscular and intravenous injections. You won't need a needle longer than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm), for SQ injections because you only need to penetrate the skin.
For IM and IV injections, needles that are around 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) or more are best.

, A new, sterile needle is recommended to be used per animal. However, it is acceptable to use the same needle for up to ten injections, provided it remains sharp and straight. Always change to a new needle when a fresh draw is made from a different bottle of medication because using the old needle may introduce contamination.


Never attempt to straighten a bent or burred needle because it is much more likely to break on you or break off in the process of injection. Burred needles are also to never be straightened, but simply tossed into a bio-hazard bin.

"
"
Take a syringe and cap it with a needle.,
Remove the needle cap.,
Take a new bottle and remove the aluminum cap.,
Poke the needle through the rubber cap.,
Draw the medication into the syringe.,
Lower the bottle and slowly remove the needle.,
Place the bottle upright in a safe place for future use.,
Point the needle upwards to allow any air bubbles present to float to the top.",How to Give Cattle Injections3," The needle will have a cap on it when you push it onto the end of the syringe, or should if it's a fresh, clean needle. Push the needle down on the syringe so the needle stays on and won't come off.

, Take the cap off the needle and have it ready to draw fluid into the syringe. You won't be able to get medication into the syringe if you have the cap still placed over the needle.

, The aluminum cap protects the rubber cap that is placed over the opening of the bottle and keeps the liquid from leaking out if the bottle is tipped on its side or upside down. Use your finger nails to remove the cap, never a knife or sharp object, because you will compromise the rubber cap and invite contamination.

, Before you do so, however, you should draw the same amount of air into the syringe as you want to draw from the bottle. This is so that it makes it easier for you to draw in the contents, because trying to draw in liquid when you have a vacuum formed by both the syringe and the bottle can make things very difficult. Then you can poke the needle into the rubber cap.


The rubber cap will act as a vacuum or not invite air into the bottle, and when the needle is pushed through, this vacuum will not be disrupted.

, After you have pushed the amount of air you have in your syringe into the bottle with the plunger, raise the bottle up so that it is almost vertically above the syringe, and slowly pull back on the plunger, drawing the fluid into the syringe up to the desired amount. It's important to raise the bottle above the syringe so that you allow gravity to help draw the fluid in, and so that you're not drawing in air instead.

, Lowering the bottle moves the liquid to the bottom (via gravity) and introduces the ""air"" component of the bottle. Removing the needle then ensures that liquid won't drip out.

, Store the bottle in a place where it's cool and dry and won't get damaged, like in a cooler or toolbox meant for storing your cattle medicating equipment.

, Flick your finger against the barrel for any bubbles that won't automatically float up. Slowly and carefully push the plunger to eject the air bubbles present. This especially important if you are going to administer IM or IV injections.

"
Use the ""tenting"" technique.,
Angle the needle so that it is at a 30 to 45 degree angle from the surface of the neck.,
Guide the needle in the injection site.,
Administer the shot.,
Reduce any bleeding that may occur.",How to Give Cattle Injections4," To give an SQ injection, a technique known as ‘tenting’ is used. If you are right handed, hold the syringe in your right hand (and vice versa if you are left-handed). Identify the injection triangle (as described in Method 1) and choose a spot in the center of this imaginary triangle. Using your left hand, pinch some of the animal's skin between your two forefingers and thumb and lift this piece of skin straight out and away from the neck to form a ""tent"". The tent should be made perpendicular to the neck. , The tip of the needle can be placed under your thumb, though location of where to place the tip of the needle depends on what you are most comfortable with and where you are least likely to poke yourself. Take care not to touch the plunger (if using a syringe) or trigger (if using a dosing device). , Using your forefinger of the hand holding the syringe, guide the needle into the center of one side the tent you formed with your other hand in the first preceding step. This ensures you only insert the needle halfway, instead of all the way, into the skin fold, and reduces the chance of hitting muscle or a blood vessel.

, Once the needle is in at the required length, release the skin and depress the plunger or squeeze the handle of the syringe with your syringe hand. Apply slow, steady pressure to the plunger. Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle, cap it, and place the syringe on a dry, clean surface for future use (if you are planning on giving injections to more than one animal).

, Press and rub the injection site with your hand for a few seconds so that the spot does not bleed too much and to insure the injected fluid does not leak out too much. An SQ injection should not bleed nearly as much as an IM or IV injection, if at all, but there is greater risk of injected fluid leaking out, sometimes profusely if the skin is really tight or too much fluid is injected into one site.

Help the bovine to reduce the painful feeling of the needle plunging in.,
Select a location to administer the IM injection.,
Put the needle into the cow’s neck.,
Administer the medicine.",How to Give Cattle Injections5," Because intramuscular injections are more painful than a SQ injection, efforts must be made to reduce the pain that a cow will feel when the needle is put in. To lessen the pain then, most veterinarians firmly thump the heel of their hand against the cow’s neck two or three times prior to introducing the needle. It's highly recommended you follow this procedure.Thumping the cow’s neck with your hand desensitizes the nerves so when the needle is put in, she is less likely to feel the needle going in and become startled.

, Hold the syringe in your dominant hand (right, if right-handed). Identify the injection triangle and selecting an area near the center, be ready to put needle in at a perpendicular angle to the surface of the skin. , Keeping the needle perpendicular to the skin surface and a using firm, thrusting movement, push the needle through the skin into the muscle. This must be done immediately after the neck has been thumped a few times. At this point the cow may flinch so be ready for her to move around a little in the chute (a bit more if she's not used to human contact).


Check to see if you have hit a vein or artery. To do this, withdraw the plunger of the syringe a small amount and look for blood back-flow. If you find blood going into the syringe, you’ve hit a blood vessel. You will have to withdraw and try a different site.

, Once you have checked that you have not hit a blood vessel, you can administer the medication. Slowly depress the plunger until the cow has received the correct dose. If you are giving more than 10 mL IM, be sure to give no more than 10 mL per injection site.


After you have removed the syringe, press the spot with your fingers for a few moments to keep the spot from bleeding.

Select the right gun with the right bullets for the job.,
Prepare the gun.,
Assess the animal to be euthanized, and the best target location.,
Aim at the targeted location and make the shot.,
Approach the downed animal with caution and assess it.,
Dispose of the carcass appropriately.",How to Humanely Euthanize a Cow4," Current AVMA recommendations suggest that a .22 caliber handgun or right loaded with a solid-point bullet is sufficient for calves, but is not be recommended for use for more mature, larger stock. You are best to go with a handgun or rifle that have muzzle energies above 300 ft/lb. It's important to use solid-point bullets as well with these higher-caliber guns.

Bulls will need heavier-powered firearms to be euthanized. The best are those that are capable of 1000 ft per lb of muzzle velocity to be able to penetrate the very thick skull of a bull.

Some countries, like in Canada, dictate that the .22 rifle is not humane for euthanizing any cattle, but rather firearms with muzzle energy of at least 300 ft/lb are ideal for calves under 400 pounds, and firearms with energies at 1000 ft/lb or more are recommended for mature livestock from cows to bulls.


Shotguns are an excellent alternative to handguns or rifles, but they carry a little greater margin of risk, especially if used at greater distances than the recommended 1 to 2 yards (1 to 2 meters) from the intended target. Use of the 12, 16, and 20-gauge shotguns are ideal for mature cows, bulls, elk, and horses loaded with slugs or No. 2-, 4-, or 6-size birdshot.

The .410 or .28 gauge shotguns should not be used on larger animals because of the lower muzzle velocity.



, Make sure it's loaded with the proper type of bullets (like solid points, never hollow nor soft-points) or slugs if using a shotgun. You may need more than one bullet or slug to do the job, just in case., Restraint is not needed when euthanizing via gunshot, and an animal can be on its feet and mobile, or are down or debilitated to be effectively killed. The latter two are less difficult with placement of the bullet. However, when the animal is on its feet, on the move and posing to be a dangerous threat, the recommended standard of shooting at the forehead may be much more of a challenge.

A downed or compromised animal is easier to shoot at the head. This is because the angle of the shot is very important for the bullet to not only penetrate the brain, but also into the brainstem. It is very difficult to aim perpendicular to the head when the animal is standing up or moving away, unless you are very very tall or the animals are very short and small.

You can also shoot them at a closer distance, at the recommended 1 to 3 feet from the intended target.


Animals on their feet generally won't allow you to get at arm's-length from them, and you wouldn't want to especially with dangerous stock. These animals will need to be shot from a distance, aiming for the lower chest just above the elbow (or behind if the animal is moving away at an angle you can still see the target zone), the head, or neck.

Shooting a cow or bull like this would be no different from hunting and shooting big game, because they all have the same anatomical features where bullet placement is ideal for a one-shot kill.



, Be prepared to make a second shot immediately after the first if the first shot is not successful. Aim for the right location to make the second shot count this time.

As mentioned, the closest you should be to a downer or debilitated animal is one to three feet away.

, Be careful with animals that were on their feet and mobile as they may be down and thrashing around violently, which is to be expected with euthanizing via gunshot. Using the steps above, assess the animal for signs of unconsciousness then death, which will come very soon after the shot has been made.

There is no need to follow with a secondary euthanasia technique following a gunshot, unless the animal is going to be slaughtered for meat. Then exsanguination will need to be used to save the meats being used for consumption.

, As with the cap-bolt method, disposal of cattle euthanized with gunshot is more flexible. They can be rendered, buried, burned, or used for consumption.

Euthanizing a sick animal with drugs still in its system may have some restrictions, especially with concerns of drug residue. This type of animal should neither be consumed nor rendered for the sake of food safety laws and regulations.

Locate the jugular vein.,
Check to make sure that there are no bubbles in your syringe.,
Insert the syringe at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the surface of the neck.,
Administer the medicine.",How to Give Cattle Injections6," You can do this by running your fingers down the side of the cow's neck (it will be below where the invisible injection triangle would be) above the dewlap. You will feel the jugular vein throbbing. Once you have located it, press down on the lower part of the vein to make it bulge out. This will help you better locate the vein when giving the shot., Air bubbles, if injected into the jugular vein, can cause a serious health risk, if not death. If air is present in the syringe where the medication has been injected into it, hold the syringe upright and tap it using your fingers, until the air bubbles go up. Disperse the bubbles further by slightly depressing the plunger until all the air bubbles have noticeably gone out. A little medication will come out out the needle as you do so.

, Slowly, but firmly, insert the syringe into the bulging jugular vein. You will know if you have correctly hit the jugular vein because just a slight pulling of the plunger will draw blood into the syringe and mix with its contents. This is a good sign, unlike for SQ and IM injections.

, Very slowly press down on the plunger so that the fluid gradually gets expelled into the cow’s vein. Once you have given the required amount of medicine, gently removed the needle. Hold your hand over the spot and press against it for a few moments to reduce the bleeding that will occur when you give this type of shot.

Place the cow in a restraining or squeeze chute with a head gate.,
Load the pill or pills into the bolus gun.,
Open the cow’s mouth.,
Insert the balling gun.,
Release the bolus into the cow.,
Keep her head elevated until she swallows the pills.,
If you have other oral medications to give that are not in bolus form, the same steps described above apply in administration.

",How to Give Cattle Oral Medications," The cow's head must be restrained in order for the cow to be given a bolus, because any other method will be too stressful and dangerous for both the cow and the people helping with the restraining process. A head-gate is a piece of equipment (always made of heavy-duty iron for greatest strength and durability against even the feistiest one-ton beast) that allows the head to be accessed by the handler, and locks in place so that the animal cannot force its way forward nor backwards. Once the bovine is locked in place with its head easily accessible, then the bolusing process can begin;
, You can do this by simply inserting the pill into the tip of the balling gun. Hold the ""business end"" of the gun up so that the pills don't fall out onto the ground.


When giving many different types of medication through one single application, always load any gel-based pill last because soft-coated capsules may melt under the heat of the cow's mouth and stick to the insides of the balling gun.

, Position yourself so that your body is acting as an object to hold the cow's head in place and reduces her action of trying to avoid getting the medication, and for easier grip on the animal's mouth. Place your butt up to the chute with the cow's head against your side, and use your legs as leverage and as a means to brace yourself. With your arm closest to the cow's head, wrap your arm over the top of the cow's muzzle so that you can get her opposite lip, not the side of the lip that's closest to you, so you can safely get to her mouth and elevate her head. Push your hand under her lip and use the same hand to stroke the roof or palate of her mouth. This will encourage her to open up wide enough to get the balling gun in. Be sure you are keeping her head elevated.

, With your free hand, the gun will need to be inserted down the middle of her mouth right to the very back, but not so forcefully that she will choke on it. It's best to initiate the swallowing reflex once the tip of the gun is at the very back to the entrance of the esophagus (into the pharyngeal area) and slowly let the end of the gun work its way down--you helping it along--until the handle of the gun reaches the lips of the cow's mouth. She will chew on the balling gun as she swallows it--this is completely normal--and at this point you can press the plunger to deposit the bolus.

, Keeping the gun in position from the above step, press down on the plunger or handle to deposit the bolus into the very back of the cow's mouth. This projects the pill further down the back of the mouth into the esophagus.

, You can also encourage this by stroking the throat, optional this may be. The sign she gives that she has swallowed the bolus is licking her lips and nose, likely followed by a cough. By then you can let her head go if you have no more oral medications to give.

Make sure the mom cow will allow you to get close to her calf.,
Check to see if the calf is healthy and is breathing.,
Lift the tail to sex the calf.",How to Tell the Sex of a Newborn Calf1," Sometimes cows will be very protective after birth, even if you’ve been assisting them. Before you get ready to inspect the cow, make sure both the cow and calf are relatively calm and understand you are still there to help.


If you sense the cow is going to attack you, back off.
If the cow is positioning herself to separate you from her calf, let her.
If the cow kicks at you at all, come back later.;
, Before sexing the calf, you want to check its vitals and make sure it can breathe. Check to see if the calf can breathe through its nose and mouth. Make sure there are no other complications that need to be tended to before checking the sex.


Clean the afterbirth from nose of the calf.
Clean the afterbirth from the mouth of the calf. Make sure there are no obstructions.
Check to see if the calf's respiration is not labored and the pulse is regular at 100-140 beats per minute., If the cow allows you to get close to her calf, you can quickly sex the calf. Lift the calf's tail and check the genitalia.


Males have a scrotum containing testicles and a sheath containing a penis, located near the belly. It is possible to confuse the umbilical cord for a penis, so you should focus on locating the testicles.
Females have a vulva, located closer to the tail. The best way to tell if the calf is a female is to note the absence of testicles.

Observe the behaviour of cows and heifers.,
Pay attention to physical changes of cows and heifers.,
Fetal responsiveness to physical or observational pregnancy testing.,
Perform an accurate scientific pregnancy diagnosis to confirm observations.",How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer Is Pregnant1," The behaviour of cows and heifers after they have conceived is one of the best non-invasive means of determining pregnancy in cattle. Simply put, pregnant cattle will not (or should not) come into estrus or ""heat"" for the entire duration of the 9.34-month (285 day) gestation period.


The estrous cycle in cattle occurs, on average, every 21 days. If a cow or heifer has aborted or absorbed the embryo, she will soon come into estrus and continue regular cycling until she conceives again. Embryo absorption, early embryonic death, or fetal abortion can happen at any time during a cow's pregnancy and can be caused by anything, from extreme stress to a disease a cow acquired before or during her gestation. How to Tell when a Cow or Heifer Is in Estrus fully explains the estrus activity shown by such cows. Thus if a cow unexpectedly starts to behave like she's in estrus during her pregnancy, particularly if she is several months along, chances are she aborted the fetus and is beginning to get back into regular cycling. Absorption of the embryo occurs within the first two to three weeks after breeding.

False heats may be experienced by females during the first few weeks post-conception, and though they are rare, they can be easily misdiagnosed by the producer as an actual heat period. Such suspicions can only be confirmed or rejected if follow-up with a proper test (see below) is completed at least a month and a half after breeding.


Observing behaviour also applies to cows' and heifers' male counterparts. Bulls will not show any interest to any cows that maintain pregnancy. They only show interest if a cow comes into heat and when she's ready to calve. This is because, during both periods, estrogen levels increase every time a cow is one to three days away from coming into heat, and when it's time for the calf to be born. (At birth, the fetus sends stress signals to the dam's nervous system which starts a cascade of hormonal events, such which largely includes progesterone levels decreasing and estrogen increasing.) A bull can sense this through performing what's known as the ""flehmen response"" where he ""tests,"" via drinking, the urine of a female to check for pheromone activity. The bull tilts his head up high and back as far as he can to allow the fluid to drain into a sensory organ in his nasal passage called the Jacobson organ. Curling his upper lip up allows the urine to flow into this organ as deep as possible to better test for pheromone activity. High levels of progesterone in the cow's system, which would be present in the urine, will tell a bull that she is not available for his services. Besides getting a little bit of a head-butt to the ribs from the cow herself in displaying her disappointment in his flirtatious advances, it also tells him that it's probably best to find another female that would potentially be in more need of his amorous intentions.;
, Changes to size and shape of body parts can be noticed in both cows and heifers, primarily with the abdomen (or ""barrel""), and the udder.


Unlike humans, cows do not typically show their ""baby bump"" until they're about half-way through gestation. Only after then do you begin to see how the cow or heifer is getting larger in the abdominal region. By mid- to late-third trimester when a cow or heifer is considered ""heavily pregnant,"" she synonymously looks quite like a large, round barrel with a head, a tail, and four legs.
In heifers, the udder begins to fill out more and reach maturity. Heifers that are ""virgin"" or not yet conceived will have an under-developed udder that is only resembled by the presence of four small teats tucked up under their belly between their hind legs. As they progress into their gestation period, the udder gradually becomes more prominent until she gives birth. A heifer will not have as defined an udder as a mature cow will (nor even a mature dairy cow), but it will be as big an udder as a heifer will need to feed her newborn calf.

Mature cows already have a fully developed udder so there will be no change in the physical structure of the mammary organ as in the bred heifers. Cows also will not begin to fill up with milk until they are showing signs that calving is imminent. However, a cow that is pregnant and still has a calf to suckle will continue to produce milk until that calf is weaned. With dairy cows, when they successfully conceive and become pregnant they will continue to lactate until they are ""dried off"" or, essentially, forced to stop producing milk by not taking any more milk from them for the next two months until they calve.


The belief that a cow must become pregnant in order to produce milk is purely myth . Cows only become pregnant to produce a calf, and only produce milk with the intent to feed that calf. That a cow becomes pregnant and is producing milk is purely coincidental due to the overlap of the length of lactation period (6 to 8 months for beef cattle, 10 months for dairy) and the gestation period (approximately 9.5 months in all female bovines).





, The below pregnancy tests, if they can be called that, are inaccurate as best and should only performed on females that are in late pregnancy, i.e., from months 5 to 9. They should not be counted as reliable tests for determining pregnancy especially with inability to perform such tests at early gestation, and because results confirming pregnancy are less of a guarantee than other more reliable methods mentioned in the next section. However, they can be done purely out of curiosity and interest in seeing the physical responses of the fetus when one or more of such tests are performed.



Abdominal ballottement (bumping). This can only be used in females that are five to seven months into their pregnancy. To feel for the fetus, use the following technique:

1. Place your hand or fist against the lower right flank region of the abdomen, then
2. Make a short, vigorous inward-upward thrust and keep your hand in place. You will feel the hard fetus come back against your hand. The amniotic fluid will allow the fetus to recede against your bump but fall back in place almost immediately.
The size of the fetus determines the effectiveness of this technique, which means that it can only be done when the cow is over halfway through her gestation period and not one and a half to three months (45 to 90 days) post-breeding. Because of that it's not an effective technique for early-detection pregnancy nor for large herds that need to be ""preg-checked"" in a short matter of time. It's best for small herds and for producers that would want to feel for a fetal calf that is only a few months away from birthing for curiosity's sake.



Formation of uterine seal or mucosal plug in the cervix. Typically a pregnant cow will form a seal in the cervix to protect the fetus from foreign bodies (bacteria and soil, mostly) entering the uterus. The plug can only be seen with a speculum and light that is inserted in the vaginal canal. The mucosal plug can also be felt via rectal palpation. This method is not always reliable because the plug is not always readily observed because it may form deeper in the cervix than throughout the entire organ.

Fetal heart beat. This is best performed after the sixth month of gestation, though detection can be unreliable as it is not as certain as with other classes or species of farm animals as in cows. Use of a stethoscope is recommended even though pressing an ear against the right lower abdominal region and listening will also yield good results. The fetal heart beat can be distinguished from the dam with its greater frequency and higher and lighter pitch. This method is not recommended if the cow is not cooperative nor accustomed to human touch. Do this only on cows or heifers that are accustomed to your touch and you trust each other enough to be able to do this without a stethoscope and without getting kicked. Like with bumping cows, this can only be done on those cows in the last two-thirds of their pregnancy, and is not ideal if early detection of pregnancy takes higher precedence than mere curiosity and a willingness to wait for a long period of time before being able to determine pregnancy of a cow or heifer.

Fetal movement. Patience is much needed to observe voluntary fetal movements on the right side of the cow through the abdominal wall because you just need to wait see such movements. This can only be done when the cow or heifer is in the latter half of pregnancy, and is certainly not ideal for either early detection or if you wish to have results without waiting for either the right time to detect nor to see any results.

, Four primary pregnancy tests are available for producers to choose from in order of cost to use: Rectal palpation, PAG ELISA with blood and milk samples, and ultrasound. Such pregnancy tests can be utilized based on the type of cattle (dairy or beef, and even purebred versus commercial), and level of record keeping done. Some tests are better to use than others based on expense and ease of use, and how well breeding records are kept. For example, PAG ELISA via either milk or blood testing is not recommended if inadequate and imprecise records are habitually kept for either beef or dairy operations. The second section below describes the methods to use, what is involved with carrying out such methods and whether it may be right for your herd or not."

Watch where the calf urinates from.,
Observe the size and shape of the calf’s head and its topline.,
Check the muscle tone and overall shape of the calf’s neck and shoulders.,
Examine the calf’s pelvis, and compare it to other calves.",How to Tell the Sex of a Newborn Calf2," If the mother cow will not allow you to get close enough to check the calf, you can try to watch and see where on the body the calf appears to urinate. This might take a lot of time, but it will give you a very good indication of the sex of the calf. It is also possibly the safest way to sex the calf, as it provides distance between you, the calf, and the cow.


Make sure to bring binoculars and do this during the day.
Heifers urinate out from from the vulva, located just under the tail.
Bulls urinate from the penis, which is situated further forward than the vulva on a heifer, underneath the belly.

, The topline is the top line of the cow from the head to its butt. These observations will give you a better idea of the cow’s sex.


Compare the calf to other calves you might have or to pictures.
Bull calves will have a heavier jawline.
Bull calves will have a burly and more masculine topline.
Cow calves will have a smaller jawline.
Cow calves will have a softer topline., The muscle tone and the calf’s shoulders will also give you a better idea of the calf’s sex. This provides a non-invasive way of sexing the calf.


Compare the calf to other calves you might have or to pictures.
Female calves often have longer, narrower necks.
Female calves will have smoother shoulders and a more angular shape to their body.
Bull calves will have thicker necks.
Bull calves will have more robust shoulders., The pelvis shape will give you a much better idea of the sex of the calf. Heifer calves will have a more robust pelvis than bull calves. This, combined with previous steps, will provide certainty on the calf’s sex."
"
Catch and restrain the cow or heifer.,
Choose your method of pregnancy detection.,
Record the results.,
Release the cow/heifer.,
Repeat with other cows and heifers as necessary.",How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer Is Pregnant2," Pregnancy testing often cannot be done while an animal is loose for several reasons, including the cow or heifer is not accustomed to being in close proximity to humans, and safety to both the human handler and the animal in question. A squeeze chute is ideal, though a 6' by 3' box with a head-gate is also preferable. A ""medina"" gate or a gate that confines a cow so that she has no choice but to back out to escape is also good for a small number of animals that need checking.

, There are several methods available to check pregnancy, each with their strengths and weaknesses.



Rectal palpation. More commonly referred to as ""preg-checking."" Please see the article How to Perform Rectal Palpation in Cows and Heifers for more comprehensive information.

This is the most popular and common method used by large animal veterinarians, artificial insemination technicians and cattlemen for both beef and dairy herds, primarily because of its timeliness--it guarantees early diagnosis at 45 to 90 days post-breeding, and it allows results to be determined within seconds compared with other methods mentioned here. An experienced technician or large-animal veterinarian can perform this method and determine pregnancy with 98 percent accuracy in about 5 to 10 seconds, however technicians with less experience typically take longer to make a diagnosis, and accuracy may be lower. It's also the cheapest form of pregnancy checking compared with the other main methods like milk pregnancy testing, blood testing, and ultrasound.

Hazard of abortion is quite minimal especially when performed by experienced operators, however it is a risk with this form of pregnancy checking. Other risks associated are spread of disease from cow to cow particularly if shoulder-length gloves are not changed after preg-checking each female. If there are many females to check (well over 100 cattle, for example), that means a lot of dirty gloves to throw away. Thus, as far as risk of disease transfer is concerned, it's a risk to consider if you don't want to have to switch to a new glove after checking every cow.


The operator applies this method to recognize any changes in uterine arteries and the tone, size, and location of the uterine horns through the rectal wall. Often only one of the uterine horns (out of only two) will be either more swollen or lowered deeper into the body cavity of the female, and the uterine arteries may be more distended with extra blood pumping to the newly formed placenta connecting the fetus to the dam.



Blood test. Blood tests are used to test for pregnancy-specific proteins found in the serum of blood. Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) are placenta-expressed inactive aspartic proteinases often referred to as pregnancy-recognition markers. Unlike the hormone progesterone which is commonly known to be associated with pregnancy, PAGs are present only during pregnancy (and around 60 to 90 days after calving), thus are the best means to determine pregnancy status in cows. An ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) or RIA (radioimmunoassay) test singles out these proteinases and shows their concentration levels in both milk (see below) and blood samples. ELISA testing is more popular to use because results can be obtained faster than RIA, generally. You will not get the time frame of how far along in gestation a cow or heifer is, but you will get a yes-or-no answer on whether the female is pregnant or not, or if the female needs to be rechecked (another sample of blood is drawn from the animal in question and sent back to the lab).

Ideal for both beef and dairy herds. Blood testing is gaining popularity over palpation per rectum because of less stress and trauma on cattle, significantly reduced disease risk, and more accurate diagnosis. Blood samples are also relatively easy to get, provided a veterinarian can show you how to properly take them so that you do not need to call out a vet every time. The lab you are planning on sending your blood samples too will supply you with the tubes, the box those tubes are in and the bubble wrap they are contained in. The companies that offer these tests include BioPRYN - Biotracking LLC (Moscow, ID),PAG-IDEXX Labs (Westbrook, ME), and DG29 - Genex, CRI (Shawano, WI).
Timing is important. Cattle should not be blood tested until they are both 90 days after calving and around 30 to 50 days into gestation for optimum results.

Blood samples can be taken from either the neck or the tail. The neck offers the large jugular vein, and the tail the coccygeal vein, which is a main vessel that runs underneath the tail. Basically a sample is taken by inserting a needle straight into the vein and drawing back on the plunger until you get around 2 to 5 mL of blood. A vacuum-sealed tube with a rubber top is used to collect the blood from the syringe, simply by poking the needle into the rubber top and allowing the sample to vacate into the tube. The vacuum in the tube should be enough that you don't need to apply any pressure to the syringe to put the blood into the tube. When all samples are taken enough to fill the box supplied by the lab where you are to send them, wrap them in bubble wrap and mail your samples the very day you've taken the samples. If you cannot mail them immediately, like on a Friday or on the weekend, put them on ice or in the refrigerator until you can mail them Monday morning.
Samples must be properly labelled and accurate and precise records must also be kept in order to avoid any potential and inadvertent culling of cows that may actually be pregnant. Tag numbers (also other identification names or numbers) can be used, as long as all cows and heifers are re-tagged if they have missing tags. Remember to label the sample with which farm, which sample, and which cow it came from.



The ELISA test is generally performed as follows: PAGs are detected with anti-PAG antibody-coated plates, a detector substrate, a conjugate, and a dye with wash and incubation periods in between before results are analyzed. The dye allows the technician to judge the amount of PAG in the blood sample, since the deeper coloured the sample, the higher the concentration of PAG. Accuracy of such results are high, most samples have an accuracy of at least 90 to 99%. Sensitivity can much higher, from 97 to 100%.

Results from blood tests generally won't be sent back to the producer immediately. At the earliest, results can be expected two to three business days after the samples are sent in.





Milk Pregnancy Test. As with the blood test above, milk pregnancy test uses a PAG ELISA (Pregnancy Associated Glycoproteins Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test to affirm pregnancy in cows and heifers.

Recommended for herds with accurate breeding and artificial insemination (AI) records. I's a test primarily for dairy herds, however research has found equally accurate results can be had with beef breeding herds as well. Samples must be sent to a laboratory that will do this test for you. Cost per sample depends on where you are sending samples to, and through whom (i.e., for dairy producers in the US, through DHIA , or for Western Canadian dairy producers, Can-West DHI ). You can expect to pay anywhere from $3.00 to $4.50 per sample. The predominant company that can commercially perform this test for you is IDEXX Laboratories (via The IDEXX Laboratory Milk Pregnancy Test). The test itself and how it's done is exactly how PAGs in blood are tested, as described above.

Results can be obtained within 3.5 hours from the start of testing, and sent to the producer just as soon via email. In the mail, though, you should expect to get lab results back in two to three business days. Testing can be done from 28 days post-breeding until cows are dried off, even though sensitivity and specificity averages increase when cows are around 60 days into gestation. For best optimum results and to reduce chances of false positives (or even false negatives), samples should be obtained when cows are at least 90 days post-calving.





Transrectal Ultrasonography. Also known as ultrasound, this method not only determines status of pregnancy, but fetal age as well. The method utilizes a computerized unit that allows the operator to literally see what's inside the cow. There are two major parts to this ultrasound unit--the console which is the screen, and the transducer, or the probe that is inserted in the rectum of the cow. The electrically-powered console is connected to the probe via a cord so that the row of crystals in the probe can emit ultrasonic sound waves (the electricity actually causes them to change shape slightly allowing such sound waves to occur), which focuses on the tissues focused beneath the probe. The sound waves bouncing off the tissues back to the probe provides a visual image that can be seen on the console screen. The density of the tissues varies with bone, muscle, tendons, and fluids inside the body. The more dense the tissue, the more quickly sound waves return to the probe and the brighter they appear on the screen. Bone shows up bright white, whereas fluids like urine, follicles, amniotic fluid, blood vessels, etc., show up black. Because of the differences in tissue densities, the probe allows the operator to visually identify different structures, muscles and parts of the fetus.

The optimal age to perform ultrasound is 26 days post-breeding in heifers and 28-days post-breeding in cows, however skilled operators can identify pregnancies with this method once the fetal heartbeat starts, which is around 21 to 22 days post-breeding.

Ultrasound can detect fetal heartbeat and movement, which is a way to determine if the fetus is alive. Live fetuses indicate the cow or heifer is pregnant and is very likely to stay pregnant throughout the term. Dead fetuses mean that the cow or heifer will need to be rebred soon, and a hormonal shot like Estrumate® or Lutalyse® may need to be given to get the female to abort so that she can be rebred soon. This is especially true with dairy herds.


Fetal age can be determined by measuring, or estimating using what is seen on the screen, specific body parts like length of body (from the top of the head to the rump), and diameter of either the skull or the chest. Not all operators have the same preferred method for determining fetal age, some like to use more than one.

Check with your veterinarian to see what age of fetus (and hence corresponding days post-breeding) they're comfortable with identifying. Note, though, that the measurements and age relationship are the most accurate in early pregnancy, and using that means that predictions of the anticipated calving date will also be more accurate.

However, the exact time a fetus will be ready for birthing is highly variable among individuals, with frame size, fatness and other factors affecting when and if it will happen.


With fetal age also comes the possibility of sexing fetuses. Fetal sexing techniques are highly precise, yet they depend on fetal age. Best times to sex a fetus is from day 60 to 65 to when it is too large or drops over the pelvic rim.

A single scheduled ultrasound date for an entire cow herd to determine fetal sex would be very difficult because of variability in age of the fetus, even if the breeding season of said cow herd was confined to 60 days. It possibly would be best to fetal sex the entire herd when cows are at least 90 to 120 days post-breeding.




Historically transrectal ultrasound involved the technician to gain access to feel the reproductive tract of cattle via the rectum, very similar to rectal palpation described above. Recently several types of rigid probes and probe extenders have been developed to avoid risk of injury to technicians that have had to repeatedly place their arms inside of cows that have the potential to be quite uncooperative while being preg-checked. The increased safety is prevalent with optional use of a probe attached to a rigid wand, but some of the sensitivity and mobility required to perform all diagnostic techniques accurately is also lost.
Ultrasound is expensive and requires hiring a technician or veterinarian to perform this type of pregnancy diagnosis.



, Records are important to keep so that you know not only which females don't need to be culled, but also how far along they are, especially if you have left preg-checking to less than 5 months post-conception, or need to confirm which females are bred (pregnant) and which are not.

, If all other things that needed to be done have been done--such as vaccinations, re-tagging, and deworming--the animal can be released back into the herd.

, Ensure what you do with one female you try to do with all of your herd, and in a short period of time. The shorter the time between animals you have the sooner you can make the necessary decisions that need to be made. In other words, if you have to blood-test or preg-check 100 or 200 cows, make sure you do it in one day, not over an entire month. The key thing to remember is to never be in a rush to get things done: Quality takes far more precedence over quantity!

Look for blisters in the mouth, on the feet, and on teats.,
Watch for excessive drooling.,
Watch for lameness issues.,
In lactating cows, look for blisters accumulating on the teats.,
Look out for other issues associated with the blisters.,
Note that the symptoms above can be confused with a different disease of similar symptoms.",How to Identify and Prevent Bovine Foot and Mouth Disease1," Vesicles, which are liquid-filled blisters, will accumulate on the lips, tongue, hard palate, dental pad, gums, muzzle, coronary band, in between hooves (interdigital cleft), and teats of lactating cows.
, Because these vesicles are accumulating in the mouth, the animal will be salivating excessively as the body's way to try to fight and get rid of these blisters., While ruptured vesicles in the mouth will heal quickly (roughly 10 to 12 days), ruptured vesicles on the feet can take longer to heal and may become reservoirs for secondary infection from bacteria, resulting in chronic lameness., These blisters or vesicles can rupture and, just like on the feet, cause major problems with secondary bacterial infection (mastitis) in and on the teats. This can cause a cow to refuse milking and/or suckling from a calf.

This causes a lot of pain for the cow upon milking or when a calf attempts to suckle. While the workers have to worry about getting kicked from these affected cows, the calf is more seriously affected because not only is it discouraged from suckling by its mother, but it also becomes afflicted with this disease, and suffers as a result from malnutrition and having vesicles in its mouth and feet.

, Infected animals will be running a temperature of 104ºF (40ºC; normal for a cow is 39ºC ), stamping their feet profusely, and preferring to lay down because their feet would be quite sore from standing. Secondary infections due to vesicles rupturing may result in lameness and secondary bacterial mastitis, as that already mentioned.

Young, suckling animals are also seriously affected. Calves that are suckling and less than 2 months of age are most likely to die from myocarditis (heart failure), than calves that are older or weaned.Calves that die of heart failure often do not show the classical clinical symptoms mentioned above prior to death.

, Vesicular stomatitis affects animals from an altogether different viral strain than what would cause FMD. How it spreads is different also: animals have to be in direct contact with an infected animal, or spread via blood-sucking insects in order to get infected. Vesicular stomatitis rarely affects sheep and goats, unlike FMD, but is known to be zoonotic."

Watch for estrus activity.,
Study the behaviour of the bull.,
Look for the crooked tail.,
Look for raised hair, mud or bare patches over the female's hindquarters.,
Look for discharge from the vulva.,
The mating couple.",How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer Has Been Bred," If a cow is not coming back into heat after approximately 21 days, nor is showing any signs heat activity any time between day 21 to day 45 post-breeding (or even an estimated breeding date if you weren't there to see it happen), then it's likely that she has been successfully settled.

A bred cow may display false heats on occasion, but should not be an indication that she has come back into regular cycling again, particularly if such false heats occur only once or twice after breeding then not again afterwards. However, it is possible that such activity may have not been false, because it's not uncommon for a cow to absorb the embryo or even abort it thus allowing her system to resume regular cycling until the next time she mates with a bull. False heats are notably rare, and so can be easily mistaken for real, genuine estrus activity.;
, If the bull is not paying any attention to a cow that has since gone out of estrus, and continues to not pay any attention to her when you suspect she should be coming into heat about 18 to 24 days later, then it's very likely that that cow has been bred.

It's typical for a bull to not pay attention to a cow in between heat periods. This is because she is not receptive to breeding due to her hormonal levels. You'll know that she's going to come into heat when the bull starts paying her more attention.

,  This is probably the one of the best ways to tell if a cow has been bred: A crooked tail, or a tail that is held out in an odd angle than normal, will be displayed by the cow or heifer for about 24 to 48 hours after being serviced by the bull. It is one of the best ways because you can determine almost the day that a cow has been serviced. If you're one or two days off, that is not a problem. It's far better than being a complete month off!,  Also an indication of mating and estrus activity, it is another useful way to see if a cow has been serviced or not. 

These characteristics should be used to note breeding activity, but only if there is a breeding bull with the females. The raised patches only indicate that a cow or heifer is in heat if a) there are only females in the herd, and/or b) there's a non-breeding bull (or a ""gomer"" bull) used on the cow herd for heat detection only for the purpose of artificial insemination.

,  A female that has recently been bred by the herd bull--often within an hour or so--will usually have whitish discharge come from her vulva. This would be seminal fluid from the bull, as often not all the semen that is ejaculated into the cow or heifer makes it through the cervix into the uterus; almost half of it is excreted back out again., The most obvious indicator that a cow has been bred if you just caught the sight of your bull riding and ejaculating into one of your cows. The whole event, as it can be called, only takes a matter of a few seconds, so if you're able to see it, then consider yourself lucky. Usually a bull will mate with a cow once, but it's not uncommon if it's done several times, especially if she has garnered the attention of more than one."

Identify the breed, strengths and weaknesses of your cowherd.,
Identify the type of bull you wish to have based on its breed.,
Decide what breed of bull you wish to buy.,
Start looking for advertisements of bull sales, bulls for sale, dispersal sales, etc.,
Before you go over to the farm or ranch that are holding these bulls that are for sale, you must come prepared.,
Typically the seller will give you a sheet with the bull's EPD's (Expected Progeny Differences) written on it.,
Now you are able to have a look at this bull.,
Set a price-ceiling based on what you believe is the best price for this bull according to breed, breeding, conformation and genetic qualities.,
Once you've found the bull with pretty well everything you want in him and bought him for the price you wanted and expected, now you can take him home and turn him out with the cows.

",How to Select a Herd Bull for Your Cows," You will need to start basing your selection of a good herd bull on whether you wish to do some crossbreeding or pure breeding. The weaknesses of your cowherd are the second issue you need to focus on, because you need to find a bull that will improve on these weaknesses.


Such weaknesses to improve on include:

Poor calving ease
Poor conformation (see How to Judge Conformation in Cattle for more)
Mature weights (you may wish to increase or decrease mature body weights in your herd)

Weaning/Yearling weights (may wish to increase or decrease weaning/yearling weights depending on whether you intend to sell the calves as feeders or keep some as replacements)
Fertility
Feed Efficiency
Ability to grow
Milking ability
Mothering ability


Note that some traits listed above are more heritable than others. Some, like fertility and feed efficiency, are much less heritable than weaning/yearling weights are.;
, There are three types of bulls that you must decide between:



Terminal - a bull that is used to increase weights and growth in calves, and is used only if you wish to sell all of your calves as feeders.

Maternal - a bull that is used for producing replacements. The qualities of this type of bull should be less on increasing weights and growth and more on improving the quality of your herd in terms of mothering ability, milking ability, calving ease, and calf vigour.

Rotational - a bull that is suitable both as one for maternal traits and for producing calves for the meat market. Also one that can be used for cross-breeding.

, It is best to buy a purebred bull instead of a cross-bred one because you have a higher chance of getting a more uniform calf herd than one that seems to be all over the map.

, to find the bull that you need. Such sales can be found in a local agricultural newspaper in the classifieds section or in a cattle magazine.


Once you have found a seller that seems to have the type of bull you are looking for, phone and ask the seller if you can come over to see the bull and check him out before you decide on your purchase. If yes, go have a look at him. If the seller says no (which is quite rare), then find another seller.

, Bring a camera, a pen/pencil and note pad, and a list of questions. The questions are best if you are buying via private-treaty, but not if you are going to a bull sale where you are competing with other buyers.


Questions should include everything from what his dam and sire are, how he's been fed and how he's been raised from birth to sale, vaccinations, if he's been tested for sexual diseases like Trichomoniasis (applicable only to older bulls that have been previously used for breeding), if he's had a semen test done, etc. Think of anything about this bull that you want to know before you decide on buying him.

,


It's best if you know how to interpret the EPD numbers before you have even considered buying a bull! If you already know how to interpret them, study them to see if the numbers are what you are looking for. In a bull sale, you will get a little booklet with all of the bulls that are for sale and their EPDs, as well as who the dam and sire are.

If the seller doesn't give you any information on who the dam and sire are, ask. You should also ask to see the dam and sire of that bull to see what type of dam and sire he came from.



, Study his conformation and take pictures of him to study later (best for private treaty, not auction sales). Also ask the seller your questions that you have written up.

, If the seller wants to sell higher, either barter with him to bring the price down or go find another bull-seller.

Analyze your herd and present and past feeding program.,
Watch your cows' behaviour for anything that may seem abnormal.,
Call your local large animal veterinarian if you suspect one of your cows have come down with BSE.,
Report your case (if the vet hasn't done it for you) your the federal food safety and health department.,
Expect to have your farm undergo inspections to see if your other cattle have the same disease or at risk for such a disease.",How to Diagnose Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or Mad Cow Disease in Cattle," If you have cows that are at least 8 to 10 years of age in your herd and feed or have fed them high-protein feeds that have contained animal by-product in them, especially that which contains ground-up ruminants in the form of blood or bone meal, then you are at risk for having cows coming down with BSE.


Dairy cows tend to be at a higher risk for getting this disease than beef cows because of the diet they are fed, which means feeding high-protein, high-energy and high-calcium-phosphorus-magnesium ratio, which is easily obtained by mixing blood and bone meal with the feed they're fed. A lot of dairy farms keep cows that are, unlike popular belief, older than 8 to 10 years of age.
Beef cows are just as likely to get this disease if the producer raises them in such a way that they are in need of grain to meet their reproductive demands according to when they are going to calve and their lactation period.;
, Cows that have the symptoms for BSE include:


Nervousness or aggressive behaviour
Abnormal posture (i.e., holding head in an awkward position)
Lack of coordination and inability to rise again when fallen down
Uncontrollable shaking of the body
No sign of habituation to a stimulus that is designed to startle her
Decrease in milk production
Decrease in weight despite continued appetite

, You will have to, if you have access to a gun (preferably a rifle), put the cow down yourself. Since there is no cure for this disease, euthanasia is the only option to put the animal out of her misery. The vet will arrive and take a brain tissue sample to a lab to have analyzed to see if the cow did have BSE.

,


For Canadian cattle producers, you need to call the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) hotline to report your case, at 1-800-442-2342.
For American cattle producers, you will need to report to your local Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) according to what state you live in if you have a suspected case of BSE in your cow-herd.

, You will have to present officials with records of everything from where you bought the animals from, where you sold your animals, and the health, breeding and calving records.Only expect this if the animal that you had to put down has been tested positive for BSE.

, Put on fingered latex shoulder-length gloves on the one arm (preferably your strongest arm) you will use to do rectal palpation with.

, Apply a handful of OB lubricant to your hand, and rub it so that it gets above your hand as well as the inside.

, Grab the tail with one hand (the one not gloved up), hold up above your head (see photo above) and with the gloved one, form a kind of closed-puppet mouth configuration with your hand (thumb tip connecting with all four tips of your fingers), and with the point of the top of your fingers forming a 45 to 60 degree angle, push into the rectum of the cow.


You will have to push hard because the cow will be straining against you to push you out. Keep your wrist rigid and in-line with the rest of your arm, and keep your elbow flexed slightly so you have enough strength to push into the cow's rectum.

, If the rectum is full of feces, then carefully scoop the loose fecal matter with your hand and retract your hand enough so that you can expel the feces for the cow. Expel enough of the feces that you have room enough to work, so you can reach and find the cervix.

, It will be below your hand, as will the rest of the female bovine's reproductive tract. You should be able to feel a hard cylindrical shape part of the way in. If you are up to your shoulder in the cow and still can't find the cervix, you're too far in. Move back until you can feel the cylindrical object below your fingers.

, If you have short arms, you may either need a stool to stand on, or have to go in right up to your shoulder to feel for anything in the fallopian tubes or uterus of the cow.

, If you feel anything that feels like the uterus is distended, with a small oval ball of liquid floating inside it or something that feels like a fetus, then you have found that the cow is bred. If you don't feel anything of the sort, just a uterus, then she may be open (not bred.)


It takes a lot of practice to know what you're feeling for. Often it's best to preg-check 2 to 5 months into the cow's gestation period, so that you know you are feeling for something larger than a golf-ball sized ovary. The sizes you should be feeling are according to how far along the cow is:

2 months - size of a mouse
3 months - size of a rat
4 months - size of a small cat
5 months - size of a large cat
6 months - size of a small dog
7 months - size of a Beagle

These size comparisons are useful if you have a dead premature calf that may have been aborted.




A vet or bovine practitioner who has had more experience and has preg-checked more cows will be more accurate than one who has done only a few cows. Thus saying, the more practice you get or the more chances you get to preg-check cows, the more accurate you'll become.

, Once you've determined if the cow or heifer is pregnant and how far along, pull your arm out of the cow, and release her back into the herd, and repeat with another cow or heifer.

Contact a veterinarian immediately.,
Biopsies will need to be obtained.,
Send tissue samples to a qualified laboratory that can accurately test for the FMD-causing virus.,
The lab performs several means of testing to isolate and identify virus type and serotypes that cause FMD.,
Wait for the results.",How to Identify and Prevent Bovine Foot and Mouth Disease2," If you suspect you have a case of FMD, contact a large animal veterinarian immediately to have them come out and see the animals affected.

All animals will need to be tested to see if they are carriers of FMD. All livestock animals are susceptible to the disease.

, The vet will take at least 1 g (0.035 oz) of vesicular ""membrane"" or skin raised from the formation of blisters with a scalpel, and/or the fluid inside the vesicles with a sterile needle.

The samples will be placed on a transport medium of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or equal parts glycerol and phosphate buffer with pH 7.2 to 7.6. Samples need to be kept refrigerated or transported on ice.
If there are no blisters or vesicles present, then samples of ""oropharyngeal fluid"" need to be taken. This means fluid (saliva or mucous membrane keeping the pharynx moist) from the back of the throat behind the tongue needs to be obtained with a sterile swab or a probing cup (a long wire with a cylindrical cup at the end).
Blood samples can also need to be taken so that the serum is analyzed for any presence of a virus.

, The vet will take various biopsies or tissue samples to send away to a specialized laboratory that meets OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) standards for FMD testing under Contaminant Group 4 pathogens.

If your country does not have access to a national or regional laboratory that meets these guidelines, samples will need to be sent to an OIE FMD-reference lab instead.

, ELISA testing is most common, but reverse transcription (RT)-PCR is also used if ELISA is not enough to detect the virus if it happens to be in low levels in the samples.

The virus that causes FMD is an Aphthovirus under the family Picornaviridae. Seven serotypes exist: A, O, C, Asia 1, and SAT (Southern African Territories) 1, 2, and 3. You do not need to worry about doing this particular step; most people are not qualified nor have the equipment to accurately test their own animals for FMD.

, The test results may take a few days to a week to come back. The results will first come back to the veterinarian you had come out to take samples, where they will look over the results and determine the next steps that need to be done if further action is needed.

FMD is a reportable disease, so if you or neighbouring herds come up positive for FMD, actions will need to be taken to deal with these animals and save the rest of the nation's animals from spread of infection. This will mean the euthanasia of all infected and susceptible animals.

"
"
Prepare for the worst.,
Comply with national laws in food and animal safety and biosecurity measures regarding control and eradication of this disease.,
Practice strict biosecurity measures if you must leave the farm for whatever reason.,
Supply necessary requested information and records to officials.,
Understand that no treatment exists for infected animals.,
Vaccinate susceptible animals with appropriate vaccines for the detected serotypes.,
Communicate to the veterinarian if FMD is suspected.",How to Identify and Prevent Bovine Foot and Mouth Disease3," Test results that come back positive for FMD in affected animals will play an emotional toll on you because it will mean that your entire herd will need to be euthanized and strict restriction on movements of any animals or vehicles leaving or coming to the premises are going to be put in place. This is much more true for animals with FMD that have come into countries where the disease is not regularly affecting the national herd (or enzootic countries).

FMD-free countries currently are USA, Canada, countries of Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Greenland, Iceland, and Western European countries.

, This is very important to prevent further movement and spread of this disease to other herds.

Farms with the affected animals undergo strict restriction of animal and vehicle movement (no one in, no one out) on the premises of that farm.
As already mentioned, animals in designated FMD-free countries that have contracted FMD are restricted to the farm they were found on, and it and other susceptible animals it would've came into contact with would be euthanized.

Animal carcasses and their manure are then properly disposed according to federal biosecurity regulations.
There may be additional orders that feeds, animal products, materials and equipment may also need to be destroyed and properly disposed of on site or at another secure site.


Environmental disinfecting of the premises and any vehicles, tools and equipment involved is needed after animal and manure disposal.
Tracing and surveying  the movements and locations of potentially affected animals and detecting newly affected animals, respectively, must be done by the federal animal health inspection services of that country.

, Restrictions and biosecurity practices include:

Showering before leaving the premises.
Clean clothing and footwear need to be worn before leaving.
No visiting other farms of susceptible animals; those coming from farms with susceptible animals may not be allowed to visit the affected farm either.
Dogs, cats, and other pets must be confined.
Vehicles and equipment need to be properly cleaned and disinfected before leaving the farm; some countries may order certain equipment to not leave premises, but be destroyed as well.

, Everything from herd records to the contact of the primary veterinarian that regularly sees your animals will be needed. <http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/foot-and-mouth-disease/if-your-animals-may-be-infected/eng/1355870935544/1355871049411</ref> This is so that the officials can trace animals back to the source where they contracted FMD and if any other potentially infected animals were moved and where they went., No antibiotics exist for this disease, since it is a viral infection, not a bacterial one. Infected animals will more sickly and weaker after they have recovered from the disease, and may need to be eventually humanely euthanized., Vaccines are low in their effectiveness because most only protect susceptible animals for 4 to 6 months and may induce animals to become carriers. Vaccines are primarily only used in enzootic countries to protect susceptible animals from clinical illness (but not viral persistence), and required because the slaughter of all at-risk animals maybe economically unfeasible and cause food shortages., This communication needs to be immediate to prevent further spread of the disease."

Before a bovine is butchered, it must be slaughtered.,
Start the butchering process.,
Quarter the carcass.,
Attach a gambrel to the lower half or use chains to hang these quarters from a hook.,
Cut off each leg with a meat saw.,
Remove the flank steaks from the side of the carcass.,
Remove the sirloin flat meat.,
Cut away the meat beneath the backbone, otherwise known as tenderloin or fillet mignon.,
Choose whether you want to cut the meat from the ribs with a knife or use a meat saw to leave the bone in on your rib steaks.,
Cut your steaks from the rear (just after the rump roast) forward.,
Remove meat that is left on this part of the carcass and use it for ground beef or stew meat.

,
Begin butchering the front section.,
Remove the meat on the shoulder.,
Remove the top part of the leg.,
Remove the meat from the front of the leg.,
Remove the neck meat and put it with the other stew meat.

,
Wrap your meat separately in plastic and paper.

,
Place the meat in your freezer or in your refrigerator if you plan to use it quickly.

",How to Butcher Cattle," Please see How to Slaughter Cattle for steps on how you can humanely and properly slaughter your cattle.;
, After the carcass has been hung for a few days to a few weeks, it is time to cut the carcass halves up into different pieces.


Make sure you have the proper equipment, knives sharpened, and clean clothes and an apron before you begin.







, Cut between the 12th and 13th rib, first slicing with a large pointed knife and then cutting the top from the bottom with a meat saw. This cross-section of the cut should look like a rib eye steak.

, Or, set both halves on a table at a comfortable level. Begin cutting the meat at the hind end of the carcass.

, You will begin at the hip and move down to the tailbone. Cut across the top to create round steaks, or cut larger portions for roasts.


The meatiest end of the leg is the rump roast. Cut it away from the bone or leave the bone in when you remove it.

, This is the muscle to the side of the belly portion. Trim away any large amounts of fat. Set your flank steaks on a table and save your fat in a pile to use for pure rendered fat, if you choose.

, Remove the fat with a sharp knife and cut into sirloin steaks of any size. You can also cut this flat meat into pieces for fajitas or tri-tip steak meat.

, You can leave it intact or cut it into smaller steaks.

, You can also choose to use the area between the 6th and 12th ribs for a large prime rib roast.

, They are sirloin, porterhouse, T-bone and New York strip.

,, Lift the leg up and cut beneath the shoulder blade until the leg comes loose from the body.

, This is called a blade roast.

, This is called chuck. It can be used as a roast or steaks with the bone in or out. The lower portion of meat should be used for ground beef or steaks.

, This is your brisket.

Grab an available ear.,
Insert the needle into the ear.,
Squeeze the trigger to eject the required dosage into the ear.,
Release the animal.,
Repeat for the next animal from step 2.",How to Give Cattle Hormones1," There are many types of implants to choose from, but there are actually only five or seven main brands that are available for use (see the introduction above). The United States has two additional brands (Encore®, Finaplix-H®and Implus®) to that mentioned in the introduction that are approved for use in Canadian beef cattle. Australian producers have Progro®, Ralgro®, Synovex®, and Revalor® approved for use in beef cattle Your choice will reflect the effectiveness of it in your herd, because each type of implant product is intended for use in different types of cattle. You need to know the sex (i.e., heifers or steers), age, weight, length of time the implants are effective, and classes of cattle (nursing calves, grass cattle, backgrounding, feedlot, or breeding cattle)of the animals you want to implant.
Some implants are more effective than others, but effectiveness is actually limited by what you feed your animals and how you raise them. Implants can only do so much, but they will not make the animal grow better for you, they are only a means of assisting growth and feed efficiency along with a proper feeding program and responsible, humane handling. An implant can be next to considerably ineffective if you do not feed your animals properly or, in other words, you fail to meet their nutritional requirements.;
, The steer or heifer should be put into a squeeze chute and locked in a head-gate for the procedure. The ear is going to be needed for this, which means the head needs to be easily accessible in order for the implant to be injected.

, This is optional, but useful if this is your first attempt at performing an ear implantation and don't want to have to deal with a struggling animal. You can restrain the head by using a rope halter or a bull lead (nose tongs), or a nose brace that can be attached to the head gate.


If you choose to use a rope halter, put it on by first looping the head piece over the ears, then the nose band over the muzzle and the chin piece (the adjustable part of the halter) tightened snug against the chin. Next, loop the end of the lead rope once around one of the bars that sits behind the head gate, and pull tight until the animal's head is snug up against the side of the head-catch. Secure using a quick-release knot.
Bovine nose tongs are put on by inserting the ball points of the tong inside each nostril (one ball point per nostril) and locking the tool in place by squeezing the handles together and keeping tension on the rope or chain that is attached to the ends of the handles. A rope should be tied to the chains, then secured in the same manner as with the rope halter above.

, Using a cotton swab dipped in germicide or disinfectant, generously swab the site of the ear to where the needle will be injected. The needle of the applicator gun should also be disinfected if not already done so.

, This should be done before you have the animal in the chute and head restrained. The implant gun is like a hand-gun except with a sharp, large-gauge needle at the ""business"" end. The barrel holds a cartridge of several small implant pellets which are injected under the skin of the ear, and slowly release their contents over time.


These pellets are contained in a cartridge because they are too small to handle alone like small bullets that can be loaded into a .22 rifle. One cartridge contains 10 to 100 pellets, depending on the product (i.e., Synovex® vs. Revalor® vs. Ralgro®; each have different guns and different methods on loading each for injection).
Load the gun according to the label that comes with the implant gun or re-fill cartridges. Do not use a cartridge from one product for a gun of a different product, i.e., don't load a cartridge meant for a Rev-X Universal Applicator Tool (for Revalor® implants) into a Synovex® gun.

, You will only need one ear (not both) to give an animal its required dose, preferably one that does not have an ear tag in it, if possible. Divide the ear into three imaginary sections. Locate the middle third of the ear. Implants are going to be placed on the outside of the ear, all under the skin, and in the middle of that ear.

, Holding the ear in one hand, use your other hand to guide the need of the applicator tool so that the needle is parallel to the surface of the ear, the sharp end of the needle closest to the surface and at the outer third of the ear (or the third that is closest to the tip, not the base ). Make sure your finger is off the trigger during this step to prevent premature ejection of the pellets. Using your finger on the inside of the ear to feel for the needle (and ensure it does not poke out the other side), push the needle until it is completely submersed beneath the skin.

, This may need to be done multiple times if more than one pellet is to be administered into the ear. You should feel a straight line of pellets running parallel to the ear, this indicating that the procedure has been properly done. Once you have ejected the pellets into the ear, pull out the needle in the same direction you pushed it in.

, If there are no more things that need to be done (such as vaccinating, dehorning, castrating or tagging), then release the animal from the chute.

, You will need to keep the implant gun disinfected each time and ready to go for each animal, and each animal restrained as necessary.

You may confine the cow to a head gate of a handling facility you already have, or a calving or maternity pen specifically suited for this very practice.
, Most C-sections are performed on the left side of the cow, or according to whichever side the cow is laying on if she's a downer cow and cannot get up without risk of collapsing again. In this case with a standing cow, the left flank--located just behind the last rib and before the hook of the pelvis--is shaved. A quarter inch of hair--or less--should remain afterwards., Squirt some pre-podine scrub onto the area that has been shaved, and rub down the area with hands, a sponge or scrub brush. Repeat until the area is clean or free of any tag (dirt or feces on the hide)., This will further disinfect the area., Administer local anaesthetic to spinal area (which involves a long needle inserted into a specific area of the spinal cord) that incision will be done on.

Purchase the product.,
Read the label.,
Calculate out how much MGA is needed for your herd.,
Measure out the amount to supplement.,
Feed it to your intended animals.,
Repeat the steps from step 2 as necessary.",How to Give Cattle Hormones2," Melengestrol acetate (MGA®) is a product that is added to the feed that is being fed to them, and comes as dry or liquid premix form, and in medicated range pellets.

, The label will give instructions on how much MGA needs to be given based on number of head to feed per ton of feed per day. The rule of thumb for supplementing MGA® 200 Premix and MGA® 500 Liquid Premix is that heifers and females get 0.25 to 0.5 mg per head per day, with optimum levels of 0.35 to 0.5 mg/head/day for maximum estrus suppression. MGA® 100 Premix should be fed so that females get 0.4 mg/head/day.


The only MGA product approved for use in Canadian cattle is MGA® 100 Premix. The others, including MGA® 100 Premix, are approved for use in American cattle.
MGA® 100 Premix contains 100 mg of melengestrol acetate per pound (lb), MGA® 200 Premix 200 mg per pound, and MGA® 500 Liquid Premix 500 mg per pound. How much MGA is mixed in with the feed depends on the type of feed as per compliance with the Food and Drug Agency's (FDA) Medicated Feeds Program.

As per the program, there are two types of feeds: Type B and Type C medicated feeds. Type B medicated feeds are feeds that are created for the purpose of manufacturing other Type B medicated feeds, not to be fed to livestock. Type C medicated feeds are those where a medicated feed or Type A medicated article (like MGA® 200 Premix) or a Type B medicated feed has been heavily diluted with a non-medicated feed for the purpose of being fed to livestock.



, As per the aforementioned step, you will need to determine whether you are putting MGA in Type C (non-medicated) feed, or Type B feed (to be turned to Type C feed). The label will indicate how much MGA can be mixed with the feed you intend to feed to your heifers. MGA® 200 Premix, for example, needs to be mixed at a rate of 1.25 to 10 pounds per ton of non-medicated feed to create a Type C medicated feed with 0.5 to 2.0 grams of MGA per ton.


Remember, one US short ton is around 2000 pounds (~ 907 kilograms), and that MGA@ 200 contains 200 mg of MGA per pound of the premix. Also, try not to get mixed up on the conversion measurements between empirical and metric measurements!!
MGA@ 500 Liquid Premix contains more complicated mixing directions that will need to be followed. Basically, though, this premix should be mixed with a non-medicated feed at a rate of 0.5 to 4 pounds per ton so that you get a Type C feed that contains 0.25 to 2.0 grams of MGA per ton.
MGA® 100 Premix should be added to feed at a rate of 0.25 kg to 1.0 kg per 1000 kg of feed so that heifers get 0.4 mg of feed per head per day.

, The amount you measure out to give to your animals to be mixed in the feed will depending on how many animals you are feeding and how much feed you have to use to mix the MGA in.


The feed that is typically mixed in with is grain or bag of feed that is a mix of grains and intended as a supplement or to top-dress on a mix of silage and hay, especially in a feedlot environment. It's not feasible to mix MGA premix directly with silage or hay.

, The resulting manufactured feed should be fed as a top-dress on grain, roughage, or mixed with a complete ration so that cattle get the Type C feed at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per day.


This feed is not intended nor permitted to be fed to steers, breeding cows or heifers, bulls nor veal or suckling calves, and doesn't work on spayed heifers or steers. It is only intended for feeder cows or heifers that are fed in confinement for slaughter to suppress estrus for the intended period of time they are in the feedlot.

, You will need to feed this premix as directed daily to prevent heifers from coming into heat. Any lapse of feeding this can result in heifers going into estrus at least a day later.

Purchase the drug.,
Read the label.,
Know how much needs to be injected per cow.,
Confine the animal.,
Fill up the syringe.,
Inject into the cow.,
Release the cow.,
Repeat for other cows, and after the recommended time period.",How to Give Cattle Hormones3," You will only find this injectable hormone in the United States, so if you are an American dairy farmer looking for Posilac®, you will find it being sold at your local veterinary clinic or at the local farm supply store. Posilac® is the only hormone drug on the US market that is intended and used for increased milk production in dairy cows. There is no similar drug on the market nor for legal use in dairy cows outside of the U.S.

, Like with all other drug labels, the Posilac® label will tell you the optimum dosage, where to inject and how often, and for which animals it is intended for. Use this information to perform the proceeding steps below.

, Dosage depends on the weight of the cow, and this is recorded for each individual cow in all dairy operations. Majority of dosages are calculated based on approximate weight, thus there is no need to know the exact weight (that down to the pound) in order to be able to give the correct dosage. As long as it is within the correct hundred weight, the dosage will be precise enough to administer.

, Unless you have a dairy operation where cows are confined to stalls for the duration of their lactating period, you will need to move the cow into a squeeze chute in order to give the hormone. Restrain the head in a head-catch or head-gate so there's less chance that she will try to move up and down the chute on you while you are giving the needle.

, As directed in the wikiHow article How to Give Cattle Injections, the syringe will need to be filled up with the required dosage by putting air into the bottle via syringe then slowly pulling back the plunger to allow the liquid to flow into the syringe until you get the required dosage. Once done, tap the syringe and depress the plunger slightly to let any air bubbles out.

, Unlike with beef cattle, you can inject Posilac into the rump of the cow, as well as the neck. The rump injection would not be in the muscle, but rather in the skin that stretches between the tail head (at the very base of the tail) and the hip bones that are known as the ""pins"" of the pelvis. This is found right at the top of the rump of the cow and make up the tail-head depression. Avoid the folds that extend from under the tail, known as the caudal fold. This is the area where USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) tuberculosis testing is done. Since Posilac® must be administered subcutaneously (under the skin), the tenting technique on the neck is also recommended. The area behind the shoulder is also a recommended area to inject, though tenting in this area is a little more difficult. After inserting the needle, lowly depress the plunger of the syringe until all the fluid is gone out of the syringe.

, Once the injection process is complete and no other medications or supplements need to be administered, the cow can be released back into the herd.

, The Posilac® label recommends that cows be injected every 14 days, starting 57 to 70 days post-calving and continued until the end of lactation. It's best to keep records to keep track when which cow was injected, especially when you have a large dairy herd that is not in the same stage of reproduction or lactation as a means to achieve year-round milking.

(Optional) Buy machinery for feeding cattle.,
(Optional) Buy feed for cattle.,
Shop around, ask questions, and study the animals you want to buy.,
Buy cattle.,
Bring them home.,
Keep them confined in a good strong corral first before you let them out to pasture.,
 Carry through with your plan on raising these cattle you bought.",How to Start up a Beef Cow Calf Operation,"  In this day and age, planning is the best way to determine how, what and where you are going to do the things you want to do.  Make a business plan, do your SWOT analysis and brain storm your goals and objectives creating the kind of cow-calf operation you want to have.  Also make a budget according to what you have to do and how you do it; you should also plan out financial and marketing initiatives and goals to market and sell your calves and culls. 


Research the kind of breeds that do well in your area. Look at yourself (using the internal SWOT analysis you completed) to determine what kind of breed you like and/or the kind you can handle. 
Look up and read everything else that is involved in the cow-calf business: that means everything from feedlot to pasture management, calving, weaning, breeding, conformation, body condition scoring to even forage physiology. 

The Internet is a good place to base your research from, but remember that you can't trust everything you read in the Internet. Make sure the sites you read are government-based, scientific research papers, or extension articles from colleges and universities. Reliable cattle sites such as BEEF magazine, TheBeefSite.com, CattleToday.com, CattleNetwork.com, and even those good articles found here on wikiHow, are also great to look through to find what you need.
Books are the greatest things to have. Storey's Guide to Raising Beef Cattle, Beef Cattle Science, Salad Bar Beef, Getting Started with Beef or Dairy Cattle, The Cattle Health Handbook, Essential Guide to Calving, and/or any other cattle-related books are highly recommended to buy and to read as thoroughly as possible.

;
,  Without land you cannot have cattle.  You could buy land, acquire land through an agreement with your parents or grandparents to inherit land (if you have family members that are actively farming and looking to retire), rent some land, or have a cow-lease agreement with another producer to start raising your cows with once you do acquire some land. 


Research the laws and taxation that comes with buying/renting/inheriting land, both municipal, state (or provincial), and federal.  Also know the pros and cons of the land and climate you are buying/renting/inheriting into, so you know how to manage your cattle accordingly.

,  This is always important to do.  Fences are more important than buildings, and water sources are more important than fences.  Since you have to keep your new cattle confined for a few days in order for them to calm down and get settled in to their new home, a sturdy corral is important to have at all times for each and every time you bring new animals home. This location is also useful as a handling facility where you can easily handle them when they need to be loaded up to be sold to the auction mart or taken to the slaughterhouse. 


Steel panels or sturdy wood fencing is best for keeping new-comers in for a few days, making sure they also have access to water and feed at all times.  Pasture fencing can be caught up on when they are in after you bought them, or if you have to build fence, should be done before they come home. 
Most buildings can be built and/or repaired after they come home, especially if you have bought weaned heifers that won't be calving until they're 2 years of age. All animals should have some form of shelter, though no matter what. 
Water sources are a must.  Automatic waterers that refresh themselves after the cattle drink and connect through piping that runs to a well or a ground cistern that collects ground water deep below the frost line (if you have a frost line where you live) are highly recommended to have and install. 

Automatic waterers are a little more reliable when it comes to watering cattle, because a) you don't have to break ice every couple hours when it's 30 below 0, b) it often comes with a heating element on the other side of the flow tank, and c) you don't have to be out in a winter storm using a garden hose to fill up the tank.  


Stock tanks may work for areas where there are a small number of cattle to care for and the seasons are quite mild, but when you come up north to the Great White North or Northern USA, watering cattle in the dead of winter is not a fun chore.

, This is optional because you may wish to become a low-cost producer and raise your cattle with only fence posts and an ATV.  However, if you have the money to spend on keeping cows in the drylot all winter (or all year) feeding them grain and hay and making silage and hay in the summer, then machinery may be necessary. 


Some grass-fed operations have hay machinery that the owners use to cut, dry, rake and gather hay for the winter.  Other operations prefer to have it custom-done. 
A tractor may be necessary if you have heavy temporary panels that need horse-power to be moved and not man-power, and especially if you are unable to move them yourself!  Make sure you get the right size of tractor that can manage big bales of hay (average large round bale weighs around 1 ton or ~2000 lbs) easily without breaking down or causing a hydraulic hose to burst.  But don't get a tractor that is too big, like those big beasts you see on display in front of machinery dealerships like Agri-Trac (Case IH for Americans), John Deere, CAT, or New Holland's Ford tractors. Some low-cost producers don't need a tractor, but really, a farm--and that means literally any farm or ranch--is nothing without a good tractor.  You can never know when you need one!

, This only applies if the area you are keeping them in for a few days has little grass, or if you bought cattle at a time of year when pastures are low or not producing. Feed is also necessary if you bought cattle and failed to put up hay or silage that year for the following winter.  Roughage feed is also a good source to fall back on if your winter grazing methods fail.  Some of you may like to invest in a little grain to keep your cows tame and easy to handle; there's nothing wrong with that.

,  This is a must if you want to buy great foundation stock to start. It's always good to shop around and compare prices, just like you would if you were going to a few clothing or shoe stores in the mall.  Some producers may charge a little more money because they can or because their stock is high quality (i.e., registered purebred stock).  No cow is alike, no matter how many individual cows you look at.  Don't get caught up on just looking at pictures on the internet, as most of the time the pictures you see on-line are not what you see when you're standing out in the pasture.  But that's not to say that it's wrong to have a producer send you pictures to look at, or to view pictures of heifers and cows on a producer's website.  It's actually good to have both to go off of. 


Most of the time when you are out with the cow in her pasture you get to see how she acts around you (as a stranger to her), her general temperament, how she walks, her conformation, etc. Visiting a producer also gives you a chance to talk with him or her about how he raises her animals, what health problems they've gone through, how they manage their pastures and their cattle, and to also see the other cattle that they raise in addition to the one (or more) of interest. You also get to see where they live, what kind of land they raise their cattle on, their facilities and other things that may concern you.  And ask questions; chances are that the producers you are visiting couldn't care less whether you are full of questions or not.  Even they'll most likely be asking you questions about you and what you want to do with the cattle of theirs you're offering to buy.  It also wouldn't hurt if you asked if you could take pictures of their cattle so you can study them further back home.
When you're at a sale barn or auction mart, it's a bit different.  The cattle are shunted through pretty quickly, giving you only a few seconds to study them before they are sold to a buyer and shunted out of the ring again.  Chances are you will not be able to meet the producer that is selling the cattle--except if it's a dispersal sale--so you are pretty much on your own as to deciding what cattle you can buy.  It may help to go in the corrals behind the ring to have a look at the animals yourself before the sale to see if there are any worth bidding on.  Don't choose something just because it looks cute or pretty, be more pickier about disposition, looks of overall health, conformation and body condition.  And follow your gut instinct.  Don't be disappointed if you've lost a bid on some heifers or a 3-in-1 that you were looking to buy, nor if you haven't found any worthwhile animals to buy at the sale you went to.  There's always a next time, always a next sale to attend to if you couldn't find what you were looking for in a previous one.  If you are really inexperienced and don't know what or how to think in a cattle auction, get a friend who has more experience with cattle to come along with you to help you pick and decide which is best and which isn't.

, Producers may charge according to either the current market price for a good cow or heifer in terms of weight, or according to their breed standards and registries.  Registered cattle of any sex or age are more expensive than commercial, unregistered or crossbred cattle.  Heifers are cheaper than cows; open (not pregnant) cows are cheaper than bred cows, and bred cows are cheaper than bred cows with a calf at side (3-in-1's).  This goes for dispersal sales, general cow sales, and buying private treaty. 


You needed to have planned out, from Step 1, about what kind of cows you should buy, whether you wanted to buy weaned heifers that are around 6 months of age and will take 2 years until you get any income from selling calves, or spend money on a few bred cows with calves so you can sell the calves within a month or two and wait for another few months until the cow gives birth to another calf, etc.
Remember you have five (5) choices of the types of cows you can buy: Bred Heifers, Weaned Heifers, 3-in-1's, Bred Cows, or Open Cows.  Make sure you do your research before-hand and think seriously about which you should go about to purchase.

, Make sure you have that holding corral in top shape before you bring them home or have them brought home.  If you've bought a truck and trailer (no need for anything new, fancy, or expensive), you can load them up and haul them home yourself.  But if you don't have a trailer (yet), you can either rent a trailer from a machinery rental service, rent the producer's trailer (if you've got a truck that's powerful enough, depending on the size of the trailer), or ask or accept an offer to have the producer to ship the cattle home for you.  However, it's more important to come prepared with a stock trailer if you've bought cattle at a sale-barn.

,  Cattle in new surroundings get a bit tense and stressed out, and they may try to find their way out of your corrals to get back home.  Weaned calves are especially bad for this, as calves that have been taken away from their mommas and prodded and harried to and from the sale ring, are under a lot of stress.  Weaned heifers will most likely have to be confined to a good corral for at least a week before they are allowed access to a pasture.  Older cows will most likely calm down a lot sooner, especially if they are of a docile nature.  If you've bought weaned calves, be prepared to put up with constant bawling and bellowing for a few days.  Calves bawl because they want to locate their mothers and want to be near their mothers; it's a way of calling out to them.  Eventually they give up and things quieten down and you can start working with them to get them used to you and their new routine.

, But if you have to make changes, make a note in your business plan and do what you have to do.  Be flexible and strategic at the same time, and always expect the unexpected.  You may find after a few years that raising cattle isn't right for you.  So be it.  You may find, on the other hand, that the cattle you started with aren't the type you aren't too crazy about, and would like to switch to something else that is better and that better meets your requirements according to you, your preferences, opinions and lifestyle.  So be it.  We all learn as we go, be it our own mistakes or from the mistakes of others.  And you will never stop learning about how to raise cattle, no matter how long you've been at it!

Check the machine over before use.,
Attach all tubes and caps to the machine.,
Have the cow standing in her stanchion with some feed.,
Clean the udder thoroughly.,
Dip the teats with a 70% Iodine solution.,
Hook up the vacuum line to the vacuum port on the milker and turn on the vacuum pump.,
Move the bucket or bucket-milker unit beside the cow next to her rib cage.,
Grab the claw and hold it under the udder with the milk hose pointed to the front of the claw.,
Open the vacuum to the claw and listen to make sure the pulsator is clicking properly.,
Add the teat cups to the teats one at a time.,
Check to see how and if the milk is flowing into the bucket.,
Remove the cups when the milk going into the bucket slows to a stop.,
Turn off the machine and remove the lid from the bucket.,Repeat for other cows.,
Clean the machine afterwards.,Store the machine in a warm dry place until next use.",How to Milk a Cow With a Milking Machine," Regular maintenance and cleaning will keep the machine in good order for a long time. It's very important to make sure the machine is cleaned regularly because raw milk tends to dry and stick to parts and invite dirt and other foreign objects into the different parts of the machine that may end up contaminating the milk.

Cleaning the machine should be daily or after every use. Maintenance on the machine should be made once a month or less to make sure parts are well oiled or greased, and any repairs that may need to be made are done before things get worse.
Regular disinfection of the hoses (especially inside), tank, and suction cups is very important. The cups should be covered or placed in a bag where they will not become contaminated or dirty during storage.;
, Make sure all tubes are connected properly; any that are not properly connected (or not connected at all) will not create a vacuum seal. Make sure also the O-ring for the lid is properly in place before attaching the lid. The lid should also be in place properly to create a good seal., If you keep to a regular milking schedule, she will know where to go and how to get in. Just make sure she's happy munching on a flake of hay (or part of a square bale) while being milked., Using a clean rag or paper towels, clean the teats and lower part of the udder of dirt and debris. As you do so, gently yet firmly, just like if you were hand-milking, squeeze each teat in a downward motion to initiate milk let-down and to dislodge any plugs that may be accumulated at the end of each teat. This may not be necessary if the udder is already so full that the teats are leaking milk. Discard the rag or towel., Wait for a couple minutes for the solution to dry, then gently dab any excess iodine off from the end of the teat with a clean rag or paper towel. Do not touch the teats afterwards., If you have a DIY milker (those you can make yourself with proper parts to create a good vacuum pump) that operates from an electrical outlet, plug the pump in then turn it on. If you're running the pump from a little motor then the similar applies as above, to attach the line to the port on the milker before turning on the motor to the pump. Some milkers may need some time to build up the negative pressure needed to begin milking, and to get the pulsator going in the inflations (or suction/teat cups). The pressure should reach around 0.04 kPa before putting the cups on.

Remember to make sure all connections are secure and attached before turning anything on.

, The bucket, especially if you have one that you are not moving around on the trolley, should be placed on the ground next to the cow. This leaves you room to access the cow's udder more easily., This claw is actually a holding unit that collects milk from all four teats (via the suction cups or teat cups) before moving it down a tube into the sealed bucket or container. When you hold the claw under the udder you are ensuring that the cups are going to be put on properly, avoiding it being twisted up during milking., It should be ticking once every half to three-quarter of a second. Don't listen for too long because you need to maintain pressure to be able to add the teat cups to the cow without them falling off., Start from the back, from right to left (if you're on the left side of the cow) then continue in the same manner with the front. Put them on as quickly and smoothly as possible so that the cups won't lose suction. Guide the cups onto the teat with your hand rather than trying to look under the cow to see where they are going to be attached. This will make things quicker and safer for you., If everything is flowing well, then sit back and relax and let the machine do the rest of the work., The easiest way to do this is by kinking the hose to the claw and cups which will allow the cups to fall off immediately.

With large milk operations machines have automatic systems where each cup will fall off as soon as one quarter of the udder is out of milk. But with single milker units this is not so much of a luxury, so kinking of the hose is one of the easiest ways to remove the cups from the teats.

, Pour the milk into clean buckets or a milk container for storage and later use.,, Get a pail of water with a couple cups of cleaning solution (cold water is best), and put the suction cups open end down into the pail, then turn on the machine. The machine will actively suck the water and cleaning solution through the hoses into the bucket, until the pail is empty. Repeat with plain clean water afterwards to wash out any residue chemical.,"

Get two cattle pictures from your favourite search engine.,
Study the level of fatness.,
Look at the coat colouration of one of the pictured cattle.,
Study the coat colouration of the next picture.,
Look at the size difference of the udders between dairy and beef cows.",How to Tell the Difference Between Beef and Dairy Cattle," Do an image search on ""dairy cattle"" and pick a random image from the first several that show up. Save it to your hard drive. Then do an image search on ""beef cattle"" and also pick a random image from the search results, also saving it to your hard drive. Print them out and lay them side by side. Or, bring up both pictures on your computer (preferably use a computer rather than a tablet or smart phone), reduce the window size so you can see them both at the same time without having to click back and forth between either image.
, One bovine on one image should appear ""fatter"" or more muscular than the bovine in the other picture. Do not look at the belly, instead look at the ribs, the spinal column or ""top line"" of the animal all the way back to the hips. If the ribs and hips are more prominent in the animal in one of the pictures than the other, then it's likely that that thinner bovine is a dairy animal.


Don't confuse emaciated with what is considered the ""dairy look."" Beef cattle have other characteristics besides level of fatness or muscularity to distinguish themselves from dairy cattle. Coat colouration is one significant identifier.
Dairy cattle are actually not emaciated or malnourished, even when they appear that way. Dairy cattle are typically thinner looking because of their breeding. Artificial selection has made them into animals that, genetically, focus on milk production than building muscle and fat. Muscle building and milk production are genetically opposed in most animals (also expressed in sheep and goats), so a producer cannot focus on enhancing one trait without sacrificing the quality of other. This is why you see cattle that have dairy breeding in them with little muscling in the rear (""funnel butts"") and a ""thin"" look no matter how well they are really being fed.

, This is probably the harder part if you are not familiar with cattle breeds. However, since 95% of the world's dairy herd is Holstein, Holstein-Freisian or Freisian (the two breeds are very much related in bloodlines), and if by chance one of the cattle you have on your screen happens to be black and white, then it's actually a lot easier to identify a dairy cow than once thought. The picture in step 2 is one that matches this description exactly.

Here's another fun thing to try: Pull up a picture, from your ""dairy cattle"" image search, of a brown dairy cow. Does she (or he if it's in fact a bull) have the same muscularly-structural qualities as in the step above? If yes, then look at the face. Black nose? Big soft, dark eyes? Dark hooves, fawnish-brown all over with a dark face? If you said yes to all, then you've pulled up a picture of a Jersey cow, also a dairy animal.






You're going to find dairy bulls as well. The fifth step below will describe udder characteristics, but if you find a picture of a bovine with no large, well-developed udder between its legs and it bears the same characteristics already mentioned in the steps above, then you just happened across a dairy bull.







, Beef cattle, unlike dairy cattle, come in a much wider array of coat colourations and patterns than any dairy breed or cross breed can come out with. You will find in your search beef cattle that range from all black to all blonde, red with white, brown with white, all white, grey, mottled, very spotty, and even coats with both red and white hairs (roan). Black is the most popular colour in beef herds today, with Angus cattle being at the root of it all. Dairy cattle can be all black too, just by crossing breeding a Holstein cow to a Jersey bull (preferably that than a Jersey cow bred to a Holstein bull!), however even these cattle will still have the same musculature as mentioned in step two. Angus cattle, black Simmental, black Limousin, black Gelbvieh, etc. are all identifiable as beef cattle by musculature, bulls especially.

, If you don't have two pictures of two cows (the female mature type, not the colloquial ""cows""), find them in your search from step one. You should clearly see how the dairy cow, described above minus the udder, has a much larger udder than the beef cow. A fully mature beef cow's udder is almost hidden because it's both much smaller and often covered in hair, especially with cows that bear winter coats. A dairy cow has been genetically selected to produce almost five to eight times that of your average beef cow. In other words, where a dairy cow will be producing 8 to 10 gallons of milk a day, a beef cow typically only produces between 1 to 2 gallons per day. That's quite a difference!

Make careful preparations for doing the slaughtering process.,
Make sure the animal you are going to slaughter is of the right age to butcher.,
Make sure you are slaughtering at the right time of year, or even day.,
Consider which parts of the animal you want to keep before slaughtering.,
Locate the area where you are going to euthanize your beef animal.,
Load the gun and make sure the knife you have with you is razor sharp.,
Make the shot.,
Cut the throat right after the animal goes down.,
Remove the head and testes immediately.,
Remove the front feet/lower leg.,
Get the tractor.,
Make slits between the achilles tendon (or gam cord) and the hock bone (equivalent to our ankle/heel) of the hind leg and insert a hook called the gambrel or beef hook into this slit, and repeat for the other hind leg.,
Move the carcass to the designated slaughter area.,
Remove the hind feet and shanks.,
Start skinning the animal.,
Remove the offal/viscera of the animal.,
Split the carcass in half.,
Clean the carcass with cold water to wash any excess blood and dirt off.,
Hang the carcass to age it.",How to Slaughter Cattle2," This will help you remain calm and make sure you make the euthanization process as quick and painless as possible. You will get a strong surge of adrenaline and emotional stress when the animal is killed, but make sure you learn to direct these feelings into doing the job right instead of letting them get the best of you and botching the job .
, This is especially true with a steer or heifer that you have raised for beef. If you are or have finished a young animal on grain, aim to butcher when they are around 15 to even 18 months old. Some people prefer to butcher their cattle between 10 and 15 months of age. If they are finished on pasture, the best age to butcher is between 24 and 30 months of age.

, Try to avoid slaughtering and butchering cattle, or any other animals, during fly season, which is typically between May and October in most countries except Australia. For some areas, you can butcher anytime between October and May, especially the areas that don't get much or any snow and temperatures remain 40 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) during the day.


However, the window for slaughtering cattle is much more narrower for areas that do get snow from November or December through to May. For these areas, slaughtering should be done in the fall, between October to the first snowfall.
You should also note the time that your animals were born and when the best age and time to slaughter should be. For example, if the steer you are raising on grass was born in April and you are wanting to slaughter him when he's around 18 months of age, then you should slaughter in October of the following year. However, if the steer was born in February and you want to slaughter at the same age (18 months), then you may have to consider waiting a couple of months more (into October or November instead of in August of the following) to slaughter it.
Consider withholding feed for 24 hours prior to slaughter. It's not mandatory, but it's easier to clean or gut an animal when there is no food in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract than if there was. If you feel bad about leaving your cattle hungry before slaughter, then that's fine. But remember to be very careful when the skinning and cleaning process has to commence to avoid contaminating the carcass.

, Some people like to use all parts of the animal for various uses. If you choose not to use the different parts available to use, the value is only in learning and experimenting, as well as knowing the possibilities of what you can save and use.

, The best place would be in an area where it is most comfortable in, where you can easily get into with a tractor to haul it out, and were chances of bullet ricochet (a real danger if location is not thought out thoroughly enough) is minimal.


Ideally, many recommend to restrain the animal first for your safety, or move the animal into a small enclosure where you can make the shot as close as possible. If necessary, restraint in a box chute with a side-access door is also recommended so that you can quickly access the animal as quickly as possible after the unpleasant deed (next step) is done. This is an exception if the animal you are slaughtering is already a ""downer"" from an injury and is unable to get up.

, Your gun of choice should be capable of at least 300 ft/lb of muzzle velocity (according to the AVMA) for yearlings or cows, or over 1000 ft/lb for bulls and adult cows (CVMA recommends the latter for all adult cattle). Use solid-point bullets. See How to Humanely Euthanize a Cow for more information on proper gunshot euthanasia procedures.

A small .22 caliber gun will not be enough to kill an adult cow, but it may be best on younger cattle. A large-caliber handgun like a .44 Magnum, or a large caliber rifle like those used with hunting large game such as deer, elk, bear, or moose, such as a .30-30, are sufficient to effectively kill a cow or a bull. Rifles like the .30-30 are excellent at killing a bovine from a distance where a pistol or a shotgun will not be so effective.
Shotguns can also be used, but need to be used at closer range (within 1 to 2 yards). Use of the 12, 16, and 20-gauge shotguns are ideal for mature cows and bulls, loaded with slugs or No. 2-, 4-, or 6-size birdshot.

, There are two areas that you can aim for in making a quick and painless kill to the bovine: At an invisible X just above the eyes, or at the back of the head where the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata (part of the brain that controls all organ function) are located. The latter is ideal if the animal is down from injury or illness and is unable to get up, and the angle for a shot at the skull is too acute to make a proper kill. Either way, what's especially important is that you must make sure the shot you take is precise so that the bovine will not struggle nor feel any pain. You owe that animal, that has been in your care, to make its death as quick and painless as possible, so please try to make the first shot count the most so you don't have to do it again and allow the animal to suffer.

Visualize an invisible X on the forehead, for cattle older than 6 months: Start at the top of the base of the animal's horn bed, then trace it to the inner corner of the opposite eye. Do the same with the opposite horn bed and eye. (Or think of it this way: left horn bed to right eye, right horn bed to left eye.) The center were the two lines meet is where you must aim for and place the bullet.For cattle 6 months and younger, the aim should be from the top-base of each ear to the inside corner of the eye on the opposite side: left ear, right eye, right ear, left eye.

No matter the age, the angle of the gun itself should be perpendicular to the angle of the face from poll to nose. This is so that maximum impact can be achieved and there is a lower chance of bullet ricochet.
If the gun is placed between the eyes, the shot will completely miss the brain and cause suffering to the animal instead of intended instantaneous death. Do not allow this to happen.



If you have chosen to place a bullet in the back of the head, aim below the poll (the rounded portion at the top of the skull) and just above the neck-line. Your aim should be parallel with the angle of the face or, at a 45-degree angle to the neck-line. Do this only with a downer animal.
This can be the most nerve-wracking, emotionally-distressing, and very unpleasant portion of slaughtering an animal, especially for those doing it for the first time. If you find you cannot do it, there is nothing wrong with finding someone else who can do it for you.

, With a very sharp knife (a hunting knife is recommended), insert just above the breast bone at a 45-degree angle toward the head, and make the cut outwards and away from you. You should have been able to severe the carotid artery and jugular vein in one movement.Never cut into the skin through the hair, you need to cut through the skin and out. This avoids the knife slipping and cutting you or some part of the animal. So, it's point in, then cut out.

Note: Before and during the sticking process many people who have viewed videos of animal slaughter or have personally watched the slaughter process observed that the animals' legs were still moving and kicking as their throats were being slit, and this has lead them to believe that the animal was still alive after being stunned or killed. This is false. Leg movements after stunning and sticking are merely unconscious muscle reflexes that are initiated by synapses that come from the spinal cord, not the brain itself. This is because the brain would already be non-functioning after being severely damaged enough to initiate brain death. Even decapitated animals will kick out or ""appear to struggle.""

In order to determine if an animal is unconscious and insensible, leg movement must be ignored. Eye reflexes, eye blinking, vocalization and rhythmic breathing or movement of the animal's sides must be absent in order for an animal to be considered deceased.



, Removal of the testes is only applicable to the slaughter of bulls. This is so that the meat doesn't get tainted. Be careful when removing the testes because the animal may still be involuntarily kicking out. The head should be removed by cutting all the way around with the hunting knife, careful to keep the blade between the skin and flesh, never into the hair, and cutting outwards but never towards you.


You will need a meat-saw to cut through the spinal column.

, Stick the point of the knife into the knee-joint and cut outwards, keeping the point of the knife in the cartilage and cutting around, until you can completely remove the leg.

, Make sure it has a front-end loader attached first, otherwise you won't be able to do dress the carcass, unless you can do it on the ground like with wild game (deer, moose, bear, etc). If you choose to use the latter, note that you could do this for skinning the front of the animal, but not for removing viscera and splitting the carcass.

, The two hooks should be attached to a beef-spreader or single-tree. Shackle the single-tree to chains and attach the chains to the loader. Raise the loader up as high as you are comfortable with so that the animal's head is both not dragging on the ground and at a sufficient height where you can start to work on the hind quarters.


If you choose to start slaughtering the animal on the ground, all that's needed to be done is to move the animal onto its back and place a short prop or square post on either side of the rib-cage (below the elbow) to hold it there.

, This is where you will be able to do the rest of the slaughtering procedure. Make sure the area is located in a:

Dry, dust-free and well-drained area.
Area not visible to the public, like from roads, neighbor's houses, etc.
Well-lit area, such as in a sunny spot or where you can access electricity if you have to do the slaughtering process in the evening or at night.
Sheltered area to protect yourself and the carcass from the elements like wind and precipitation.

You may already have a designated slaughter facility where a tractor is not needed, but simply a cable and a winch. Come-along winches are the best for cattle, and can be used to hoist the animal to the height that is most convenient for you to work on the animal.



, Skin the hind legs just like with removing the front legs mentioned above (only up to the hock joints, not past it), then saw through the bone below the hock (above the hock joint when you have the carcass hanging).

, You need to work from the back legs to the neck front to back. To do this use the following steps:


1) Slip the short-pointed knife into the slit made at the gam cord and cut around the hock, cutting outwards.
2) With the knife between the flesh and the skin, slice a line down each leg to the midline, then all the way down to the neck or dewlap.
3) Using your skinning knife, begin at the junction where the leg cuts meet the mid-line cut. Grasp the hide with one hand and pull hard (out and down for hanging, up and out for carcasses on the ground) to create tension as you use your knife to separate the hide from the flesh. Place your knife firmly against the hide with the cutting edge turned towards the hide at a slight angle. Keep pulling the hide away with your hand and keep slicing down and to the side until the belly and rib cage is completely skinned.

You may want to wash down this area at this point to remove any dirt or other contaminants before proceeding to the rest of the skinning process.


4) Start skinning the back legs by starting at the top of the ""Y"" and skinning the hide up and over the groin (scrotum or udder). The hide tends to be tautest here, so you need to be especially careful if you're wanting to save the hide. Just like with skinning the belly, pull the hide out and down to create tension as you work. Fat is good when skinning the animal as it makes it relatively easy to skin, so you should leave as much fat on the carcass as possible.
5) Continue skinning over the anus to the tailbone. Give the tail a sharp jerk downward to sever it from the vertebrae. (If you can't do it, simply cutting it off with a knife works just as well.)
6) The weight of the hide itself will help skin the rest of the carcass for you. Work all around the animal until you reach the forefront of the carcass
7)Skin the forelegs near the shoulders, starting on the outside of the leg and working around to the front. Repeat for the other leg.
8) Skin the neck and inner forelegs. By this time the hide should be completely shed.

, You will need to first separate the large intestine from the body and tie it off, then remove the penis if it's a steer or bull you are butchering, then continue with the removal of the rest of the internal organs, as follows.


1) Lower the animal so that you can work comfortably on the rear end of it.
2) Cut around the anus with a short, pointed knife, being very careful not to make any holes in the intestine, as that could contaminate the meat. This anal area is known as the bung.
3) Pull the bung out slightly or enough that you can tie it off. Unless you know your knots and can make a slip-knot prior to pulling it out, you may need a helper to hold the rectum as you tie it off.
4) If the animal is male, cut out the penis before slicing through the belly.
5) Cut down the belly, cutting from the inside out, working your way down from the udder/scrotal area to the sternum. Use your other hand to hold the viscera away from the point of the knife, cutting through the belly fat as you go.
6) Place a large container underneath to catch the viscera, as by now they would be bulging out of the body.
7) Cut through the fat surrounding the offal and sever any tissue that connects offal to the back of the abdominal cavity. Pull the bung through to the inside of the cavity then out through the slit made to access the internal organs. Take your time separating the intestines from the cavity since you don't want to spill the contents into the carcass. Also be careful to not rupture the bladder.
8) Pull the intestines and bladder out of the body, as well as the stomachs since it should also be free by now too. Reach in and down to lift it all out into the container, severing the remaining flesh and connective tissue connecting the stomachs (also called the paunch) to the body cavity. This includes severing the esophagus from the stomach at the point where it goes through the diaphragm.

If there are some innards that you want to keep, you'll want to get a separate ""keeper"" bowl to put them in. This would include the kidneys and liver. The kidneys should be removed after the intestines are taken out, as well as the abdominal fat that can be cut up and fed to the chickens (if you have any). Remove the liver and place it in the bowl along with the kidneys.


9) Cut out the diaphragm and remove the heart and lungs. To do this you need to grasp the heart and lungs and pull forward and downward, cutting the large blood vessel attached to the backbone. You should be able to remove the heart and lungs with the esophagus and trachea attached. You will need to sever the connective tissue between them if you want to keep the heart along with the liver and kidneys.

You may need to squeeze the heart a bit to get any blood out that may have not been completely pumped out.


You should inspect the offal to see if there are any abnormalities that may affect the quality of the meat. If you're not sure what to look for, it may be best to get a large-animal veterinarian out to do the postmortem inspection for you.

, Start by sawing through the sacral vertebrae from the inside and the cartilage that joins the pelvic bone. As soon as the pelvic area is cut through you can saw from the back, but some prefer to keep sawing through the back since the vertebrae is much easier to see in the front than the back, especially if the animal has a lot of back fat. Continue sawing to the neck. Cut down through the center of the brisket to cut the ribcage in half.


You should consider splitting the carcass into quarters to handle the carcass a bit easier. Cut between the 12th and 13th rib, and leave the 13th rib intact to allow air to circulate over the kidney knob and prevent bacterial growth if additional hanging time is needed.

, You may have to trim any soiled, bruised or bloodied pieces of flesh off as well.

, How long to age depends on the air temperature, fat covering and desired flavour. Most should hang the carcass to age for seven to five days (some say two weeks), longer if aging is done during the colder conditions and if there's more fat on the carcass. If the carcass is entirely covered in fat then it is recommended to hang longer than 10 days.


A good way to tell if you have the meat aging at the right temperature is if the temperature of the round (the hind-quarter) and other thick parts are lowered to 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 4 degrees Celsius) within 24 hours after slaughter.
Hang the carcass in an area where off-odors will not be absorbed and do not exist. Odors like manure, gas, paint or musty odors can be readily absorbed by the carcass.
The hanging area should, in addition to cool and dry, also be dust-free, odor-free and relatively sterile.

Set up a double boiler.,
Put a clean thermometer in the top pan.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Pour the raw milk into the inner pan.,
Heat while stirring.,
Watch the temperature closely.,
Cool the milk rapidly in the ice bath.,
Clean and sanitize containers.,
Store in the refrigerator.,
Upgrade to specialized tools.",How to Pasteurize Milk," Fill a large pan with about 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of water. Place a slightly smaller pan in the water, ideally without the bases touching. This setup lowers the risk of scorching and burnt flavors., You'll want to track the temperature constantly, so a floating dairy thermometer or a clip-on candy thermometer works best. Wash the thermometer in hot, soapy water first, then rinse. Ideally, sanitize the thermometer by rubbing it with a single-use alcohol swab, then rinsing again.If your thermometer doesn't clip to the pan or float, you'll have to insert it by hand frequently during pasteurization. Work near a sink so you can clean and sanitize the thermometer again after every measurement.

, The faster you cool your milk after pasteurization, the safer and tastier it will be. Fill a sink or large tub with cold water and ice so you'll be ready to go.


An old-fashioned ice cream machine is especially effective. Pack the outer compartment in ice and rock salt as you would normally.Read the full instructions below before you set this up. After reading, you might decide to use the longer pasteurization process, in which case you'll want to keep the ice in the freezer for another half hour.

, Pour through a strainer if the milk hasn't been strained since it left the animal.For small home batches, it's easiest to pasteurize milk one gallon (3.8 liters) at a time.

, Place the double boiler over medium–high heat. Stir frequently to help equalize the temperature and prevent scorching.

, Make sure the thermometer probe is not touching the sides or base of the pot, or the measurement will be off. As the milk approaches the temperature listed below, stir constantly and draw milk from the bottom of the pan to eliminate hot and cold spots. There are two ways to pasteurize milk, both of them safe and USDA-approved:High Temperature Short Time (HTST)Faster, with less effect on taste and color.1. Bring the temperature to 161ºF (72ºC).
2. Keep it at or above this temperature for 15 seconds.
3. Remove from heat immediately.

Low Temperature Long Time (LTLT)Recommended for cheesemaking to avoid accidental overheating.1. Bring the temperature to 145ºF (63ºC).
2. Keep the milk at or just above this temperature for 30 minutes. Restart the timer if the temperature drops below 145ºF.
3. Remove from heat.
, The faster you cool the milk, the better it will taste. Put it in the ice bath and stir frequently to help release heat. After a few minutes, replace some of the warming water with cold water or ice. Repeat this whenever the water warms — the more often, the better.The milk is ready once it reaches 40ºF (4.4ºC). This can take as long as forty minutes in an ice bath, or twenty minutes in an ice cream machine.


If the milk does not reach 40ºF (4.4ºC) within four hours, assume it has been recontaminated. Pasteurize it again and cool it more rapidly.

, Clean a milk container thoroughly with hot water and soap before using. For best results, sterilize a heat-safe container after cleaning by submerging it in hot water (at least 170ºF / 77ºC) for 30 to 60 seconds.


Let the container air dry. Using a cloth towel can reintroduce bacteria.

, Pasteurization only kills 90 to 99% of bacteria in the milk. You still need to refrigerate the milk to prevent the bacteria population from growing to unsafe levels. Seal the container tightly and keep it away from light.Pasteurized milk without further treatment typically lasts 7–10 days if you pasteurize soon after milking. The milk will go bad sooner if stored above 45ºF (7ºC), if new contamination is introduced (for instance by touching it with a dirty spoon), or if the raw milk was not stored correctly before pasteurization., If you have your own animals and pasteurize a lot of milk, consider buying a dedicated milk pasteurizing machine. A machine can pasteurize larger batches and may do a better job preserving the milk's flavor. ""Batch"" or LTLT (low temperature long time) machines are the cheapest and simplest, but HTST (high temperature short time) machines are faster and usually have less effect on taste.The milk still needs to cool rapidly for the pasteurization to work. Remember to transfer the milk to a cold water bath if your machine doesn't include this step.
The HTST machine tends to break down (denature) fewer proteins, as long as it doesn't heat above 172ºF (77.8ºC). This gives more consistent results when the milk is used for cheese."

Take a hay ride or wagon ride as part of your tour.",How to Visit a Dairy Farm," Some dairy farms operate as large-scale factories whereas others are smaller and produce fewer dairy products.Tours offer various activities geared towards both children and adults. Think about your interests. Do you want to see how massive amounts of milk is produced, or are you more interested in petting the animals? Do you want to taste products like milk and ice cream, or are you just looking for a nice day outdoors?


If you’re planning a visit for a school group, think about what would be most valuable for the students. If you’ve been studying animals, for example, find a dairy farm that has animals other than cows for the children to interact with. Plan some pre-trip and post-trip lessons that weave the real-life experience into your curriculum.
Consider an overnight stay. Some dairy farms offer overnight stays as leisure or educational trips.These trips are longer and more expensive, but may be worth the extra effort depending on your needs.;
, Do some research. A quick internet search yields several dairy farm websites with comprehensive information about what is offered. Many websites include a phone number to call with any questions about scheduling and other logistics. Compare the prices, tour offerings, and available tour dates of different farms in your area.


Look into several farms. If one farm doesn’t offer what you want, ask them if they know about any other farms in the area.

, Set a date for your tour and call the dairy farm to schedule a visit. Larger farms have headquarters or a main office that you can call. Smaller farms are typically run out of the owners' homes. You may not be able to reach them until after dark and all the chores are completed.


Get a head count before you call. The dairy farm will want to know how many people will be visiting. Farms sometimes have different rates depending on the size of your group. Prices also vary by age. Babies are usually free and seniors and children might get a discount. Some farms even offer free tours to active service individuals.The cost of a tour ranges depending on the farm, your area, and what is offered on the tour. A full tour can range from $5 to $10 per person.Remember that not all tours are the same. Find out how long the tour will last, what you will see, what extras are included, and what kinds of extra costs you might incur for animal feeding or food tasting.

, Wear comfortable, casual clothing. Skip the glamorous look-- you don’t want to worry about staying clean while you pet the cows. You may walk through grass, mud, and animal droppings on your tour, so wear shoes that you don’t mind getting a bit dirty. They should also ideally have closed toes, as you may be walking close to animals and machines and you’ll want your feet protected. Rubber boots with hard soles that do not stain easily are best.Keep in mind that farms may not let you on tour if you’re dressed inappropriately.
Dress for the weather. Check the weather before you go. The weather might be quite different depending on how far you are driving from home. Bring a good rain jacket or a sweater if there is a chance of rain.
If you are going with a school group, let the students know what the weather will be like on the day of the trip. Remind the students to wear layers if the weather will fluctuate between cool and warm.

, The dairy farm is a great location to pause for a few moments and enjoy an outdoor meal. Take a break from the tour and enjoy your surroundings. Snack time is a good moment to think of a few questions to ask your tour guide!


Some farms offer food for purchase. Ask about the available options when you schedule your tour. Try out fresh ice cream, cheeses, or other prepared dairy products for lunch.
Have students to bring a packed lunch. Although there might be snacks offered on the tour, students should still bring a full lunch. Decide if you will allow students to purchase lunch on the farm. If so, remind them to bring enough money for a satisfying lunch.

, Remember that you might be outside for a good part of the day. Farms tend to have large open spaces where you will be exposed to direct sunlight. Wear a hat to cover your face and use sunscreen if you are prone to sunburn.Bring extra sunscreen if you are traveling with students. Students may forget to apply sunscreen before leaving home, so it is best to have some on-hand at the farm.

, Many bugs live in rural areas and farmlands. Pack some form of bug spray or insect repellent to avoid going home with itchy bites. Bug spray is especially helpful if you plan to wear shorts or stay overnight. Apply the repellant to exposed skin before you go on the tour., Your tour guide will tell you about the schedule on a dairy farm, general tasks that are regularly completed, and other chores that must be done. You may even be able to sample some tasks, such as cleaning a stall or throwing hay to a cow. Listen carefully and think of some fun questions for the tour!


If you are traveling with a school group, consider having your students prepare questions before the trip. Preparing questions is a good pre-trip activity that increases student engagement. Once on the farm, the students can ask their questions and evaluate how the farm compared with their expectations.

, Milking cows is an essential part of life on a dairy farm.After the farmer demonstrates how a cow is milked, they may ask for a volunteer. Be ready to participate and try it out. Milking a cow can be difficult to get the hang of at first, but it is a lot of fun. Grip the cow's udder and carefully work your way down the teat until a stream of milk comes out.

, Many dairy farms sell cheese or milk products on site. Even if they don't, you may have an opportunity to try unpasteurized milk or cheese the family has made from the milk the cows produced.


Be aware of any allergies. Avoid dairy products if you have a milk allergy or are lactose intolerant. If you are with children, ask their parents about any dairy sensitivities. Milk allergies can range from mild to fatal, so keep a close eye on children who have reported allergies., Often, dairy farm visits include a ride in a vehicle driven by a farmer that allows guests to get in the farm spirit. A hay ride is usually a wagon or trailer with seats provided by bales of straw. Riders sit on the straw bales and are transported to one location from another.

Tie the cow to a stable fixture.,
Approach the cow slowly.,
Clean the teats with soapy water or iodine.,
Dry the teats before milking.",How to Milk a Cow1," Make sure the cow is wearing a halter, and tie the lead end to a sturdy post or other immovable beam. Tie the cow in a low-stress, quiet environment. If cows are anxious or afraid, the milking process will be more difficult and unpleasant for both you and the animal.If you are working on a farm that has a stanchion (a wooden box-like structure used for securing a cow’s head so that it can be milked, vaccinated, or branded), you can effectively secure the cow.
Sophisticated stanchions will have a bar or lever on the side that will gently clamp wooden or metal slats around the cow’s neck and hold it immobile. More rudimentary stanchions may need to be fastened with a crossbeam or piece of wire.;
, When moving near to clean the udder, speak in a low voice and gently pat her side so that she knows where you are. Don’t make any sudden movements. The idea is to let her know where you are. If you surprise her, she may panic and kick you or step on you.

Tying the cow’s tail to her leg will prevent her from swishing you with it. Tail hair does not tie well, and it will come loose after a few minutes.

, During the course of a day, the cow’s teats will become covered in grass, hay, and dirt. Wash the teats before you begin milking to prevent soil—and any bacteria that it may contain—from contaminating the milk.Washing with warm water may help coax or “bring down” the milk.

, Do not milk the cow if her teats are still wet, because the soap and water may drip down into the milk bucket and contaminate the milk.Dry the teats using a clean, soft cotton cloth.


As you dry them, don’t scratch or irritate the teats. They are sensitive, and the cow may jerk or try to kick you if you cause any pain.

Next phase.",How to Slaughter Cattle3," These pens, usually holding around 20 to 50 cattle in each, are such that they separate the various grades and even coat color of cattle that have to go through the slaughter facility. This is so that it makes it easier for the personnel in the slaughter plant to grade various carcasses that go through.

The pens are also a way for them to undergo ante-mortem (before death) inspection by licensed veterinarians. This is to detect any evidence of disease or any abnormal condition that would indicate a particular animal is diseased. If any such animal is found, a metal ear-tag is placed so as to give special postmortem scrutiny.

If there is definite and conclusive evidence that, in the antemortem examination, the animal is not fit for human consumption, it is condemned and no postmortem exam is necessary.



, It's important that cattle are herded and kept in a calm state to not affect the quality of the meat. Cattle that are in a state of anxiety or panic will have darker-colored meat (called ""dark-cutters""), than cattle that are calm and relatively relaxed., This cradle is specially designed to block the animal's view from what's going on outside of the cradle, restrain it, enable the person above to stun it, drop the side to release the stunned or killed animal to shackle one or both of the hind legs, and complete the rest of the slaughtering and dressing process.

The box is open above and the sides are high enough so that the animal cannot see over even if they try to raise their head. The right side of the box chute is released and let down to free the stunned animal once the killing/stunning process is complete. This allows access to the legs so that they can be shackled. More on this in later steps.
In addition, there is a solid-sided gate at the rear of the box stall so that the cattle behind the one that is being killed do not see what is going on in front of them. This is so that they remain calm and quiet.

, The captive bolt gun (also named cap-bolt, cap-bolt gun, cap-bolt stunner or captive bolt stunner) is the primary tool that is used to stun and kill cattle in a commercial slaughter plant. This device uses a steel rod that is driven instantly into the forehead of the animal. The gun is placed in the middle of the forehead, never between the eyes, to effectively kill the animal instantly.


The steel rod from the captive bolt gun is driven by compressed air or a blank cartridge, and is retracted and reset for the next animal.

The cap-bolt gun will remain effective if maintained properly. Cartridges should be stored in a dry place and the steel rod cleaned regularly. The gun itself must also be cleaned to ensure it induces instantaneous death to the animal it is used on.


Veal calves are often killed with carbon dioxide.

, The side panel of the cradle drops down to allow access to the animal's legs. Chains are shackled to their hind legs and attached to a hook in the conveyor system that hoists the animal up. The stunned bovine then travels to the proceeding areas to be bled out, skinned, gutted and halved.

, A very sharp knife is used in this process: the point of the knife cuts into the animal's throat and cuts through the dewlap, trachea, esophagus and jugular vein immediately below the jaw-line to allow the blood to flow out. The cut can be made perpendicular or parallel to the neck, depending on what the standards are of the slaughter plant. Animals are bled out before being dressed because it prevents blood from coagulating in the tissues and thus making the meat go rancid.

, The hind shanks are skinned and removed at the hocks: beef hooks are inserted between the gam cord (which is the tendon that runs from the tip of the hock (tuber calcaneus) up to the tibia) and the tibia, freeing the chain on one of the hind legs that had been used to hoist up the animal. The hide is opened along the median line of the belly and is removed from the belly and sides. Down-pullers are used for removing the rest of the hide, including skinning the head.


This method greatly increases the efficiency of skinning and the yields of headmeat/cheekmeat.

, The head is not severed from the carcass until the hide is completely removed. Until then the legs, head, breast and aitch (rump) bones are split from the carcass by sawing or by using a mechanical saw similar to a chainsaw, except it's built for cutting cleanly through bone, not wood.

, All internal organs are removed except the kidneys. The anus is cut out, and the offal is dumped out into a cart or barrel to be hauled away.

Most slaughter plants do not find it cost effective to discard the offal, legs, head, blood or hide to the landfill. A large number of facilities sell the waste material to various butcher shops or other factories that use the remains for various users from cosmetics to car seats, home insulation and material for paving roads.

, If the plant is under federal inspection (USDA-FDA in the United States or CFIA in Canada), the carcass and viscera are examined by a federally licensed veterinarian hired by the FDA or CFIA at this stage in the slaughtering process. Since the head is cut from the neck, the brain and brain stem also needs to be examined for signs of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy).


In the United States and Canada, the brain, spinal column, eyes, and other organs that are most likely to hold prions that cause BSE are discarded as SRMs or Specified Risk Material and never put into the food chain for either livestock or humans.

, The carcass is split through the centre of the backbone and the tail is removed. The spinal cord also needs to be removed during this process and discarded, since, as mentioned above, is designated as Specified Risk Material.

, The split carcasses or halves are washed with cold water using a pressure-washer, and let to dry.

, The halves, after slaughtering is complete, are sent to a cooler room where they are kept at a temperature of around 34 degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum of 24 hours. Often carcasses are left in the cooler for two to three weeks to allow the meat to cure before it is cut up or ""ribbed"" into various cuts of beef.

, Once the carcasses have cured, butchering will commence. Please the How to Butcher Cattle page for more information.

"
Protect or lubricate your hands.,
Strip each teat three or four times.,
Place a bucket underneath the udder.,
Sit or squat on the cow’s right side.,
Wrap a hand around two of the four teats.,
Squeeze down to push out the milk.,
Milk until the quarter that you’re milking looks deflated.,
Move on to milk the other two teats.",How to Milk a Cow2," Your hands can carry bacteria, which may be harmful if transmitted to the cow. To keep both you and the cow healthy, and to avoid scratching the cow’s udder with rough hands, put on a pair of latex gloves before you start milking.If you prefer not to use gloves, apply a lubricant such as Vaseline to your hands to minimize friction.


Some people prefer to use udder cream (also called udder balm or udder butter) to lubricate the cow’s udder. Like Vaseline, udder cream will reduce friction during milking. You can purchase udder cream at any farm or ranch supply store.

, “Stripping” is the process of pulling down a cow’s teat (using a normal milking grip) in order to pass any dirt, bacteria, or other debris from the milk ducts.Do not catch the milk from stripping in the milk bucket, as it is generally not clean and should not be consumed., This will catch the milk that you squeeze from the udder.Better yet, hold the bucket between your legs. It takes practice, but this can be done easily and comfortably. This position reduces the chance of the cow kicking over the pail of milk.


Some cows only stand still if they’re given grain or hay to munch on while you go about your business. If your cow is demanding, keep an eye on her food. Be ready to replenish it, or else she’ll let you know she wants more by becoming restless and difficult to work with.

, Seat yourself in a position that will allow you to move away quickly if the cow becomes uncooperative. If you sit on a stool to milk the cow, position it very close to the cow. Your body should be very close to the cow—practically underneath it—so that there is as little distance as possible between the bucket and udder.Sitting cross-legged on the ground is not safe, as the cow could easily step on or kick you.

, Choose diagonal teats (front left and rear right, for example). Or, try the front teats first, then the back pair.Begin milking by gently clamping (almost pinching) each teat between your extended thumb and first finger, so that the teat fills your palm as you squeeze down., As you press down on the teat, maintain your grip on the base of the teat so that the milk doesn’t flow back up into the udder. Do not jerk or yank the teats. This motion is performed by sequentially squeezing your fingers from the middle to the pinky to force the milk out. Be gentle yet firm., Often even looking at the quarter just milked can tell you if it’s been emptied enough or not. Whereas a full udder will appear tight and be firm to the touch, an emptied quarter of the udder will look saggy and wrinkled, and feel much softer and more malleable. Experienced farmers can feel the udder to know exactly when all the milk has come down.After you’ve milked one quarter, repeat the motion with your other hand on the adjacent quarter. Most people prefer to alternate (right hand, left hand, right hand, etc.) The downward squeezing motion takes less effort doing it in alternate steps than all at the same time.

, If you began by milking the two teats on the right-hand side of the cow, you’ll need to pick up your stool and move to the cow’s left side to access the left two teats. If you used the diagonal method, switching sides is not necessary.


Watch your feet when moving near the cow. A cow often weighs over 1,000 lbs (450 kg). If she steps on your foot, those 1,000 lbs will hurt quite a bit, and could break your foot.

"
"
Rub her udder.,
Pat her udder.,
Bump her udder.,
Repeat the above steps a few more times.",How to Encourage Milk Let Down in a Cow1," Once she is in her milking area, just rub, up and down her udder, around the teats, and possibly massage the teats as well (optional, not necessary). Do this for at least 30 seconds.;
, Pat it on the bottom, on the sides, etc. Find the spot she likes best, and that will increase the chances of milk let down. Do this for at least 10 seconds, after rubbing her udder.

, Don't be rough, but gently bump the bottom of her udder 4-5 times.

, Then you should be ready to milk!

"
"
Choose the dairy breed.,
Consider purchasing a mature lactating dairy cow.,
Do your research on what cattle are currently available for sale.,
Purchase the cow.,
Keep up with routine milking and feedings.,
Have a breeding schedule for her.,
Maintain shelter.,
Maintain her health.",How to Choose and Have a Family Dairy Cow," There are many breeds to consider in order to have your own family milk cow. Make your choices based on the amount of feed you're willing to spend on, quantity of milk produced, the size of your farm, temperament, what's available in your area, what size of cow you can handle, among other things.;
, This is the easiest way to start the home dairy, rather than buying a heifer that you must raise, train and breed before you get any milk out of her. Purchase of a yearling dairy heifer will mean you having to wait at least a year until you get some milk from her. You are much better off getting dairy cow that's already trained, is gentle, easy to handle, and milk.

, Avoid auction barns if you can if you don't want to rescue a cull dairy cow that may have health problems down the road you don't want to deal with. Consider possibly buying a mature cow right from a dairy farm willing to part one of their good cows, or from a small-time dairy.


Make sure she has been vaccinated recently. If she hasn't, check with your local large animal veterinarian for a vaccination schedule you should have for your cow.
You will need to determine if the cow you purchased is bred or open (not bred or pregnant). This way you can decide if and when to get her bred next or if she needs to be bred at all. Dairy cows can still be lactating regardless if they are in calf or not. If the seller does not know if she is pregnant nor how far along she is, get her preg-checked either via rectal palpation or blood-test. A veterinarian can do this for you.

, Once you've made your decision on whether the cow you've picked out is good for you and your farm, then it's time to spend the money and bring her home.

, You can choose to milk her once a day or twice a day; it's your choice. Feed her the same time you milk her, but if you want you can choose to split the feedings to twice a day to break up the amount of feed she needs to be given per day. Fresh clean water and proper mineral needs to be made available to her at all times.

, You may want to consider times to give her a rest for a couple months before she calves and times when it's best to get her bred. She should be bred two to three months after giving birth to a calf. She can be allowed to milk for 10 months or so. Dairy cows can be lactating for much longer, but the optimum milk production you can get from a cow is during that 10 month time period.

, A barn or shed with a stanchion should have been put in place before you purchased your cow. There's nothing worse than having to milk a cow in the rain or out in the hot sun: the cow won't enjoy it, and neither will you.

, Proper feed, regular vaccinations, proper mineral and knowledge in how to prevent certain diseases that you cannot vaccinate for (such as milk fever, grass/winter tetany, ketosis, mastitis and bloat) will keep your cow healthy and productive for more years to come.

"
Establish the total area of your dairy farm.,
Determine the number of dairy cattle that the grazing area can legally support.,
Multiply the number of cattle that you can house by the basic individual monthly animal maintenance costs.

,
Itemize the equipment that you will need to lease or purchase.,
Estimate your non-livestock monthly operating costs.,
Check with your local government to find out if it has any licensing fees related to starting a dairy farm.,
Request insurance quotes.",How to Calculate the Cost of Starting a Dairy Farm," Total area includes pasture land or grazing area, fields for growing crops, corrals for holding cattle in the winter seasons, buildings including barns, sheds and housing, and areas for storing feed and manure. This can be the most important step when you calculate the cost of starting a dairy farm because of how it affects your other costs. Virtually all of your other costs from machinery and capital to feed and veterinary care will be based off of the number of animals that you can house on the property.


You will need to know your fixed, variable, operating, and depreciation costs. Fixed costs include rent; variable costs include fuel, feed, fertilizer, cattle prices for selling culls and bull calves, maintenance for machinery, etc.; operating costs include costs of feeding cows, milk production, veterinary bills, feed bills, etc.; depreciation costs include machinery, building, livestock, and equipment.;
, Many areas have local governmental guidelines that mandate the maximum number of hoofed animals that are allowed per acre of grazing land. Some countries like Canada also require a quota to be purchased before or during the start-up process.


The cost per head (or per animal) will vary slightly (usually less than 10 percent) depending on the ""line"" or family history of the animals that you are considering purchasing. You can get a baseline value of dairy cattle in your areas by visiting the local livestock auction.
Multiply the number of animals that you can house by the median sale price to arrive at the estimated cost of purchasing your dairy herd.

Feed is one cost to consider. The amount of feed each animal will require is dependent on the climate and whether you are feeding straight grain, sweet feed, or a combination of grain and grass or hay. Your local feed supplier will be able to help you prepare a diet specific to your region and give you an estimated monthly price per head.

,, Remember to include milking machines, sterilizing machines and milk storage tanks as well as computers and other office equipment.


Veterinary care is another cost to consider. Most dairy farms utilize a combination of inoculations or vaccinations, hormone injections and supplements to maximize the milk production. You should also anticipate injuries and illness. Your local veterinarian will be able to supply you with the specific items required for your region and the cost per head of each item as well as a rough estimate of emergency care costs.
If you live in a country where injecting hormones into dairy cows to increase production is outlawed (such as in Canada and the United Kingdom), this is one less thing to consider as far as veterinary care is concerned.

Turn on the milking machine.,
Hand-milk each teat a few times to let down the milk.,
Release the machine’s pressure and place each suction device on each teat.,
Leave the milking device on for 5–7 minutes.,
Turn off the device’s suction.,
Clean the cow’s udder.",How to Milk a Cow3," The machine will need to be running for a few minutes before you begin milking the cow, in order to build pressure. Use this time to secure your cow and wash and dry her udder.

, This process is known as “stripping,” and, in addition to encouraging milk to flow from the cow’s teats, will squirt out any dirt or bacteria that has built up in the cow’s teat.Consequently, the milk produced from stripping should not be squirted into the bucket, or it may contaminate the rest of the milk. Let it fall onto the ground.

, As soon as you release the pressure buildup on the milking machine, suction begins. As quickly as possible, place each suction cup over one of the cow’s four teats. As milk begins to flow from the teats into the suction device, adjust the devices so that they hang straight down from the udder.Some cows lift their back leg and kick over the bucket or knock off the suction devices. Keep the handle positioned so you can grab the bucket should she decide to kick the bucket.

, Wait until the machine draws all of the milk out of the udder, which will become flaccid. All cows are a little different, but most will be fully milked out within 5 minutes.Due to udder differences or teat structural problems, some cows will take more than 7 minutes to be fully milked. Keep an eye on the milking device, and make sure that milk is still flowing. As soon as milk stops flowing, remove the device.

, Then remove the suction devices from the teats. The order is important: if you try to remove the milking device while suction is still on, you risk causing pain to the cow and damaging the sensitive tissue around her teats.Many modern milking machines do not require the person milking the cow to manually remove the suction cups. Once one quarter has been milked dry, they automatically fall off, one by one.
Be careful not to trip over the milking machine’s tubes or wires as you move around the milking area.

, Cows’ teats are vulnerable to bacteria and infection immediately after having been milked, and should be cleaned and protected. The most efficient method of protecting a cow’s teats is to apply a post-milking disinfectant. This dark, thick liquid coats each of the cow’s four teats and prevents bacteria from entering.Cows often like to eat after they’ve been milked, so provide the cow with fresh grass or hay.

Consult a licensed veterinarian in your area for any medical issue with your cow.,
Look for symptoms of the cause.,
If proper treatment goes well, the cow will be able to stand back up on her own with a little encouragement.",How to Get a Downer Cow Back up After She Naturally Delivered a Very Large Calf," This information is not intended to be used as a guide for diagnosis or treatment. It is merely for owner education. Do not attempt to treat your animal without vet involvement.;
, A downed cow immediately following calving, is most likely suffering from either obturator nerve paralysis, or milk fever. It is also possible, though unlikely that she is suffering from a broken bone, or another more rare condition.



Obturator nerve paralysis occurs when the obturator nerve--a nerve that runs along each side of the pelvic cavity in the floor of the vagina and controls the adduction of the thigh muscles in the cow's hind legs--is pinched by the birth of a large calf, resulting in swelling and causing neuromuscular dysfunction in the adductor thigh muscles of the cow's hind leg(s). Nerve paralysis of this nature is very common in cows after a long birth in which the cow tried to have a calf without assistance and the calf remained in the vagina too long, or after a hard pull and could not nor has not stood since delivery. Her hind legs may possibly be splayed outward in an unnatural angle because of this inability to pull her legs inwards to sit comfortably or even stand.

Your vet will treat the cow with appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs and possibly Vitamin E and Selenium to speed the healing process. Your vet may also encourage you to get the cow up as soon as possible, either by encouragement or hip-lifters and straps, to help speed the healing process. Hobbles on the hind legs to prevent them from splaying out or causing more damage if she tries to get up on her own are highly recommended while she is recovering.
Often when the swelling goes down around the nerve the cow will recover and be able to get up on her own without any assistance. Some cows, however, if left for too long, may never recover and will need to be humanely euthanized.



Milk Fever (also referred to as Hypocalcemia ) is caused by the rapid mobilization of calcium to the mammary gland following calving, resulting in decreased calcium content in bodily tissues (hence the scientific name). She cannot remove enough calcium from her bones quick enough to counter this sudden shift, and neuromuscular weakness, dysfunction and paralysis soon follow.

Affected cows are often seen staggering around as though drunk and may fall. Fallen cows can be so weak that they cannot get up, and if left untreated, become dull and sleepy looking (heads are often turned back towards the rear), drifting into unconsciousness, shock, then death.
Cows that are down (but not out) need to be treated immediately and appropriately with calcium solution. Consult a vet immediately: it is always in the cow's best interest to him/her do this for you because intravenous injection, if done inappropriately, can cause cardiac disturbance and subsequent death.


Other causes of a downer cow after parturition are possible, but less likely. Always consult a vet to rule out other causes and determine appropriate treatment.

, Cows that can get up after going down and not getting up is always a good sign of progress!

  Make preparations before moving the bull into the squeeze.,
Handle, move and confine the bull to a head-gate or squeeze chute.,
Measure the scrotal circumference.,
Glove up.,
Insert your hand into the bull's anus.,
Feel around for the seminal glands of the bull, at the same time making room for the rectal probe to be inserted in.,
Prepare and insert the anal probe.,
Have a helper push onto the tail to keep the probe in place.,
Man the control box to start stimulating ejaculation of the bull.,
Put the semen collector up to the bull's penis.,
Analyze the semen and sperm under the microscope.,
Record the necessary information about the bull and the results from the semen testing.,
Base your decisions about the bull's fertility and let the owner know about the results.,
Free the bull from the head-gate.,
Clean equipment after the testing is complete.",How to Collect Semen from a Bull for a Breeding Soundness Exam," This means doing the following:


Plug in the control box to an electrical outlet
Place the control box near the center of the holding or squeeze chute (on the outside of the chute, never the inside) in a dry area.
Plug in the cord that connects the control box to the anal probe, and place it near the box
Take the collection cup near the control box and make sure it has the plastic collection bag with a test tube attached to it, then place it near the control box.
Readying the lube, fingerless obstetrical shoulder-length glove and non-sterile latex glove, scrotal tape and paperwork to be done as the BBSE is being performed;
,  The chute itself must be able to open up at the bottom to be able to collect semen as the bull ejaculates into the semen collector.  The head gate should be wide enough that it confines the bull's head, but doesn't cut off circulation to his body. As you move the bull into the chute, this is a good time to have a look at his conformation (especially the way he walks), and make a visual assessment of his body condition.

,  This usually will tell you, based on the bull's breed and age, whether he has good fertility or not. It's common knowledge among most cattle producers that a bull with large testicles will pass on high fertility to his daughters.

,  Put on an obstetrical shoulder-length glove on your dominant arm or arm you plan to use to insert into the bull's anus, and pour lubricant into the palm of your gloved hand.

,  Form your hand into a kind of puppet the same way you would when performing rectal palpations on cows (thumb tucked under your fingers, extended so it touches the tips of your fore and middle fingers, and all four fingers also extended out but closed together), and slowly push into the anus, keeping your wrist and arm straight.

,  There are three main glands that are found in a bull, just like in a human male: the prostate, cowper's gland and seminal glands.  These glands should not feel irregular in anyway, such as feeling harder than usual, have abnormal lumps, etc.

,  You should have a helper ready the probe by lubricating it along its length and holding it ready for you to insert it into the anus of the bull.  The two lighter-shaded stripes on the probe need to be facing downward, and the point of the probe going in to the bull's anus. As you pull your hand out of the anus of the bull, insert the point of the probe into the anus and keep pushing it in until it reaches the handle.

, The handle (silver part) needs to be between the anus and the tail, and the tail pushed up against the handle portion to keep the probe from popping out as the bull is ""forced"" to ejaculate through electrical stimulation.

, It takes a bit of practice and a ""special touch"" to be able to get a bull to ejaculate for you, but you must remember to not turn the electrical control up too high, nor too low.  It should be high enough to get the bull to react to it (the first few electrical stimulating enough to get the bull to tense his body up and move forward into the headgate, but not  vocalize in a way that it's causing him pain), and to encourage the penis to protrude from the sheath with an erection. Reduce the amperage to allow him a brief rest, then crank it up again.  Each increase and decrease in amperage cycle should last one second. 

, Place it far enough so that the tip of the penis is near the entrance to the test-tube end of the collection bag. Continue stimulation until the bull ejaculates about 7 ml (millilitres) of semen into the test tube. Have the helper leave the probe in until you've confirmed that you have a worthwhile sample to analyze, which follows in the proceeding steps.

, Take a sample of the ejaculate, place it on a microscope slide and stain it, then place it on the stage and have a look at the results through the eyepiece. Study the morphology and mobility of the sperm and count the number of sperm you have on the slide. If the first slide reveals nothing (no sperm to view), then you must repeat the process (Step 9) again. If it reveals enough to work with, then get your helper to pull the probe from the bull. You will also need to make one or two more samples to analyze so that you don't end up with any false positives or results that may warp the true results of the bull's semen test.

, This includes the owner's name and address, the breed of the bull, the bull's age, body condition score, conformation score (including reproductive organs, body and legs/feet), scrotal circumference, ejaculate volume, and sperm morphology, mobility and count.

, There are generally five classes to class a bull into: unsatisfactory, decision deferred, satisfactory, good and excellent. Most bulls are typically classed into the last three.  Young bulls are likely to get classed into ""decision deferred"" if their sperm is immature or if the bull still needs time to grow and mature before being tested again.  If the bull is classed into satisfactory, then the producer be pleased with the results, because generally that's as good as a bull can get.

, As soon as the semen testing is done, the bull is free to go back into the trailer or into the holding pen he came from before he was herded to the head gate to be tested.

, It's always important to have clean equipment every time a bull is tested so that you don't potentially invite sexually transmitted diseases such as Trichomoniasis from one bull to the other, or even harm the recipient bull in anyway from a dirty, caked probe.

See if there is a cow that is ready to calve.,
Find an inconspicuous spot where you can watch the cow.,
Find a comfortable place to sit, or bring a lawn chair.,
Wait and watch.,
Take pictures or video, if necessary.,
Once the cow is finished and the calf is on the ground, leave them alone.",How to Observe the Birth of a Calf,"  You can tell if she's really close to dropping a calf on the ground if there's a water sac hanging down or a couple of hooves sticking out from her vulva. More information on how to tell if a cow is ready to give birth can be seen in the article How to Tell if a Cow is About to Give Birth.;
,  She will usually go off by herself to give birth, so it's best to find a spot where you can watch her where she either won't see you, or you're far enough away that you're not disturbing her.  Be aware that you can never be in an area where she doesn't know you're there, because she will know, but will be too busy with the delivery of a new calf to bother with you.


If you are watching a cow calve in a barn, this still applies as a cow usually won't calve on her own if there are people actively watching or disturbing her.  It's just like with a woman giving birth--she certainly wouldn't appreciate it if she were giving birth to a baby with a bunch of onlookers gawking at her or disturbing her in some way.

,  Calving doesn't take a few seconds, it can take anywhere from around 30 minutes to several hours, so having a place to sit and relax while you wait is better than being sore from standing or squatting the whole time. 

, Cows have their own time to keep, and will never go by your time, so you will need to be patient, very quiet, and ever watchful.

,  It's always neat to see the pictures or video of a cow giving birth and sharing it with others, or reviewing it yourself.

,  As mentioned above, she will know that you're there, and there's a chance that she may not mother up to the calf right away as needed if you disturb her, even if you think you are not."

Choose your cow: There are many suitable breeds of cows that can be used for milking.,
Care taking: Like all animals, your cow needs food, water, shelter and space enough to move around at her free will.,
Health: Your cow can and will get sick, it's only a matter of when.,
Feeding: Grass, with loose mineral freely accessible to her, is sufficient enough to feed her over the spring and summer without any needed supplementation.,
Milking: It's important to milk her at least once a day.,
Breeding: In order to keep her producing milk, she must be bred to produce a calf.,
Pregnancy and Calving: Cows stay pregnant for a little over 9 months or ~285 days.,
Weaning her calf: Calves depend on their mother's milk for the first 3 months of their lives.",How to Keep a Milking Cow,"



Holstein Fresian: These cows are most commonly found in commercial dairy farms since they tend to produce the highest quantity of milk.

Jerseys: This breed is the second-most common dairy breed in North America, and is recognized for its high quantity of butterfat in the milk these cows produce. Jerseys are beautiful, gentle creatures (except for the bulls) and are relatively easier to manage and care for than Holsteins, though some Jerseys can be kickers when it comes to milking time.
Other common breeds to consider for personal dairying are Brown Swiss, Milking Devons, Milking Shorthorns, Dexters, Red Polls, Guernseys and Ayrshires.;
,


Depending on where you live, you will need adequate shelter for her to spend the night in and to go to during adverse weather conditions. A shed or barn is favorable for this. If you experience winters where its very cold and you get plenty of snow, you will need a barn to keep her sheltered during days where it's too cold for her to go out.
Water is a must, and must where she can easily access it 24/7/365.
Mineral licks or loose mineral is also very important for your cow, as the feed she eats is often deficient in different nutrients she needs to function properly.
You need a fence of some sort to keep her in at all times. It must be a fence that is strong and sturdy enough to keep her inside and keep her from escaping on you. If you have a sturdy fence that is well built and in top shape you will only need to check it once a week, not every day. If you have her grazing in an area where you have a temporary electric fence and need to keep her there for a few days, then you will have to check it once a day.

, Proper handling, vaccinations that are recommended by your large animal vet, and attention to detail when feeding her and having her graze pasture is important.


Several anti-quality factors may come up when she's on pasture, depending on the forage, the time of year she's grazing, and her reproductive period:

Grass that is rich and growing (with clover mixed in) may cause bloat; if the soil is magnesium deficient, she could get sick with Grass Tetany. When there are times of drought and a sudden frost, the forage that freezes or dies quickly from lack of moisture can increase in nitrate levels; when she eats these plants, there is risk of nitrate toxicity.


Other diseases and illness to watch out for range from digestive to reproductive, so talk to your vet if you have any questions or concerns about any potential illness and risks your cow may have.

You will know she is sick if she doesn't act or eat normally, decreases in milk production or has a temperature.



, Come winter, however, proper feed and supplementation is necessary. Straw is also necessary for bedding during cold nights. A cow's peak nutrition demands occur 3 months after giving birth.


Pasture is necessary during those times when the grass is growing and you don't need to feed her hay. Depending on your area, the general rule of thumb as far as stocking rate is concerned is 1 Animal Unit (1 x 1000 lb cow with or without a calf) per acre per month. See your local county extension office for more information on pasture stocking rates.
Winter feeding is the most costly and most important part of feeding your cow. Make sure she has adequate forage that will act as both maintenance for her body and enable her to keep producing milk for you. Have your hay tested (hay is a better forage to feed to dairy cows than straw) for nutrient levels, and if necessary, feed formulated for lactating dairy cows is also necessary.

Hay should be a primary diet for your cow. She should have good quality hay accessible to her at all times during times when she is not able to graze on pasture. A dairy ration (containing cereal grains and added nutrients) should only be kept at 2 to 5 lbs per day, since it is quite rich and can make her get fat more if you feed her too much. She may develop bloat, indigestion or even acidosis if you give her too much grain.



, Most people prefer to do the OAD (once a day) milking instead of the usual twice a day, since it gives them more time during the day to do things. You need to have a stanchion and/or stall with an area where she can be tied so she can't decide to move out on you all of a sudden. You also need to keep to a schedule, keep milking her the same time every day.


Milking by hand can be a bit tedious at first, but once you get a pattern going and know how to milk her it will become something to look forward to. If you don't know how to do it, get a local dairy farmer or dairy workhand to show you. You can also see the article here on WikiHow on How to Milk a Cow for tips.
It's best to have the milking done inside a barn because both you and the cow are out of the elements and it creates an environment that's a bit more enjoyable and relaxing for the both of you.
Feed should be put in front of the cow while milking her all the time since it keeps her distracted and her mind off of you milking her.
Keep her udder clean before you milk her. There's always going to be some bit of dirt sticking to her, and you don't want that in your milk!

,


If she has calved before, it's recommended to wait to breed her until 45 to 80 days have passed after she's given birth. This gives the uterus enough time to shrink back to normal and to allow her to go back into normal estrous cycling.
Before she gets pregnant, she needs to be bred. Artificial Insemination is one method of breeding her, though this requires attention to her heat cycles and when the best time is to have her AI'd.

Cows cycle once every 17 to 24 days, and the heat period lasts for 24 hours. She needs to be AI'd 12 hours after you see signs of heat from her.


Natural breeding is another way to get her pregnant. You will need a bull for this. When you only have one cow or two cows to care for, it is best to send them to a farm where another cattle farmer has a bull that is good enough to breed your cows. However, there is always risk that the bull may not be a calving-ease bull (or, a bull that has genetics for producing large calves, depending on the breed), or that the bull has reproductive disease like Trichomoniasis that could affect your cows. Jerseys, for instance, need to be bred to smaller calving-ease bulls like another Jersey bull or an Angus bull, because of their small size and inability to birth a large calf.

If you do choose to have your cows bred naturally, you will need to either rent a bull for a couple months to stay on your place, or to give them up for a couple months to send them to a farm to get them bred.

It is highly recommended you choose AI, since you do want to keep your milk cow at home and keep the milk supply she's been giving you for the past while.





, In that time, care must be taken that the cow has adequate feed to feed both herself and the calf.


As mentioned above, you need to dry her off 2 months prior to her calving date to give her a break and focus more of her energy into the growth of the fetus.
She will have an increasingly higher demand for more nutrition and feed by the time she is 3 to 4 months away from calving. Increase her feed ration gradually over that time, but be sure to decrease her calcium intake 10 days prior to calving to prevent her from getting milk fever after calving.
Keep an eye on her when her due date is very near and when she is showing signs of calving. She may need help calving out, but only help her when she is not progressing any further. Keep your veterinarian's phone number handy in case anything goes wrong.
When she has given birth, make sure the calf is alive, then leave them alone for a while, ensuring the cow still has feed and water available.

The calf needs colostrum, and it will be in the cow's system for the next 36 to 48 hours after birth.



, However, calves that are raised in dairies are usually taken away from their dams a day or two after birth. With your cow, however, you don't need to do this, but start, little by little, decreasing the calf's reliance on his/her dam's milk by the time he/she reaches a month old.


You can start creep-feeding the calf at this time by encouraging it to starting to eat Calf Starter feed, feeding the calf when you are milking the cow and only letting the calf to suckle after you've gotten what you needed from the cow. The calf should be fully weaned from his/her dam by the time he's 3 to 4 months of age.

Some people may choose to wean the calf cold-turkey by the time it reaches 3 to 4 months or even 6 months of age. Separating it from his mother, or using a Eezy-Wean spiked nose ring are two common methods you can use to wean the calf.

The calf can be kept as another dairy cow if it's a heifer, or castrated and fed for the freezer if it's a bull calf.

Consider the cost of feed.,
Gauge the cow’s temperament.,
Decide what you’ll use this cow for.,
Look at cull cows.",How to Choose a Good Dairy Cow Breed1," The bigger the cow is, the more you have to feed her. Although, a bigger cow may produce more milk, you don’t want a monthly feed bill that exceeds what you’re able to spend.Holsteins are the biggest eaters and will cost the most.
Brown Swiss cows are somewhere in the middle.
Jerseys are the smallest and need the least amount to eat.;
, What kind of cow do you think you can handle? Can you deal with nervous cows or would you need to have very docile ones? Take this into consideration when selecting a breed.Brown Swiss cows are the most docile dairy cows.
Holsteins tend to be a bit nervous.
Jerseys can be notorious kickers.

, If you are raising a cow to be part of a dairy farm, obviously milk production will be a crucial factor. On the other hand, if you only need enough milk for your family, you may not need such a high-production breed.


If you're looking to maximize milk production, Holsteins are the way to go.
If you're only wanting milk for you and your family, you may want to consider a cow that doesn't give as much milk (such as a Jersey).
Breeds that are dual-purpose (produce both milk and meat) may be ideal, but this will produce less milk overall.
You may also want a dairy cow for butter and cheese making. Jerseys and Brown Swiss produce milk higher in butterfat and protein content, making them ideal for cheese and butter making.

, Dairy cows that have been culled from conventional dairy operations are cheaper. However, such cows may have injuries, illnesses, or inability to breed back.If you are a dairy farmer just starting out, avoid these cull animals.
As a hobby farmer you may not mind the time, money and feed invested in rescuing and caring for one or two cull dairy cows.

Learn about Holsteins.,
Research Jerseys.,
Read about Brown Swiss cows.",How to Choose a Good Dairy Cow Breed2," Holstein cattle are classic black and white cows. They are by far the most popular dairy breed of all. Holsteins may be the most expensive animals (to purchase and to feed), but they are known for yielding the most milk.Holsteins make up 90% of all dairy cows in the US.
Although they are usually black and white, they can also be red and white.
They are very large, typically around 1500 lbs. (680 kg) and 58 inches (1.47 meters) tall.
They can thrive in a variety of settings.

, Jersey cattle are the smallest dairy cow breed, and may be a little easier on the pocket book. They are beautiful cows known for their solid brown color, wide-set eyes, and long eyelashes.They typically weigh around 1100 lbs. (499 kg).
Colors can range from light brown to almost black.
Jerseys tend to give milk higher in butterfat.

, Brown Swiss cows are a popular breed, known for their sturdiness. They produce a decent quantity of milk, stay in lactation longer than other breeds, and tend to have a long lifespan.They are usually light brown or grey/silver.
Brown Swiss cows usually weigh 1300 to 1400 lbs. (590-635 kg).
This is said to be the best milk for cheese.
They tend to have large calves and some cows may struggle with the first calf.

Contact a local auction house.

, Only female cattle—cows—produce milk, and only after they deliver a calf. You can choose a female cow in any stage of the reproductive process. The most expensive choice will be a young, high-producing cow. The cheapest will be a calf, but you have to feed it and raise it for a couple of years.Your options include:


A mature cow who has already calved.
A pregnant cow.
A heifer who will soon calve.
A calf (and raise it).

, When it comes time to purchase your cow, you essentially have two options: a private sale or an auction house. Whereas an auction house will sell only culled or slaughter animals, private sales will vary from seller to seller.

Your herd bull should also be one that will improve your herd, not disprove it, since he is worth half of your herd.;
, There are two types to choose from, and both can be integrated into another, if you so choose.

If your herd is too small to have a herd bull or do not want to have to deal with bulls, use artificial insemination to breed your herd.
If you have a herd of over 10 cows and do not want to go to the extra mile of having to watch females for estrus, a good herd bull is the way to go.

, Know when your cows go into estrus, when they're ready to breed, and go from there.

If you are using a herd bull, you will not need to worry about when your cows go into estrus, only when they have been bred for record keeping.
Follow the steps outlined in the article ""How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers"" to artificially inseminate your bovine females.

, Sometimes if you have one too many bulls for your herd, there may be more fighting than mating. Other times you may end up with a bull that has a broken penis, a leg/foot injury, or that just doesn't seem to be getting the job done.

Monitor the cows as well. If you see tails being held out or crooked tails when they're walking, that means they've been bred within the 24 to 48 hours you first noticed that physical sign.

Choose the best castrating method to use.,
Decide when to castrate your animals.,
What age is best to castrate?",How to Castrate Bulls and Bull Calves1," The most important thing before you start castrating your cattle is to find out and think about what method you should use and/or are most comfortable with, according to what their stomach can handle and how sensitive they are to the animal's well being.


With these in mind, run through the pros and cons of each practice. Here's a list to consider.


Advantages to banding:

Bloodless (no blood is lost when banding or crushing the cords through the scrotal wall)
Less chance of infection occurring because no open wounds are created
More painless than cutting because the area quickly numbs after the band is put on: there is a little discomfort, but it goes away after a while.
Quick and easy to do if done properly
No risk of maggot infestation if done during the fly season
Cutting off blood supply enables the testes and scrotum to gangrene and fall off on their own



Disadvantages to banding:

Mistakes can happen: put the rubber ring around the teste instead of the cord, one testicle is only banded because the other hasn't descended yet, ring is too brittle and comes off sooner than the scrotum starts to atrophy, etc.
A little painful during the application, but the area goes numb very quickly soon after.
Tetanus shot may be required as there is risk of infection as the scrotum atrophies and sloughs off.



Advantages to cutting:

Easy to see that two testes are present
Quick and a highly common practice used among ranchers
Great way to collect enough calf testes to make some Rocky Mountain or Prairie Oysters!



Disadvantages to cutting:

Risk of blood loss, infection and maggot infestation
Cannot be performed during fly season
Knife may not be sterilized, inducing infection
Cutting the cord may not be done properly increasing the chance of blood loss for the animal
More painful for the animal than banding, depending on the method of cutting used.
Can cut oneself whilst castrating the animal: knives are sharp and must be handled properly and safely!



Advantages of using the Burdizzo pinchers:

Desirable for show steers because of the large and well-shaped cod that is formed in well-finished steers.
Similar advantages as described above with banding.
No tetanus shot required because there is no scrotal atrophy occurring



Disadvantages of using the Burdizzo pinchers:

Best done by an experienced operator or veterinarian
One cord can only be cut at a time, and cannot slip from the clamps of the Burdizzo
Mistakes are likely to occur if not done properly: the cord may be incompletely crushed and the animal may develop stagginess later.

, Depending on where you live, most castrating should be done during early spring or late fall. It can also be done in the wintertime, as the cold will constrict the blood vessels making it less likely for an animal to bleed out sooner.

, One thing you should remember is that the younger the animal is done, the better. Bulls should be castrated no older than 8 months of age. Bulls can be castrated at any time, but you must remember that if you castrate a bull that is at least 12 months of age, you will notice a loss in productivity:


The older the animal is at castration, the greater the stress, risk of bleeding, and the slower the growth rate for that animal.
On average, calves are castrated around 8 weeks of age or sooner. Some producers, depending on how busy they are and their willingness to go out to the pasture to find calves to tag and castrate, will steer a bull calf when it is a day to two days old. Other producers would rather run the calves through a chute when they're around two and a half months old when they can castrate, tag and vaccinate them all in one go.

Watch your cows and/or heifers for signs of estrus.,
Twelve (12) hours after estrus is when females should be AI'd.,
Calmly, with proper handling practices put the heifers or cows in to the working alley to the squeeze chute (or alleyway with just a head gate is good enough), and catch the first female in the head gate.",How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers1," Females go into heat once every ~21 days, and the heat periods themselves last for 24 hours.


Check out this article: How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer is in Estrus for physiological, behavioral and physical signs of heat.

Most heat periods start or end around dusk or dawn.

;
, This time period is when the female ovulates, sending an ovum out to the fallopian tube to await fertilization from sperm from a bull.

, If there are others behind her, make sure they are back behind another gate to prevent them from squishing you when they try to move up further in the race. If you have a squeeze chute with a palpation cage attached to it, use this as a means to do your AI'ing. Some barns are set up so that each cow is in a stanchion or head-catch lined up beside one another. This is very convenient for the AI tech who has to AI over 50 cows in one day!


If doing AI outside, it is best to do it on sunny warm days, not when the weather is rainy or windy or even stormy. If you have a facility that is set up inside a shed or barn, so much the better!

Begin by starting up your dairy farm and purchasing your dairy stock.,
Find an AI technician to hire to breed your cows.,
Have a schedule to determine which cows need to be bred and when.,
Breed your cows.,
Have your cows monitored (by you and your other hired hands) to tell if any of them go back into heat or not.,
Record those that have been bred and the projected time they will calve.

",How to Breed Dairy Cattle,";
, The more experienced the tech you hire is, the higher the success rate of your cows getting pregnant.


It is highly recommended you use AI to breed your cows and not a herd bull. Dairy bulls are extremely dangerous and unpredictable, and not worth your or your employees' lives to keep one around.

, A Breeding/gestation table or pinwheel will help you in this regard, and also helps your AI tech to know which cows need to be AI'd.


Time when your females need to be bred by when they go into estrus. The rule of thumb that all AI techs follow is that females are to be bred 12 hours after they've showed signs of estrus.

, The AI tech will be following the steps that he/she already learned at an AI distribution company and according to the ""How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers"" article here on Wikihow.

, Record those that do go back into heat.

Stage 1: Initiation of myometrial contractions (removal of progesterone block).,
Stage 2: Expulsion of the fetus.,
Stage 3: Expulsion of fetal membranes.",How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer Is About to Give Birth1,"


The fetus becomes stressed because it approaches the inherent space limitations of the uterus, resulting in the fetus's anterior pituitary gland to release ACTH (Adrenal corticotropic hormone).
Fetal cortisol promotes the synthesis of three enzymes (17alpha Hydroxylase, 17-20 Desmolase, and Aromatase) to convert progesterone to estradiol.

Estradiol encourages myometrial (or uterine) contractions become more active and contractions are more noticeable.
Secretory activity also increases in the vagina and cervix, with the production of mucus providing lubrication for the easier passage of the fetus.

Mucus secretion also helps wash out the cervical seal of pregnancy.




Fetal corticoids also cause the placenta to synthesize PGF2alpha to help eliminate the progesterone block.

Corpus luteum starts to regress, facilitating the decline in progesterone.
Relaxin, a glycoprotein, is produced by PGF2alpha and stimulates the softening of the connective tissue in the cervix and promotes elasticity of the pelvic ligaments, allowing easier passage of the fetus.


Calf fetus rotates so that the front feet and head are positioned towards the rear (posterior) of the dam.
Contracting uterus begins to push the fetus towards the cervix, applying pressure to the cervix.
Pressure on the cervix activates pressure-sensitive neurons located in the cervix that synapse in the spinal cord and eventually synapse with oxytocin producing neurons in the hypothalamus.
Oxytocin acts to facilitate myometrial contractility initiated by estradiol and PGF2alpha.
As pressure on the cervix increases, oxytocin secretion increases; force of contraction of the myometrial smooth muscle begins to peak.
Fetus enters cervical canal; first stage complete.;
,


Strong myometrial and abdominal contractions continue until the calf is expelled from the birth canal.
The feet and head of the fetus put pressure on the fetal membranes until they rupture, resulting in a substantial loss of amniotic and allantoic fluid.
Fetus becomes hypoxic (or deprived of adequate oxygen levels), and this hypoxia promotes fetal movement which in turn promotes further uterine contractions.

,


The car-uncles (or chronic villi) becomes dislodged from the uterine wall

This release is believed to be brought about by powerful vasoconstriction of arteries in the villi.


Further myometrial contractions, as well as the beginning of the involution of the uterus, help expel the fetal membranes.

If you are new at this, you should either think about getting someone more experienced to do the castrating for you.,
Treat animals humanely.,
Restrain the calf to prevent additional injury to both you and the calf during the procedure.,
Obtain sterile surgical instruments.,
Keep your hands clean and wear clean latex surgical gloves.

,
Clean the bull or calf's genital area with warm soapy water.,
Apply antiseptics to the entire scrotum.,
Have an extra bucket or two of warm water with disinfectant solution mixed in.,
Method 1 for Young Calves: Removal of Lower End of Scrotum


Remove the lower one-third of the scrotum, which will expose the testicles from below.,
Method 1 for Older Calves: Removal of Lower End of Scrotum


Follow the same steps as above for young calves except do not pull out the testes.,
Method 2: Slitting the Scrotum Down the Sides


Pull one testicle down and hold firmly to the outside so the skin of the scrotum is tight over the testicle.,
Put a ring (looks like a green Cheerios)over the closed end of the elastrator.,
Restrain the calf as indicated above in a sitting or lying position.

,
Press both testicles through the ring and to the lower end of the scrotum.

,
Release the rubber ring.

,
Release the calf (after doing additional tagging and vaccinating).

,Restrain the calf

,
Force the testes up so that the bottom third of the scrotum is available.

,
Press this portion of the scrotum through the rubber ring, then release the ring.

,
Restrain the calf as indicated above.

,
Work the cord to the outer side of the scrotum.

,
Apply the Burdizzo about 1-1/2 to 2 inches above the testicle.

,
Using the procedures described in How to Give Cattle Injections, prepare a needle and syringe for the operation.

,Restrain the calf

,
Insert the needle from the top into the middle-third of one testicle, and inject the fluid according to the weight prescribed on the bottle.

,
Repeat for the other testicle.

",How to Castrate Bulls and Bull Calves2," However, if you are wanting to learn, you need to memorize the steps required to castrate cattle properly. Stress can be reduced by doing the procedure quickly and cleanly.

, This also reduces stress to the animal.

, The younger the calf, the easier it is for you to restrain it. Calves older than a month of age require two people to restrain it. However, one person can effectively restrain a one-week-old calf and do all the necessary operations.


If you have access to a calf table, use this instead as it greatly simplifies your job that you have to do.
Use a chute with older animals, preferably one with a head-gate attached.
If there is no chute available, an animal may be tied to a fence with a halter, with your assistant pushing the calf to the fence, then applying a tail-jack. Tail-jacking immobilizes the rear-legs of the calf and thus it cannot kick. This will not stop a calf from flinching and jerking when a scalpel is cut into its scrotum!

, Depending on your method, a knife or scalpel is the best tool of choice. You may also wish to use an emasculator.

,, It should be clean and free of dirt and other organic matter before you begin.

, This step is not useful if the hair is not shaved off or the area has not bee scrubbed with soap several times.

, This enables the operator to rinse off surgical instruments and their hands. This can also be useful for letting the instruments soak between animals.


Consult with your local veterinarian on specific disinfectants that you can use.

,
Slit the membrane covering each testicle. However, if desired, this membrane does not need to be slit and can be removed along with the testicle.
Pull out the testes.

, Instead, sever the partially withdrawn cord by scraping it in a shaving motion with the knife or clamping with an emasculator.
If using the emasculator, leave it on the cord for 30 seconds.

Cut one cord at a time, or use the emasculator on one cord at a time.



,
With a sharp knife, make an incision on the outside of the scrotum next to the leg

Make sure the incision is extended well down to the end of the scrotum to allow for proper drainage.
The incision should also extend through the scrotum and membrane.


Remove the testicle by emasculator or by scraping with the knife.
Repeat for second testicle.

, There are four points on the elastrator, and when the handle is squeezed, this opens up and stretches the green band.

,,,,,,,,,,, Remember when closing the clamp, you need to close it so that it crushes the cord, not so that it is merely a light pressure to the area.


Ensure that the penis is not included in the crushed tissues.

Prepare a water bath that is between 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 34 to 35 degrees Celsius) in a thermos.,
Identify which canister contains the semen you need.,
Remove the canister from its storage location to the center of the tank.,
Grasp the desired cane then immediately lower the canister to the tank floor.,Shake the straw to remove excess liquid nitrogen (nitrogen quickly goes into a gaseous state when exposed to air and warmer temperatures)

,
Immediately place it the prepared thermos of water and keep it in there for 40 to 45 seconds.

,
After the straw is put in to the warm water, put the can back in the canister by raising the canister up and over the cane and return the canister to its storage position.,
Get your AI gun ready by having it pre-assembled (this should be done before/after you prep the thermos with warm water.,
Remove the straw from the thermos and wipe it dry with a paper towel.,
Put the straw in the rod.,
Wrap the AI gun in a clean dry paper towel or protective sheath and tuck it in your clothing close to your body to both transport it to the cow and to maintain a constant temperature.

",How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers2," Use a thermometer for better accuracy.

, A semen inventory on the tank that keeps track of the location of each bull prevents any unnecessary searching.

, Lift the canister just high enough into the neck region of the tank to grasp the desired cane of semen. Keep the tops of the canister or canes no higher than the frost line, or two to three inches from the top of the tank.

, Keep the cane as low inside the tank as possible while removing the straw of semen with tweezers.


You only have 10 seconds to take the semen straws out!!!

,,,


Anytime it takes over 10 seconds to locate a cane the canister must be lowered back into the tank to cool completely. Never return a unit of semen to the tank once you've removed it from the cane.

, If it's cold outside, warm the ""business end"" of the gun up in your coveralls close to your body so it warms up completely. Rubbing a paper towel on the rod also helps warm it up. If it's hot outside, keep it in a cool place. The AI gun should not be extremely hot nor cold to the touch.

, It should be completely dry before you do anything else with it. Flick your wrist slightly, while holding the crimped end, to adjust the air bubble in the straw. The flick should move the bubble to the end you are holding

, Clip 1/2"" (or 1 cm) from the crimped end of the straw. Use sharp scissors or specially designed straw-cutter scissors should be used, and cut in the area that the air bubble is located.

Take the gun out of your jacket or overalls, unwrap it, then insert it at a 30 degree angle into the cow's vulva.,
With your left hand in the rectum of the cow (which should have been there to begin with), feel with your finger tips through the wall of the rectum and vagina the location of the end of the AI gun until you reach the cervix.

,
Grasp the cervix with the hand in the rectum of the cow (like you would hold a bar that is below your hand) and hold it steady while you thread the rod into and through the cow's cervix.

,
When the rod is all the way through the cervix, check the location with your index finger.,
Slowly depress the plunger at the end where your right hand is so that 1/2 or is deposited.

,
Recheck the location of the semen to make sure you are in the cow's uterus and not in any of her ""blind spots"" (see tips below), and deposit the other half of the straw's contents.

Shoulders appear, then the barrel and finally the hips and back legs.,
Reddish ""gunk"" and a sac appear within a matter of minutes to an hour after the calf is born.",How to Tell if a Cow or Heifer Is About to Give Birth2," The first signs of parturition in cows and heifers is that most will start to freshen (or bag up or start lactating) before birth. This may range from 24 hours before birth to even 2 to 3 weeks before birth.


The teats of the cow will start to fill up, looking full and distended, with the teat plugs often starting to come out. Most cows will show these signs 24 hours prior to calving.

, The vulva of the cow or heifer gets quite swollen and large. It also tends to look very loose, with more creases forming along the sides and underneath the vulva than normally.

, The pelvic bones begin to widen out (as a result of the hormone relaxin, as described above), and the tailhead sinks lower into the hooks of the pelvis.

, The first signs of labour occur when the cow usually stops to strain, or may kick at her belly because of the discomfort the contractions are causing her. She will also be laying down and getting up a lot, and be quite fidgety.

, A cow or heifer will usually find a secluded place away from the herd to give birth, whether it's in a grove of trees or in a corner of a corral or pasture.

, After noticing the signs in steps 1 to 3 above, you will also notice a clear mucus discharge from her vulva. This is the onset of the secretions starting in the cervix and vagina to help with reducing friction and aid in an easier birthing process.

, The sides of the cow begin to sink in, and her belly appears to be more larger in the back than it was in the front.

, The water bag is a yellowish-coloured sac that hangs down from the vulva, and is always the first to appear before the calf.

, If the feet are pointing down, then the calf is in normal position. Soon the nose will also start to show.

, The calf is born! Congratulations!

, This ""gunk"" may stay on the rear of the cow for 6 to 12 hours, until her uterine contractions completely expel it.


This ""gunk"" is the afterbirth, the remains of the placenta and fetal membranes.

Know and become familiar with the current averages for a breed.,
Put the context of EPD values into your purchase of a new bull.","How to Read, Understand, and Use Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs) in Cattle"," You can find these on the internet or by contacting various breed-specific organizations to get a hard-copy of some bulls and females to look over. Local seedstock breeders that are having a bull sale in the near future and bull testing stations where bulls are being held are both good sources to get a catalogue from on the bulls and heifers that are being made ready to sell. Various AI companies like Genex and Semex are also a great source to go by to analyze the various EPD values for various bulls that have semen available to be used. Much of the information on the bulls they have available can be obtained on-line or by ordering a catalogue.;
, It doesn't matter what bovine you choose: it can be the first one on the page. But you will be needing to look at the EPD numbers that pertain to that animal to follow the rest of the steps below.

, There are two types of abbreviations found in most EPD charts: The production traits, and the accuracy values. Accuracy values are either as percentage values or positive/negative values, and come in the form of the abbreviation ACC. Production traits are the actual EPDs that are analyzed in the selection of a herd bull, cow or heifer. Some of the more common traits, their abbreviations and meanings (with emphasis placed on bulls as sires) that are commonly reported on most EPD tables are as follows:



BW (Birth Weight): Birth weight of a sire's progeny when compared to the breed average, in pounds (lbs).

WW (Weaning Weight): Adjusted to 205 days excluding maternal effects (evaluated as milk), in pounds (lbs).

YW (Yearling Weight): Adjusted to 365 days excluding maternal effects in pounds (lbs).

Milk, MM (Maternal milk): A measure of the pre-weaning performance, pounds of calf attributed to the milking ability of a sire's daughters. (Note the use of the term ""milk"" is inaccurate because the trait measures all maternal effects, of which milk is the major but not the only factor.)

CE (Calving Ease): The ease with which a sire's calves are born. This is expressed in a percent of unassisted births, with the larger positive numbers indicating greater calving ease. This EPD is determined largely by the weight of the calf. (Trait expressed in Gelbvieh and Simmental breed associations.)

CED (Calving Ease Direct): Predicts calving ease of a sire when mated to heifers. Expressed as difference in percentage of unassisted births, with a higher value indicating increased calving ease in first-calf heifers. (Trait reported in Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin and Red Angus breed associations.)

CW (Carcass Weight): The adjusted carcass weight of a sire's progeny expressed in pounds (lbs). (Trait used in Angus, Brahman, Brangus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin, Red Angus, Simbrah and Simmental breed associations.)

DOC (Docility): This is the measure of an animal's temperament, nervousness and flightiness when handled. (Trait primarily reported in Limousin breed associations, but may also be found in Angus, Salers, Charolais and Maine Anjou breed associations.)

Fat (Fat Thickness): This trait is the back fat thickness measured over the ribeye at or between the 12th and 13th ribs. It is used as a predictor of total body fat being the major factor in calculating yield grade. (Trait reported in Angus, Brahman, Brangus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Red Angus, Simbrah and Simmental breed associations.)

IMF (Intramuscular Fat): This reflects differences in a 365 day adjustment of intramuscular fat measured over the 12th and 13th rib in live cattle using ultrasound. (Trait reported in Angus, Charolais Limousin and Hereford breed associations.)

MARB/Marb, MB (Marbling): This is a 365-day adjusted marbling score measured in USDA marbling degrees. This is the primary factor in USDA quality grades. This trait would also be measured the marbling degrees for breeds with this EPD found in other countries besides the USA, such as Canada, Australia, and South Africa. (Trait reported in majority of beef breeds including the Angus, Brahman, Brangus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Limousin, Red Angus, Simbrah and Simmental breed associations.)

M&G, TM, MWW (Milk and Growth/Maternal Milk and Growth, Total Maternal, Maternal Weaning Weight): This is a measure of a sire's ability to pass on milk production and growth rate through his daughters. It predicts the total weaning (direct and maternal) that will be displayed in his daughters' offspring. It is calculated by adding half of the Weaning Weight EPD with the Milk EPD (+ MWW EPD). This trait can be calculated for all breeds participating in the National Cattle Evaluation analysis.

REA, RE (Ribeye Area): Ribeye area measured in square inches between the 12th and 13th rib and adjusted to 365 days. This is a good predictor of the total amount of muscle in the carcass and is highly related to carcass weight. (Trait reported in Angus, Brahman, Brangus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Limousin, Red Angus, Simbrah and Simmental breed associations.)

SC, SCR (Scrotal Circumference): This is the predictor of sperm-producing tissue as measured in centimeters. Scrotal circumference is highly related to age at puberty in male and female progeny. (Trait reported in Angus, Brangus, Beefmaster, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford and Limousin breed associations.)

Note that not all of the traits used in various breed associations like the American Angus Association and American Hereford Association, among many others, have been mentioned. It is suggested that you check out the breed association website applicable to your country (especially if you reside outside of the USA) for additional EPDs and their definitions, as well as the links posted in the Sources and Citations section below of this article.

For information on additional Angus EPD definitions including $Value EPDs, please check out the AAA's EPD Definitions website at http://www.angus.org/Nce/Definitions.aspx. For Hereford EPD definitions, please see the EPD Basics page on the AHA website at http://www.hereford.org/content/epd-basics.





, Depending on the traits themselves, there is always going to be some sort of concern if numbers go into extremes or are significantly separate from the average-breed-EPD values. There would be cause for concern if, for example, a bull has a high BW EPD, or a negative SC EPD.


Remember that there are both numbers showing you the accuracy of the EPD values and the EPD values for the production traits themselves.
The majority of the numbers don't go over 100 or below -10, and the accuracy range is from 0.0 to 1.0, or on a percentage-basis.

Accuracy values are published with an EPD to indicate the amount of risk that an individual will take when using an animal in a breeding program. It is a reflection of the number and distribution of progeny per sire along with how much pedigree information is available. This accuracy gives us an indication of how close estimates are to an animal's true genetic value and is an extremely useful tool to breeders in determining the reliability of an EPD.

The higher the accuracy value, the less risk there is to an EPD value changing as additional data is included. That being said, bulls with low accuracies should be used on a limited basis, while bulls with high accuracies can be used as deemed necessary.





, All EPDS are reported relative to a base population, making each breed's base year arbitrary. Most bases are obtained by forcing the EPDs for all animals in a particular year to add to zero. Thus, the EPDs reported on animals born in the current year are relative to the average genetic merit of the animals born in the base year.


Note that an animal with a 0.0 EPD does not necessarily mean that they are at the current breed average for that EPD value. For example, an Angus born in 2006 with a birth weight EPD of +2.3 would be the average for BW EPD of the Angus breed, while a bull with a 0.0 EPD would be below the current average.

, The majority of bulls these days have some form of EPD values put on them, so you will need to study the values and accuracies and base your decisions on the right bull for you for your herd.


Don't just choose any bull. You will need to first analyze your cow herd and see where the weaknesses are. Wherever you find weaknesses you will need to try to find as strengths in your potentially new bull. In either extremes, a bull is selected to either improve daughters for replacements, or maximize growth so that the whole calf-crop is sold as weaning as feeder calves. You cannot have both: in other words, you can't have your pie and eat it too!

The same can be applied to the purchase of new heifers or cows. You need to select females that will potentially help improve the herd, even if it's a bit less than what a new bull can do.

Depending on the breed of the heifer, most heifers will start to show the first signs of heat when they are between 9 and 22 months of age.,
Usually it's best to wait until they are at least 15 months of age before breeding.,
The heifer must also be at least 60% to 65% of the average mature weight of the cowherd before she can be bred.,
In order to successfully breed a heifer, there are two ways to go about it:



Choose a bull with good (as in low) calving-ease numbers to breed her (and other heifers like her), or ...
Time her estrus periods so that you can Artificially Inseminate (AI) her (or get an AI tech to do it for you).",How to Know when a Heifer or Cow Is Ready to Be Bred1,"


The rate of sexual maturity or puberty is determinate of genes and breeding. The rate of maturity, being carcass maturity, is not directly related nor determinate of when a heifer is ready to breed. Carcass maturity is when bone and muscle growth plateau's off and fat begins to be laid down.;
, Even though the early maturing breeds do reach puberty by the time they are around 7 to 9 months of age, it is best to wait until they are around 13 to 15 months of age before you can breed them. This is because it allows them to grow more, increase their pelvic area and gain enough condition that can allow them to sustain themselves throughout gestation. Heifers that are bred too early tend to have too small a pelvic area to calve out, so some ""whoopsie"" heifers need to have a C-section done on them, or have the calf pulled. This can be quite costly, as the new calf will often have to be bottle-fed to get enough milk for him.


Occasionally, though, some heifers that are bred too early are able to pass and raise a calf without human interference, either at calving or during the period the calf is being raised.

, This is so that she is big enough to hold and grow a calf in her while she also continues to grow.

,


A heifer can only be successfully bred during her heat periods. It's critical in timing everything right to make AI successful for her. She must be AI'd 12 hours after you see her first signs of estrus. And remember that AI only has a 60% to 70% success rate.
With use of natural insemination, the bull will know when she will stand to breed and when she isn't receptive. It is best to leave the bull in with the heifers for 60 to 80 days to make sure he services all of them. Use a yearling bull (one that is around 12 months of age) on them to reduce injury. (Note, though, that using a yearling bull may or may not decrease the size of the calves born. Most, if not all veteran producers can tell if a young bull will sire small calves simply by looking at his conformation and his EPD numbers based off the genetics and EPDs of his sire and dam.)

Contact your local large animal veterinarian to assess whether the reason your cow is down is really from nerve paralysis and not something more serious.,
Once you have determined the cause that she is down from nerve paralysis, get her to stand up.,
Once (and if) she's up, grab her tail to keep her from falling.,
Try to keep her on her feet for a few minutes.,
If she goes down again, let her rest for a few minutes before trying to get her up again.

,
Make sure she can stand and walk on her own before you leave her and her calf alone.,
Keep an eye on her until you are certain that she's figured out how to manage by herself.,
Make her comfortable.,
Your vet may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, Vitamin E, Selenium and steroids for her to assist nerve healing and reduce swelling.

,
Check on her often and keep trying to get her up.,
Turn her over a couple times a day so she's not always laying on one side all the time.,
Most cows will get up after a few hours or a few days, especially if you are persistent in helping them get up.,
If she has been down for a while when you do find her, the outcome may not be as good, and she may need to be humanely euthanized.

",How to Get a Cow With Nerve Damage to Her Hind Legs from a Long Birth or Hard Pull to Stand Up," The cow may be down not only from obturator/gluteal paralysis, but also from a fracture to the femur or a dislocated hip joint. A fracture of the femur can be severe enough that if you get the cow to stand up without consulting the advice of a vet first, the bone may sever the femoral artery (a main artery that runs along the length on the outside of the hind leg) and she'll bleed to death in a matter of minutes. Another reason that the cow may be down may be from having a case of milk fever, which can also quickly kill her if not treated immediately and appropriately.

, It may sound cruel to force a cow to get up, but this may minimize or prevent what might otherwise be a more serious issue. She will be tired after a difficult birth and may just want to lie there. The following steps are very effect (FAR more effective than trying to do the nice sweet-talking thing) in getting most cows back up.


Before you do try to get her up, move her calf away from her so that she won't fall on him if she wobbles and staggers over.









Twist her tail. Do this by taking the tail halfway down and twisting it into a loop hard enough so that you don't break the tail but can't twist it any more. Hold it there until she gets up or you can't any more (for around 10 to 20 seconds).







Clap your hands, shout or stomp your feat very loudly to startle her. A flighty cow will normally try to rise if you startle her if you make a sudden noise or movement. A more gentle one won't even try.







Suffocating her. This does sound very cruel, but it's an old trick that has worked in getting a stubborn cow back up. All you do is place your hands firmly over her mouth and nostrils tight enough so that she can't breathe. When she starts getting worried about getting short on air, she'll usually try to get up.






Only try this for 10 to 20 seconds. If the cow won't get back up after 20 seconds, then remove your hands and let her breathe.



Shocking her with the cattle prod. This is another really dirty trick, but touching the hairless area under the tail with a hotshot or cattle prod will startle almost any cow into attempting to get up.







, You do not want to risk a leg fracture or hip-joint dislocation if she goes down again.

, If you can do that, generally she'll be less helpless the next time she tries getting on her feet again.


The longer she stands, the better!






It may take a couple of people to steady her and keep her from falling over on her numb side (one on her tail, the other on her head)






She may try to swing or kick that one hind leg a bit because it feels funny, not because she's mad at you for getting her up. It's just like when you get hit in the funny bone or when your arm or leg or foot gets numb and has ""pins and needles"" from abnormal pressure.







,, You certainly don't want her to fall on him by accident when you're not there.


When she tries to turn around (if she does), the leg that's unsteady may suddenly collapse under her and put her down again.







, Often once a cow's up and around, the leg will soon be back to normal again and she'll be able to mother the calf herself without any further issues.

, This means doing the following:


Move her hind legs into a more comfortable and natural position if she tried to get up and her hind legs are all askew.







Milk colostrum from her while she's lying down (yes, you can milk a cow while the cow is lying down) if she has a live calf. You can feed him from a bottle or bring him to the udder to suckle. Keep him lying down so he's level with the udder and can nurse properly. You will have to guide his mouth to a teat.






Partition the calf away from the cow if she's in a barn stall, or make a temporary pen for him nearby if she's in a larger area. Make sure you get him back to momma every few hours for him to nurse.






Hobble her hind legs (if you suspect she'll try to get up without you there to watch or assist) to prevent her from doing the splits when she does Try to fails. Tying the legs together reduces the chances of her fracturing a leg, dislocating her hip or tearing her leg muscles. Position the legs 16"" apart and tie a strap or baler twine above the fetlock joints in nonslip knots so it won't tighten and cut off circulation. Don't worry, the hobbles, if done right, won't hinder a cow to get up on her own.






Keep her warm, clean, sheltered, and well fed. Change the straw put around her often so her rear and udder stays clean. If she's outside and not in a stall and it's cold, wet and stormy out, make a windbreak of bales (can be any size and type) around her in a semi circle, and place a tarp over the bales to act as a shelter. A tarp over her body will also help keep her warm in windy and/or wet weather. Provide fresh hay and water for her, even if she's going to be down for a few hours.





;
,, If she still cannot stand, find a way to hoist her up.


An overhead beam in the barn or a tractor loader helps in these situations.






You need to do this twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes each time






Wide belting of some kind, like belting used in balers can be used as a sling. Place it around her front end behind the elbows and around her back end at the flanks.

Your vet may supply hip lifters (a device that clamps on to the hipbones of the cow) to lift up her hind end that you can borrow.



, She will get what are called ""bedsores"" from constant pressure and the muscles she's lying on will get sore and fatigued.

, Periodically stand her up if she'll try. A lot of folks can ""tail her up"" by hold on her tail to hold her steady for a bit before she goes down again.


The more you get her up, the better!

If the animal has been cut, confine him to a well-bedded area or clean pasture and keep him there for three to four hours.,
Consider treating him with a long-acting antibiotic, just in case, immediately after the castration is complete.

,
Keep him under close observation for about a week to keep an eye out for swelling or stiffness from infection.

,
You may need to have a fly spray on hand if flies are going to become a problem.

,
If the wound swells or the animal becomes stiff and depressed, isolate him immediately and call your local veterinarian.,
Once everything has cleared up and/or the animal has healed up nicely, you can release him back to the herd.

The wound should be bathed with hot water, and antibiotics should be administered.
The vet may open and drain the wound. You may have to make sure the wound gets cleaned out after the vet has done the initial clean-out, using warm water and an antiseptic.

Purchase a good herd bull.,
Get the bull semen tested.,
Bring the bull to your farm or ranch.,
Put him in with your cows or heifers at the start of breeding season.,
Keep the bull in for as long as your breeding season entails.,
At the end of the breeding season, remove the cows from the bull.",How to Breed Cows and Heifers Naturally," Make sure the bull is a calving-ease bull if you are wanting to naturally breed heifers, or a herd bull that is selected to improve your cow-herd, not disprove it. Look at the breedyour cows are made up of and choose your bull from there. You may want to purchase a purebred bull to start a crossbreeding operation, or a bull of the same or similar breeding as your cows to get calves suitable for sale to market or as replacements. Whatever the choice, make sure it's a wise one that you won't regret during calving season.



Conformation is extremely important in the selection of a good bull for your cows and heifers. If you get a bull that has poor conformation, he either won't last very long or will sire inferior calves.
Purchase the bull a couple weeks or so before breeding season, especially if it's a yearling bull that has been on a feed-testing station prior to being purchased. This way the bull can get used to your farm/ranch and you can start getting him on a proper roughage diet instead of the grain diet he's been tested on.

The exception to this is if the bull has been tested on forage, not grain, which is becoming more and more common-place due to need for more cattle to be raised on grass alone.


Remember the bull-to-cow/heifer ratio when purchasing a bull. For most herds, the ratio is 1 bull to 25 to 50 cows, depending on the pasture size and age of the bull. Cow herds in large enclosures will often require a smaller bull:cow ratio than if that cow herd were in a smaller enclosure.

Mature bulls tend to settle more cows than yearling or virgin bulls, so you will need to accommodate for that as well. A mature bull will typically mate with 30 to 50 cows per season, whereas with a yearling bull, 10 to 25 cows or heifers is sufficient.

;
, It is highly recommended you get this done before you purchase the bull otherwise you will end up paying much more than what the bull is actually worth. A qualified large animal veterinarian will do the semen testing for you.


If you get the bull tested after you purchase him and find out that he's a dud, you'll have to sell him. The price you get for your bull will be quite a bit less than what you initially paid for.

, Put him in a corral with good, sturdy fencing, feed and water already accessible. He will be a little antsy at first, but should settle down after a few days.


Depending on your herd health management criteria, you may want to or have to quarantine the bull to check for potential health concerns with sexually transmitted diseases such as Trichomoniasis, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Vibriosis, etc. If that's the case you will have to quarantine the bull for three to four weeks prior to letting him in with your cows and/or heifers to make sure he tests negative for any STDs that could cause damage to your herd.

, You also have the choice of putting your cows or heifers in with the bull, but only if the corral the bull is in is large enough. You don't want to have a pasture or corral that is too small that quickly turns into a dirt wallow, nor a pasture too big so that the bull gets too worn out or cannot successfully settle all your cows or heifers by himself. If the latter is the case, consider purchasing another bull, ideally one that is not the same age as the first one you purchased.

, This can range from 45 days to 120 days. Ideally, you should have your breeding season between 45 to 60 days, but of course this varies between farm to farm and ranch to ranch.


Check the breeding herdregularly to check up on the bull's progress with breeding the cows/heifers. This way you can watch and see whether the bull is actively breeding his females or if he's more interested in the grass than his girls.

Often spending time (at least a half hour to an hour) watching the herd will give you a good idea of how well and how interested your bull is in your cows.

If you're finding that your new bull isn't really doing much or anything, you can hypothesize that either he is a ""night rider"" (he chooses to be more active breeding his girls at night), has some sort of injury you haven't noticed yet that is inhibiting his breeding ability, or is simply not interested (some producers call these sort of bulls ""gay bulls"" or ""gay breeders"").





, The best and safest way to pull the bull from the herd is not to remove the bull himself from the herd, but to pull the cows from the bull. You can do this by herding the entire herd into the bull's pen, then herding the cows out, leaving the bull in the pen.


Some producers choose to leave the bull with the cows until the start of the calving season so that he isn't going to be alone for most of the year. You need to make sure to pull the bull at the end of the breeding season though for a period of time so that you can detect any open cows or heifers for culling purposes. Ultimately, though, the time you wish to pull the bull from the cow herd after breeding season is up to you.

A cow should be bred back after she has had a calf.,
As mentioned above on Step #5 for heifers, a cow can either be bred by AI or by natural service.",How to Know when a Heifer or Cow Is Ready to Be Bred2," The optimum time to breed her is 45 to 60 days after she has had a calf. In order to get her to calve on the same date as the previous years, allow for 80 to 90 days of rest before getting her bred again. Typically it will take longer for her to come back into normal heat if she's in poor condition or has reduced fertility due to age, inadequate diet, or environment.


The poorer her condition, or, the thinner or fatter she is, the later she will be able to breed back. See How to Judge Body Condition Scores in Cattle for more. Age and poor or undesirable conformation will also determine how soon a cow will breed back in time.
The reason there is a waiting time between when the cow has given birth to when it is best to get her bred again is because it takes time for the uterus to involute or shrink back to its normal size. It also takes time for the cow's ovaries and hormonal system to get back to normal. Though a cow will show signs of heat 14 to 18 days after giving birth, her heat periods are quite unpredictable and short. This is because it takes some time for the corpus luteum to grow back to its normal state and begin to normally produce new ova again.

,


AI follows the same principles and rules mentioned for breeding heifers in order to have a higher success rate in getting her settled.
You usually do not need a calving-ease bull with cows, certainly not like you do with heifers. However, please be cautious in what bull you select for your cows. If you are using a Continental bull on British-type cows, for instance a Charolais bull on Angus cows, that bull does need to have good or low calving ease EPDs in order to reduce risk of dystocia or calving problems in your cows. Charolais are typically notorious for causing calving problems in British-type cows, or rather throwing calves that are often larger than what a British bull on British cows usually throws. If you do not pay attention to the numbers (the EPDs or Expected Progeny Differences)of that herd sire, you will land yourself in a lot of trouble, and be very busy next calving season pulling calves.

On the other hand, if you are using a British bull on British cows (and it doesn't necessarily have to be the same breed), you can still get a bit careless with calving ease and still end up with problems. All the same, watch out for those bulls that have extremely high calving ease EPDs, regardless of what breed they are or you choose.

Also remember to select the bull that complements and improves your herd, not the other way around.

Purchase or gather the appropriate feeding supplies.,
Clean the calf bottle and nipple before first use and after every feeding.,
Feed your calf colostrum during its first 24 hours of life.,
Prepare a bottle of bovine milk replacement formula (if not using milk).,
Give your calf the bottle of formula or milk.,
Feed your calf one quart of milk or formula in the bottle 2-3 times per day for the first two weeks.,
Give your calf two quarts of milk or formula in the bottle twice a day (after the first two weeks).,
Raise two bottle fed calves together, if possible.,
Check for aspiration.",How to Bottle Feed Calves1," You’ll need a two quart calf bottle with nipple and raw cow’s milk or a bovine milk replacement formula, and possibly colostrum. Choose a milk replacement formula that is at least 25% protein.Other supplies can include a syringe or turkey baster, which you might find helpful in the beginning when getting the calf accustomed to the bottle.A calf bottle that holds two quarts of liquid is all you should need.
A turkey baster or syringe can be used to introduce the calf to the milk or formula if it doesn’t take the bottle initially. Squirting the milk or formula directly into the calf’s mouth using the baster or syringe will help the calf realize you are feeding it. You can then try offering the bottle again
The hole on the end of the nipple should be big enough that the calf can easily nurse from the bottle, but not so big that it drinks too fast and aspirates.;
, Whether you are using a newly purchased calf bottle or one that was previously used to feed another calf, you’ll need to thoroughly clean the bottle before using. The bottle will need to be washed again after every feeding.


To prepare for washing, remove the nipple from the bottle.
Rinse the bottle and nipple to remove any surface dirt and milk or formula.
Wash the bottle and nipple with hot water and your preferred soap or cleaning detergent.
Use a brush to thoroughly wash the inside of the bottle.
When washing the nipple, check for tears or cracks. If you notice such flaws, discard the nipple and use a new one. Cracked or torn nipples are hiding places for bacteria that can make your calf sick.After washing the bottle and nipple, thoroughly rinse with warm water.
Allow the bottle and nipple to fully air dry before the next use. Try setting the bottle upside down on a rack so that any remaining water can fully drain off.Keep several bottles and nipples on hand so that there is always a clean, dry bottle ready to go before each feeding.

, Colostrum is important for all mammals at birth. It is produced in the breasts before the actual milk comes in and is filled with healthy vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and disease-fighting antibodies.Colostrum will help your calf develop a strong immune system.


Calves can obtain colostrum by nursing directly from the mother cow during the first 24 hours after birth. However, that is not always possible, particularly if the mother is used as a milk cow.In that case, if you do not have another source of bovine colostrum, a homemade colostrum replacement can be prepared for the calf. Calves should get 2–3 US quarts (2,000–3,000 ml) of colostrum as soon as possible after birth, and then 2–3 US quarts (2,000–3,000 ml) about 8 hours later.To make a colostrum replacement, mix the following ingredients together: 1 cup of dry formula, 2 eggs, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1/2 teaspoon of powdered vitamins A, D, and E. Stir the mixture into a quart of warm water. Give this homemade colostrum replacement to the calf in a bottle during its first two feedings. In the colostrum mixture, the eggs give shine to the calf’s eyes and coat, and the honey helps prevent constipation. Wash the bottle after each use following the instructions previously mentioned.

, The formula is made by mixing a scoop of dry formula with warm water. Refer to the formula package directions to determine the exact amounts of dry formula and water to mix together for one quart of liquid. Instructions might vary slightly between formula types. Keep in mind that calves under 3 weeks shouldn’t have non-milk proteins.Add the appropriate amounts of dry formula and water to the bottle, put the nipple on the bottle, and shake to mix the contents together.
Give your calf one quart of formula or milk for the first few weeks, after which time you will up the amount to two quarts.If you have plenty of cow’s milk available (preferably unpasteurized raw milk) from a milk cow, then you can use that in the calf’s bottle rather than formula. Just fill up the bottle with milk and feed the calf.
Alternatives to commercial formula include dried whey protein concentrate, dried skim milk, soy protein concentrate, and modified wheat protein.

, Place the nipple of the bottle on the calf’s mouth until it opens up and begins drinking. You will need to hold the bottle the entire time while the calf is drinking.


You can stand directly in the calf’s enclosure when bottle feeding or simply offer the bottle through the fence. It is sometimes easier to stand next to the calf the first few times until it is used to the bottle. Once the calf is used to it, you can switch to feeding through the fence.
If your calf refuses the bottle at first, you can try introducing the formula or milk by using a syringe or turkey baster. Either method will allow you to squirt the liquid directly into the calf’s mouth. You can then try offering the bottle again once the calf knows to expect nourishment. Wash the bottle after each use following the instructions previously mentioned.

, Some calf owners bottle feed their calves just twice a day; others prefer to do so three times daily.Whether you feed your calf two or three times a day is your choice and can depend on your calf’s appetite.

, Continue feeding the calf two quarts at a time twice a day until the calf is four months old. At four months the calf should mainly be eating solid foods and be ready to wean from the bottle. , Cows are herd animals and do best when not alone. If you only have one calf and no other cows, sheep, goats, and even horses can make good companions for your calf.The calf can graze with the other animals when it is old enough to eat grass and solids.


If raising two calves simultaneously, you can easily feed them both at the same time by holding one bottle in each hand.

, Aspiration is when foreign bodies or liquids are breathed into the airway. Normally, your calf should drink slowly and steadily. If you see bubbles come out of its nose or hear the calf cough, stop the feeding immediately. The calf might be drinking too fast and inhaling milk into its airway. Give the animal frequent breaks to breathe and swallow."

Begin by starting up a beef cow-calf operation.,
Buy your cows and/or your herd bull.,
Choose your breeding program.,
Breed your cattle.,
Monitor your bulls and cows during breeding season.,
Pull the bullout 64 to 85 days after they've been put in.",How to Breed Beef Cattle," Follow the steps provided in the article linked in this step.;
, Buy the quality of cows that meet your standards, as far as having a good breeding herd is concerned.


Your herd bull should be selected to improve your herd, as he will be providing half of the genetic potential of your calf crop. Knowing conformation at this point will really help in determining how good a herd bull is needed. Fertility and live calves are key to profitability. One live calf is worth more than 100 dead ones. A bull that sires calves that are larger than your cow can safely give live birth to is economic suicide.

, There are two types to choose from, and both can be integrated into the other, if you so choose.


If your herd is too small to have a herd bull or you do not want to have to deal with bulls, use artificial insemination to breed your herd.
If you have a herd of 10 or more cows and you do not want to go the extra mile of having to AI them, a good herd bull is the way to go. The rule of thumb is 1 bull per 25 cows. High fertility bulls with high libido can service 50 cows with no drop in conception rates. Bulls reach peak fertility by 20 months of age, after 20 months of age it can only drop, barring illness or injury, with proper nutrition most bulls fertility will not start to decline until after 6-7 years of age.

, Know when your cows go into estrus, when they're ready to breed, and go from there.

If you are using a herd bull, you will not need to worry about when your cows go into heat, only when they have been bred for record keeping.
Follow the steps outlined in the article ""How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers"" to know how and when to AI your bovine females.

, If you have one too many bulls for your herd, there may be more fighting than mating.


Running bullunder 4 years of age with older bullmay prevent cows from being serviced by the bull with the highest fertility. Other times you may end up with a bull that has a broken penis, a leg/foot injury, or that just doesn't seem to be getting the job done.
Monitor the cows as well. If you see tails being held out or crooked tails when they're walking, that means they've been bred within the 24 to 48 hours you first noticed that physical sign.

, Unless you choose to do year-round breeding and calving where the bulls are in with the cows all the time, pulling the bulls out after 2 to 3 months both ensures that all your cows get 3-4 chances of being covered and is also not long enough for your less fertile females to get away from being culled.

Make SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely); ones that are going to make you think about what is logically possible in the near future. Goals encompass lifestyle, finances, resources, and for the livestock operation, production.

Goal-setting begins by looking at where you're at now, and where you want to be in the future. They also make you look at what is practical given your situation and resources, and just what you can do to improve on or get what you don't have.

It doesn't have to cost you any, or much, money. It will certainly cost you time, and discussions with family and friends, but consider that time well-spent.


Think about how goals can elevate you to be somewhere where you always wanted to be, or better. Implementing those goals requires change on your part, and with no change, you become stagnant, and don't get you where you have always wanted to go or be.

It's very important to be flexible. Things never go to plan, and things don't always turn out the way you predicted.


Strategic goals are the ""how"" to where you want to be in 5 or 10 years. They are the tactical, step-by-step procedures to take you to your goal. These involve creating partial budgets, business plans, pasture design plans on paper (or graphic arts software program), those sort of things.;
, Or better yet, perform a SWOT analysis (SWOT = strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). This should be a list compiled of all the things that need improving, are already doing well and don't need improving, where you opportunities lie, and what kind of things may negatively influence change or stagnation you choose to make.

Add to the list an aerial map of your farm–Google Earth is an excellent resource to use for this–to locate fence lines and watering points where you are seeing various problems, including crowding, bare-spots, overgrazing, etc.
Keep an open mind as you are doing this. There may be some details that you may or may not be comfortable with admitting are in need of improvement. These best come about with having a second opinion from others that work with you and see the operations, or even a pasture management consultant.

Use this as an opportunity for them to do a SWOT analysis/list of the operation to see what their opinions are. More than one point of view is often a very good thing to have!


When doing a SWOT analysis of yourself, you get to see what your own limitations are. For instance, how much time do you have for moving livestock versus how much time can you make? What's your financial situation? How far or often do you need to travel (to work, between farms or land bases)? Are you personally able to move cattle, check fence, check water, or do you need to hire someone? Those sort of questions, and more, are important to consider.

, Use Google Earth or, even better, Google Earth Pro, to see where current fences, watering points, buildings, and other things are. These are what you are going to start from, and where you need to start working from. It's impossible to work from a clean slate if you are starting with a current operation that needs improving.

It's a different story if you are starting with a land base that is clear of fences and watering facilities. As in the next step, working from a clean slate may require more work, more planning, but on the other hand, much more flexibility.

, The management end is going to be the hardest part to work at. Planting fence-posts and stringing up wire will be the easy stuff. But, if you're starting over again, by improving a farming operation that largely used no management to graze its livestock, you should consider the option of starting small and slow. Start with the smallest pasture, or a part of a pasture, and work up from there.

Please remember that it's not worth starting off big (as in changing everything in a matter of one or two years) if you're financially and temporally tied up. It's a smarter choice to start small, and remind yourself of the phrase, ""Rome was not built in a day.""
Planning is going to probably take a huge chunk of your time. But you can plan and plan and plan until you are blue in the face and never be happy with what you want. There's a point in time where you need to plan first, then act second. So, don't let the planning portion take up too much of your time.

A second opinion will certainly help with this decision process.



, Once you have set your goals and performed your SWOT analyses (and gathered those of others that influence the operation of your farm or ranch), it's time to get out a good pencil and eraser (no pens are allowed), some lined and graphing paper, fire up Google Earth Pro, and start planning.

If you think you need to hire a consultant to help you with this planning process, then do so. There are several pasture planning consultants out there for you to contact, so ask a pasture or forage specialist that may know of someone you can contact.
The type of vegetation your farm or ranch has will influence the type of grazing system you wish to have. Rotational or intensive grazing may not be the best choice for an arid area with limited moisture, even though it is included in the title of this article. You will need to plan out a type of grazing system that works for you and the vegetation in your area.

Management-intensive grazing (MIG) may or may not include rotational grazing. Rotational grazing basically means rotating animals around a pasture from different paddocks, and it also means rotating different species of animals through paddock systems. MIG, though, does take rotational grazing into account making it a part of the MIG-management scheme.



, The first thing to start with is laying out perimeter fencing. This will be influenced by location of roads, farm yard boundaries, and property lines. The goal of perimeter fences is to limit where your livestock should and should not go. These will determine layout of paddocks.

It's particularly important to be sure of your property boundaries before beginning to plan out pastures.

, The most significant difference is going to be the variation in vegetation composition. These particular areas need to be separated from each other to create various homogenous areas that can be more easily and separately managed.

There's no real need to be too particular about which areas should be separated and which should not. As long as there is a significant and noticeable difference in species composition, then there should be a legitimate reason to separate these areas to enable you to manage them effectively.

Try to separate native vegetation from tame forage, and riparian zones or lowland areas from upland or dryland areas. Treed areas must also be separated from grassland areas.
Hills must be managed according to slope and south- versus north-facing sides. Depending on the size of the hills, there may be a need to separate hill tops from side hills  from hill-bottoms to reduce erosion. However the size of the hill, though, it's best to avoid creating paddocks that run from the top of a hill down to the bottom.



, It's really important to make them as square as possible. Less fencing material is needed to create paddocks as squares and circles than most any other shape. If you need to use rectangles, the length-to-width ratio should not exceed 3:1. These will make grazing more uniform, and accommodate more fencing, such as if you want to split these paddocks into smaller paddocks for different grazing methods discussed below.

You have a choice of making small or large paddocks. Large paddocks enable more flexibility with animal numbers and using different grazing methods that depend on the use of a single-strand of temporary electrified wire. So long as you remember the rules of thumb mentioned in the previous step, using a temporary electric fence to control animal movement within paddocks can ensure better grazing within.

Use lanes only when absolutely necessary. Lanes carry heavy hoof-traffic and are more prone to compaction, overgrazing and erosion. They can be difficult to plan out if they run through wet or low-lying areas (which must be avoided), or up and down hills (also a no-no), and large gates will be needed to block access to different areas. Lanes should be big enough to accommodate vehicles (from tractors to large trucks), and be easily-accessible to paddocks.

Lanes are only needed if you cannot provide water on pasture due to financial restraints. Otherwise, it's recommended to plan on piping water to paddocks as a better alternative to lanes.




Once you have planned out paddocks, you will need to look at where your watering points need to be. This must be done before looking at materials for fencing or even going out to lay out where your paddock fences are to be built. See the next section below for guidelines for setting up pasture watering points.

, A basic rule to understand is that perimeter fencing needs to be stronger than the fencing used to create paddocks. Perimeter fencing should be multi-stranded with either barbed-wire or smooth/hi-tensile or both. In most cases, these fences should not have less than four strands of wire per fence-line.

Internal or paddock fences can be set up with one or two strands of hi-tensile wire. In most cases, these can be electrified, but if livestock are already trained to electric fence, then you can get away with not having them electrified.
The materials you can get will depend on their availability. But basically, for paddock and pasture fencing, it's recommended to get 4 to 6-inch by 8-ft treated wood posts, plus 18-gauge barbed wire and higher-gauge (around 16-guage) hi-tensile wire.
If grazing smaller stock like sheep, goats, and pigs, you may need to consider the option of using paige-wire. It's more expensive than standard barbed or hi-tensile wire, but will ensure these smaller stock a less likely chance of escape.
Iron T-posts are also optional for internal paddock fences. They aren't as strong as wood posts for perimeter fences, though they can be used in combination if there is not enough treated posts to use, or the posts are less cheap to purchase than usual for whatever reason.
If you run into any other materials for fencing, consider the expense, availability, and practicality of their use. If you can get a lot of them, then more power to you. But if you cannot, the standard materials for pasture fencing should be used instead.
The most important equipment needed for fencing is a post-pounder and a come-along for tightening wires.

, A partial budget will give you an idea of how much money needs to be spent to obtain these materials. Cost-comparisons will also allow you to judge whether certain materials are cheaper than others. But beware, the phrase, ""you get what you buy;"" in other words, if you buy something cheap, chances are it's not the best quality., You may be in a municipality or county were certain regulations surrounding the structure of fences exist., These include underground utility lines or pipelines, power lines, trees, debris, etc. Phone the local or regional utility line company to mark out these underground lines for you. Clear away any brush and debris that will hinder fence-building., Lathe (or survey stakes) and surveyor tape are recommended, plus a 100-meter (330 feet) measuring tape. The tape will help mark out length and width of paddock fence lines , though the old-fashioned way of ""stepping it out"" also works sufficiently enough, so long as you know how long of a step you have.

If you are setting out square or rectangular pastures or paddocks, you will need to make sure the corners are as much at a 90-degree angle as possible. A prismatic square will help you with this, as well as another helper to mark the point for you without you having to constantly travel back and forth between points.

You can also use a compass or a large protractor to help ensure corners are square. Other methods can be read here.



, You have an option of hiring someone to do this for you, so long as you provide the necessary supplies and give them a benchmark of how or what you need to have done. Perimeter fences are standard, but internal paddock fences have more lee-way in how they're built. You certainly may also choose to build these fences yourself, provided that you know what to do to make sure these fences are strong and last a long period of time.

Corners are always built first, followed by the posts, then the wires. The exact way to go about this is dependent on your preferences, your farm layout, and supply availability. Check out the links in the Sources and Citations section below for several links that will show how to best build your fences.

, This should be done once you have planned out where your paddocks are going, but is going to pose the greatest challenge to planning out a more efficient grazing system for your farm or ranch. The basic rule is easy access to clean water in such a way that does not promote excessive trampling, erosion, compaction and overgrazing.

Avoid directly-watering stock straight from dugouts, ponds, creeks, rivers, lakes, or any kind of water body. Livestock with access to these watering sources fowl the water and destroy sensitive riparian habitat.

This is why these lowland/wetland zones must be fenced off. Water from these sources should be pumped to a tank or trough, providing cleaner water for the animals, and keeping them out of the adjoining water body.


Trailing may not be helped if planning grazing in large, expansive areas, like on native grassland or rangeland areas. Cattle trails are going to be formed on these areas regardless out of habitual following each other to and from their best grazing and resting areas.
The maximum distance livestock should travel to water is a half-mile (800 feet or ~250 meters). Animals graze most efficiently if they can travel this distance or less to water.

Livestock are lazy in that the farther they have to travel to water, the more likely they are going to loiter around. Forage near the water source is likely to be overgrazed, while forage farthest from water is under-grazed. Manure distribution is also uneven, more manure staying closer to the water source and less as animals have to venture further out.

Also, if barriers like trees or hills are in the way and prevent visibility of those livestock going for water from those still grazing, livestock are more likely to go for water as a large group rather than by themselves or in small groups. This is true even when the water source is less than a half-mile away. The best way to reduce loitering and encourage smaller groups of stock accessing water is to plan a pipeline system where at least one water source is accessible to livestock on pasture.





, There are many options to chose from, depending on things like what existing water facilities you have, the type of grazing system you wish to have, the number of animals to water, costs associated with installing and maintaining the system, the topography of your farm, and your personal preferences. Consider pipelines, pumping systems, and types of waterers available for your animals.

Pipeline systems should be of serious consideration, as you can run pipelines underground or above-ground, up- or down-hill, from a current well source or a newly dug source, from a spring, artesian well or dugout, or even from a river or creek. Underground pipelines are ideal for winter-grazing systems.

PVC piping is less desirable than HDPE pipe. HDPE is more flexible and thicker walls making it more durable and less likely to leak than PVC. Pipes should have around 1.5"" inside diameter (probably 2"", though that maybe pushing it) for best flow.
Smaller piping can also be used, and is much cheaper than the larger piping. Smaller piping (like that of a garden hose, or of similar sized pipe) can be used for watering systems that don't require pumping water, like gravity-fed watering systems, or as a T off of a larger pipe.


Pump systems vary from livestock-powered to solar-powered, as well as gas-powered, electrical, hydraulic ram, and sling pumps. Gravity-fed systems are certainly encouraged if your topography allows it.
Many do-it-yourself or purchased waterer systems exist for providing water on pasture. Nose-pumps are ideal if watering one or two animals at a time, with limits to 50 animals. Stock tanks are best for watering more than three thirsty animals at a time, and can range from purchased steel tanks from a local farm supply store, to a home-made tank made out of a big old tractor tire, a hay tarp, and a truck-load of gravel. Even granary-bin ring bottoms, sealed up and made extremely water-proof for long term use, are great for watering a large number of animals at one time. All of these can easily be made as automatic watering systems using a float and a sensor that ensures the water level does not exceed the rim.
Hauling water to livestock is another option, but the most labour-intensive, time-consuming, and demanding of all the mentioned options. It's best if watering a small number of animals from a large tank, but if you have many animals and even the largest tank isn't big enough, then this is a very poor option of choice. Pipeline and pumping is more practical when you have more animals to water.
There are also options with building or purchasing temporary, portable watering systems. A lot of these waterers have a long hose attached to a pump, and the pump sucks water in from a neighbouring water body be it a lake, dugout, or a pound. It's controlled by float and automatically refills itself every time as or after livestock have been drinking.

, Use a different coloured surveyor tape than what you used for marking out fences, if you haven't started (or completed) installing fences yet. The layout of the pipelines won't be like with fences, rather in as directional a means as possible for the lowest cost (and less material) possible., Source your piping materials, the type of waterers to use, as well as pumps that may possibly be needed. You may also need to hire out a back-hoe or trencher so that you can lay down the pipe underground if you choose not to run the pipe above-ground. Running pipe above ground is another option, but must be along the fence-line and not where it's at risk of getting run-over or trampled., If you think you will need to hire some help or someone with more experience to do this, then do so. It may save you in the end.

In most cases, the piping has to go in first before the water facilities are installed. This is especially true with underground piping, or even temporary watering facilities.

Exceptions are with creating dugouts or ponds.
Install a shut-off valve at select points so that you have control over where water is going to be routed to and when water can be pumped to that watering point. Valves are especially needed if you have more than one watering point that the pipeline is going to have water ran to.
Check pipes for leaks before filling in the trenches via pressure-testing. Big leaks are easier to detect than small leaks, but it's the small leaks that need to be attended to before they become bigger problems.



, Each may slightly differ in the amount of herbage (or forage yield) in terms of pounds per acre or kilograms per hectare. The most notable differences will be seen on hill tops compared to that in lowlands or low-lying areas.

Remember that, despite the greater abundance of forage, these low areas are more prone to be saturated with water or contain water for most of the year, making them quite sensitive to grazing. In normal or wet years, these sensitive wetland or riparian zones should be excluded from grazing. The best time to put livestock in them is in a dry year, or when the soil has dried up significantly enough that pugging will be a minor issue.

Pugging is the biggest threat with these areas and can severely degrade or ruin their integrity, resulting in more time needed for their recovery (which, depending on the severity, type of wetland, and soil type, may range from a whole year to at least 5 years). If they are to be grazed, the grazing should be light and only when the area has dried up enough to be able to withstand a moderate to light amount of hoof impact.


Assessing forage yield can be done in a few ways, but most popularly they are done by a grazing stick or by clipping. For more information, please see the first step in How to Calculate Stocking Rates for Your Pastures for detailed and comprehensive instructions on how to calculate forage yield for your pastures.

The grazing stick is probably the best method to use for assessing forage quantity when using management-intensive grazing. You can get forage height and the composition quite readily if you have a known plant composition. However, if the composition is more varied or includes other plants that make up quite a bit of the stand, clipping may be needed to be done to establish the amount of forage in pounds per acre for every inch of forage height.

Forage yield is determined in a dry-matter basis, not as-fed primarily because forage yield is much more variable if water is included.


This step is vital to help you determine the number of animals to stock a pasture, or the amount of land needed for a particular herd or flock. But the rest of the steps are harder to understand without providing an example scenario for you to help you better understand the math.

Let's say you've found that you have 2000 lb/acre of forage yield available in your pastures. This after measuring with the grazing stick an average forage height of 10 inches (25.4 cm), and a fair-conditioned mixed pasture with 200 pounds per acre-inch (or estimated 200 lb/acre for every inch of forage height).



, The utilization rate is basically a percentage estimate of how much your animals are expected to remove for consumption versus how much should be left behind. Utilization rates should never be at 100 percent nor should they exceed 75 percent unless under special circumstances.

For most rotational grazing schedules, you should aim for a utilization rate between 45 to 60 percent. Daily moves or moves every two or three days allow you to have your animals eat more forage than if you were moving less often. For a continuous grazing system, you should aim to utilize only 30 to 35 percent of forage, but if you're moving your animals twice a day, you can easily have them utilize around 70 percent of the forage.

It's best to err on the side of caution because it's very easy to over-estimate how much forage is being consumed. If learning to switch from a continuous grazing system to a rotational-grazing system, it can be difficult to want to leave behind ""too much"" grass; in most cases, you can never leave behind too much grass. Thus, it's best to be conservative when estimating utilization rates.


To continue the example, let's assume you have a utilization rate of 60 percent. This is because of the example in step 6 where you may want to move once every two days.

, Stocking rate is very useful for determining the number of animal units at a set unit of time (days or months) can be stocked per acre on your pastures. It is predetermined by both utilization rate and forage yield, which has been gone over already.

One animal unit (AU) is one 1000 lb cow-calf pair that consumes around 25 pounds of dry matter forage per day. Therefore, one animal unit day (AUD) or one cow day is equivalent to that forage consumption.

One animal unit month (AUM) is that same animal unit consuming around 800 pounds of dry matter forage per month. Typically one AU will consume between 600 and 900 pounds of dry matter forage per month, but for the sake of simplicity, an AUM = 800 lb DM of forage/month.

An AUM with stocking rate is ideal in extensive grazing systems, and may give you an idea of how many AUMs per acre to expect for your farm even if you are rotating animals on a daily basis.




Calculate stocking rate by using the formula Stocking Rate = (Forage production (lb/acre) x ) ÷ (800 lb/month). From the examples created above, stocking rate for your pastures may be calculated as follows: Stocking rate = (2000 lb/acre x 0.6)/800 AU lb/month = 1.5 AUM/acre.
To calculate AUD/acre (or animal days per acre), use the same formula as above, except the formula is going to be more like: Cow days per acre = (Forage production (lb/acre) x Utilization rate (%)/100) ÷ (animal unit daily intake). Using the examples created above, the number of cow days per acre = (2000 lb/acre x 0.6)/25 AU lb/day = 48 AUD/acre.

, This can be in acres or hectares. The amount of land you have available is in total acreage overall, and the area of each paddock. Preferably it's best to know total amount of land you own that is available for grazing in order to determine how many grazing animals to stock on that land at a particular time.

This particular step actually can be ignored if you already know how many animals you want to have, but need to know how much land you need to have in order to keep those animals well-fed for the grazing season, or year after year.

Ideally and preferably, you should first know the amount of land available for grazing before determining the number of livestock animals to graze.


Knowing the amount of area you have in each paddock is ideal if the paddocks you built are permanent, or not easily changed at any time in the grazing season. While area differences for each paddock are not going to influence the number of animals that you can put in there, the differences are going to influence the amount of time they are going to be in there, particularly according to the current forage yield.
Continuing the example laid out for this section, let's say you have a quarter section (160 acres) to graze.

, This may be optional, depending on how you have your pastures split up or if you are grazing on native range in an extensive manner.

The amount of time that you may want to graze may end up being more or less than you think. But typically, with rotational grazing systems, splitting up a big pasture into many small paddocks is going to grant you more time to graze than letting the cows out to the entire pasture. It makes for better utilization of forage that is growing there, and gives more areas of the pasture the amount of rest it deserves.
The length of time to graze really depends on your location. Certain areas that are close to large seas or oceans or lakes may see a longer growing season than more land-locked locations. And, the closer you are to the Equator or the closer you are to the tropics, the longer the growing season is going to be.

This means that in some areas, may be able to graze year-round, but others may only be able to graze for 4 to 8 months out of the year.
This step may be less important for a rotational-grazing schematic than rotational-continuous or continuous grazing systems. In some instances, it actually may be a good thing if you can stretch your ""typical"" grazing season for longer than you had thought initially or planned for.



, This will be up to you and your personal preferences. How often you are able to be available to move your animals based on outside influences and priorities like your off-farm job, family, and other duties will determine how often you want to move your cattle.

The longest time you probably want them to spend in a paddock is a week; the optimum move times is once every 1 to 3 days. Daily moves (or sooner) are the most ideal so that your animals have less opportunity to go back and take that second bite from those particular plants that they found favourable.

An example for this section is moving every 2 days.



, Rest period is the amount of time that plants need to recover from grazing, and ""normally"" is 30 days in ideal growing conditions, however may range from 40 to 365 days.

Basically, the less time livestock are on a paddock the less time that paddock needs to recover from grazing. Also, the less number of animals (and the lighter their weight) are grazing a paddock, the less time that paddock needs to recover or rest from grazing before being grazed again.

Remember to target the optimum recovery period with the number of animals you have or need to graze your pastures. If you have too few animals, you may run the risk of under-grazing a lot of your pastures. You can easily tell if you are under-grazing your pastures by how quickly your grasses reach maturity before you get your animals there. In other words, if your grasses are pushing up seed-heads and reaching maturity before you can get your animals there to graze those grasses, then you are under-utilizing your pastures, have too few animals, or are just not moving your animals fast enough.
Thus, an example rest period could be around 60 days.



, The basic formula for determining the number of paddocks needed is:


Number of Paddocks = (Rest Period + Number of Days on Paddock) ÷ Number of Days on Paddock

The longer the rest period and the less days on paddock, the more paddocks you're going to need.

Thus, carrying the example grazing calculations forward, with two days of grazing and 60 days rest, the number of paddocks you may need is: Number of paddocks = (60 + 2) / 2 = 31 paddocks.





, Using the values and formulas from the steps above, the size of your paddocks is determined by the formula Acres per Paddock = Pasture size (step 4) ÷ Number of Paddocks (previous step).

You may be able to see that the rest period and number of days on paddock are going to influence how big your paddocks are going to be. The less time animals are on pasture, the smaller the paddocks need to be. The shorter the rest period, the larger the paddocks are going to be. Also, the larger the entire pasture size, the larger the paddocks are going to be.
From the example values obtained from previous steps, the size of each paddock on 160 acres, with each paddock getting 60 days of rest and 2 days of grazing, is: Acres per Paddock = 160 acres / 31 paddocks = 5.2 acres per paddock.

, This will help you determine how much herbage is going to be available per day, per the next step. To calculate number of acres available a day, use this formula: Acres per Day = Acres per Paddock ÷ Number of Paddocks.

The example from previous steps shows this: Acres per Day = 5.2 acres / 31 paddocks = 2.6 acres per day.

As above, the greater the size of the paddocks, the more acres are going to be available per day.



, This is different from the actual forage yield that you had to do in the first step above. Instead, you will need to calculate the amount of forage that is available per day in order to find out the amount of forage that is consumable or utilized per day based on the utilization rate that you had already decided on.

All of the values calculated for this step are on a dry-matter basis, as they have been with calculating forage yield in step 1.
The formula for Forage available per day (DM) is Forage yield (lb/acre) x Acres per Day

Per the example: Forage Available per Day (DM) = 2,000 lb/acre x 2.6 acres/day = 5,161.3 lb/day of forage.



Forage consumable per day (DM) formula is Forage Available per Day (lb/day) x (Utilization rate (%) / 100)

Per the example: Forage Consumable per Day (DM) = 5,161.3 lb/day x (60 / 100) = 3,096.8 lb/day consumable.



, As mentioned with the step on stocking rates, one Animal Unit (AU) is equal to one 1000 lb cow-calf pair (or single cow) that consumes 25 pounds of forage per day; This equals to one AUD (animal unit day). Thus, using the values from previous steps, the calculations are as follows:


Animal Units per Day = Forage Consumable per Day (DM) (lb/day) ÷ AU consumption (lb/day/AU)

Per the example: AUD = 3,096.8 lb/day ÷ 25 lb/day/AU = 123.9 AUDs for the previously calculated 2.6 acres needed per day for your herd.



, As already mentioned, this article is for any type of grazing animal of your choice, be they goats, sheep, cattle, horses, bison, llamas, whatever. Thus, to help you figure out the method to adjust for actual weight and type of animals you wish to graze apart from the standard animal unit, the easiest formula to use is this:

Animal Unit Equivalents = Average Actual Animal Weight (lb) ÷ Animal Unit Weight (lb)
For example, you want to graze a bunch of young stocker cattle (post-weaning cattle to be raised for beef) that weigh around 800 pounds as an average weight. Thus, the adjusted animal units would be: Animal Unit Equivalents = 800 lb / 1000 lb = 0.8 AUE

Therefore, to determine the number of these animals you want to graze, use the formula Number of Animals to Graze = Total AUDs ÷ AUE. Per the example, the number of stocker cattle you should graze is: 123.9 AUD / 0.8 AUE = 154.9 or 155 stocker cattle per day for 2.6 acres per day.


Use the same formula if you want to graze sheep. Minus the calculations, for 200 pound ewes (which are 0.2 AUEs), you should expect to graze 620 of these ewes on 2.6 acres per day.

, Where to move them (or which paddock) is entirely up to you, and the forage in your pastures.

Different paddocks will have forage plants coming at different stages. Targeting pastures or paddocks where grasses haven't quite headed out but are past the 3- or 4-leaf stage is ideal.
Each year you begin grazing it's best to start in a different pasture or paddock than the year before, and graze different paddocks from the year before, never keeping to the same schedule as last year's grazing season. This is so that you allow different pastures opportunity to get ahead or reach a different physiological state than they would if they were grazed at the same time year after year.
It's perfectly fine to allow some paddocks to get ahead and reach flowering and/or seed set before either grazing, or mowing. Some of your pastures may have a variety of legumes that need to be allowed to set seed before next grazing, all to maintain a healthy stand. These range from clovers, sainfoin and cicer milkvetch to alfalfa, lespedeza and birds-foot trefoil.

, Depending on the grazing intensity and targeted utilization rate, you should look for things like how much is forage is left behind (basically height-wise, as well as leaf area) from what was there just before the animals were turned in, and ask yourself if you grazed too heavy or possibly too light.

One important thing to remember is that it's very easy to allow animals to consume too much grass and not leave enough grass behind. So if you think you may have grazed too light, check plant height before and after to be sure with your grazing or yard stick.

Basically, determining how much to leave behind is an art that requires a lot of observation, trial and error, and practice. There is no perfect one-size-fits-all way to judge how much to take versus how much to leave behind.



, This will help you determine how long your rest period may need to be. Your initial estimated rest period may be too short, or too long; it all depends on how slowly or quickly the plants recover from grazing., When you start a grazing operation, you're going to be tweaking things every year to make them that much better for you. This is why observation of everything in the entire grazing operation, from water facilities to the animals you are using, is very important.

Every year is different and will pose different challenges.

, The easiest animals to teach grazing are the matriarchs of the herd that stay on the farm year after year. But possibly the hardest ones to graze are those young weaned animals that require some time to get accustomed to being moved regularly, and to respect the electric fence. Your plants will also show how well you are doing, by a decrease or increase in diversity, forage yield, and recovery time.

For the first while you may need to keep your grazing stick handy for every time you're moving the herd.

, Differences in weather patterns and climate in your area will test the strength and durability of these systems, and this will be shown through your stock. Little things like needing an extra fence post here and there, putting in an extra grounding rod, or a fixing a hole in a water trough or even one of the man-made ponds or dugouts not having enough water than normal can be the kind of changes that may improve or challenge your system."
"
De-horn and castrate well ahead of weaning time.,
Bring the cows and calves into a small well-fenced pasture paddock two to three weeks ahead of the actual weaning schedule to get the calves used to their new surroundings.,
Precondition the calves.,
Provide immunization and boosters.,
Wean the calves by moving the cows out of the weaning paddocks so that the calves remain in their familiar surroundings.

,
Keep an eye on the calves during this stressful period.,
For the cows, do not feed milk-stimulating feeds (those that contain high amounts of calcium and proteins) to cows at weaning time.,
Do not milk the cows during this time.",How to Wean Cattle1," This will minimize stress on the calves since this will not be done right at weaning time, causing illness and weight loss in the weaned calves.;
, If weaning paddocks are not available, use small pastures (with good fencing!). Don't put the cows and calves in pens that consist primarily of dirt; this is to avoid respiratory diseases and pneumonia caused by dust that often crop up during and after weaning time.

, Creep-feed (or precondition) the calves so that they learn to eat from a feed bunk before being weaned.


Preconditioning calves is a great method to adopt to reduce stress for calves at weaning time. Preconditioning involves getting calves used to eating out of a feed bunk or trough, and drinking from a water trough. This should be done without the cows around, as cows tend to be more pushy and bossy around the feed bunk and water trough, not allowing the calves in at all. Use of a creep-feeder is best to get the calves used to eating out of a feed bunk.

A creep feed or precondition ration for calves should include a mix of grain silage (corn, sorghum, barley, wheat or oats) and legume-hay, plus a concentrate supplement that includes protein. Make sure the supplement you are giving them does not have animal by-products in it at all, as this could be serious if one or some of the calves develop symptoms of BSE when they get older (especially in those heifers that will be used as cows.)Also, keep the feed free of mold and dust, as this will cause calves to get sick with illnesses like pneumonia.



, Give calves their first immunization treatments while they're still nursing, and follow with booster shots as recommended by your veterinarian or the manufacturer of the vaccines. A herd-health program should have been established between you and your local large animal veterinarian so that you are prepared to give the calves whatever needs to be given in your area.


Treat for internal and external parasites as well.

,, Handle and treat the calves with care and a bit of TLC. Confide with your veterinarian about use of tranquilizers during the weaning process to calm the calves and to minimize weight loss.

, Putting them on a grass-only diet of hay or putting them out on poorer pastures will help the drying up process proceed quicker.

, Keep an eye out for any signs of mastitis or swollen udders.

Calculate how many animal units you have.,
Calculate the estimated stocking rate for your area.,
Determine how long your cows will be grazing on a piece of land for.,
Put it all together to find how just how much space you need for your herd.,
Find out if you can get the required space for your livestock.,
Turn your cows out to pasture and let them graze for the allotted time.",How to Determine How Many Acres of Pasture are Required For Your Cattle," In order to do this, you first need to know just how many animals you actually have, plus the average weight of the herd. For example, you may have 100 head of 1400 lb mature cows. The next thing you need to know is what an ""animal unit"" is.

Animal units (AU) are the basis of calculating stocking rates and pasture space for a group of animals. The standard single (1) AU is equivalent to one cow-calf pair weighing a collective 1000 lb. Some sources may confuse you with ""with or without a calf"" or as just a cow, but you should not worry about those technicalities so much as that 1 AU = one 1000 lb cow (or cow-calf pair).
To calculate the number of animal units you have, multiply the number of head by the animal unit equivalent of your cows.

By the example above: 100 cows x (1400 lb / 1000 ) = 100 head x 1.4 AUE = 140 AUs
An ""animal unit equivalent"" is the adjustment that is calculated from the standard animal unit based on the average weight of your livestock. AUEs can be used for any weight of grazing animal being used on the pasture, from sheep to bulls to horses to deer. The calculation simply involves dividing the average weight of your animals by the weight of the standard animal unit.

;
, The stocking rate for your location is determined by the amount of forage you have in terms of pounds per acre or kilograms per hectare, the utilization rate expected by the animals based on pasture condition, and how much of that forage is utilized by a standard animal unit for one month.

The amount of forage you have in your pastures can be eye-balled, though if you have not learned how to properly eye-ball how much forage you have, you can be far more in accurate than if you clipped various samples around the pasture, and weighed then after they are dried down.

To get an accurate clipping measurement, you need to use a 1 ft by 1 ft quadrat (square) so that you can calculate the amount of forage (in pounds) per acre (where 1 acre = 43,560 square feet) after its dry matter weight has been assessed.


Utilization rate is a percentage of how much a cow should remove compared with the total amount of forage that is actually there.

For most pastures that are in decent condition (with 6 to 8 inches of forage or more) the utilization rate should not exceed 55%. Poorer pastures with low amounts of herbage should have a utilization rate of less than 30%. Excellent pastures can have a high utilization rate only if the animals are in there for a short amount of time; otherwise it is best to stick with a 50 to 55% utilization rate to ensure plenty of plant material is left behind.


One AU is estimated to consume between 600 to 900 lb of forage in one month. To make things simpler, and as an average used by all stockmen to calculate their stocking rate for their land, the best estimate is that one animal unit will consume 800 pounds of forage in one month.

This is what makes an Animal Unit Month (AUM).


To calculate out stocking rate, let's assume your pastures are producing 1600 pounds of forage per acre. With a 50% utilization rate, and assuming one AUM consumes 800 pounds of forage a month, that will give you a stocking rate of 1.0 AUM/acre.

The formula is: Stocking Rate = (Forage production x )/800 lb/month

Per the example: Stocking rate = (1600 lb/acre x (50%/100))/800 lb/month = 1.0 AUM/acre





, Typically this is measured by months, not days. For most North American areas (not including the tropics) a typical grazing season is between 4 to 6 months. More southern grassland areas, like in California and down into Florida and Texas, are more flexible with being able to graze for 12 months a year. Thus, let's assume you live an area where you are only wanting to graze these 100 cows (see step 1 above) for 4 months.

Only use days if you are splitting up the pasture into multiple paddocks to rotationally graze your cattle in. This requires more extensive calculations, and an entirely different how-to article to perform.

, Once you have figured out how many head of cattle you have, their weights and corresponding animal units, your stocking rate, and how long you intend to graze, you can plug them into a formula to get the amount of land needed for your herd.

The formula is: Required Pasture = (Number of Animal Units x Stocking rate ) / Time to graze Using the example created: Required Pasture = (140 AUs x 1.0 AUM/acre) / 4 months = 560 acres needed.



, You may need to recalculate if you cannot get the amount of acreage for your herd. Recalculation may involve reducing the number of cows, or the amount of time they spend in the pasture.

It's highly recommended to not change the weights of your cows if you've already determined their weights, because you could short-change both yourself and the person you may be leasing the land from to use to feed your cows for the summer. If you reduce the weight of your cows from 1400 pounds to 1200 pounds, you may be inviting serious overgrazing by libelling about your cows' actual average weights. This could land you into trouble and potential for being not allowed to lease from that person again.
Also do not change stocking rate unless you're absolutely sure that it needs to be changed. Always remember, the shorter the grasses look and the thinner the sward (collective term for lots of forage plants), the lower the stocking rate will be.
If you reduce the number of cows you have or the time allowed to graze, you can reduce the amount of land needed to raise your animals on. For instance, 90 head of 1400 lb cows can be grazed on 504 acres of land, whereas if you decided to graze your 100 head of 1400 lb cows for only 2 months, you could leave your cows on 280 acres for two months.

, Keep an eye on the pasture and the cows. If you find they are not getting enough, you may need to pull them out sooner than expected.

These calculations are merely a guide and an estimation. They are not exact, nor ever will be. It's up to you, as manager, to pay attention to the resource (forage) the cows need in order to both keep your cows happy, and not cause significant damage to the land.

Feed your calf only high quality milk replacement formula and grains.,
Provide vitamin A supplements if your calf shows signs of a deficiency.,
Prevent vitamin D deficiency by providing alfalfa and allowing calves time in the sun daily.,
Add finely ground limestone to the calf’s grain to correct calcium deficiency.,
Observe your calf’s behavior for signs of possible magnesium deficiency.",How to Bottle Feed Calves2," Feeding your calf high quality food is the best way to prevent vitamin deficiencies. Formula that is at least 25% protein and fresh grains usually provide adequate amounts of the necessary vitamins and minerals calves need to remain healthy.

, Younger calves are most susceptible to vitamin A deficiency because they have not yet built up a reserve supply of vitamins in their bodies.If your calf has a loss of appetite, rapid breathing, joint swelling, and even weight loss, it might be deficient in vitamin A. Consult a vet who treats cows and calves before starting any treatment.
To correct a vitamin A deficiency, administer a shot of vitamin A or add powdered vitamins to its bottle.
Grains that have gotten wet or moldy lose some of their vitamin content and might not offer enough nutrition. Replace with fresh grains immediately.
Calves that are deficient in one mineral like vitamin D are often deficient in others, like vitamin E, copper, manganese, selenium, or zinc., Vitamin D helps calves absorb both calcium and phosphorus, which keeps their bones strong. A vitamin D deficiency can lead to the development of rickets.Regularly provide alfalfa that has been cured in the sun to prevent rickets in young calves.Allow the calf time outside in the sun whenever possible for additional vitamin D exposure.

, If you observe your calf chewing on rocks, wood, or other similar substances, that could be a sign of calcium deficiency.Adding limestone to the grain is a simple way to increase your calf’s calcium intake.


For every ton of grain, add 40 pounds of finely ground limestone.Continue adding limestone only for as long as your calf shows signs of a calcium deficiency.

, Cows get magnesium from eating grains. Calves who are bottle fed only milk or milk replacement formula without the addition of grains at the right time, can become magnesium deficient.Signs of magnesium deficiency include nervousness, irritability, and loss of appetite.To correct a magnesium deficiency, feed the calf more grains. Good choices include alfalfa, pasture grass, hay, wheat bran, soybean meal, and even legumes."

Make sure it's a good day to wean.,
Put feed out in an area where the cows will be able to see and smell you putting out the feed.

,
Let the cows out.,
Close the gate after the number of cows you wish to let out are out, making sure none of the calves have chose to escape in the meantime.,
Leave the calves in the corral for a few days until they've settled down before you decide to load them up and sell them at the auction mart.

",How to Wean Cattle2," Sunny, calm and warm weather is better than windy, rainy or cold weather.

,, Once the cows are at the gate, open up the gate and let them through, using calm and effective herding cattle practices. You can choose to let a few cows at a time to ease the calves into the weaning process, letting out a handful of cows out of the weaning paddock into another one once a day or twice a day, however many cows and calves you have to wean.


You can choose to leave a few babysitter cows–those that are open (not pregnant) and you intend on culling later on, or need better quality pasture because of their age–with the weaned calves. Yearling heifers even work great as den-mothers or babysitters.

, Usually with calm handling practices, you won't get any calves that will escape, because usually the cows go through the gate first, then the calves follow soon after.

Prepare.,
Leave them be.,
Move the cows after several days.",How to Wean Cattle5," Following the steps above in the sections ""Preconditioning Calves Prior to Weaning"" and ""The Actual Traditional Low-Stress Weaning Process,"" separate cows from the calves into adjacent paddocks where they can see and possibly sniff each other but the fence does not allow any suckling to occur.


Placing page wire and strands of electric wire on either side of the fence is a good way to keep from calves and cows from getting back to each other. Having a two-layered fence built may also help prevent the more desperate mothers from getting back to their calves.

, Allow this interaction for the next 3 to 5 days, until you see the cows and calves losing interest in each other.

, If you wish, you can move the cows to another pasture after this weaning process has gone through.

"
Run the calves through the crush or squeeze chute.

,
Put the nose flaps in the calf's nose; you will just need to manipulate the ends of the nose ring so that it will stay in the calf's nose, or use a small screwdriver or wrench to adjust and hold the nose-flap or spiked nose-ring in place.,
Let the calf out with the cow.,
After a week or two has passed, the cow's milk will have started to dry up and the calf will have already adjusted to not having milk.",How to Wean Cattle6,", The nose ring is temporary, unlike a bull's nose ring, and will be removed after a week or two.

, The cow will kick off the calf if he attempts to nurse because the spikes on the nose ring prod her in the udder. The nose ring does not prohibit the calf from grazing, eating in the creep feeder or drinking water, nor does it prohibit the calf from being with his mother.

, You can now separate the cows from the calves with very little stress and remove the nose rings from the calves. Ideally it is best to remove the weaner rings after seven to ten days.

Prepare yourself for the weaning process.,
Consider two ways of weaning the bottle calf.,
Provide feed, water and mineral at all times during the weaning process.",How to Wean Cattle7," Weaning an orphan calf that you have raised and nurtured for the past few months can be and emotional strain on both you and the calf. The calf will complain a fair bit during the weaning process but you must be diligent and stubborn.


Bottle calves should be weaned by the time they are around 3 to 4 months of age.

, These two methods include reducing the quantity of milk the calf gets per day, or diluting the milk solution gradually to the point where he's drinking only water.


Reducing the quantity of milk can be a bit more stressful on the calf because he'd not getting the same amount of milk that he had before the weaning process started. Cutting back a few pounds per day is a good way to start.
Diluting the milk is more towards the natural way a cow would wean her calf. This is because by the time the calf has reached a certain age (i.e., 3 months), the milk quality that the cow produces decreases over time. Diluting the milk formula an eighth (1/8) at a time until the ""milk"" is 100% water is a good way to go.

, The calf should already be eating hay and/or grain and/or grass by the time the weaning process has started.


Also ensure that the hand-reared calf is on good pasture that is clean and leafy, if there is pasture available."
"
Introduce alfalfa and fresh water after the first week of life.,
Give the calf starter pellets after two weeks.,
Mix starter pellets with ground feed after eight weeks.,
Limit bottle feedings to once a day between 12 and 16 weeks of age and allow the calf to graze regularly.,
Wean from the bottle completely by four months.",How to Bottle Feed Calves3," The calf might not show much interest in anything but the bottle at first, but it is important to keep fresh water and alfalfa nearby.The calf will soon become curious and begin nibbling at the alfalfa and sipping the water.


A salt or mineral lick should also be provided. You can find these easily at feed stores.

, This will help your calf get used to eating solid foods.The pellets can be purchased from a feed store.


Continue providing pellets for the calf until it is eight weeks old.
Fresh water and alfalfa should still be provided, as well as the salt lick.
If the calf is reluctant to eat the pellets, try putting a few in its mouth right after bottle feeding., Once the calf is two months old you can diversify its solid food by adding ground feed to the starter pellets. Continue giving the calf pellets mixed with ground feed from eight to twelve weeks of age.Ground feed can be purchased from a feed store or you can make your own.
To make your own ground feed, mix equal parts of ground corn, wheat bran, and oats with a bit of powdered molasses.Initially, just mix in a small amount of ground feed until the calf gets used to it. The, gradually increase the amount of ground feed as you reduce the amount of pellets.The calf should be fed two pounds of the pellet and ground feed mixture daily.Continue providing water, alfalfa, and salt. You can also let the calf begin grazing on green pasture grass rather than give it alfalfa., At this point, the calf should be given two quarts of formula or milk by bottle just once a day.Let the calf pasture graze daily.


Continue providing ground feed or grains, fresh water, and salt.
At this point, you can choose to offer ground feed or grains without any starter pellets.

, At four months of age, the calf should be getting enough nutrition from the grains and alfalfa or pasture grass to no longer need bottles of formula or milk. You can stop giving the calf the bottle at this point. Be sure to provide enough grains (ground feed) daily based on the calf’s weight and allow it out to pasture daily."
"
Check fences prior to turning cattle out.,
Open the gate and coax or bribe the cattle through to the fresh grass.,
Let them have at it!,
Repeat the fence checks for the pasture you want the cattle to graze in next before moving them there.,
Move the cattle from the spent pasture onto a new pasture or paddock.,
Repeat the process from the steps above.",How to Graze Cattle on Pasture," Assuming that pasture fencing is already present, go around the perimeter of the pasture that you are to graze your animals in and check the fence for any broken wires, stretched wires, staples pulled out, broken posts, or trees on the fence line. Fix such weak areas as you find them accordingly.;
, Quite often, just the activity of checking fences will bring cattle up to the gate or fence to see what you are up to. Cattle are always inquisitive and will go to discover anything that is new or different, such as activity out in the field or an open gate left deliberately or accidentally open. Thus, it shouldn't take them very long to find the open gate and the fresh grass beyond.

, Grazing cattle is the most economical means of feeding them because you are getting them to look for their own food. They serve themselves, rather than you serving them.


Cattle do not need to be forced to like or eat grass; they will easily feed themselves until you determine when they should be moved to fresh pasture or when they start looking for fresh pasture.

, It cannot be stressed enough the importance of checking fences before moving cattle. Sometimes you may want to check fences again during the time they are on pasture, especially if they are in an area that is big enough to allow them to graze there for three to four weeks or more, and especially if the fences themselves are old and prone to break from the stress put on them by the cattle.

, Cattle that are manage-intensive-grazed (MIG) will soon get accustomed to being moved at a certain time of day or after a certain time they are on pasture. Cattle that are continuously grazed on a large pasture are not trained as such, and require calm herding techniques to move them from one pasture to the other.


Cattle should be moved to fresh pasture when 50% to 70% of cover has been removed; this is important with rotational grazing that follows a high-intensity low-frequency form of grazing. Cattle will need to be moved sooner in a high-frequency low-intensity form of grazing where they only get to graze enough that they are taking only one bite from every plant and trampling the rest.

With continuous/rotational combination grazing (where one pasture is being grazed for around a month before moving the animals on to the next) remember to move them before most of the pasture gets overgrazed. This is where determining stocking rates or stocking density--used mostly for MIG--is important. The timing of when you decide to move your animals to fresh pasture depends on the pasture size (number of acres), the average body weight of the herd, and the forage quality and quantity.



, Make sure pastures get a rest period of 25 to 30 days or more to allow plants to come back at an adequate height to be grazed again.

"
Determine the amount of land you have available.,
Calculate the estimated stocking rate for your area.,
Determine how long you want the cattle to be on the land.,
Determine the number of animal units that can graze on your piece of land.,
Adjust for actual weight of the cows to be grazing the piece of land.,
Determine the number of animal unit equivalents to graze your land.,
Put the cows out to the pasture to allow them to graze.",How to Determine How Many Cattle Can Be Grazed on a Pasture," This will be the first of one of the most important pieces of information you need in order to find how many cattle you can graze. This number can be in acres or hectares. For example, you may have a quarter section (equivalent to 160 acres) available for grazing.

You can even work with as little as one acre. As long as you stick with one unit of measure (acres versus hectares), you are able to work with as much or as little land as you wish.;
, The stocking rate for your location is determined by the amount of forage you have in terms of pounds per acre or kilograms per hectare, the utilization rate expected by the animals based on pasture condition, and how much of that forage is utilized by a standard animal unit for one month.

The amount of forage you have in your pastures can be eye-balled, though if you have not learned how to properly eye-ball how much forage you have, you can be far more in accurate than if you clipped various samples around the pasture, and weighed then after they are dried down.

To get an accurate clipping measurement, you need to use a 1 ft by 1 ft quadrat (square) so that you can calculate the amount of forage (in pounds) per acre (where 1 acre = 43,560 square feet) after its dry matter weight has been assessed.


Utilization rate is a percentage of how much a cow should remove compared with the total amount of forage that is actually there.

For most pastures that are in decent condition (with 6 to 8 inches of forage or more) the utilization rate should not exceed 55%. Poorer pastures with low amounts of herbage should have a utilization rate of less than 30%. Excellent pastures can have a high utilization rate only if the animals are in there for a short amount of time; otherwise it is best to stick with a 50 to 55% utilization rate to ensure plenty of plant material is left behind.


One AU is estimated to consume between 600 to 900 lb of forage in one month. To make things simpler, and as an average used by all stockmen to calculate their stocking rate for their land, the best estimate is that one animal unit will consume 800 pounds of forage in one month.

This is what makes an Animal Unit Month (AUM).


To calculate out stocking rate, let's assume your pastures are producing 1600 pounds of forage per acre. With a 50% utilization rate, and assuming one AUM consumes 800 pounds of forage a month, that will give you a stocking rate of 1.0 AUM/acre.

The formula is: Stocking Rate = (Forage production x )/800 lb/month

Per our example: Stocking rate = (1600 lb/acre x (50%/100))/800 lb/month = 1.0 AUM/acre





, Typically this is measured by months, not days. For most North American areas (not including the tropics) a typical grazing season is between 4 to 6 months. More southern grassland areas, like in California and down into Florida and Texas, are more flexible with being able to graze for 12 months a year. Thus, let's assume you live an area where you are only wanting to graze these 100 cows (see step 1 above) for 4 months.



Only use days if you are splitting up the pasture into multiple paddocks to rotationally graze your cattle in.

You can use days for this formulation. Since most of these calculations are used by months, to determine days, divide by 30.5 (because not all months of the year have 30 days).





, As mentioned in step 2 above, one animal unit is equal to one 1000 lb cow-calf pair. Thus, the resulting number will be in terms of those animals and not the actual average size of the cows to be grazed on your piece of land.

The formula for determining number of animal units is (Pasture size x Stocking rate ) / Time to graze (months)

Therefore, as per our example, Number of Animal Units = (160 acres x 1.0 AUM/acre) / 4 months = 40 AUs



, Most modern cows are not 1000 lb, but rather 1400 lb. If we use 1400 lb cows, then to adjust for animal unit equivalencies by weight, we simply divide the actual average weight of the cows by the weight of the standard animal unit, like so: 1400 lb / 1000 lb = 1.4 AUE., Taking the number of animal units calculated from step 4, which was 40 AUs, divide by the AUE calculated in step 5, to get 28.57 AUEs on 160 acres for 4 months.

To calculate, incorporating step 5: Animal Unit Equivalents = Number of AUs / (Actual animal weight / Animal unit weight); thus AUEs = 40 AUs / (1400 lb / 1000 lb) = 28.57.

In other words, you can have around 29 cows (weighing an average of 1400 lbs) graze your 160-acre parcel of land for four months.



, Monitor pasture conditions and the grazing behaviour of the cows. If they are not getting enough (as in, they do not have their heads down most of the time grazing, but moving around excessively), then it may be time to pull them out and move them to another area to allow the pasture to rest.

It's important to understand that these calculations are merely a guide and an estimation. They are not exact, nor ever will be. It's up to you, as manager, to pay attention to the resource (forage) the cows need in order to both keep your cows happy, and not cause significant damage to the land.

Use a pet carrier if possible.,
Carry a dog with a minor injury in your arms.,
Carry large dogs on a stretcher.,
Use a soft material as a stretcher.,
Move a large dog on you own.,
Muzzle the dog.",How to Carry an Injured Dog1," If you have a pet carrier that you can safely place the dog in, do so. This is the best option to protect both you and the dog. Encourage it to lie down, and support its body with anything soft to minimize movement during transportation.For more significant injuries, or in scenarios where the dog is having trouble breathing or is unconscious, you’ll want to move it as little as possible. See the section in this article on dealing with specific injuries.;
, If you do not have a carrier, the dog only has a limb injury, and you can carry it safely with both arms, it is fine to do so. Use one to support the chest, and reach over with your other arm, looping it beneath the dog’s abdomen, just in front of its hind legs.Do you best not to move or otherwise agitate an injury, but make sure to fully support the dog's body with your arms.

, If another person is available to help, use something stiff, such as a board, to carry a large dog or a dog that is seriously injured. Position the dog on its side, taking care not to bend its body. If you have anything soft, wedge it along the dog’s body to minimize its movement.


When lifting with the assistance of another person, position yourselves on either side of the stretcher. Bend and lift simultaneously, using your legs to support the weight. Position your hands as far apart from one another as is comfortable.
The tray from a dog crate is another good option for a stretcher.
If you have something that can secure the dog in place, such as a belt, use it to do so.Always position a fastening device over the shoulders or hips, so as not to obstruct the ribs or abdomen.

, If you have no stiff, mobile surface, a blanket or coat can be used as well. Position the material beneath the dog in a way that will support its body lengthwise. If the material is not large enough to hold the dog in place while moving, use something to fasten it to the stretcher.A soft material will only help you carry a dog if you have another person to assist you. Stand on opposite sides of the material and lift from the corners, pulling away from one another to keep the material as taught as possible. Prevent the dog's body from bending as much as you are able.
If you are alone, you may need to drag the dog, but can still use a stretcher to help you do so.

, If you are alone, position the dog so that it is laying on its side. Place a board or blanket behind the dog's back, along its spine. Position yourself behind the dog as well. Tightly grip a fold of the dog’s skin above its neck with one hand and above its hips with the other. Pull the dog carefully onto the board or other material. Lift one edge of the stretcher and drag it in the direction of help., Even if you know the dog and it is always friendly and gentle, you should almost always put a muzzle on an injured dog. Pain, shock, and confusion can cause even well-behaved dogs to panic and bite at you or someone else.If you do not have a muzzle, use a long strip of gauze or even a leash to make one. Drape it across the dog’s muzzle, wrap it around its jaws, and wrap it back behind the ears to fasten.
Do not muzzle the dog if it is vomiting or having trouble breathing.
Remove or loosen a muzzles, especially a makeshift muzzle, once the dog is settled. Never leave a muzzle on a dog if you are unable to directly observe it."
"
Ask them directly.,
Use a friendly tone.,
Give them a reason.,
Be honest.",How to Get People to Pick up After Their Dog1," Talking to another dog owner about picking up their dog’s waste can be uncomfortable, but asking the owner directly to pick up after their dog will often work to fix the problem. There are many reasons people don’t pick up after their dog. Maybe they think no one notices or that their actions (or non-actions in this case) don’t directly affect those around them. Asking the person directly lets them know you, and others, have noticed their actions and are being affected negatively by them.


Some people choose to leave notes or signs around their communities in hopes that the culprit will take notice and correct their actions. While this may work to create awareness of the problem, it may not persuade someone who doesn’t believe they are doing anything wrong or who doesn’t think anyone knows they are the culprit.If you are going to leave a sign, however, it may help to make it humorous. Some people respond better to funny or witty notes about picking up their dog’s poop.;
, Although you are probably fed up and mad at a dog owner that isn’t cleaning up after their dog, approach them in a friendly manner. Yelling at them may make them defensive and angry and will likely do more harm than good in resolving the issue.Don’t confront them when you are angry. For example, maybe you just saw this person’s dog go to the bathroom in your front yard and you witnessed the owner walk away without picking it up. If you are too angry to have a friendly conversation with them about it at this time, wait a few days and confront them once you have calmed down.

, It’s possible this person doesn’t realize how their neglect in picking up after their dog is negatively affecting those around them. When you ask them to pick up their dog’s waste, give them a reason why you want them to do so.For example, say “I know it can be unpleasant picking up after your dog, but my children play in our front yard often and I am afraid they might get sick from your dog’s poop. Can you please pick up after your dog?”

, When confronting someone on this issue, don’t exaggerate the truth or make up reasons they should comply with your request. Be honest with them about why you want them to pick up after their dog and what could happen if they don’t.For instance, don’t tell someone that their failure to pick up after their dog is ruining the lives of everyone in the community. This is likely an exaggeration of the truth and may be brushed off as such.
Instead, tell them that you are frustrated that you have to continually pick up their dog’s poop to keep your kids from getting in it. Be honest about how their actions are negatively affecting your life. Hopefully they will relate to your truthfulness and change their ways.

Check for evidence of a spine injury.,
Position an unconscious dog’s head.,
Do not splint a clearly broken limb.,
Stop uncontrolled bleeding.",How to Carry an Injured Dog2," If the dog has injured their spine, it is especially important that you carry them on a firm, stiff surface. Evidence of a spine injury include immobility or wobbliness in the rear legs, unconsciousness, differently-sized pupils, partial or complete paralysis, or blood flowing from the dog’s orifices.There are many options for flat surfaces to use as stretchers. Aside from a board, you can use a sled, table leaf, bookshelf, ironing board, or even a window screen.Make sure the dog lays on its side, and that its body is not twisted while moving it carefully onto the stretcher. Have someone help you carefully move them onto the stretcher, if possible.

, Position the head of an unconscious dog in normal alignment with the dog’s body. With the dog on its side, this means the snout should be pointed forward or a bit downward. This is important to maintain both airflow to the lungs and blood flow to the brain. If the dog has vomited, position the head slightly downward, to allow vomit to easily vacate the dog’s mouth.Be aware the a dog that has suffered a head injury is likely to vomit, even if they are unconscious.

, If the dog’s limb is clearly broken, wrap it in something clean, such as gauze or a towel and tape it in place. The goal is reducing movement of the leg. As you move the dog, make sure to support the entire limb, so that it cannot bend at the point where it was broken or fractured.Do not attempt to push broken bones back into place.

, If the dog bleeds continuously for more than five minutes, you need to take steps to control the bleeding. First, apply pressure with a clean material, ideally a padded bandage or gauze. This will at least slow the loss of blood. If you have wrap and/or tape, wrap a bleeding wound with tension equal to gently pressing on the wound."

Minimize spine and neck movement during transportation.,
Cover the dog.,
Have someone else drive.,
Call the vet en route.",How to Carry an Injured Dog3," While carrying a dog on a stretcher or driving them, wedge anything you have that’s soft around the dog’s body to keep their body from moving around unnecessarily. Pillows or rolled up towels and blankets are ideal., Unless it is quite warm, use a blanket, towel, or piece of clothing to wrap the dog during transportation. Not only will this calm the dog down, if will prevent heat loss that may occur due to shock or injury., If anyone else is around, have someone else drive to the vet. This will allow you to help keep the dog from moving around. Further, this will keep you from driving distractedly., Call the veterinary hospital to let them know you’re on your way. Describe the dog’s injuries to help the vet prepare for your arrival and start helping the dog as efficiently as possible. If no one else is around to drive, complete the call before getting on the road.Another benefit of calling ahead is ensuring that the vet you're heading for is capable of treating your dog. If they are not, you may be able to have a vet meet you there for emergency service, or they can tell you where to go instead.

Inform them of the rules and the law.,
Debunk some common misconceptions.,
Let them know the health risks.,
Tell them about environmental risks.",How to Get People to Pick up After Their Dog2," It is also possible that people who don’t pick up after their dogs are unaware of your neighborhood’s rules on the subject. When you ask them to pick up after their dog, be sure to let them know that this is a practice all dog owners in your community are expected to perform. It is not optional.You could say, “We take picking up after our dogs very seriously in this area. Everyone is held accountable for picking up after their pet and we, as a community, help enforce this policy. If this issue remains a problem, you could face a fine and nobody here wants it to come to that.”

, Another reason people might think it is okay to leave their dog’s feces on the ground is that they believe it will break down naturally. This is not the case, however. Dog waste can actually take months or years to break down, and when it does it can deposit loads of toxins and bacteria into the soil.If you find someone who is not picking up after their dog, open up a conversation with them and discuss some of the reasons this is an unhealthy practice.


Another common misconception people have about dog poop is that, like cow poop, it can be used as a fertilizer. They might also believe that the next rain will break down the feces and wash away any dangerous bacteria it carries. The fact is, the safest way to dispose of dog waste is to bag it and throw it away, every time., Leaving your dog’s waste on the ground carries some serious health risks for both people and dogs. Unfortunately, many dog owners may not be aware of these risks, and therefore, don’t understand the implications of not picking up after their pet. Let them know how leaving feces on the ground can impact their health, their family’s health, and the health of their dog.


One gram of dog waste contains 23 million fecal bacteria.A dog can track a variety of dangerous pathogens into the home by stepping in their own waste. These pathogens can include a number of things like E. coli, giardia, and tapeworms., Dog waste that is not taken care of can also affect the environment. It contains toxins that seep into the soil as they decompose, ultimately affecting our fresh water supply. Once again, dog owners may not be aware of the severity of the effects that not picking up after their dog can cause.


Water filtration systems are not designed to filter out dog waste. Eventually, it will make its way into our rivers, lakes, oceans, and our drinking water.
The Environmental Protection Agency warns that dog waste is as harmful to our environment as chemical and oil spills. The pathogens contained in dog waste can make local waters unusable and can cause serious illnesses in people."

Ensure garbage cans are easily accessible.,
Suggest alternatives to using a bag.",How to Get People to Pick up After Their Dog3," One of the most common excuses heard for why an owner isn’t picking up after their dog is that they forgot to bring a bag. A simple solution is to offer them one. Make sure you carry poop bags with you at the dog park or on a walk around your neighborhood and offer them to people who neglect to pick up after their pup.


If you see someone failing to pick up after their pet try saying something like this: “I notice you didn’t pick up after your dog. Do you need a bag? I’ve got plenty and I’ve forgotten one before so I’m happy to give you some!” Chances are, the person will accept your offer and pick up their dog’s waste., Making sure bags are available 24/7 can also help with this problem. If your neighborhood or local dog park does not have bag dispensers, contact your local officials to suggest they be added.When contacting your local officials, calling their office may be more effective than writing a letter or email. Speaking in person about an issue at a community meeting can also be very effective.
Whichever method you use, make sure you are polite, respectful, and provide suggestions on how to fix the issue instead of just complaining. Also, avoid sending a pre-written mass letter or email. These will most likely get a cookie-cutter response without receiving much attention. Finally, do your best to speak to someone specific. Research your officials and ask to speak to the person most likely to take action.Be prepared to support your request with information about the health and environmental risks dog waste can have. This will make your argument much more convincing and, hopefully, you’ll receive quicker action.

, In addition to having bags readily available, garbage cans need to be easily accessible as well. If they aren’t available in public places, like dog parks, place a call to your county’s waste department and suggest garbage cans be added. People will be more likely to pick up after their dog if they know they’ll be able to quickly dispose of the bag of waste.


Also, ensure these garbage cans are placed in the most heavily trafficked areas. The more convenient they are to people, the more likely they are to get used., Some people may not be physically able to pick up after their dog using a bag. They may have back problems that prevent them from being able to bend down, or have a particularly sensitive gag reflex. If you run into someone facing these problems, suggest they use an alternative method. There are several types of devices made for these issues:


The most common device is a stick with a bag attached to the end. You simply scoop the waste into the bag from a standing position, tie the bag, and dispose of it.
There are also bag-less products that suck the waste up through a tube. When you’re ready to dispose of your dog’s poop with these devices, you just press a button on the device and release the waste into a garbage can.
For those who don’t like to carry a poop bag around, there are products that allow you to clip to your dog’s waste bag to its leash until you find a garbage can. Some of these products include the Poopy Carrier, The H-Clip, and The Fifth Paw. You can also make your own carrier by attaching the bag to the leash with a binder clip."

Set up video surveillance.,
Use DNA testing.,
Alert the authorities.",How to Get People to Pick up After Their Dog4," If the suggestions above aren’t working, you may have to use more advanced approaches, depending on your situation. Some people find it helpful to set up video cameras around apartment buildings and in communities. If people know they are being watched, they’re more likely to comply with rules regarding pet waste.


This isn’t an option for everyone. For example, as a homeowner in your community, you may not have enough pull to get cameras installed, but this can be a very doable option for people who own rental properties.

, DNA testing is also being used in some cases. Some apartment complexes are resorting to collecting the DNA of any dogs living in their buildings. If there is a recurring problem, the waste collected can be tested and matched to the dog and owner., As a last resort, alert the authorities about someone who refuses to pick up after their dog. The right authority might be the president of your home owner’s association, your landlord, or in very extreme cases, the police. If someone continually refuses to pick up after their pet, there may be no other option than to impose whatever penalties are stipulated in your community.

Blot the area.,
Make a cleaning solution.,
Pat down the area.,
Rent a carpet cleaner.",How to Clean up Dog Urine2," To remove dog urine from the carpet, start by adding water and a few drops of dish soap to a thick cluster of paper towels. Place over the area of the carpet that your dog urinated on. Using your foot or a gloved hand, press down the mess lightly to absorb as much as possible., Mix one cup of white vinegar and one cup of water. Add a tablespoon of baking soda, stir and pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Spray a thick layer of the mixture onto the soiled area of the carpet and let it sit for 5-6 minutes.You can also opt for a store-bought carpet cleaning spray, but avoid products containing chlorine, ammonia and sodium lauryl sulfate, which can be harmful to pets.

, With a fresh cloth, gently blot the area to absorb the solution. Let the carpet air dry. Keep pets away from the damp carpet while it dries., If the area is still stained, or if it still smells like urine after your first attempt to clean it, consider renting a carpet cleaner. Cleaners are usually available at local hardware stores or grocery stores for rental periods of 24 hours or more. Opt for a hot water extraction cleaner, the rates for which start at $20 a day for less expensive models.Be sure to follow directions carefully when using a rented carpet cleaner.

Locate the source of the smell.,
Clean up any liquid.,
Wash the floor with detergent and warm water.,
Apply an enzymatic urine removal product.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement1," Urine is one of the most common pet odor problems. For people whose dog spends a lot of time in their basement, figuring out how to remove the urine smell from concrete or cement can be tricky. The first thing you’ll need to do is locate the source of the urine smell.


If you catch your dog in the act, or shortly after, this will be easy, you just look for the wet spot on your cement.
However, dried stains can be harder to find. To find a dried urine stain, look for any areas that are discolored or any rings on your floor caused by a puddle of liquid.
If you are unable to locate the source, try using a blacklight to identify any previously soiled areas.;
, If you’ve found a fresh puddle from your dog, clean up the urine as quickly as possible to keep it from seeping into the concrete any more than it already has. You can use a towel, paper towels, or kitty litter to absorb any liquid that is still on the ground., Once you have removed the excess liquid, scrub the concrete with dish soap and warm water to remove any stains left on the concrete. Avoid using a wire brush as this can scrape the concrete., Urine can be tough to clean because traditional cleaning products do not break down the uric acid crystals in urine. To get rid of odor and stains from urine, use an enzyme-based cleaner. Apply the cleaner according to the directions on the packaging.Most pet supply stores carry pet-safe enzyme-based cleaners.
You can also try making your own enzymatic cleaner by combining three parts water to one part vinegar, baking soda, and dish detergent. Generally, however, store bought enzymatic cleaners have been found to work better on urine stains and smells."

Decide to start composting.,
Gather materials.,
Create an area where you will compost.,
Layer the compost pile.,
Sprinkle the pile with water until the first layer is moistened.,
Care for your compost pile weekly.,
Use the compost appropriately.",How to Compost Dog Poop," Simply put, composting is the process of taking organic (living or once-living material) material and breaking it down into a nutrient rich soil additive. This great soil additive has valuable nutrients that help plants to grow.When composting you take a natural process and speed it up by using heat, aeration (adding oxygen), and moisture.Bacteria, fungi, molds, earthworms, insects, and other soil organisms break the compost materials down into a useful material.Compost consists of both dry and moist materials. The moist materials are those that have a high nitrogen content, like manure, food waste, or grass clippings, and dry materials are materials that have a high carbon content, like dried leaves, straw, or sawdust.These items need to be mixed in a specific ratio in order to make good compost.;
, You will need a container to keep your compost in. This can be a commercial compost bin or simply bricks or concrete blocks to contain the pile. You will also need a shovel or garden spade, a long stemmed thermometer (which can be found at hardware stores), a carbon source (such as sawdust), and access to a hose or watering can.

, It would be best to use a far corner of your yard to keep it out of the way of animals or children. You will need a yard site that is at least 3 feet by 3 feet.


If you are building your own compost container, use the bricks or concrete blocks to outline the area you’ve chosen.
Make sure it isn’t under building eaves where a lot of water could run into it.

, Place a 3 inch layer of sawdust on the bottom of the area. Next put in the dog poop. Then place a 1 inch layer of sawdust over the dog poop, along with a shovelful of dirt.


Mix this together and cover with another layer of sawdust.
You will have to use your judgement but the correct ratio is 2 parts dog poop to 1 part sawdust., Do not soak it totally but the pile needs to be moist. The organisms that break down the dog poop need moisture to function.Then put the thermometer deep into the pile, making sure not to go into the ground. Record the temperature on your calendar.

, You will need to take your shovel or spade and “turn” the pile (mix it up) once a week. This will assure that it is properly aerated and that all the material is decomposing evenly.


Also take weekly temperature readings (before turning) and record. The target number is 140 ° F. This will generally be reached in 4-8 weeks, when the waste and sawdust has turned into a material that looks much like soil., Do not use this compost on any plants or shrubs you use for food. It cannot be certain that dog poop compost is safe for use on fruit or vegetable plants."

, Cattle are divided into different classes and types, based on intended production (growth, lactation, reproduction), age, gender, weight, breed, body condition score (level of fatness), how much weight they need to gain or lose on a daily basis, and even intended slaughter weight. Within these animal types, listed below, are other pieces of information to present when formulating a ration.








Lactating cows: Period of lactation (how long they have been producing milk), number of lactations (or how many times, per production cycle, has a cow produced milk in her life), how much milk she is production (in weight, not volume), pregnancy status (is she bred, and if so how far along), and expected birth weight.

Dry (non-lactating) cows: Generally whether a non-lactating cow is bred or not is of significant importance. If she is bred, like with lactating cows, the question that comes is how many months is she pregnant.

Bred heifers: Same information is required as for dry cows.






Feeders and Replacements: Age, gender/sex, and desired average daily gain (ADG) is really important for this cattle type. Also important to note are if ionophores are needing to be fed, if the animals have received implants, if MGA is being fed (applicable to heifers only), targeted slaughter weight (or mature weight for replacement heifers and bulls), and targeted grade, marbling and yield at slaughter.

Herd bulls: All information already mentioned, minus that for lactation, pregnancy and carcass evaluation, is needed.

, Mentioned above were different animal types and the various characteristics and factors that set them apart. These, and other characteristics determine whether an animal (or a select group) will have high (or low) requirement for nutrients based on how much they are expected to consume per day and thus grow, gain, lose or maintain in muscle mass or body condition.


Body weight. Probably the most important question to know the answer to in asking just how to feed cattle (and how much) is how much do your animals weigh? It makes no difference if the weight is in pounds or kilograms.






Sex or gender. From a nutritional aspect, gender plays a very minor role in the differences of nutritional requirements. Studies have shown that nutritional requirements between heifers and steers or heifers and bulls (or cows and bulls) are not statistically different, rather that differences in gender only affect growth rates (also to a minor extent) and how nutrients are allocated to bodily tissues: either as muscle or fat. For example, if growth rate between a group of steers and heifers was the same, and they were fed the same ration, the heifers would be more likely to lay down more fat than steers will.The only concern with gender is the actual diet formulating, especially when it comes to cows. Females, especially mature cows, are probably the most difficult to formulate for because they have different requirements that are associated with where they are in their reproductive cycle (i.e., how many months into pregnancy they are, or how far along in their lactation cycle they are).

Heifers can be difficult too because of their growth requirements and, if they are pregnant or producing milk for a calf, the reproductive strain it puts on their bodies. Cattle don't stop growing until they are around 3 or 4 years old (depending on breeding), and a heifer that is pregnant at 18 months old (bred at 15 months), or suckling a calf or producing milk as a young dairy cow at 26 months old (calved at 24 months), is going to need careful consideration surrounding what the best diet she can be fed without putting too much fat on her while at the same time giving her sufficient energy to produce milk and to grow.





Reproductive Ability: This is not nearly so important in bulls and steers as it is in cows and heifers, however bulls have nutritional requirements that surround and affect their breeding ability and fertility. With females though, both timing in the gestation and lactation period will determine where cows and heifers are in nutritional requirements.


Gestation and Lactation. Since the average length of gestation is 285 days or about 9.5 months, three stages of pregnancy are apparent: first, second, and third trimester. Also, a cow is most likely also lactating during her pregnancy. Dairy cows lactate for a full 10 months, beef cows may be lactating (suckling a calf) for 6, 8 or even 10 months after calving. Females are usually bred back 2 to 3 months after they have calved. Because these dates and times coincide so closely together, nutrient requirements are mainly affected by whether the cow is in fact lactating, versus in pregnancy.

Nutritional requirements with gestation/pregnancy alone do not begin to increase until a cow is in her last trimester (last three months of pregnancy). Her nutritional requirements continue to climb after she has given birth.

Requirements of the heavy-pregnant cow increase because the fetus in her is growing and needing more energy and protein to grow. Careful consideration needs to be made with either essential, and often limiting, nutrients because of the fear of cows having problems giving birth (dystocia). However, note that there is some data correlating with how genetics for calf size at birth (in terms of birth weight) is more determined by the genetics of the bull, very little by the dam.Once a cow has given birth, she begins to suckle a calf (beef cows), or lactate to be put as part of the milking cow herd (dairy cows). Both types of cows will experience a climb of nutritional requirements until they reach 2 months after calving (some won't reach the peak until 3 months after calving). Nutritional requirements emphasize need for more energy, protein, calcium, phosphorus, and other vitamins and minerals. And since a lactating cow is producing milk for either her calf or for all those cow-milk-hungry humans out there, she also needs more water. This is also the point in time where a cow is re-bred via natural service (bull) or artificial insemination (AI).
After she has passed the 2- or 3-month lactation and re-breed mark, nutritive requirements decrease along with milk production. By the time the beef cow weans her calf at usually 6 or 8 months post-calving (she should be into her second trimester by then), her nutrient requirements dip significantly until she begins her third trimester again. Dairy cows' nutritional requirements decrease less dramatically because they are not ""dried off"" (milk production is slowed to nothing by stopping regular twice-per-day milking) until they have reached 10 months post-calving and are a third of the way into their last trimester.
All of these timings of gestation and lactation are why it is important to keep records on your animals. The better records you keep on calving, breeding, lactating, and weaning (the latter especially for beef herds), the more accurate you can get with keeping on top of a healthy ration for your cows and heifers.



Considering Replacement and Bred Heifers. As mentioned above, heifers need a little more attention because they are still growing, replacing their baby-calf teeth, and also are feeling the strain with becoming new mothers for the first time (or new to the milking dairy herd). Their nutritional requirements with regards to gestation and lactation are no different from the mature cows. However, energy supplied must be limited so that they are not putting on too much fat which will compromise milking ability and calving ease later in life. Fat deposits in the udder hinder proper mammary tissue growth and maturity, and too much fat in the birth canal make it more difficult for heifers to push out a calf. Heifers must be fed to encourage growth and some fat deposition so they are in good condition when it's time for them to give birth.

Cull Cows/Heifers. Cows and heifers can be culled regardless if they are pregnant or not, or have a calf at side or not, and as mentioned in the How to Cull Cattle article, are culled for a variety of reasons. Cull cows can be marketed as open (not pregnant), bred (pregnant), or even bred with calf at side (three-in-one). Feeding requirements for cull females are no different than if they were a part of the breeding herd. They may be destined for slaughter, but nutrition shouldn't be compromised or considered a ""specialty"" just because they're suddenly culls. However, feed requirements do regard serious consideration when their body condition is under par. Feeding according to body condition score will be covered later in this section.

Herd Bulls. Fertility of the bull is of serious importance in regards to nutrition and feeding. Since the bull-to-cow ratio is high (1:25 to 1:50), fertility of bulls is much more imperative than for cows because of how important it is, ideally and especially for beef cow-calf herds, to have every cow bred and give birth to a live, healthy calf. Body condition of the bull plays a large part, because there's nothing worse than having a bull that is too thin to breed all the cows (not enough energy to service every opportune estrogen-hyped cow in a short period of time), or to fat to try to mount any (too much condition impairs both sperm production and even libido of the bull himself). Bulls often come out of the breeding season thinner than when they went in, so the time they have to rest up is the best opportunity to feed them up so that they gain back what they lost chasing after all those enamoured cows.









Feeding for Slaughter. Feeding cattle for slaughter comprises of two groups of cattle: those that are backgrounded, and those that are finished.







Backgrounding/Stocker Cattle: Heifers and steers that are being ""backgrounded"" or ""stockered"" are those that have just been weaned and are being raised on a forage-dominant ration, plus pasture (possibly), for six to 12 months. The reason for this phase is so that the calves can focus on developing bone, building muscle, and growing in frame rather than becoming literal butter-balls like if they were fed a high-energy, high-grain diet. Carcass quality is considered ""good"" if the carcass doesn't contain a lot of external fat to trim off and too much marbling or intramuscular fat. Packers prefer meat that is relatively lean, does not have a lot of extra-muscular fat to trim, and moderate marbling. All this is affected by how beef calves are fed before they are finished. The better quality forage they get that contains sufficient energy and optimum protein, calcium, phosphorus, and trace minerals needed for their health and growth, the better they will grow and look when they transition to the feedlot or ""finishing"" phase.

Feeder/Finisher Cattle. Time to reach a finishing weight and/or body condition is generally four to six months, depending on the breed. This is especially true with cattle fed in a commercial feedlot or drylot. When finished on grass, finisher cattle will take longer to reach a decent size, weight and condition score to be slaughtered for beef. Where grain-finished cattle are sent to the packers when they are from 18 to 24 months of age, forage-, pasture- or grass-finished cattle won't get the cap-bolt gun until they're 30 to 36 months of age. Between that time and entry into this finishing phase, energy and protein requirements aren't as important as the target weight, average daily gain, and body condition that are needed to be achieved in the given amount of time.









Body condition score (BCS). Body condition scoring is judging the level of fat the animal is carrying. As described in the linked article previously, condition scoring is done by looking and/or feeling the latter half of the animal, from the ribs to the pelvic region. The lower the score, the thinner the animal. In the Canadian system, the score goes only up to 5 (1 to 5 scoring). In the American System, it goes from 1 to 9.

Lower scoring animals in your herd mean that you will need to compensate and adjust what you're feeding so that those animals can gain weight. Thinner animals tend to have higher requirements for nutrients than those that have a moderate score or higher. This can translate into higher consumption levels. This also means that you need to invest more in higher-quality feed to bring those animals up to a desired body condition by a certain amount of time (calving, breeding, or even as meat cattle for sale).
It's different with fatter or moderate-framed cattle. With these, you have to manage feed so that they're either maintaining their weight, or losing some of it. It's actually easier to make a cow lose weight than for her to gain it, economically and metabolically speaking, which will be explained in more detail in the section on ration creation below.
Body condition score is an especially good indicator of where particular individual cattle may be in the pecking order. Thinner cows may be the hard-keeper cows that need more energy and protein than the rest of the herd, but they may actually be those that are being bossed around too much and can't get the nutrients that they need for themselves. The fatter cows, too, may either the bossy cows or the easy keepers or both.

Cattle on the lower end of the pecking order tend to be less competitive for food than those that are considered the ""boss"" animals: The bigger bulls, bigger/stronger cows, more robust animals, etc. The ""bossy"" or ""bully"" cattle tend to come in when the weaker ones try to get at the feeder first to get what they can, and push those weaker cattle out so they can eat what they like until they are full. The lower-pecking-order cattle don't get what the need themselves, so become thinner than the bossier cattle. Separating the two groups into different pens can help remediate this. Or, spreading feeding stations around may also help because it gives those lower down in the pecking order a chance to get what they need with lowered competition from the bovine bossies in the herd.





Desired average daily gain (ADG): How much weight an animal, no matter the class or type, is expected to gain or even lose during the feeding period. This is all determined by what condition those animals are in, if they're growing, and/or if they are being raised for meat.






ADG, along with BCS, is actually a good way to determine feed efficiency, residual feed intake, foraging ability, etc. of your cattle. Those animals that can maintain their weight on feed that may typically cause a dairy cow to quickly lose condition, would be considered as having good feed efficiency. On the other hand, those that need a little extra ""boost"" with some grain or extra pellets are those that need to be watched for potential weight loss. If a beef cow-calf producer were looking for cows that are ""feed efficient"" or ""good on feed/pasture"" in his/her herd, the drop in condition and even how much more feed is needed (in a general, or somewhat ambiguous sense) to maintain those animals needs to be monitored to know which cows may need to be culled eventually. This can be especially concerning during times of feed shortages caused by drought or abnormally dry conditions.
Target ADG is really important with growing cattle, regardless if they are meant for the meat market or for the breeding herd. Young cattle should be growing and gaining weight at at least 1.5 to 3 pounds per day. ADG of 3 lb/day is pretty high, and optimum for feedlot cattle, but probably not so practical for either feeders or replacement heifers and bulls! As discussed above, the primary reasons for that is to avoid too much fat deposition in and around the reproductive tracts of either animals, which will impair fertility, milking ability and calving ease (latter two being crucial for heifers).



Breed and Type: Breeding plays a significant role in determining feed rations. Dairy cattle have higher maintenance requirements than beef cattle, and so need to be considered differently. The kind of formulation used for lactating dairy cows in a dairy milking system is more complex than one for beef cattle, thus the formulation for dairy cows is usually separate from that intended for beef cattle. However, there are some feed rations out there that account for dairy cattle requirements, except they are not as precise or individualized as a feed formulator for each individual dairy cow would be. That said, breeding, more within beef than dairy, plays a role in what requirements need to be met and how.






Dairy cattle breeds comprise of Holstein, Jersey, and Brown Swiss, to name a few. In a feed formulation, Simmentals are also included with dairy because the NRC (Nutritional Research Council, 1996) had listed several research trials that showed how these cattle, despite being classed as a beef breed, needed the same level of energy to meet maintenance requirements than other beef breeds. Fleckviehs are similar to, if not the same breed, as the Simmental.
Beef cattle breeds (aside from Simmentals) are generally lumped into three categories: British-type, Continental, and Exotics.

British breeds include Angus, Shorthorn and Hereford. Typically, these are your average ""range"" cattle or those cattle that have lower maintenance requirements and thus are considered better converters of feed into milk or muscle. However, some changes in breeding have also made a lot of continentals sufficient ""range cattle"" too.
Continental breeds such as Charolais, and Limousin may require more ""pampering,"" or rather the need to give more supplementation in energy and protein when on a roughage or grass-only diet. But, if hay and grass quality is quite poor (more below in the feed and ration creation sections), then both will need some ""pampering"" to do more than just survive on grass alone.
Exotics include the Brahman-type cattle like Santa Gertrudis, Nellore, and Sahiwal, and composites like Brangus and Braford cattle. The first group is linked separate because they need a little higher maintenance requirements than either the non-Simmental Continental group and the British-type group.





, In terms of assessing your animals themselves, hair depth, hair condition, and hide thickness are related factors associated with changes in environmental conditions, especially going from summer to winter and vice versa. The next section below also discusses how changes in climatic conditions, no matter how sudden or gradual they are, should be accounted for when determining how and what to feed your animals.


Hair depth. Length of the first layer of hair (the finer, softer hair close to the skin) should be more pronounced in the fall and winter than spring and summer when it is shed out and a light hair coat is worn. This is to allow the animal more external insulation against the cold. Depth isn't needed numerically, just whether it's as ""summer"" or ""winter.""

Hair condition. This just asks if the hair coat is wet, muddy, or snow-covered. All can compromise insulating qualities of the hair coat, and thus the threshold temperature of the animal and that animal's maintenance requirements.

Hide thickness. The thicker the hide, the greater the external insulative qualities, and vice versa for thinner skin in cattle. Herefords and Devons are known for having thick hides. Other beef breeds, from Angus to Shorthorn and Charolais to Gelbvieh are considered average. Dairy breeds and Zebu/Brahman cattle have thinner hides, but what's interesting is that Holstein-Friesians have much thicker hides than Jerseys.Note that with dairy cattle being classed as ""thin hided"" cattle is that most dairy cows are raised in a controlled environment (barn) and not outside, so they are mostly unable or lack opportunity to grow a winter coat like beef cattle are that are housed/raised outside. The referenced link above to skin thickness in cattle notes that Friesians (Holsteins) have 6.0 mm thick skin, whereas Jerseys have skin that is 5.46 mm thick (Dowling, 1955).



, Usually it is thought that cattle raised in a dry-lot or ""feedlot"" environment would need to be viewed differently in their feeding requirements compared with cattle on pasture, and there is some truth to this.

Cattle in a dry-lot have their feed harvested, stored, and brought to them compared with cattle on pasture who have to find it themselves, and may actually be more picky about what they eat (depending on pasture system set up), than the choice they have with the bale of hay. Cattle in a dry-lot also have mud to contend with, and if straw or sawdust is not offered as bedding, this will affect their consumption and requirement levels. Pastured cattle usually do not have this problem, and if they do, it's only briefly when they need to get a drink of water.
But as far as consumption levels, nutrient requirements and any other factor mentioned above are concerned, the difference between feeding cattle in a drylot versus grazing them on pasture is minimal to insignificant.

, Your location plays a very big role in feed availability, as well as environmental stressors (directly related to climatic conditions) your cattle may experience. The types of winters and summers you get, length of grazing season (which translates into length of feeding period, no matter if it's winter grazing triticale, stock-pile grazing native forages, or feeding alfalfa hay bales in a sacrifice, drylot corral), average ambient temperature, and other environmental factors will depend on what you can feed your cattle and how much they're even expected to eat.

There are crops that are more available to some producers than others depending on their location. Lespedeza, for example, is a forage introduced from Central Asia that is adapted to grow from Missouri and parts of the more moist Great Plains east to much of New England and south to Florida and Texas. You won't find this forage growing further west in Montana or north in Alberta or British Columbia. This primarily because of moisture limitations and freezing winters. Alfalfa, on the other hand, is found all over North America. Corn can be grown as a feed in much of the United States and now even the southern and a few central reaches of Canada (especially Ontario, and into the Prairie Provinces) because of the ideal heat units available for it to get 8 to 12 feet tall. Where it can't be harvested as grain, it can be used for winter grazing cattle, or harvested as silage.

, The climate you live in (directly relating to your location ), and the seasons you experience, no matter how short or long or pronounced they are, have a real deciding factor on the feeding of your animals. Environmental stressors are what you are going to be most concerned with because the climatic conditions you are or will be experiencing will affect how and what you need to feed your animals. The following list are what needs to be considered (from CowBytes5 from Alberta Ag).


Current temperatures. Nutritional requirements, and how much cattle eat, can be greater or less than average if the temperature is at -20ºC or 30ºC. If, for instance, a thin cow is trying to keep warm at -20ºC, she will eat more and need more energy. If a heavily-moderate-conditioned cow is even grazing in 30ºC weather, she will eat less and may even experience some heat stress (see below). Critical or threshold temperature for a cow is between 20ºC (upper) and -7ºC (lower). Generally speaking, a cow is expected to have a 1 percent increase in maintenance energy requirements for every degree lower than 20ºC. This if she is in moderate condition.


Previous month's temperature. Sometimes this is good to know because it takes time for a cow to acclimatize to a new or different temperature experienced now than the month before. Higher temperatures mean cattle will eat less, and lower temperatures indicate cattle are going to be eating more, generally.



Night cooling. This is only accounted for in hot summers. If night cooling is a factor, then intake is reduced by only around 10 percent. If not, intake is reduced a lot more (around 35 percent) because cattle are almost unable to dissipate heat accumulated during the day.

Wind speed (average). The higher the wind speed, the more the insulating capabilities of the hair coat and body condition is going to be compromised, especially in cooler seasons like autumn and winter. Wind can have a greater affect on weight gain and animal performance than ambient temperatures alone.

Mud in lot. A muddy lot can decrease dry matter intake levels by 15 to 30% especially when there's quite a bit of mud in the lot. The extent and duration of the mud can make determining dry matter intake difficult.

Heat stress. Heat stressed animals have an increase in maintenance energy requirements because they are trying to dissipate excess heat built up from ambient temperatures greater than 30ºC. According to the NRC, a 7% and 18% increase in maintenance requirements is expressed when the animal is showing rapid, shallow breathing, and when the animal is open-mouthed panting, respectfully.

Prolonged heat stress can be lethal. Over-conditioned, lactating, and dark-haired cattle are more susceptible to heat stress than any others. Animals can quickly develop heat exhaustion and heat stroke if other precautions are not taken like allowing animals access to shade, regular access to drinking water, and abstaining from stressful activities like castrating, vaccinating, dehorning, branding, weaning or even transporting during the heat of the day. If any processing of cattle needs to be done in the summer, it should be left for the cool of the early in the morning or late evening. , You have a wide variety of different types of feeds to choose from for your animals, from different types of hay to by-products to grain. What you choose to feed depends on your operation/cattle, location, your finances, and personal preferences, The main feed types (and the kind of feeds found in such feed types ) are:


Mix (combination of hay, silage, grain, supplement, mineral, salt, by-product, salt, vitamin, etc.)

Hay (grass, legume, or grass-legume mix. Pasture available for grazing may be also included in this feed type even though pasture isn't sun-cured harvested forage like hay is.)

Grain (corn, oats, barley, wheat, rye, and triticale)

Silage (corn , barley, winter wheat, rye, winter rye, triticale, oats, pasture grass)

Straw (cereal grain chaff baled; barley, oats, triticale, rye, wheat usually. Legume/pulse straw include pea, flax, lentil. Also includes greenfeed)

Chaff (similar to straw)

By-Product (distillers grains , wheat middlings, brewers yeast, bakery product, corn gluten, cottonseed meal, soybean meal, alfalfa pellets/cubes, barley malt sprouts, beet pulp, canola meal, canola cake, oat hulls, etc.)

Supplement (usually in the form of protein as a percentage with a mix of other minerals and grains. Also includes non-protein nitrogen that can be used for cattle older than 6 months old).

Salt (block or loose form. Most blocks are 95 to 98% salt and 5% or 2% mineral respectively.)

Vitamins (vitamins A, D, and E sold in various forms as a feed-mix supplement)

Minerals (Macrominerals are calcium , phosphorus , sodium , chloride , potassium , magnesium , and sulphur . Microminerals are cobalt , iodine , iron , molybdenum , manganese , copper , zinc , and selenium . Mineral bags with Ca, and P are usually sold as a ratio, as 1:1 or 2:1. Less common are mineral sold as greater than 2:1, though 7:1 is still appropriate for cattle. Macrominerals are labelled as a percentage , while microminerals are labelled as mg/kg or parts per million .)

Milk (for calves only. Cow's milk, or milk replacement formula in powder form)

Fats (tallow, sunflower oil, canola oil)

, Various feeds and feed types are obtained either through purchase from other producers, the local feed store, or that are made yourself (provided you have sufficient money, land, equipment, labour, and time to do so)., Do not test your feed right after it has been harvested, although there's nothing wrong with sticking in a probe in a hay bale to test for moisture, as is often done (or should be) when making hay. The best time to test your feed is right before or when it's going to be fed to your animals.

If the feed sample is taken right the first time, then you only need to send samples in once. But if not, like if you just did a hand-grab from a hay bale or took only one sample from one hay bale and not a selection of several out of 80 or 200 bales, then you might have to re-take and re-send in the sample again.

The only other time you would need a second sample taken is when you haven't finished feeding all your feed out to your animals before they went to pasture. If the bales are prone to weathering (i.e., they're not stored in a shed or under a tarp away from the elements), some quality may be diminished over the extended time they are kept outside, so to ensure that they still have some nutritive value left when they're going to be fed again, take samples again to have them tested.


Forage samplers, probes, or corers, which are long hollow tubes designed to ""core"" into a bale of hay, straw, green-feed, haylage, etc., or a packed silage mound, are the best to use to get a sample from deep into the bale or pile that cannot be taken from the surface (i.e., a ""hand-grab"" sample). Bale corers have widths that vary from 1/2 or 3/8"" to over 1"" or 1-1/8"". Typically the larger diameter ones work best especially if you have hay or straw that is more stemmy. Where these large corers will cut through the stems, the smaller diameter samplers might slip past them and give misleading results when the samples are sent in.

Talk to your local agriculture extension specialist, forage association, or feed store to see where and if you can buy, borrow or rent a forage sampler. Samplers range from $200 to $500 if you wish purchase one.
Take at least 10 to 20 samples per ""forage lot,"" or the silage or hay that came from one field. That means taking a sample from at least 10 or 20 bales that came from that same field to get a representative sample. For silage, that means at least 10 or 20 samples from the same pile.
Core each bale 12 to 15 inches in. The cores should be taken from the string- or netting-side of the bale, not the flat side, and pushed straight in (parallel to the ground), not at an angle. For silage, samples taken from 3 to 5 feet in. Make a slit in in the plastic before pushing the probe in so that the slit can be easily fixed with silage-plastic tape (found at your farm store where silage plastic is sold).
Options are to bag each sample, or to collect a set of samples from one lot in a clean, dry 5-gallon pail so they can be mixed and stored in plastic bags. Squeeze all the air out when you put the sampled forage in the bag, and send it to your local feed lab.

When you are asked what values you want, you will need protein, energy, fibre, fat content, and all minerals and vitamins, if applicable. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) is much more accurate at getting mineral values than wet-chemistry, so make sure you have the feed lab use that analysis for your samples.





, Sight and smell are much less accurate means of judging quality feed, but ones that are still often used and sometimes just as reliable.

Smelling the feed determines how dusty, moldy, or even smelly the feed can be. Hay and straw that are a little dustier and/or smell or look moldy may be lower quality, however if this is only appearing on the outside, the inside should be better quality.
Mold and dust are unavoidable, especially if bales are stored outdoors, or forage is baled up wetter than it should be. Moldy hay will have to be fed to cattle, but it can reduce palatability or reduce feed intake to the point that cattle may refuse the feed altogether. Certain fungal molds can produce mycotoxins which can cause health problems like infertility and abortions in breeding females. Since not all molds produce mycotoxins, the ones that do produce amounts that can be unpredictable.

Silage that has a putrid smell to it is obviously feed that is getting spoiled. Not only will it smell like rotten bananas, but it will has have a dark, slimy look to it instead (and feels slimy when handled). Like with moldy hay, this can reduce palatability. Good silage has a brownish colour that gives a sweet, fermented smell and, if tasted, the grains have a tangy, sharp, almost sweet taste.
Grains with mold can be cause for concern too. They'll have the same musty, moldy smell like hay, and may have potential for the same problems.


Hay, especially, that looks green is usually an indicator of good quality. But, green hay can still be had when it's tested to be as good quality forage as straw. Higher than normal precipitation with high temperatures, cutting mature forages, poor soil fertility, and improper curing and/or storing of bales can impact hay quality, even though the hay may look green and is not that stemmy.
Usually stemmy hay or hay with a lot of stems is deemed poorer quality hay than that with more leafy material. The reason is that stems are often less palatable and retain less energy and protein than leaves do. But, if hay is harvested during a time of a lot of moisture and a lot of heat, even hay with less stemmy material is going to be poorer quality than you'd think.

Also, forage species has a lot to do with quality. Hay obtained from dried up wetland, riparian or slough areas tends to be lower quality than hay from field with timothy, fescue, brome, alfalfa, clover, sainfoin, or trefoil.



, Pay attention to NDF (neutral detergent fibre), ADF (acid detergent fibre), TDN (total digestible nutrients), and DE (digestible energy) values for energy (carbohydrate/sugar) and fibre content, CP (crude protein) for protein content, CF (crude fat) or Ether extract (fat) for fat content, and Ca (calcium), P (phosphorus), K (potassium), S (sulphur), Mg (Magnesium), Na (Sodium), and Salt (NaCl) for macrominerals, and Fe (Iron), I (Iodine), Co (Cobalt), Cu (Copper), Mn (Manganese), Mo (Molybdenum), and Zn (Zinc) for microminerals.

All of these nutrients will be discussed more in the next section below.
Energy content and protein are especially important to pay attention to when considering which diet or what feed will contribute to weight loss or weight gain, meet requirements for lactating cows or growing calves, or be at maintenance requirements. Ideally, energy and protein should be at the optimum requirements, never too much nor too little.

If you're seeing tests that of a feed that exceeds or falls short of requirements, consideration will be needed to limit the amount fed and/or include another feed to offset the amounts.


""Macrominerals,"" also called ""major minerals,"" are minerals that are needed in large quantities or concentrations in the diet, usually on a per-gram (or per-ounce) basis. ""Microminerals"" are also called ""trace minerals,"" and are needed in smaller concentrations, often as parts per million (ppm), milligrams (mg) or nanograms (µg).

, All of these types will have different nutrient requirements especially if you have a herd that is diverse in different types of cattle. Lactating cows won't do well on a ration that is suited for dry, mature cows. And growing steers and heifers could have a ration that could make a mature bull a little gain more weight than he needs going into the breeding season.

Ideally a herd should be as uniform in nutrient needs as possible. It makes planning out what to feed and how to feed it easier. There's no avoiding having different groups of cattle to consider, like a group of bulls, a larger group of cows, some replacement heifers, and stocker steers, but to have a mix of cows especially that are in varying stages of lactation and gestation can make planning out rations harder than it needs to be. Dairy herds are like this to deliver a year-round supply of milk, but beef herds don't need to be.
Body condition score is a really good indicator of where your cattle are in nutrient needs. You may have a herd that is a mix of normal to fatter conditioned cattle or thinner cattle. If so, you may need to consider separating into groups so that the thinner cattle can meet their nutrient needs. As mentioned in the Assessing Your Cattle section above, some thinner cattle in the herd may be a sign that there is a lot of competition for feed and the bigger/fatter bossy cattle are getting too much of the good stuff, and the thinner animals the exact opposite. But, you could also have cattle with different nutrient needs. This is especially true if you have a herd with a mix of breeds, regardless if it's a breeding cow herd or a backgrounding steer herd.

, Average daily intake on a dry matter (DM) basis is a way to figure how much forage a cow will eat per day when that forage has all the water taken out of it. Dry matter weights are taken when a feed is sent to a lab and ""cooked"" or roasted until it's nothing more than crispy plant material. DMI, though, does not reflect how much a cow will eat per day on an as-fed (with a certain amount of moisture in the feed) basis. DMI is a way to take out the variation of moisture content of the feed so that how much a cow, bull, steer, heifer or calf will eat can be calculated based on the quality of the feed and the animal's nutrient/energy requirements.

Typically, then, the higher the quality of the feed, the more the animal will eat. In other words, if the feed is lower in fibre and higher in energy and protein, a bovine will consume more of it.
Lactating and growing cattle will eat more per their requirements than a mature bull, or a dry mature cow.
Numerically, the amount a bovine will eat is on a percent body weight basis. The average rate of consumption is subjective. Many publications state ""average"" percent body weight consumption as between 2.0 and 2.5 percent of body weight. But many agree that the lowest percent body weight an animal should consume is 1.0 percent (straw and low-quality feeds), and the highest at 3.0 percent (excellent quality forage)..
In order to calculate the estimate of a bovine's average daily dry matter intake, use the following formula:

Body weight (in pounds or kilograms ) x 0.025 = Daily Dry Matter Intake.
For example: 1500 lb cow x 0.025 = 37.5 lb DM forage per day.


To calculate how much a cow will consume on an as-fed basis, find out first what the moisture content of a feed is. For example, grass-hay is typically at 18% moisture. To get the dry matter content, subtract by 100: 100 – 18 = 82% DM. So, to find out how much a 1500 lb cow will eat on an as-fed basis per day, calculate it out this way:

1500 lb x 0.025 = 37.5 lb DMI; 37.5 lb DMI / 0.82 DM = 45.7 lb hay as-fed.




, Various beef and dairy publications through magazines (BEEF magazine feed composition tables for example), agricultural extension services via universities, colleges, and government agricultural ministries, and books on ruminant nutrition, will or should have feed tables available through the Internet for you to look at.

These are only general nutrient content values for many feeds that are listed. For specific nutrient content of the feed that you have on hand, look at the contents on the feed bag and/or send in a sample to a feed lab to have it tested.
Generally, these tables will give you a good idea of what feeds to consider as supplementation or alternatives for your animals. Please take note, though, of the particular feeds may or may not be available in your locale.

, Growing cattle are those were you will want to have a desired ADG to target for, ranging from 1.5 to 3 pounds a day. Stockers should have less of an ADG than finishers because they are growing more than putting on fat. ADG is determined by energy content of the diet., Energy content is expressed in terms of TDN (total digestible nutrients) or DE (digestible energy). As mentioned in the previous step, ADG for growing and finishing cattle is determined by energy content of the diet. ADG is less important for mature cows and bulls, though when needing to understand how much energy in the diet is needed for dry, pregnant cows in the middle of winter versus lactating females in summer is certainly important. Energy needs can be exceeded (to a certain extent, and as long as fibre needs are also met) for all classes of cattle in order for them to meet their maintenance and productivity requirements. Maintenance energy needs should be exceeded if a cow is too thin, but energy has to be cut back if that cow is over her desired body condition score.

The rule of thumb of energy requirements for breeding beef cows, in order to maintain their body condition score through winter, is 55-60-65: 55% TDN for mid-pregnancy, 60% TDN for late-pregnancy, and 65% TDN for after calving. Energy requirements for dairy cows is more different because TDN isn't used to determine energy requirements so much as net energy (NE) is.
Replacement heifers and stocker cattle should be fed a ration where energy is around 65 to 70% TDN so that they can achieve a rate of gain at around 1 to 2 lbs per day or higher, depending on the animals' breeding. At minimum, for growing cattle, TDN value should be no lower than 55% for maintenance and some growth. Any lower would mean loss in body condition, and possibly stunted growth. But on the flip side, diets that exceed 80% TDN can lead to problems like acidosis if there is not enough fibre to counter the effects of acidosis.
TDN and DE are evaluated on a DM (dry matter) basis.

, Cattle are ruminants and cannot subsist without sufficient fibre in the diet; if fibre was minimal (less than 15 to 20% of the total dry matter ration), damage to the rumen wall would result, as well as other problems like acidosis. Optimum fibre for cattle all cattle should be at 40 to 50%. Lower quality feeds see fibre levels climbing up to 65% of DM ration or higher, potentially causing impaction and reduction in nutrient uptake. There are no rules of thumb for fibre content of different rations for different classes of cattle.

Fibre in feed tests are expressed as neutral detergent fibre (NDF), or acid detergent fibre (ADF). NDF refers to fibre that is insoluble in neutral detergent and includes cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. It includes all plant cell wall material that is only partly digestible. Typically as NDF increases, DMI (dry matter intake) decreases. ADF refers to fibre (largely cellulose and lignin) that is insoluble in acid detergent, and comprises of the highly indigestible portions of plant material, generally the lignified material. As ADF increases, digestibility of feeds decrease.Effective NDF (eNDF) is the amount of NDF that stimulates chewing and rumen motility. Long-stemmed forages stimulate more chewing and ruminating which stimulates more salivation. As salivation increases, so does buffering capacity of the rumen. Buffering pH in the rumen is important for dairy diets and finishing rations because it helps reduce rumen pH levels from dipping below what's acceptable (i.e., pH 6 or higher). The higher the end of a feed, the greater the buffering capacity of the rumen.

, Typically, younger and lighter-weight cattle have higher protein requirements than older, heavier cattle. Lactating cows also require more protein than dry cows. Also, dairy cows need more protein than beef cows regardless if both are lactating or dry. Protein content in feeds and for livestock are denoted as crude protein (CP).

A rule of thumb for feeder/stocker beef cattle is the 14-12-10 rule: 14% CP for weaned calves 550 to 800 lbs, 12% CP for calves 800 to 1,050 lbs, and 10% CP for feeder cattle 1,050 lbs to finish (1350 to 1400 lbs).
A rule of thumb for an ""average"" (British-Continental-mix cattle excluding Simmentals, generally) pregnant to lactating/suckling beef cows is the 7-9-11 rule: 7 percent CP for mid-pregnancy cows, 9 percent CP for late-pregnancy cows, and 11 percent for post-calving nursing cows.
Some examples follow (from Beef Cattle Nutrition Series Part 3: Nutritient Requirement Tables:

A 500 lb weaned steer with an ADG of 2 pounds per day requires 12.8 percent CP. If he has an ADG of only 0.5 pound per day, he will need 8.5 percent CP. Similarly, if a 300 lb steer where to have an ADG of 3 lb/day, he would require about 22 percent CP. Lower protein available (or lower requirements) begets a lower ADG.
An 1100 lb cow with a low milking ability of only 10 lb of milk/day and 2 months post-calving requires 8.9% CP to maintain her body condition. However, if this same cow had a superior milking ability of 30 lb of milk per day, also calved 2 months ago and is having her body condition maintained, she will need around 12.5% CP.
A 1400 lb cow with 20 lbs/day of milk production and 6 months post-calving needs 7.7% CP. That may seem like it's less than the others above, because it is, but only because she's well past her peak milk production and is close to weaning her calf. But with her protein requirements when it's been 2 months since she's calved (she's at peak milk), she's needing a whopping 10.3% CP. If she were producing 30 lbs of milk, she'll be needing 11.8% CP.

To compare with the lactating cows, an 1100 lb cow that is at the end of her second trimester, and needs to increase her body condition score from a BCS of 4 to 5 (using the Body Condition Scale of 1 to 9), she will need 7.5% CP, to the point where she'll need to be fed to 9% CP soon when she is less than a month or two from calving.




Crude protein content should be on an dry matter basis when looking at feed labels or feed tests. Some feed tests also give CP in as-fed, but the more accurate measurement of protein content in the feed is by dry matter.

, Optimum Ca:P ratio should be 2:1, though ratios that are up to 7:1 aren't going to hurt cattle either. However, if phosphorus is in excess of calcium problems could occur from abnormally loose stools to inability to absorb calcium, since too much P can interfere with the body's ability to take in and utilize Ca for cellular and bodily functions.

Calcium is really important for lactating cows and heifers. Limiting Ca can cause reduced milk production, but limiting Ca so the cow is forced to utilize calcium from her body rather than depending on the feed she's given before calving will also reduce incidence of milk fever, especially in dairy cattle. But, it can be a double-edged sword because milk fever is also caused by a sudden drop of calcium in the blood after calving, so calcium levels need to be watched closely in nursing or milking cattle.
Calcium is a macro-mineral, so the NRC (Nutrition Research Council) suggests that a maximum level of 2% of a DM (dry matter) ration needs to be fed to cattle. However, dietary calcium levels in feeds vary as well as calcium needs in different classes of cattle. Not all cattle need the same amounts of calcium as the other.

Calcium is readily accessible in legumes like alfalfa, and oilseed meals are also good sources. Supplemental sources include calcium carbonate, ground limestone, and dicalcium phosphate.


Phosphorus is important for all classes of livestock, but nutrient requirements vary according to age, weight, and type and level of production. Deficiencies in phosphorus can cause a condition called pica which results in abnormal behaviours in normally herbivorous animals like cattle, which is a more severe condition coming out of depraved appetite. Cattle experiencing pica will chew wood, soil, and bones, and some serious pica cases have reported cattle eating other animals like chickens or chewing on carcasses, just so they can quench their craving for minerals like phosphorus. Pica also comes from a lack of salt, cobalt, and iodine in the diet.

The NRC suggests that the maximum phosphorus level would be 1% of DM ration.
Oilseed meals, grain, grain-by products and other high-protein supplements are typically high in P.



, Other than the Ca:P ratio discussed in the previous step, other minerals like potassium (K) and magnesium are important to look at. Other minerals like Selenium, Sulphur, Cobalt, Iodine, and Sodium need to be looked at so they don't go into toxic levels nor are deficient in the diet. This is where supplementation may be necessary with loose mineral and salt blocks or loose mineral-salt mixes. Mineral requirements are as follows:


Magnesium (Mg) requirements: Growing and finishing cattle, 0.10% of DM ration; Gestating (pregnant) cows, 0.12% of dry matter ration; Lactating cows, 0.20% of DM ration.

Potassium (K) requirements: 0.6% of total DM ration. Maximum level is 3% of total DM ration.

Sulphur (S) requirements: 0.15% of DM ration. Maximum must be at 0.4% of DM ration.

Cobalt (Co) requirements: 0.10 ppm of DM ration. Maximum tolerable level is 10 ppm, or 300 times the recommended amount.

Copper (Cu) requirements: 10 ppm of DM ration. Maximum tolerable level is 100 ppm.

Iodine (I) requirements: 0.5 ppm of DM ration, or 1 mg/day for a 1100 lb (500 kg) cow. 50 ppm is maximum tolerable level for calves.

Iron (Fe) requirements: 50 ppm of ration DM. 1,000 ppm maximum tolerable for cattle.

Manganese (Mn) requirements: 40 ppm of DM ration for mature cows and bulls, and 20 ppm of DM ration for growing finishing cattle. Maximum tolerable level is 1000 ppm.

Molybdenum (Mo) requirements: Not established. Copper and sulphate alter molybdenum metabolism, thus arriving at Mo requirements is impossible. However, maximum tolerable level is 5 ppm.

Selenium (Se) requirements: 0.10 ppm of DM ration, however the NRC suggests that 2 ppm of DM ration is maximum for all classes.

Zinc (Zn) requirements: 30 ppm of DM ration. High-milking beef cows have higher requirements, with milk containing 300 to 500 ppm of Zn. Maximum tolerable level is 500 ppm.

, Cattle outdoors on fresh forages typically do not need vitamin supplements unless there are conditions that will cause deficiency symptoms, such as a deficiency in a mineral that is closely linked with a particular vitamin, like Selenium to Vitamin E, or Cobalt to B vitamins. Certain conditions or feeds can limit vitamin availability to livestock, but typically healthy cattle that aren't grazed don't need to be supplemented regularly with nutrients like B vitamins or vitamin C, D, or K. Vitamins E and A are needed if feeds are sourced from soils that are deficient in selenium, and feeds are low quality with poor carotenoids, respectively. Vitamin requirements are as follows:


Vitamin A requirements: Variable according to class, age, and weight of cattle. On a dry ration basis, the vitamin A requirements are about as follows:

Growing finishing steers and heifers: 1,000 IU/lb (2,200 IU/kg of boy weight)
Pregnant heifers and cows: 1270 IU/lb (2,800 IU/kg of body weight)
Lactating cows and breeding bulls, 1,770 IU/lb (3,900 IU/kg of body weight)



Vitamin D requirements: 125 IU/lb (275 IU/kg of body weight) of DM ration.

Vitamin E requirements: dI-alpha-tocopherol acetate added to dry ration at level of 15 to 60 IU/kg of body weight of dry matter intake (DMI; or 0.31 to 1.25 IU/kg of body weight) in non-stressed beef cattle. Supplementation may be needed with selenium-deficient soils.

Growing calves need higher vitamin E requirements when newly weaned and just received at a new farm because they are undergoing a lot of stressed. They should get 400 to 500 IU/day (1.6 to 2.0 IU/kg of body weight). This can be decreased down to around 300 IU/day (1.25 IU/kg of body weight).
Once cattle are adapted to new conditions feedlot cattle should go back into recommendations of 25 to 35 IU/kg DMI or 0.52 to 0.73 IU/kg of body weight.



Vitamin K requirements: None recommended. Abundant in pasture and green roughage, but deficiency symptoms come about when feeding moldy sweet clover hay high in dicoumarol.

B Vitamin requirements: None, because no dietary B vitamins usually need to be supplied to cattle. Exceptions if ruminant system is adversely affected when an antagonist is present, or lack of precursors or other problems related to rumen health affect B vitamin synthesis.

, Once you know the type of cattle you have, their daily intake, their nutrient requirements, and their average daily gain (if you are feeding growing cattle), then you can form a diet based on where you live, what's available and what you wish to feed them. Of course, what you should use to feed your animals is just as important.

Hay feeders like cone or cylindrical feeders with slanted slots for the animals to fit their heads through are good for cattle. Hay feeders are ideal for reducing waste and to put large round bales in, and keeps the animals from climbing in and laying down in the feed and urinating/pooping in it further causing more waste.
Large feed bunks that are not raised (typically those used in feedlots) are ideal for feeding silage. These bunks reduce waste apart from feeding silage on the ground, and prevents animals from laying in and pooping in the feed.

You can limit how much silage is being fed in these bunks, because there's no need to fill it all up. Cattle can get really picky if they're fed too much silage, because they learn to pick through the more coarser material to get at the tastier grains.


Use raised bunks for feeding cattle grain or supplemental mix apart from the hay or silage they're being fed to reduce waste and allow them to clean up as much as possible.
Loose mineral should be fed in a sheltered unit where rain will not get into the feeder and ruin the mineral, causing it to clump up. Most farm and ranch supply stores sell mineral feeders, but you can make your own with things like an old rain barrel, a suspended tractor tire, a crafted wooden feeder, to even a modified futon or bed frame. You can use these same innovative, reuse/recycle re-inventions for feeding grain or small square bales of hay, especially if the feeder is longer and more open for more cattle to eat from.
Salt blocks can be put out on bare soil or grass, but should be put in a container that keeps it off the ground. An old tire rim, modified ATV tire with a flat iron or rubber bottom, or a purchased plastic or metal salt block holder can be used.
You can purchase or make your own feeders for holding and feeding loose mineral, salt blocks or grain for your animals. Most farm and ranch supply stores sell the kind of feeders you need, but you can make your own (which may cost you less, not including labour) using various things you don't need to use anymore from your home or around your farm. Use things like one or more rain barrels, an old tire (tractor tire can be set vertical on a frame that stabilizes and elevates it for dispensing pellets or grain at set intervals as its pulled along by a vehicle; or a horizontal-set ATV tire with a rubber bottom for holding a salt block), a re-modified futon frame, large 4"" PVC pipe for dispensing mineral that calves or cows can lick from (gravity fed from an enclosed barrel or 5-gallon pail), weeping tile, old flat-bed wagons, or anything else you can think of.

You can even just crafted feeders yourself using 2""x4"" or 2""x6"" wood planks and/or welded steel or iron frames. Just remember that it's solid enough that it can take a lot of abuse from multiple hungry, jostling, feisty 1400 lb muscular bovines (though accidents do happen), but portable enough that you can move it around easily yourself without any trouble. Repairs are never going to be a matter of if (only when). Also remember how much space is needed for each animal and how high or low to the ground these feeders need to be, i.e., 8"" space for most cattle, and around 36"" high from the ground to the top of the feeder.
Innovation, a bit of outside-the-box thinking and know-how with the tools you need (from a circular saw to an open wrench or a hammer), you can make anything you need to make for your animals.



, Forage comes in the form of pasture, hay, or silage. What species that are in the mix depends on your area and what's available. You can have pasture and hay forage that is all grass or all legume or a mix of both. Silage is primarily grass-based.

No matter what class or production-type of cattle your feeding, forage needs to be the most important part of the ration. This is so that it stimulates rumination, chewing, and buffering capacity of the rumen.

Even feedlot cattle would (and should) have a dominantly forage ration that is largely high-quality silage with grain, grain by-product and other supplement mixed in. Cattle raised for DIY home/backyard slaughter do not need to be on a similar diet, rather free-choice pasture and/or hay (high quality) with 2% of body weight of grain as-fed per day. If no grain, high quality forage is a must for a good finish.


Pasture and/or hay forage or fodder is the best type of feed for your cattle, provided it contains enough nutritive value for your cattle to thrive off of. If not, please take note of the nutritive deficiencies and supplement according to your animals needs!!

, If the hay is too low in quality, supplement with range cubes, grain, protein tubs or molasses licks to satisfy their needs for more energy and/or protein. If pasture or hay is good to excellent quality, there will be less to no need for any supplements to be supplied. However, salt and mineral must be readily accessible to cattle at all times., Also keep track of your cows nutritive requirements based on their reproductive cycles. You may need to change what you're feeding when its necessary according to what's available and what's not, and what your animals need.

Remember: any drastic changes to feeds needs to be made gradually, like if you are switching from hay to silage or from coarse hay to pasture. This just allows the rumen microbes time to adjust.

, Water, salt and mineral is a very important part of a bovine's diet. Water should be clean and clear; if watering out of a dugout, have a piping and dugout-exclosure system that eliminates the animals from going into and fowling the water, and diverts them to a more cleaner system farther away. Salt and mineral should be off the ground and (typically) sheltered from the elements to reduce waste. This more so with loose mineral than blocks., A Ruminant Nutritionist (beef or dairy) will help you determine whether you are doing the right thing or see improvements that need to be made to your feeding operation."

Use a lint roller.,
Use tape.,
Use a damp washcloth.,
Vacuum the furniture.,
Use a toothbrush.,
Don't let your home get too dry.,
Remove pet hair from upholstery and fabric with rubber gloves.",How to Get Dog Hair off Furniture1," You can roll this device over the surface of your furniture to pick up dog hair. You can be find a lint roller at any drug or grocery store. You can use a lint roller on furniture, clothing, and even your dog itself. The adhesive isn't strong enough to harm skin, furniture, or clothes.;
, Flatten a section of sticky tape against the furniture, let it sit for a few moments, and peel it away to remove stubborn dog hairs. Use broad sections of tape to make the process go more quickly. Duct tape and masking tape are good choices. You may have to do this many times to get all the hair off.


Consider making yourself a makeshift lint roller using tape, preferably masking or duct tape. Rip off a generous piece of tape and put it around your hand so that the sticky side is facing out. Then pat the furniture where the hair is so that the hair comes off with the tape. You may have use several pieces of tape depending on how much hair there is.
Be careful using duct tape (and other especially strong types of tape) on furniture that is coated in paint or another thin veneer. If you do use duct tape, don't leave it on for more than a few seconds. Strong adhesives might peel away paint from your furniture.

, Removing pet hair from any cloth surface is easy if you use a damp washcloth. Wipe cushions or clothing in one direction only and the hair will lift off. You can also try a damp sponge mop to remove pet hair from your carpets. Again, wipe in one direction only, and the hair will pile up and can be easily picked up by hand.

, Use the detachable hose of a vacuum-cleaner, use a small handheld vacuum, or lift a vacuum onto a surface a couch or chair. Depending on the type of furniture, vacuuming may or may not work.


If there is a very large amount of fur, don't vacuum it. This may clog up the vacuum or even damage it.
Consider using a shampoo vacuum cleaner for fabrics. Make sure that your pet shampoo product is safe to use on furniture.
In the future, consider brushing your dog more frequently or covering your dog's favorite furniture with blankets in order to prevent excessive shedding.

, For just a few clingy hairs, try using an old toothbrush. Dog hair is hard to clean out from between brush bristles, so do not use a toothbrush that you plan to use for anything else.

, Static electricity and low humidity make already annoying pet hair that much worse. Mitigate these two factors, and fur will remain more friend than foe.

, Wear a pair of disposable rubber gloves, and dampen them with water so the hair will stick. Run your hand over the surface to attract hair. Simply rinse off the glove when it’s covered with hair, and repeat as needed. If you don't have rubber gloves handy, try a slightly wet sponge instead. This method doesn’t use up lots of tape needlessly.


You can also spray a mix of water and fabric softener onto your upholstered furniture, then wipe the hair off.
To remove pet hair from wooden furniture, use a soft cloth and furniture polish or anti-static dusting spray. The spray will eliminate the electric charge, making removal easier and lessening the likelihood that the hair will re-stick.

Rinse thoroughly.,
Presoak the items.,
Load the washing machine.,
Add vinegar to the wash. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the softener dispenser of the machine.,
Dry the items.",How to Clean up Dog Urine3," Before washing, rinse the soiled items under cold water. Keep rinsing until you have flushed out as much of the urine as possible. Wring out excess water., Pretreat urine stains with a liquid detergent that contains enzymes; look for enzymes commonly used in cleaning products (proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases and mannanases) in the ingredients list on the product label.Fill a sink or bathtub with cold water and soak the soiled bedding or clothing for 30 minutes. Remove the items and wring them out again., Place the items in the washing machine. Set a hot water wash cycle. Add detergent; if you are washing your dog's bedding, use a mild detergent that will not cause irritation to its skin., Start the wash cycle. If there is no softener dispenser in your machine, run it as usual and add the vinegar at the beginning of the final rinse cycle.If the urine smell is too strong for these quantities, add a full cup of vinegar to the final rinse cycle.

, Run items through the dryer. Alternatively (and if possible) hang the items on a clothesline to dry. The outdoor air will help neutralize the odor of urine and freshen the fabric. Avoid using dryer sheets, which may irritate your dog's skin.

Blot the urine-soaked area.,
Soak with an enzymatic solution.,
Blot up the solution.,
Sprinkle baking soda over the spot.,
Apply a deodorizing solution.,
Scrub the area.,
Vacuum the area.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement2," As with concrete, your first task is to locate the source of the smell. If your dog has just gone to the bathroom, the carpeting will be wet. If it is an old stain, however, look for patches of carpet that are discolored or somewhat stiff to your touch.

, Use paper towels, a wadded up newspaper, or fabric towels to blot the area where your dog has peed in order to clean up as much liquid as possible. To do so, apply as much pressure as possible to the wet area (you may try walking or standing on top of the towels). Switch out your towels as they become wet, continuing this blotting process until the towels remain dry.


If possible, pull back the carpet in the urine-soaked area and place towels both underneath and on top of the carpet. This will help get the moisture out from under the carpet, allowing you to remove as much of the smell as possible., Once you have removed as much urine as possible, soak the spot with either your store-bought enzymatic cleaner or your homemade solution. Ensure you cover the entire area to get any remaining uric acid.It is a good idea to do a spot test before applying any solution to your carpeting. This will allow you to make sure the cleaning solution won’t harm or discolor your carpeting.

, Blot the area with towels again to clean up the solution. Once you have removed most of the solution, allow the spot to air dry., Once the area has dried, sprinkle baking soda over it, covering it completely., Mix ¾ cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon of liquid dish or laundry detergent. Apply this solution directly over the baking soda., Use a soft brush to scrub the area, ensuring you work the solution down into the carpet., Allow the area to dry after scrubbing and then vacuum over the area, picking up any dirt, debris, and dust from the affected area."
"
Cover your furniture.,
Groom your dog.,
Teach your dog not to climb on the furniture.,
Consult your vet.",How to Get Dog Hair off Furniture2," Many people use plastic sheeting to preserve their furniture. However, this method is often viewed as pointless or inconvenient due to noise, discomfort, and opacity of the plastic.


You may also consider spreading out an old towel or blanket where your dog likes to lay. You can wash the towel whenever you like, and you can put it away when guests come to visit.
If your dog tends to climb on one particular piece of furniture and lay in the same spot, you may be able to keep hair off that furniture by protecting the spot. Some pet stores sell furniture covers specifically made for dogs.

, Consider brushing your dog more frequently, giving it haircuts, and giving it baths. Use a grooming brush to comb away loose hair.


Brushing your dog about two days a week dramatically cuts down on the amount of fur tumbleweeds rolling through your living room.
Give your dog a haircut once a month. It may stop shedding so much fur if you take control of the process.
Give your dog a bath once or twice a month, or as frequently as you like. After the bath, let it stay outside for about an hour to dry off.
Consider putting a stocking or thin sock over the vacuum hose, and then vacuuming your dog. You may not be able to get him or her to stand still.

, If your dog won't stop climbing all over your bed or couch, try training your pet to sleep on the floor instead. Scold your dog when it climbs on the furniture, and make it clear that it's wrong. If you are firm and persistent, you can retrain your dog and keep hair off of your furniture altogether. Bear in mind that if your dog sheds a lot, you may still need to vacuum frequently to keep dog hair off of the floor.

, If you think your dog might be losing hair for a medical reason, consult a vet for help. Your vet may prescribe hair-loss medication, or may be able to identify some other treatable condition that is causing the hair-fall.

Locate the source of the smell.,
Remove as much liquid as possible.,

Apply baking soda generously.,
Vacuum the baking soda up.,
Soak the area with an enzyme-based cleaner.,
Blot up any excess cleaner.,
Repeat the previous two steps as needed.,
Clean the floor.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement3," Again, your first step is to locate the source of the urine smell. If you can’t find a wet spot, look for any spots where the wood is discolored.

, Once again, using towels, paper towels, or newspaper, blot up as much of the urine as possible. The stain will be easiest to clean once as much of the urine is removed as possible.


Wipe any excess urine towards the middle of the stain to keep from spreading it out any further and damaging any additional wood., Once you have removed all of the urine, use a damp paper towel to blot the area., After you have blotted the floor with a damp paper towel, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the stained area. Do this while the floor is still damp because baking soda will soak up more effectively if the floor is somewhat wet. Let the baking soda sit on the area for several hours or overnight., Once the baking soda has had a chance to absorb your dog’s urine, vacuum it up. Use only a soft brush attachment to vacuum over hardwood floors. This will not cause any damage to the floor., Next, apply your enzyme-based cleaner to the area, wetting the stained area completely. Choose an enzymatic cleaner that is safe on hardwood floors and follow the directions on the bottle.


First, test the cleaner on a rarely-seen portion of your wood floor, like a closet, to make sure the cleaner will not discolor your flooring., Once the cleaner has been on the spot for the recommended amount of time, blot up any excess with a towel. You should notice that the stain is lighter than it was originally, or it may be gone completely., If the stain was not removed completely the first time, continue to apply your enzymatic cleaner and blot up the excess until the stain is gone. If you are repeating these steps, but the stain is not getting any lighter, you have removed as much of the stain as possible. If you are not happy with this, you may need to consider replacing this part of your floor., As soon as you have removed the urine from your floor, clean your floor with a pet-safe floor cleaner."

Wash your hands.",How to Pick Up Dog Poop," Although plastic grocery bags are an option if you have no other bags available, it is recommended to use small doggie bags to pick up your dog’s poop. Different types of doggie bags are available at your local pet store. Since picking up poop can be a smelly process, consider purchasing scented doggie bags. Many bags also come with ties that make it easier to close the bag after picking up your dog’s poop.Bring several doggie bags with you each time that you take your dog out for a walk. By doing this, you will be prepared if your dog needs to defecate during the walk.Bio-degradable doggie bags are also available, which are more eco-friendly than regular plastic doggie bags.;
, When you stoop down to pick up your dog’s poop, whether you are walking your dog or picking up after him in your yard, turning the bag inside out will help keep your hand clean. Place your hand on the inside of the inverted bag as if you were putting on a glove., With your hand safely on the inside of the inverted bag, firmly grab the poop on the ground and pick it up.If you are picking up poop that is on concrete, try to pick it up as cleanly as possible (e.g., not scraping your hand along the concrete as you’re picking up the poop). If the poop is in the grass, make a claw-like circle with your fingers and then get as far under the pile as possible before lifting up the poop.


Keep in mind that picking up the poop will be easier if it is solid rather than mushy or diarrhea-like.
If you are cleaning up dog poop in your yard, you may need multiple bags, depending on how long it has been since you’ve cleaned up after your dog.
If you are out on a walk and either forget or run out of bags, consider going to a nearby store to ask for a bag or disposable cup to pick up your dog’s poop. If you are not near a store, try to find something on the ground that could work, such as a large and sturdy leaf.Make sure that you have a firm grip on your dog’s leash if you are picking up his poop while you are walking him., Use your free hand to fold the sides of the bag up and around the poop.It may be helpful to grab the sides of the bag using just the tips of your fingers. This may reduce the chances of your free hand touching poop that may be near the edges of the bag.

, With the bag right side out, use both hands to tie up the bag. Make sure to tie the bag tightly so that it does not open when you go to throw it away. It may be helpful to hold your breath while you are tying up the bag., If the thought of picking up poop with your hand makes you squeamish, or if you have trouble bending over or stooping, a pooper scooper is a good alternative for picking up your dog’s poop.There are many types of pooper scoopers available at your local pet store or home gardening store. Scoopers often come with spades (for use on a solid surface), rakes (for use on grass), or grabbers (grasping poop).Try to find a pooper scooper that is sturdy enough to use with one hand.If you are walking with your dog, having a scooper that you can use with one hand would be useful.
You can also purchase a pooper scooper that is designed to have a plastic bag attached onto the scooper end.By nature of their design, pooper scoopers are not effective for picking up poop that is mushy or diarrhea-like., If your dog has defecated on the concrete, use your pooper scooper with a spade to scoop up under the poop.After scooping up the poop, carefully dump it into a doggie bag. Alternatively, you could your “grabber” pooper scooper to grab the poop and drop it into the doggie bag.


If you are cleaning up poop in the grass, use your pooper scooper with a rake to gather the poop into a neat pile (if necessary) before you scoop it up to drop it into a doggie bag.
The mechanism for using the scooper will depend on what types of attachments it has. The staff at your local pet store or home gardening store can assist you with how to use the specific scooper that you want to purchase.

, It is necessary to clean your pooper scooper so that the remnants of your dog’s poop do not begin to accumulate on the scooper. These remnants could attract flies and make it more difficult to pick up your dog’s poop. To keep it clean, you can either hose it down with water or let it soak in a bucket of disinfectant.If you choose to use a bucket with disinfectant, make sure to use this bucket only for cleaning your pooper scooper and not for any other household purposes.
Talk with your local waste department for advice on throwing away the water that you used to disinfect your pooper scooper. Do not pour the dirty water into storm drains, since your dog’s feces could contain harmful pathogens (e.g., bacteria, intestinal worms).

, Dispensing of your dog’s poop may not be as easy as just throwing it in your trash can or flushing it down a toilet. If you are unsure, check with your local waste department to learn the acceptable methods of throwing away your dog’s poop., If you are at home, you can use your own trashcan to dispense of your dog’s poop. Keep in mind that your main trashcan could get quite stinky, especially if you keep your trashcan inside or enclosed in your garage. To address this potential problem, you could keep a smaller, separate trashcan outside to collect your dog’s poop. When it is time to take your trash out, could transfer the dog poop to the larger trash can and set everything outside.If you are at a dog park or in another public area, you can find the nearest outdoor trashcan to throw away the poop. Dog parks usually have dedicated trashcans for collecting dog poop.

, Although the imagery may be quite unpleasant, it usually okay to flush your dog’s poop down the toilet. If you do this, make sure that you dump the poop out of the bag first. If you have a flushable doggie bag, you could put the entire bag and its contents in the toilet and flush.Flushing may not be acceptable in your city, so check with your local waste department before using this method of pet waste disposal.
If you have a lot of poop to get rid of, do not flush it all at one time. This could clog your septic system.Be aware that flushable doggie bags may be expensive., This is an underground septic system, called a doggie dooley, that is specific for breaking down your dog’s waste.This could be helpful if you have your own yard. A doggie dooley is relatively easy to install, but you should consult with someone at your local pet store before installing and using one in your yard.


Once you have installed the doggie dooley, you would follow the machine’s instructions to add water and a digestive powder to your dog’s waste. The waste would break down into an environmentally safe liquid that would be absorbed into the ground.

, If you are genuinely uncomfortable with picking up your dog’s waste in your yard, or are unable to do so, you can contact a pet waste disposal service that can remove it for you.Your veterinarian may be able to recommend reputable services. You could also talk to other dog owners for recommendations. Keep in mind that these services may be expensive., Several potential methods of disposal are not appropriate due to public health and environmental concerns. For example, you should not leave simply your dog’s poop in your yard to break down on its own. Not only would the poop begin to smell and attract flies (especially in the warmer months), it could contain bacteria and parasites that would be harmful to dogs as well as people.In addition, your dog’s waste could get swept into storm drains and eventually end up in local water sources if you leave the poop in your yard.
Composting your dog’s waste is also not advisable because the compost pile would not get hot enough to break down the bacteria and parasites that may be in the poop.Burying your dog’s poop could also expose the local groundwater to pathogens, making this an undesirable method to dispose of your dog’s poop.

, Even with proper precaution with keeping your hands clean, you may still get bacteria on your hands when picking up your dog’s waste. Frequent hand washing is an effective way to avoid spreading these germs."

Train a Basic Brown.,

Train an Electricsquirm.,
Train a Monstrous Nightmare.,
Train a Raptortongue.,
Train a Sabre-Tooth Driving Dragon.,
Train a Sniffer Dragon.,
Train a Night Fury.,
Avoid untrainable species of dragon.",How to Train Your Dragon (Fantasy Play)1," The Basic Brown is one of the most common dragon species. It also one of the least dangerous dragons, making it a good choice for training or keeping as a family pet. The basic brown is fully herbivorous -- which means it doesn't eat meat.


Basic Browns are medium-sized dragons which come in all shades of brown. They have prickly spines all the way down their back and tail and have regular-sized teeth and claws.
Basic Browns are not particularly good hunters, but they can be very fast when they need to. In general, they are not aggressive, but they can fight well when angry.;
, Gronkles are boulder class dragons, remarkable for their laziness and stupidity. They are very slow movers -- especially the fatter ones -- and sometimes have difficulty getting into the air. Despite this, Gronkles can be pretty fearsome in battle, thanks to their enormous strength.


Gronkles are medium-sized dragons with bulky bodies that come in various muddy shades of brown, black and beige. They have an impressive range of armory skin, including dagger-like fangs, thick, fire-proof skin and a spiky, clubbed tail that kind of rock. However, the Gronkle's most fearsome feature is its ability to shoot molten lava instead of breathing fire.
Gronkles are often very cranky, but they can almost be sweet-natured towards their rider and hatchlings. This makes them relatively easy to train.

, Driller-Dragons are pretty fearsome-looking, so they are often trained as guard dragons to protect Viking dwellings.


Driller-Dragons are always black in color and have a huge horn on the end of their nose which rotates at dangerously high speeds. This drill-like horn can cut through materials like wood and rock with alarming ease.
Driller-Dragons do not have many distinctive features, aside from their huge horn. They are not particularly intelligent and their small brain is housed in a bump on top of their heads, which resembles a large pimple. However, Driller-Dragons are very loyal and can respond well to training.

, The Electricsquirm is an example of a nanodragon -- a very small dragon that still packs a punch! The Electricsquirm conducts an electric current which gives a powerful shock to anyone who touches it.


The Electricsquirm is transparent in color, but glows with a white or yellow light when producing electricity. The only place you can touch an Electricquirm without getting a shock is its tail -- which is an important point to remember during training. Picking up an Electricsquirm by its tail will also prevent it from biting you, as it can be quite prone to nipping.
Despite their small size, Electricsquirms are a very useful dragon, as their glowing body can be used as a light source in the absence of candles or torches.

, Monstrous Nightmares are huge, terrifying dragons that are very fast and very aggressive. They can be extremely difficult to train, so only experienced dragon trainers should attempt it.


The Monstrous Nightmare has red, purple or silver scales,and corresponding wings and spikes. They have large teeth and extendable claws, and a slightly poisonous bite. The Monstrous Nightmare's most impressive skill, however, is its ability to coat itself in spit and then light the spit on fire -- turning the dragon into a terrifying fireball.
If you can manage to train them, Monstrous Nightmares are a fantastic asset -- they are ferocious in battle and make excellent hunters. Some good training tips include clamping the Nightmare's mouth shut to disarm its poisonous fangs and fireball ability, pinning its horns to the ground (which is seems to enjoy) and above all, treating the Monstrous Nightmare with the respect it deserves.

, The Raptortongue is a shy and mysterious dragon species whose major skill is the ability to almost completely flatten their bodies, so they can fit through even the smallest of spaces. This is made possible by their triple-jointed ribs.


Raptortongues are chameleons, so their color changes depending on the background they are trying to blend in with. They grow to about the size of a lion and have regular-sized fangs and talons.
The Raptortongue's ability to squeeze into small spaces and blend in with its surroundings (combined with its speed and radar capabilities) make it an excellent spy dragon -- perfect for sending into enemy camps to retrieve objects or information!

, The Sabre-Tooth Driving Dragon is a relatively large dragon (about twice the size of a lion) that is trained primarily to pull Viking sleighs during the winter.


Driving Dragons are completely white in color, with large pointed spikes protruding from their heads and two terrifying sabre teeth. Sabre-Tooth Driving Dragons are evergreen, which means that they don't need to hibernate during winter.
Driving Dragons are a little bit unpredictable -- although they don't move too quickly, they are very strong and can be aggressive during a fight. Several Driving Dragons are reported to have eaten their owners, so train with care!

, For beginner trainers, the Sniffer Dragon is an excellent choice -- they are extremely gentle and non-aggressive, making them the perfect companions or family pets.


The Sniffer Dragon is a pale aquamarine in color. This dragon's most distinctive physical feature is its huge, hairy nose, which gives the Sniffer Dragon its fantastic sense of smell.
Although these dragons are not good fighters, their highly-tuned sense of smell makes Sniffer Dragons excellent trackers -- so they can be used to sniff out enemies or find any lost friends.

, Night furies are the rarest of all known dragon species. They are extremely intelligent, displaying significant tactical skills in battle and a great curiosity for learning new things.


The Night Fury is blue-ish black in appearance with piercing yellow eyes. Its body is more streamlined than other species and it has the largest wing-to-body ratio of any dragon, making it an excellent flier, in terms of both speed and precision. The Night Fury uses echolocation to find its way in the dark, making it extra deadly at night.
The only way to train a Night Fury is to earn its trust and respect, which can be extremely difficult. However, once that trust and respect has been gained, the Night Fury is fiercely loyal and protective of his trainer and will defend them at all costs. The Night Fury can also be quite playful and mischievous once it becomes comfortable with its trainer., Some dragon species are simply too dangerous or difficult to train and should be avoided at all costs. Some examples include:



Exterminator dragons: These are large, terrifying dragons with transparent skin that displays their internal organs (including their two hearts). Exterminators can lay waste to entire landscapes with their fire and enjoy killing for the sake of killing.







Skullions: Skullions are an unusual species of dragon in that they can't see, hear or fly (they have no wings). However, they have an acute sense of smell and a lust for blood that makes them highly dangerous and untrainable.







Doomfangs: Doomfangs are terrifyingly large dragons that live in the sea, with black scales and hypnotic green eyes. They breathe strange blue flames that kill by freezing rather than burning. The Doomfang is a dangerous predator and should be avoided at all costs."

Bag it.There are specially designed dog poop pickup bags available from many pet stores, but you could also choose to be thrifty and simply use plastic grocery bags.,
Use a pooper scooper.A pooper scooper is a device that helps you pick up dog poo.,
Get some freeze spray.Commercially available pet waste freezing agents made of aerosolized oxygen are available at many pet stores.,
Remove the dog waste immediately.If you know for a fact that your dog has pooped, you could choose to go out immediately and collect it after your dog comes back inside.,
Clear the dog waste at the end of the day.Compared with monitoring your dog’s potty time and picking up its poop each time it goes, cleaning up all your dog’s poop once each day can save you time and effort.,
Pick up your dog's poo daily.,
Create a regular cleaning schedule.Whether you choose to clean immediately or daily, stay committed to your plan.,
Consider getting a separate trash can.If your trash service collects the garbage infrequently, you might worry about it getting stinky with dog poo.,
Install a pet waste digester.A pet waste digester is a device that breaks dog poo down into a safe, biodegradable liquid that is then absorbed by your yard.,
Turn your dog poo into fertilizer.In its natural state, dog poop is not a good fertilizer, as it contains harmful bacteria and (potentially) parasites.,
Be cautious when flushing your dog waste down the toilet.",How to Clean Up Dog Waste from a Backyard," Instead of just recycling them, set aside an appropriate number of bags after going grocery shopping and stash them under the sink or in another convenient location.


You can pick up the poop directly with the bag by using it like a glove, then turning it inside out. Place your hand inside the bag, grasp the poo, then pull the sides down around it so that the former exterior of the bag is now wrapped around the poo. Tie it off and dispose of it appropriately.
You could also wear disposable gloves and use a paper towel to pick up dog poo in your yard. Carefully pick the poo up with a paper towel, then drop the paper towel with the poo wrapped around it into the bag. This is the best option when picking up multiple waste deposits around your backyard.
Save most or all the bags, as you should clean up your dog's poop daily.
Fancy poo bags available at pet stores might have a pleasant scent to mask the poo.
Wash your hands thoroughly after every dog waste collection session, even if you wore disposable gloves. This will reduce the potential for spreading germs.;
, There are many varieties available, but the basic design consists of a small clamp or spade at the end of a handle that, when pulled, will close around the poop. You can then transfer the scooped waste into a bag for disposal.


Some models have special bags that can attach directly to the pooper scooper, allowing you to deposit the poo directly into the bag without taking the extra step of putting the poo in the bag.
Ensure the model you obtain can be used on concrete as well as grass. That way, you can take it outside of your backyard, should you wish.
Pooper scoopers are readily available at your local pet store.
Store your pooper scooper in your backyard or garage in a location where your pets and children will not access it. Spray it down or dunk it in disinfectant regularly to keep bacteria at bay.

, These sprays are useful when collecting dog waste that is runny or softened due to rain. Simply hold the nozzle an inch or so from the poo, and give it a sustained spray of two or three seconds all over its surface. This will cause the poop to solidify, making pickup easier.


If you’re collecting the poo by hand, be sure to wait a few seconds after spraying before attempting to pick it up directly.
Use manufacturer instructions when using freeze sprays.

, This is the best option for people with small yards or many dogs.


Supervise your dog’s outdoor time. This will give you a vantage point from which you can see whether or not your dog pooped. Otherwise, you'll have to work out where the poop is and collect it later.
If you're in a hurry and cannot clear the poop away immediately, spray it with flying insect spray. The spray will kill flies all day and the eggs will not hatch. Collect the waste later or as part of a daily pick-up. Do not use insect spray on poop if you intend to let your dog out into the yard again before you clean up the waste you sprayed.
If you have young children accessing the area, it's advisable to clean up dog waste immediately, or at least once daily.

, If you have just one dog, it probably won’t poop more than once a day, so cleaning up at the beginning or end of the day is no big deal.


This method requires you to locate the poop. Mentally subdivide your yard into strips one or two square meters wide. Start in one corner and proceed to walk down one such row of your yard, scanning the ground as you go.
Once you walk the full length of a given row, turn around and walk down the row adjacent to it.
When you see the poop, pick it up with a paper towel in your gloved hand and drop it in a plastic bag. Dispose of it in the garbage.

, If you clean the poop quickly, the parasitic eggs and larvae that may be hiding in your dog's poop won't have time to get into the soil and continue to grow and lay eggs. You should clean your dog's poop within 24 hours of its arrival in your backyard.


Choose a time that is convenient for you. Try to do it at the same time every day, such as right after dinner or right after you walk the dog.

, Dog poo can accrue quickly if not cleaned regularly. The size of the backyard and the number of dogs using it should be the main factors you consider when deciding how quickly and how often you clean your backyard. For both small and large yards, you should clean your dog's poop from your lawn daily.


Always pick up dog waste during daylight. Nothing is more frustrating than walking around in the dark trying to locate dog poo. Even with a flashlight, the chances that you’ll step in dog poo is too high. If you arrive home too late or rise too early, you might not have daylight. In this case, clean up dog waste from your backyard another day.
Don’t let yourself get locked into a yard cleaning schedule you can’t keep.

, Even when the poo is wrapped up in bags, the scent can be quite powerful, especially in the summer. You can solve this problem by investing in a smaller, separate trash can specifically for dog waste. Ensure it has a lid. Place a liner in it as you would with any other can, but leave it outside, and empty it into your larger trash bin when your trash collection service arrives.


If your trash tends to be relatively stinky even without the addition of dog waste, there is little to be gained from utilizing a separate trash can just for dog waste.
If you don’t want to dispose of your bagged dog waste in a separate can, place it in your primary garbage bin (the big one that sits by the curb).

, To use the device, simply drop the waste in the opening, add warm water, and add the digestive agent.


The exact amount of water and digestive agent required depends on the pet waste digester model you have.
Installation is relatively easy, but does require you to dig a shallow hole (usually about one cubic foot) in your yard. This allows the liquefied poo to release slowly into the yard without pooling onto the grass.
Always follow manufacturer directions when using your pet waste digester.

, New technologies, however, allow you to ferment your dog poo using commercially available kits. The fermentation process will remove the toxic elements and leave behind nutrient-rich soil.


The basic process involves mixing a fermentive accelerant, a dry mix, and water in specific amounts, then adding poo to a small bucket.
After the bucket is full, dig a small hole in your yard and poor the mixture in. Cover with soil.
After about two weeks, the poo will be completely transformed to healthy soil.
Pet waste fermenting systems are available in a few stores on the west coast, but can be easily ordered online.

, Many cities ban pet waste in human toilets since waste water systems cannot properly process it. It’s best to err on the side of caution and put your dog poo in the garbage. Alternately, if you want to do some investigating, contact your local Department of Health or Municipal Waste Department and find out if it is possible to flush dog poop down the toilet.


If your local waste water system allows pet poop, you could use flushable poop bags. These bags are specially designed to break down when they come in contact with water."

Decide what kind of dragon you want.,
Pretend to call the breeder.,
Prepare for the arrival.,
After your dragon arrives, lock it in a room.,
Get it used to your home slowly.,
Train it.,
Take your dragon outside.,
Remember, not only wizards and witches can be imaginary dragon breeders.",How to Own an Imaginary Dragon," You can make up the types of dragons, but here are a few to get you started:



Water dragon - Instead of breathing fire, they squirt water

Shadow dragon - Dark colored dragons that can become invisible at will

Fire dragon - The most common type of dragon

Earth (rock) dragon - Another common type, very good battle dragons

Lightning dragon - Instead of breathing fire, they breathe lightning bolts

Feathered dragon - Instead of having sturdy wings, these dragons have feathered, bird-like wings

Moody Dragon - He is moody but you accept it because he drove you home one time and his brother is like super cool.

Suni-dragon - A dragon with a unicorn's horn

Rainbow dragon - A rainbow colored dragon that's spews rainbows
""Plant dragon"" - Instead of breathing fire, they have saplings on their back and bloom flowers when adults.
""Dwarf dragon"" - A dragon that, instead of being bigger than a cat as a baby and as big as a dinosaur when fully grown, is as big as a medium-sized dog's puppy as a baby and as big as a full grown medium-sized dog at adulthood, or even smaller

Horse dragon - A Dragon that eats grass and has a Horse's mane

Moon Dragon - A dragon who, when tired, flies to the moon. Can also shoot moonbeams from their tail

Tsunami Dragon - Like a Water Dragon, but shoots seawater instead of freshwater

Ghost Dragon - Most likely the soul of a dead Dragon, the Ghost Dragon is often looking for something

Kalahari Sun Dragon - A rare breed, can shoot sunbeams from tail. Enemies with Moon Dragons

Poison Dragon - Is rare, can be found in power plants

Large Dragon - It can be any breed as long as it is large
You can also crossbreed! Use your imagination!;
, The breeder will probably be a wizard or a witch. Ask them for the type of dragon you want, specify the gender and age. Once you've decided on a dragon, organize a day they can bring it to you.

, The next time you go shopping to a pet store, pretend there is a dragon aisle. Buy food, drink and other supplies for your new pet.

, If it is a baby, it will still be larger than a cat (unless it's a dwarf dragon), so make sure the room is quite big. It is also a good idea if it is a main room that you will visit often, so the dragon gets used to humans. Dragons aren't evil, but they can be very aggressive to humans if you don't go near them within a few weeks of getting them. Dragons will see you as a bite sized snack.

, After you've had your dragon for a week or so, let it go onto all of the levels in that part of the house. Make sure it doesn't go up/down stairs, because it may cause trouble.


After a few weeks, let your dragon roam freely around the house.

, Before taking your dragon outside for the first time, teach it to sit, stay and come when it's name is called. Remember, dragons can be dangerous, even if they're babies. Persevere, dragons can be very hard to train.

, Go to the pet store and 'buy' a dog lead if your dragon is a baby. If it is a grown up, call the breeder and ask them to deliver a dragon lead. If you will be travelling in a car, keep an eye on your dragon. When it seems all right, unleash your dragon. Don't let it go where no dogs are allowed, as it will be the same for dragons.

, You can become one too, and provide pets to your friends.

Rabbit breeding stock can be obtained from many different sources.,
Get the right pen.,
Know that female rabbits will conceive at any time they have an ""encounter"" with a buck.,
The pen should be furnished with clean water each day.,
Feed a good quality hay.,
Hay should be contained in a lattice manger, or rick to keep it from being contaminated by the animal's waste.,
Another feeding option can be to use calf manna along with rabbit pellets, or ""rabbit food"".",How to Raise Rabbits for Food1," One good way is to go to a fair where there are rabbits and contact the owners which are usually listed on the show cases.


3 to 4 litters of 5 to 10 young can be thrown by a healthy, mature female (doe) each year.
One male (buck) can service up to twenty to thirty does, but in order to keep the gene pool healthy, you should have one buck for each 5 does. Make sure you keep records of which does are bred by which bucks, and keep rotating the animals to keep the gene pool as large as possible.
The best meat breeds are California and New Zealand or a combination of the two. Most consider the Flemish Giant unsuitable for a meat rabbit, due to the meat to bone ratio, also the amount of food consumed to meat ratio. It is okay to cross with a New Zealand for meat production.;
, The pen should be a minimum of 5 feet (1.5 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m) for this large breed, but slightly smaller for the smaller breeds. Rabbits need space! The floor should be made of a sturdy wire mesh with about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) square holes to accommodate droppings and urine. Do give the rabbit someplace else to stand, however. Standing on wire full time can hurt a rabbit's feet. A full tray or box the full size of the floor of the pen with all four sides about 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) high should be slid under the pen to catch the animal waste. This tray should be emptied once per week and rinsed with a disinfectant. Be careful when using bleach, as it will react with the urine and give off a harmful gas!


A solid compartment about 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) long and 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) wide should be included in the pen to give the doe privacy while she is having her young. this will keep mortality of the young down to a great extent. Be sure there is plenty of dried hay in the pen when she is ""due"".

, There is no set estrous period.


The young should be separated from the mother at about 6 weeks.
The doe is ready for breeding immediately after separation from her young.
The rabbit pregnancy period is 28-30 days, with the doe able to mate within hours of giving birth. However, it's advised to wait a month so as not to overtire her and drastically shorten her life span.

, The water should be contained in such a way that the animal will not contaminate it with its body waste. If in an open container, it should be elevated so that the top is at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) above the floor. Conventional water bottles work very well also (except during the winter).

, Be sure it has a sweet smell, and has not been water-damaged and become moldy. Red clover and birdsfoot trefoil seem to be the most preferred by rabbits, but they will also do well on alfalfa, Kentucky bluegrass, timothy, and a mixture of native grasses.

, Do not over feed lettuces. Any fresh green food such as lettuce from the store or grass from the yard can give your animals diarrhea! However, if they are introduced to grass or weeds gradually, they can enjoy them regularly with no harm. It's the sudden change of food that is most harmful. Also, with free choice hay, the animals will regulate much of their own eating habits.

, Medicated calf pellets, available at a feed mill which dairy farmers frequent, can help keep your rabbits free from diarrhea. They will cost you less than the ""bunny"" pellets per pound, but can contribute to the overuse of antibiotics and are not available in all cities. Very important: When you are ready to butcher, place your animals in an especially clean environment for 2 weeks prior to slaughtering and feed them conventional rabbit pellets rather than the medicated calf food to clear the rabbits from the effects of the anti-biotic which is in the calf food. Remember these rabbits will not be considered organic which is a personal choice.

Clean routinely.,
Wash pet linens often.,
Vacuum bi-weekly.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement4," While odor from urine is the biggest problem for pet owners, other causes of pet odor include feces, drool, and hair. To keep these odors from lingering, clean up after your pet daily as much as you can. The longer you wait to clean a mess, the harder it will be to get any residual odor or stain out of your floor or furniture.


Pay special attention to areas in which your dog spends the most time. Routinely cleaning these areas will help keep pet odor from building up and becoming difficult to get rid of., Your dog’s bed or blankets are another area that can hold in odors. To keep these smelling fresh, wash them at least once a week if possible.To help neutralize odors between washing, try spraying these linens with an odor-neutralizing spray, not just an air freshener that will cover up the odor for a short period of time.

, Vacuum regularly to remove any lingering pet hair that can contribute to odor. It is best to vacuum at least twice a week, depending on how much your dog sheds.Be sure you vacuum any furniture your dog frequents as well as the floor.

"
"
Open your windows.,
Sprinkle baking soda before vacuuming.,
Change your air filters.,
Seal your floors and walls.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement5," Dog odors can linger for months or even years in your home. For instance, your new apartment may smell like the previous tenant’s dog for quite a while, even once the dog is no longer living there. Airing out your home can help get rid of lingering pet smells, however. Open your windows at least once a week to let some fresh air in and allow the old smells to circulate and work their way out of your house., If you’re dealing with a lingering pet smell, try sprinkling baking soda over your floors before vacuuming at least once a week, or until you feel the smell has subsided. For the best results, spread the baking soda over the entire floor and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming. This method can be used on all floor types, including carpeting, hard wood, linoleum, and tile., Be sure to replace any air filters in your home regularly. Pet hair, dust, and debris can get stuck in your filters, trapping pet odors in your house., If the methods above aren’t working to get rid of lingering pet odor, you may want to consider sealing your floors and walls to keep any smells at bay. Inquire at your local home improvement store to find a sealant that will help block odors."
"
Brush your dog regularly.,
Bathe your dog regularly.,
Keep your dog away from potential problems.",How to Get Dog Smell Out of a Basement6," Brushing your dog several times a week can help cut down on the amount of hair they shed throughout your house. Brush them daily, if possible, with a brush that is recommended for their type of coat.Whenever possible, brush your dog outside to keep loose hairs from your grooming session off your carpet and furniture., Unless your dog has gotten into something smelly, it usually only needs to be given a bath once every two to four months. Use your judgment in figuring out when a bath is necessary—does your dog smell or look dirty? Has it been spending an extra amount of time outside or rolling on the ground a lot lately? How often it needs bathed will vary from dog to dog.


Use only a shampoo formulated especially for dogs. Human shampoos can be too harsh and mess up the pH balance of your dog’s skin.Keep a dry shampoo on-hand to use in between baths. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation on a good dry dog shampoo., Do your best to prevent your dog from getting into especially smelly situations when you can. For example, if you notice a particularly muddy portion of trail on your walk, take your dog out and around it. Also, try to keep it away from anything smelly it might roll in, like dead animals or other animal waste. Preventing odors on your dog before they happen can reduce the amount of clean up you have to do later.


Remember that dogs will be dogs and you won’t be able to prevent your dog from getting messy once in a while. Do what you can to keep it clean, but don’t keep your dog from following their natural instincts.

Hatch your own dragon egg, if possible.,
Respect the dragon.,
Earn your dragon's trust.,
Reward your dragon with treats.,
Play with your dragon.",How to Train Your Dragon (Fantasy Play)2," In order to train a dragon, you need to earn its respect, but this can be very difficult with full-grown dragons.


Therefore, the best possible way to train a dragon is to raise it from the moment it hatches, as it will develop a child-like bond with you and be loyal and trusting from the start.
Be warned though -- baby dragons are hard work! They need to be fed and played with constantly and are always getting up to some sort of mischief. Baby dragons haven't learned to control their impulses yet, so you may be bitten, burned or otherwise hurt in the process of raising them. However, if you're able to see it through, you will be rewarded with love and loyalty.
Also keep in mind that you should never, ever steal a dragon egg from its mother. This is cruel and will make the mother very angry. You should only rescue abandoned dragon eggs.

, Dragons are proud, fearsome creatures that demand and deserve your respect. How can you ever expect a dragon to respect and respond to you if you don't show it the same courtesy?


You can show your dragon that you respect it in a number of simple ways. The first is to make eye contact with it -- this shows the dragon that you are willing to treat it as an equal.
The second is to respect the dragon's boundaries. If it is in a bad mood, give it some space. If it is angry, don't try to pet him or ride him, you'll just make things worse.
Thirdly, you should never forget that a dragon is a dangerous creature that can never fully be tamed. It's kind of like having a pet bear or lion -- you may have domesticated them, but they will never lose that dangerous, unpredictable streak.

, The single most important thing you can do when training a dragon is to earn its trust. If your dragon trusts you completely, it will want to do as you ask, just to please you.You can earn a dragon's trust by placing a hand gently on its snout. This calms the dragon down if its angry or frightened and shows it that you are not a threat.
You can also earn a dragon's trust by being polite and kind -- you'll never get a dragon to do what you want by shouting or throwing rocks at it.
Another good way to earn the dragon's trust is to show that you are reliable and that it can count on you. If you say you're going to bring your dragon some food, do it. If you tell it you won't let anyone else hurt him, follow through. Most dragons will repay this loyalty a thousand times over.

, Dragons respond better to training when their good behavior is rewarded, instead of their bad behavior being punished. You can reward your dragon whenever it does something you ask, like sitting still or letting you fly on its back.


A dragon's favorite reward is food, but the type of food will depend on the species of dragon. Meat-eating dragons will enjoy eating fish (bones and all) and hunks of lamb's meat. Herbivorous dragons (like the Basic Brown) like to eat the petals of pretty flowers.
Another reward that dragons enjoy is a tickle beneath the chin or a stroke behind the ears. Be careful though -- when a dragon laughs it can accidentally breathe fire!

, Despite their fearsome reputation, most dragons love to play and have fun when they're feeling happy and safe. Therefore, playing with your dragon is one of the best ways to bond with it.


Every dragon has its own favorite game, so you will need to figure out what works for yours. Some dragons love to play fetch -- which you can do by firing a stick into the air using a sling shot and letting your dragon fly up to grab it and bring it back.
Other dragons like to play with their food. Take a piece of raw meat and throw it high into the air. The dragon will use its fire-breathing abilities to cook the flying food before catching it in its jaws!

Note that while the unicorn is a legendary creature, it has long captured the imaginations of many self-imagined damsels and knights and has been a source of inspiration for authors and illustrators alike.,
Become familiar with legends that feature unicorns.,
Find unicorn artwork to learn about the various depictions of unicorns through the ages.,
Compare the modern depictions of the unicorn with the unicorns of times past.,
Learn about the qualities of unicorns:


Unicorns are white
Unicorn eyes are said to be sky blue or purple haze, with matching hooves
Unicorn blood is silvery blue.,
Know some of the myths associated with unicorns:


They can only be captured by use of a maiden as a lure; a male unicorn would come and lay its head on the lap of a maiden should be sitting in the forest in which the unicorn dwelt.,
Understand the symbolism of unicorns.,
Choose the unicorn as your talisman or protector if you feel that these values accord with your way of seeing the world.

",How to Learn About the Unicorn," It is possible that a variety of horned beasts from the rhinoceros to the Oryx influenced the myth of the unicorn. One particular favourite is the narwhal, with its long tusk (males only).;
, Legends from medieval times are an especially good source for unicorn lore. Other legends include the natural historical accounts of the Ancient Greeks, Roman tales and Ancient Chinese tales (although the unicorn in Chinese legend is not the unicorn most people are familiar with). Much of the original tales influence our thinking on unicorns even to this day.

, Look online or in art books for the Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries (1495 - 1500). These depict unicorns from medieval times. Another excellent series of unicorns can be found in the Musée National du Moyen Âge in Paris, known as 'La dame et la licorne' (The Lady and the Unicorn). Each of these tapestries carry much symbolism, which you learn more about by researching. Other depictions of unicorns can be found in paintings, book artwork, filet crochet and lacework from the late nineteenth century and in modern cartoons and posters. Look up high on buildings in countries such as England, Wales and France and you will often find statues upon roofs or carvings on walls featuring the unicorn. Buckingham Palace in England is a good example.

, Today's unicorns are sleek, beautiful and more strongly horse-like in their presentation. They vary in colour - depicted in many differing colours and even a mixture of glistening golds, silvers and sometimes rainbows.

,
They are horse-like but have certain differences, including the horn. The legs are meant to resemble an antelope and in many depictions has the tail of a lion and the beard of a goat
The horn has magical properties - it is said to cure illnesses and neutralize poison - poisonous plants are meant to burst when brought near a horn. Modern interpretations have held that the horn can change colour with the mood of the unicorn
Unicorns were depicted as highly intelligent, possibly communicating by telepathy

, Note that some of this myth was tied up with the rabid requirement that women be chaste before marriage during the Middle Ages, a fact that influenced this myth to suggest that only the purest of maidens would have such success. Literature seems to have left female unicorns aside; it'd be nice to imagine this was in acceptance that female unicorns had better things to be getting on with but more likely because a chaste male human was not a requirement of the times
You should never lose faith in a unicorn or things will bode ill for you
Some depictions of the unicorn compared it with the purity of Christ
Unicorns barely touch the ground; some even say they merely skim it, so finding the trail of a unicorn is almost impossible
Removal of the entire horn kills a unicorn; however, a unicorn in a relationship of trust may choose to offer a portion of its horn to heal a sick individual
The blood of a unicorn is considered to be deadly, for the blood of an innocent and pure creature should never be caused to flow

, As with many mythical creatures, unicorns are graced with certain meanings. Common interpretations hold that these values are reflected by a unicorn:


Nobility
Loyalty
Quick to anger at disloyalty
Steadfastness
Purity
Selflessness

Determine or know what livestock you own or will potentially have to help you consider what your fencing needs will be.,
Determine what type of fence or fences that needs to be built.,
Obtain a survey of your land.,
Phone the utility and gas company to mark out any underground utility and pipe lines that may be on your property.,
Determine where your fences are going to go on paper.,

Mark out all of your fence lines, corners, lanes, and gates.,
Purchase your fencing supplies.,
Dig holes.,
Install corner posts.,
Put up the first line of fencing wire.,
Put up line posts.,
Put up the rest of the wires.,
Hammer in the staples.,Repeat the steps above for the rest of the fences you need to build.,
Let the animals out to the pasture.",How to Build a Livestock Fence," Most fences are suited for a variety of farm animal species, but ideally you shouldn't waste money on building something that will end up being what you don't need or is not enough to hold in the animals you are wanting to keep. For example, you shouldn't put up chicken wire if you're only going to have cattle, nor should you install cattle panels for chickens, goats or pigs. Chicken wire is best for chickens and other poultry and other small stock, and cattle panels are best for cattle and horses. With that in mind, you must also understand the risks of having a particular individual animal that may be more of a Houdini than the rest, which should be encouragement enough to make sure you make your fences, ""goat-tight and bull-strong.""


Goats are notorious for testing fences, being prone to climb up, jump over, crawl under, crawl through or even walk through fences. Build your fence so that it's tall enough that they are not likely to jump over and in the ground enough that they won't crawl under. The space between wires need to be smaller than the size of their heads, because if a goat can get its head through, then the rest of its body is sure to follow!
Sheep are less notorious for testing fences, yet are as small as goats; thus similar fencing requirements are required for this domestic species.
Pigs are worse for digging under and crawling under fences than going over them. You will need to install fencing that is deep enough underground that pigs won't root too far underneath to escape.
Many horse owners will argue that barbed wire fencing is the worse thing for horses to be contained in, and would rather spend the extra money on rail, or board fencing than wire fencing. Horses are much more apt to jump over a fence and figure out a way through the gate latch than crawling under or through a fence. However a stallion hot on the trail of a mare in heat will test a fence to its limits; thus if you own a breeding herd of horses, make sure the corral you are containing your corrals in is strong, sturdy and tall enough a stallion won't test it.
Fencing for cattle is a little more easier to choose because there are more choices a producer can make for holding their cattle in depending on where a producer wants to hold them in. Barbed wire fencing is the most common type of fencing for pasturing cattle. Electric fencing is best for those fence lines that are being tested too much or those who are rotational-grazing cattle. More rugged fencing such as stand-alone iron panels, wood board or iron rail is best for corrals, handling facilities and working or holding pens, and highly recommended for bull and cull-cow pens.;
, Once you know what kind of livestock you will have to contain and what needs to be done to keep them in, ultimately what you choose depends on how much money you are willing to spend to buy the supplies, and how long the fence-line needs to be (or, what perimeter or area needs to be contained with a surrounding fence). Note that there is a huge difference in fences for corrals versus those for pasture.


With cattle for example, corral fences need to be tougher and stable than pasture fences. Pasture fencing for cattle require simple barbed-wire or high-tensile fences, whereas for pigs, goats and sheep, pasture fencing requires page wire up to a 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) tall, respectively. Pasture fencing for horses can also be barbed wire or high-tensile, but others like to get a little more fancy and have painted wood fences or aesthetically-pleasing iron fencing.
There are numerous types of fencing available. Some examples include:


Temporary electric fencing in the form of permanent (such as high-tensile) or temporary electric. Electric fencing can be the fastest and cheapest to build if you live in the country. It will handle any animal that is trained to the wire, and is also useful as a psychological barrier to even wildlife. Wire that is electrified is said to be energized, or ""hot."" Temporary electric is perfect for rotational or managed-intensive grazing because it can be moved around all the time.

How to install an electric fence will not be covered here because some different techniques are involved with installation of this compared with building a standard permanent livestock fence. However, please see How to Make an Electric Fence for more information.



Barbed wire fencing with barbed wire installed alone in four to six or more-wired fences, smooth-wire fence in the form of high-tensile or low-tensile fencing (this type of fencing is often electrified) or a combination of smooth and barbed wire--one strand of barbed wire usually runs across top and sometimes at differing levels, or one strand of smooth wire runs across the top with the bottom wires barbed. Both types are fencing are best for livestock

Paige wire, though more expensive than barbed or smooth wire, is best for operations that pasture or raise goats, sheep, and pigs, and is a common pasture fencing for holding bison and elk. Paige wire may also be used on farms or ranches that run a cow-calf operation, and necessitates use if the producer doesn't want their calves out of the corral. Paige wire is also called ""farm fence"" or ""woven wire,"" and comes in the form of woven chicken wire or 12 to 14 gauge wire welded together to form squares of varying lengths apart, from four to six inches apart. It can stand as low as three feet or as tall as eight feet.

Wooden horse railing or wooden boards are best for those who want more aesthetically pleasing farms and don't want to worry about the potential problems posed by wire fences. It can be expensive but safe and effective for horses. Wooden board fencing is also suitable for holding cattle.

Iron railing fencing is also suited for farms that have horses or wish to have aesthetically-pleasing yards. It can also be used for other livestock like cattle and sheep, especially in high-traffic areas such as holding corrals or sacrifice corrals.

Iron panel fencing comes in panels that need to be stabilized with wooden posts or stand-alone panels that simply require a tractor to put them into place. These, depending on the size, are great for keeping large animals such as deer, cattle (especially bulls), horses (including stallions), bison and even elk.



, A legal land survey may be required to determine the exact perimeter of the land that you own, or where your land ends and your neighbor's begins. You may need to arrange for this first since a wait may be involved.


Note this is crucial for determining where your permanent fences are going to go especially if you have land that is not already surrounded by existing boundaries such as a road or a tree line. It is less important if you are building internal fences within the base perimeter fence, because quite often you can survey out where these internal fences will go yourself rather than spend money to hire professional surveyors to do it for you.

Surveying out internal pasture and corral fences require quite a bit of measuring and making sure you have corners that are close to 90 degrees, and not at an obtuse or acute angle that your animals will find and get themselves cornered in. Use surveyor stakes (also called ""lath"", surveyor tape, a 200' tape measure, and chalk or marking paint, with the latter two items ideal for marking out small, ""working"" corrals and handling facilities. You will need to use these items after you've completed the step after this next one.



, They will come out and put up stakes and/or bright spray paint to note where any hidden lines may be that you should be aware of prior to starting any fence building. Be sure you know where utility/gas lines go before you dig or start pounding in fence posts because if you don't, you will either have the costly endeavor of having it fixed, or you could be end up in the ER of the local hospital.

, You will need a ruler, a protractor, a pencil, paper, and an eraser to create a drawing to help you figure out an efficient system of movement from pasture to pasture, pasture to corral, corral to pasture, and corral to handling area. Especially for pasture rotations, you must design a system that reduces or eliminates risk of returning to a pasture that has just been grazed and requires rest, and be organized so that you are going to have smooth flow of traffic from one pasture or corral to another.


The land survey done will help you out with your planning, especially if you can acquire a copy of a surveyor's map of your land. Finding your land on Google Earth may help as well, especially to give you a better idea of how much land you need to cover and what the estimated measurements of your fence lines will be.
You then can sketch out your pasture and corral spaces, noting the following:


How many enclosures you want to have. For pastures, this all depends on the grazing system you want to have, and whether you want just a permanent perimeter fence so that you can have movable fencing for a rotational grazing system.

Where your gates should be. Remember, you need to have good flow. For most livestock, movement is smoother (and it's easier to herd them) if a gate is put in the corner of a pasture rather than in the middle of the fence line. This is because most animals that can be herded as a group (almost all species of livestock except pigs and chickens) often always go to a corner rather than a fence.

Where any ""high-traffic"" lanes may be (optional). These are good if you need to divert animals away from a farmed field, a residence, or a protected natural area in moving them to another pasture. Lanes may be good if you have water facilities out on pasture as well as several pastures that are rotated throughout the year, and this one water source is sufficient for all moves.

Length of each fence-line, noting how much land area you have, and the perimeter of your land base via the surveying results. This will help you calculate out how much wire and how many posts will be needed.

Length of gates and how many, for example if you need two 10 foot gates or only one 16 foot gate. Keep in mind space needed for potentially having equipment come into the pasture for various reasons, from reseeding pastures, mowing or haying excess forages, to spreading manure, or even collecting a dead animal (like a cow) for disposal.



, This is your anchor point for your fence that takes the brunt of the force generated by both lines of the fence that the corner brace is connected to, and is the first and most important thing you need to build for a pasture livestock fence. You might want to search around your area for these corner braces when you go driving around. You will find all manner of corners out there for you to observe which have held up over the years to various degrees. Considering the value that a fence has, it makes sense to build your corner assemblies up to the highest standard in your area.


Corner braces range from an H brace, N brace or a brace with a wood post at the top and wire stretching from the top of one post down to the bottom of the other. In other words, when two H-braces back to back which are commonly seen on a pasture fence corner, three vertical posts, two horizontal braces, and bracing wire are used to construct such a corner brace. This type of construction is standard and will hold up almost any fence for many years to come.

, Using surveyor tape, lath, a long tape measure, chalk or bright paint, measure out where your fence-lines will go, where your corner braces will be, any lanes you will have, and where your gates will go. Mark out where you will need to sink posts in to first start forming corner braces. The chalk and paint are ideal for smaller areas (like laying out a handling facility), and pointing where corner posts will need to go. Lath with surveyor tape tied work the best as reference points to where corners will be, and where corner posts will need to be pounded in to. Use all as best as possible so that when you come back with your supplies, you won't be confused as to where to begin or where your fence-line should actually be.

Note what color of surveyor tape or painted lath the gas company and/or surveyors used to mark out the buried utility lines, and avoid using that color to avoid confusion and a potential mishap.

, You will need quite a number of items:


Fence posts (treated wood, metal, or metal T-posts), both with the tapered ends and some that have no tapered ends for use as top bracing posts on corner braces;
Barbed, smooth or paige wire or, boards or rails depending on what kind of fence you have settled on;

For wire fences especially, all wire comes in rolls so you will need to build a contraption that allows the spool of wire to freely spin when you pull it along and unroll a strand of wire along the fence line, all without you having to hold the very heavy new spool (most new spools of barbed wire weigh around 70 pounds (31.8 kg) to 90 pounds (40.8 kg), which is not easy to carry for most people who have a lot of fence to build) and walk along to unroll it. Start with a metal or iron rod or pole that easily fits in the center of the spool, then go from there with any spare wood or metal parts you find that you can hammer or weld together. Note, though, that iron or metal parts tend to be more durable than wood, even when a wooden spool holder is held together by screws.

There are all sorts of inventions many producers have created that has worked for them, from truck-mounted holders to tractor-loader holders, all with the same purpose: Allow the spool to spin freely on its center axis so that it can be more easily unrolled. Simply type in ""barb wire spool holder"" to your favorite search engine and be prepared to be inspired by the search results.




A ratcheting come-along wire stretcher (hand-held or operated from a vehicle, the latter ideal for wire fences longer than 20 feet (6.1 m) or 30 feet (9.1 m) long);
Fencing pliers;
A hammer (if you don't already have a good heavy-duty one);
Nails (6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) spiral or ringed nails for putting up board or rails and corner posts) or fencing staples (come various sizes depending on the size of wire you are putting up. Most common small sizes are usually 1.25 inches (3.2 cm), and the common large sizes are 2.5 inches (6.4 cm));
A heavy mallet (optional, though useful for putting in corner braces, and maybe pounding in some fence posts);
A post-pounder (rented from your local farm supply store); and
A chainsaw or hand-saw (if you don't already have either) for sawing the tops of bracing posts and pounded posts used for forming the stabilizing corners of your fences.

, An auger or post hole digger is used to dig any holes that are required, especially for the start of constructing corner braces. The posts are buried in a hole that is as deep as is necessary in your area, depending on the type of soil you have. Corner brace posts need to be dug so that the base is sunk in at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) to 2 feet (0.6 m) deep.

, Corner posts are usually larger in diameter and even longer than line posts. Some people choose to set them in concrete, however others argue that setting them in concrete will make them more prone to rot than if they were set in gravel, sand or the soil they are to be set in. Make sure they are straight and level (it is never good to have crooked corner posts!), before installing the top post connecting all three sunken posts. Fill in the space around the three posts with the soil that was dug out, gravel, sand, or concrete if you so choose.


You should have a an approximate right 90-degree angle formed between the post that is standing at the very center point of the corner of your fence and the other two on either side.
Connect the bracing, horizontal posts with the three posts. Use a tape measure, a pencil, and a chainsaw to mark and cut out the points where the posts are to meet and be very snug with each other. You may need to use a mallet to fully connect the top post with the sunken-in posts. For constructing H-corners with a bracing wire:

Place the blunt-end post on top of the two standing posts, and mark the top portion that needs to be removed on the standing posts, and mark the portion at either end of the brace (along the curved side, not the flat side) that will also need to be removed. Allow for 6 inches (15.2 cm) to be cut down into the post before removing the length marked out at a 90-degree angle. You should end up with a right-angle cut into the standing posts and the same at either end of the bracing post; the cuts facing each other directly on the standing posts, and one the same side of the bracing post. Do not remove more than what is marked, rather right on the mark or slightly less to allow for a more snug fit of the bracing post.
Place the bracing post over the cuts and hammer in the ends, trying to do both at the same time, or rather not first working on getting one end all the way in before trying the other. As mentioned, use a mallet if the braces are too tight to use with a hammer. Hammer in a couple nails into the end of the bracing post to keep it in place.


Install the brace wire. The brace wire crosses from the top of one post down to the other, and tightening that wire with a stick by winding the wire up as tight as possible without breaking it further enhances the strength of the cross brace.

Direction of where the brace wire is located is really important. The wire should be looped around the top of the very middle corner brace, and sloped down to the post on the outside of the corner. Smooth galvanized wire is highly recommended, with four to five loops between each posts, then twisted. Direction of twist is up to you. Hammer in two or three staples over the wire on each of the standing posts to secure it.


Repeat with the other side of the corner. And, repeat this step with all other corners.

Note that with board or rail fences, installing corner braces is not required. Even hot-wire temporary fences do not require permanent corner braces.



, This is to act as a guide to where to sink the line posts in with the post-pounder. The first wire should be around 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) off the ground.


This step is usually not necessary for board or rail fences, nor temporary electric fences.

, Line posts (or ""fence posts"" mentioned above) must be set at regular intervals. This distance varies widely from fence to fence, and can range from as close as 6 feet (1.8 m) apart and as far as 50 feet (15.2 m) apart. Closer is better if finances allow, and is a necessity if you are building holding or working corrals that will take a lot of abuse from the animals herded in them. All of the line posts you use that are would should be treated posts--no exceptions should be made, because untreated wood posts have a much shorter life-span than those that have been chemically pressure-treated. These same posts should taper at the end which makes it easier for the post-pounder to drive them into the ground.


Ideally line posts should be sunk in 14 to 18 inches (35.6 to 45.7 cm) deep regardless of terrain. More posts will be needed for more uneven terrain such as the edge of a hill or into a valley.

, You will need to judge how many strands you want especially for wire fences. The standard is four wires per fence-line (especially for barbed-wire fencing), but some producers prefer to install five or six-wire fences especially along roads.


Make sure each wire is evenly spaced with the other. This is also part of what makes a fence strong and sturdy. If the wires are not evenly spaced it makes it easy for an animal to put its head through the fence or even be able to go right through or under the fence without any problems. You must make it difficult for this to happen.
For board to rail fences, the standard is three board or rails, one on top of the other and evenly spaced per fence line.

, Each line post will need to be connected to the wires strung up by staples. This is important because livestock will find a hole in the fence, and a hole can be a wire that is not connected to a post with a fence staple, or a wire that has been broken from too much pressure exerted on it. The staple should be hammered in at an angle to the wire (never perfectly perpendicular), and the loop slightly pointing up.


It takes a lot of practice to get good at hammering staples in so they look nice and neat. They are not like hammering nails, because the two pointed ends allow for a lot more give than a single-spiked nail. Each blow to the staple must be right on (ideally, blows happening so that the angle of the hammer head is next to perfectly perpendicular to the angle of the post)so that it won't angle up too much into the wood, or bend so much that the staple gets so flat it needs to be replaced. Also, when first attempting to hammer you may miss it so that the staple goes flying off somewhere in the grass and gets lost forever!
Check the perimeter of the fence-line to see if you missed any staples or anything else that may be amiss.

,, Once you are done building the fences, you can finally let your animals out to pasture. Keep an eye on them for an hour or so as they wander the perimeter of their new pasture to see if they find a hole to go through. If there's no problems, then you're good to go!

The directions given here are for a basic incubator that is affordable for most hobbyists.Since there are different types of incubators, it's important to have the correct directions for your specific incubator.Be aware that the least inexpensive incubators will have only manual controls. This means that you will need to diligently monitor temperature, turning, and humidity many times a day. Pricier models have automatic controls for these processes, which require you to do a little less - though still daily - monitoring.
If the incubator did not come with written instructions, look for the serial number on the incubator and the manufacturer's name. Check the manufacturer's website for directions or contact the company's customer service department by phone or email to obtain directions.;
, Carefully wipe or vacuum off any visible dust or debris from all the surfaces of the incubator. Then wipe down all surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge dipped in a diluted bleach solution (mix 20 drops of household bleach in 1 quart of water.) Use gloves to protect your hands from the bleach and wring the cloth or sponge out before wiping down the incubator. Allow the incubator to air dry thoroughly before plugging it in for use.This cleaning step is particularly necessary if you bought the incubator second-hand or if you had it stored away somewhere, collecting dust.
Keep in mind that sanitation is highly important. Diseases can be transmitted through the eggshell to the developing embryo.

, Ideal room conditions are 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid placing the incubator near a window, air vent, or any other area that experiences air flow or drafts., Make sure you don't plug the cord into an outlet where it could easily detach, or where children might be able to unplug it. Check as well that that particular outlet is working., Consult the directions for the incubator to confirm the correct amount of water to add.

, You must calibrate the incubator to ensure the temperate is correct and stable at least 24 hours prior to incubating any eggs.Make sure to adjust the incubator's thermometer so that it will measure the temperature around where the center of an egg will reach in the incubator.
Adjust the heat source until the temperature reads between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 and 38.9 degrees Celsius).Getting the correct incubator temperature is very important. Low temperatures can keep the embryos from developing, while overly high temperatures can kill the embryos and cause abnormalities., The temperature should still be within the target range. Do not add eggs if the temperature has fluctuated outside of the target range as the eggs will not hatch properly., You will want to incubate the eggs within 7 to 10 days after they have been laid. Viability decreases as the eggs age.Don't attempt to incubate eggs you bought from a supermarket. The eggs sold in stores are infertile and will not hatch.Locate hatcheries or farmers in your area who sell eggs for hatching. You will need to get eggs that are produced by hens in a flock with a male bird, or else the eggs may not be fertile. Contact your local agricultural extension office if you have difficulty finding an egg source. The office may have recommendations for local poultry farmers.
Consider how many eggs you want to incubate. Note that it is very rare for all of the incubated eggs to hatch and that certain species have higher viability than others. You should expect about 50-75% of the fertile eggs will hatch, although it possible that this could be higher.Store eggs in cartons at 40 to 70 degrees F (4.5 to 21.1 degrees C) until ready to incubate. Rotate the eggs daily by propping up different ends of the carton each day or carefully turning over the carton., You should always wash your hands whenever handling the eggs or incubator after you have disinfected it. This will keep any bacteria from potentially transferring to the eggs or their environment.

, Allowing the eggs to warm up will decrease the amount and duration of temperature fluctuation in the incubator after you've added the eggs.

, Lightly draw the symbol of your choice on one side and then a different symbol on the other side. Marking the eggs in this manner will help you remember the egg turning sequence.Many people use X and O to indicate each side of the egg., Make sure the eggs are lying on their sides. The larger end of each egg should be slightly higher than the pointy end. This is important as the embryos can become misaligned if the pointy end is higher and may have difficult pipping, or breaking through the shell, when it comes time to hatch.Make sure the eggs are evenly spaced out and not too near the incubator’s edges or the heat source.

, The temperature will temporarily lower after you've introduced the eggs into the incubator, but it should readjust if you've calibrated the incubator correctly.Don't increase the temperature to compensate for this fluctuation. Doing so could damage or kill your embryos.

, You should be able to estimate your hatch date based on average incubation times for the bird species you want to hatch. For example, chicken eggs typically take 21 days to hatch, whereas many duck varieties and peafowl may take 28 days., Rotating the eggs and changing their position helps mitigate the effects of any temperature fluctuations. The rotation also helps mimic the behavior of a brooding hen.Turn eggs an odd number of times each day. This way, the symbol on the eggs will change every day after you turn the eggs, making it easy to see whether or not you've turned the eggs yet for that day.
As you do your daily turns, check to see if any eggs are cracked or spoiled. Remove these promptly and dispose of them in the garbage.
Move eggs around to different positions in the incubator.
Stop turning the eggs during the last three days of incubation, as at this point, the eggs will soon hatch and turning is no longer necessary.

, Humidity should be around 45 to 50 percent throughout incubation, except during the last three days when you will want to raise it to 65 percent. You may need higher or lower humidity levels depending on the type of eggs you wish to hatch. Consult your hatchery or the available literature on hatching your particular species of bird.Measure the humidity level in the incubator. Using a wet bulb thermometer or hygrometer, take a reading of the humidity level. Be sure as well to record the temperature in the incubator using a dry bulb thermometer. To find the relative temperature between the wet bulb and dry bulb temperature readings, consult a psychrometric chart online or in a book.
Replenish the water in the water pan regularly. Filling up the pan helps maintain the desired level of humidity. If the water depletes, the humidity level will drop too low.Always add warm water.You can also add a sponge to the water pan if you want to increase the humidity., There should be openings on the sides and top of the incubator to allow air flow. Check to make sure these are at least partially opened. You will need to increase the amount of ventilation once the chicks begin to hatch.

, Candling the eggs is when you use a light source to view how much space the embryo occupies within an egg. After 7 to 10 days, you should see development of the embryo. Candling allows you to remove eggs with embryos that are not viable., Cut a hole in the can or box that is smaller in diameter than an egg.

, Take one of the incubated eggs and hold it over the hole. You should see a cloudy mass if the embryo is developing. The embryo will increase in size as you near the hatch date.If the egg appears clear, the embryo has not developed or the egg may never have been fertile in the first place.

, These are eggs are not viable and will not hatch., Stop turning and rotating eggs three days prior to the estimated hatch date. Most viable eggs will hatch within a 24-hour period., The cheesecloth will help catch bits of eggshell and other matter during and after the eggs hatch.

, You want the humidity level to be at 65%. Add more water or a sponge to the water pan to increase the humidity., Do not open once the chicks are three days from hatching., It's important to leave chicks in the incubator until they are completely dry. This can take four to six hours. You can leave the chicks in the incubator an additional 1 to 2 days, but you will want to lower the temperature to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius)., Once the incubator is clean, you can start the process all over again!

Although many herding dogs will attempt to protect the herd from predators, their primary job is to keep the herd together and move it.
Livestock protection dogs have been bred not to chase and intimidate a herd, but rather live quietly among it. A livestock protection dog must view the livestock as family, as the dog's relationship with the herd fuels its desire to protect it. It is much like house dog's drive to protect its family and home.
A good livestock guardian dog must have an advanced ability to make the right decisions on its own. That includes using aggression only when necessary, and only to protect the lives of its family.;
, They are a good choice when bears and mountain lions are a potential herd predator.

, Although some people feel that a wide range of dog breeds can be raised to protect livestock, the most commonly used breeds include:


Akbash
Maremma
Great Pyrenees
Anatolian Shepherds

,


Local veterinarian offices, animal shelters, dog rescue groups and animal associations may be able to provide you with contact information for locating your chosen breed of livestock guard dog.
Get your livestock guardian dog as a puppy and let it grow up with the herd that you want it to protect. If getting your puppy from a breeder, be sure to check into its bloodlines and look for herd-work lineage.
Alternatively, if getting an older dog, make sure you get one that was properly raised and trained for livestock protection.

The grow-out building holds new hatchlings, so no nursery is necessary.

, Typical buildings are about 5,000 square feet (464.515 m2). Different designs include concrete block, wood, or metal buildings, but all are thoroughly insulated and rest on a heated concrete foundation. Hot water pipes run through the concrete to provide a consistent temperature of 86 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 31 degrees Celsius) in the building; electric heating coils can be used but are less common.

, Pools about 1 foot (0.3 m) in depth with bottoms sloping towards a drain (for easy cleaning) and decks are prepared for each pen before laying insulation board and then pouring the concrete. Pens are about 12 feet (3.7 m) long and 14 feet (4.3 m) wide; each has a deck 5 feet (1.5 m) wide for feeding and basking and a pool 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. The deck is next to the center aisle so you can feed the alligators and hose out their pens easily (and without entering the pens). A 3-foot (0.9 m) wall of concrete block separates the pen from the aisle (to prevent climbing out and escaping).


Each pen can house about 160 2-foot (0.6 m) alligators or 50 4-foot (1.2 m) alligators and be divided to separate alligators under 2 feet (0.6 m) in length (0.6 m) from those over 2 feet (0.6 m); some states require this by law.

Schedule feeding and pen cleaning at different times.",How to Start an Alligator Farm3," Alligator feeds in pellet form are preferred by many alligator farmers and eliminate keeping a stock of fresh-frozen meats (such as beef, chicken, deer, fish, and horse) on hand. You can also use a combination of feed and meat.

, Rates for the first year are 25 percent of body weight per week and are reduced to 18 percent by the third year. Overfeeding can cause gout in alligators, but is cured by a 7-to-10-day fast.

, Stressed alligators may develop brown spot disease, which leaves discolored spots on the hides and lessens their value. Prevent overcrowding in the pens (alligators do not congregate in the wild except at breeding season) and minimize outside noise by insulating the building.

, Alligators should never be agitated just before, during, or after feeding. You might coordinate the pen cleaning in the morning and the feeding in the afternoon to prevent stress.

Choose a donkey if you need an aggressive guardian animal to watch your livestock.,
Visit a reputable breeding farm or donkey rescue to find donkeys.,
Put the donkey in the field with the herd and watch for any signs of aggression.

",How to Find A Dog or Animal to Protect Your Sheep or Livestock2,"


Donkeys seem to innately dislike coyotes, dogs and foxes, which are known predators of livestock in many areas. Donkeys also make good herd protectors because they tend to be aggressive towards intruders.
Female donkeys are best for the job of sheep or livestock protecting. Male donkeys of all ages, both intact jacks and fixed geldings, have been known to injure and sometimes kill livestock either in over-zealous play or aggression.
Mules, which are half-breeds of donkeys and horses, should never be used as guardian animals. A mule is even worse than a male donkey and could stomp and kill the herd with no notice.

,


Donkeys exist in three sizes: miniature, standard and mammoth. Miniature donkeys are under 36-inches tall and are too small to protect against many predators. Standard donkeys range from 36 to 54 inches (91.4 to 137.2 cm) and are most commonly used as guardian animals. Mammoth donkeys, which often stand much taller than the 54 inches (137.2 cm), are expensive, as well as on the rare and endangered species list.
Donkeys do not necessarily need to be raised with their herd to function well as herd protector. Gentle female donkeys of any age, adopted from a reputable donkey rescue group, often make wonderful guardian animals.

Find out if llamas have the characteristics you need in a herd animal.,
Visit a local llama farm or contact area rescues to find llamas to use as livestock guardians.,
Look for the necessary traits in the llamas that are required to be a good protector.",How to Find A Dog or Animal to Protect Your Sheep or Livestock3,"


Llamas are naturally territorial and tend to be wary of dogs.
Llamas make good guardian animals for goats, sheep, alpacas, miniature donkeys and horses, and sometimes even standard-size horses or cows in need of protection from coyotes, wild dogs, and the occasional single domestic dog.
Some guard llamas bond with the herd and consider the members its charges. A llama will herd the flock away from danger and stand guard when a herd member is giving birth or is ill or injured.
Other llamas remain present but detached from the herd, living among the livestock harmoniously but independently. These llamas protect the territory rather than the herd members.

,


Ask to see female llamas that are at least 1-1/2 years old and not pregnant.
Intact male llamas have been known to injure livestock in heat trying to mate with them. Unfortunately, gelded male llamas also sometimes retain their desire to mate, so male llamas should not be trusted as livestock guardian animals.

, Not all female llamas have what it takes to be a good livestock guardian. Llamas that tend to do well have the following characteristics:


Demonstrate respect for humans.
Accept halters and leads.
Allow you to examine and groom their body and feet.
Appear alert and confident.

Become very familiar with cattle, horses, sheep, poultry, llamas and pigs.,
Ask to shadow a current livestock judge.,
Join a competitive livestock judging team.,
Register for local county or city livestock judging.,
Apply to judge at the Minnesota State Fair.,
Keep a regular judging schedule at state shows.",How to Become a Livestock Judge in Minnesota," Many livestock judges come from an agricultural background where they learn about each of these animals. If you are not already familiar, visit local ranches or go online to find out more about breeds and standards for each type of animal.


You may consider getting a degree in Animal Science. The University of Minnesota also offers an Introduction to Animal Science course as a continuing education class. Most of the courses offered in Animal Science include field days to study the animals up close.
If you are in middle or high school, opt to become a 4-H member. This organization teaches students to raise and judge livestock. Students take on projects and then they can apply to compete in shows at county and state fairs.;
, Not only can this prepare you for the judging job requirements, but it is also a great way to network within this fairly exclusive community. Rate the animals and compare them with the judge's scores to find out your judging strengths and weaknesses.

, Children and young adults can join these teams through a 4-H program. Colleges and universities also offer traveling teams for students who are interested in livestock judging.


The University of Minnesota extension occasionally offers a 4-H Livestock Judging Camp. Request a brochure from the University of Minnesota. You must fill out an application listing your judging experience and pay a fee to be accepted.
The University of Minnesota's Department of Animal Science has competitive judging teams.

, Beginning at small venues will allow you to hone your skills without much pressure. Research and enter county fairs and small livestock shows.

, This fair takes place over labor day weekend, and it provides opportunities for 4-H members to enter competitions for cattle, goats, llamas, rabbits, poultry, sheep and swine. Go to the State Fair website, mnstatefair.org, to apply.

, You will need to network regularly with Minnesota livestock judges in order to receive an appointment at large shows.

Determine forage yield or quantity in your pastures.,
Estimate the utilization rate for your pasture.,
Understand the amount of dry-matter forage one animal unit consumes per month.,
Perform the calculations to get local stocking rate.,
Understand which variables are fixed and which are not.",How to Calculate Stocking Rates for Your Pastures1," Even though it's much easier if you obtain such information from a local county extension office, it's even more precise to develop the values yourself. Doing so takes time, diligence, a grazing stick, and a cheap microwave for the barn.

In order to get forage yield of your pastures you may need to do a bit of clipping in different sites around the pasture. Take a 1 ft x 1 ft quadrat and anywhere the quadrat is put down, clip the forage inside that square and put it in a brown paper bag. Label the bag to know which pasture it came from. Ideally, you should take about 10 or more of such clippings in the same pasture to get an albeit small representative sample size.
Take those forage samples, weigh the container you are going to put them in (should be in pounds to make things simple), then weigh the samples plus the container. Simply subtract the weight of the container to get the weight of the sample if your weigh scale does not have a ""tare"" function on it (most scales should). If your scale can be tarred, then set the container on it, tare it to zero, and put the sample on.
Dry the sample in a microwave oven, each session 1.5 to 2 minutes long, and keep a cup of water with the sample in the microwave to prevent it from burning. Weigh the sample after each session, and keep weighing until the weight of the sample is no longer decreasing. Record the weight as a dry weight, and continue with the other samples collected.
Once you have dried and weighed all the samples, take an average of all the final dry weights. To get forage yield in terms of pounds per acre, simply multiply the average result by 43,560 square feet per acre to convert pounds per square foot to pounds per acre.

Another method, which is much less time-consuming and tedious, but takes much more practice and head-arithmetic, is using a grazing stick. A grazing stick is basically just a yard stick with formulas on the side to calculate the amount of forage is in your pasture. Put the end of the stick down to the ground, and measure the height of the sward 15 to 20 times (never stretching the leaves of the plants) to get an average forage height in inches. Next, estimate forage density based on plant cover. Density is based on a percent basis, ranging from less than 75% to 90% cover (density is never, ever 100%). Then, based on forage type and density estimate, multiply average plant height by the dry matter yield of the forage type. This will give you an estimate of the amount of forage you have available per acre.

For example, with multiple measurements you came up with 10 inches of forage height. Looking at the density, you estimate that there is around 80% plant density. This is an orchard grass stand, so let's say the conversion factor is 160 lb per acre-inch (see Using a Grazing Stick for Pasture Management for the table used). Thus 10 x 160 = 1600 lb/acre.



;
, The rule of thumb for utilization rate, which is basically how much forage is going to be consumed versus left behind on a percent basis, is the longer a herd stays on the pasture, the lower the utilization rate. Also, the poorer the pasture, the lower the utilization rate. For most pastures, most stocking rates are based on a 50-percent utilization rate. However, if the pasture density is lower than 75 percent and height less than 6 to 8 inches, utilization rate should be closer to 25 or 30 percent. For this instance, let's assume that this pasture is going to see a 50% utilization rate., One animal unit is equal to one 1000 lb cow or cow-calf pair consuming 2.5 percent of her body weight in dry matter forages per day. On average, that cow or cow-calf pair is expected to consume around 800 lb of forage per month. This is is a fixed variable that does not change when performing stocking rate calculations, especially on continuous-grazed tame or extensively grazed native grassland areas., The formula for stocking rate is forage quantity (lb/acre) x (% utilization rate/100) / AUM in terms of forage consumption. Via the examples created in this article, the stocking rate example is (1600 lb/acre x 0.5) / 800 lb = 1.0 AUM/acre., Forage quantity and utilization rates are the two major variables that are prone to change. This is why you must measure the amount of forage available in your pasture and do the calculations so that you have an accurate measurement of what's available in your area.

Grazing sticks can be purchased at a local county extension office or applied research organizations. It's highly recommended every person who manages and grazes cattle have one every time they go out to check the pasture.

"
Begin preparations before winter comes.,
Check the electrical items and all barn wiring.,
Clear away fire risks.,
Remove hazards.,
Stockpile sand and rock salt near the entrance to the barn.,
Care for the barn roof.,
Insulate the barn against the cold.,
Your livestock won't be able to graze in winter, so stash up some hay/ and or grains.,
Ensure adequate ventilation for the livestock.,
Check the water supply to the barn.,
Discourage pests.",How to Winterize a Livestock Barn," Start by checking around the area and barn for debris and overhanging branches. Trim any trees that might fall down due to high wind and snow.


If you don't already have adequate storage set up, this is the time to build some. Add shelves, hanging posts, saddle racks, cupboard space, etc., where you can put tack, blankets, tarps, feed, medicine, barn tools, etc. Use labels or color codes to help you to keep things in order.
Do a general clean up inside the barn and remove used, rusty, broken, dated, etc., items. Check for expired medications and foodstuffs and throw these out. Restock with fresh items in date, and place any items that could freeze into your house storage (out of the reach of children and pets). Remove old hay and bedding which can harbor allergens and molds.
Wash down the floors and remove any stains and dried on urine or feces. Clean all stall mats and refill under stall mats if needed.
Repair the fences around the barn, if any. Paint gates and sand off any rust from gate joins and paint with rustproof paint.

Replace any broken windows with cardboard or plywood if money is tight. Give all the windows a good clean to help improve the amount of light entering the barn over the winter months.
Clean and oil the barn doors. Check that they're moving properly on their tracks.
Winterize the animals that will end up in the barn over winter by making sure they have their vaccinations are up to date and any other medical needs are attended to.;
, It's important to ensure that any fire risks are removed or averted in the barn, and faulty electrical wiring is the leading cause of barn fires.Check the wiring, the fuse box, and all electrical cords for soundness. If you find broken circuits or fuses, get an electrician to check immediately.


Place electrical wires in conduit pipes to ensure that rodents and other animals cannot gnaw on them.
Check fire extinguishers are in place and in date.
Clean the furnace filters (if you have one) and check to see if it might need to be replaced.
Replace any broken light bulbs. Put wire metal cages around bulbs to prevent the potential for breakage or fire from straw or hay smoldering on the light bulb as it operates.Clean all light fixtures.
Service any heaters used in the barns.

, Besides electrical wiring, there are other things that should be cleared away to remove fire risks. Sweep up and remove any clutter from the barn, brush down cobwebs (use a broom, mop, or vacuum), and make sure that there are proper holders for hay and straw to prevent it from being strewn across the floor. Cobwebs that are hard to reach can be hosed down, or use a leaf blower. Remove birds' nests if there are any.


Store flammable products, including fuel, in a different place, not in the barn.
Avoid using extension cords in the barn.
Switch off and unplug all items in the ban when not in use, such as kettles, radios, portable fans, and heaters. All appliances used in a barn should have automatic shut-off switches.
If you haven't already installed fire alarms, consider doing so. Check existing ones and update their batteries.

, Anything that could potentially harm an animal or person inside the barn should be removed or stored safely. Remove all electrical cords, ropes, dangling wires, etc. These present tangling hazards. Lock away cleaning products, medications, and anything else that is toxic if swallowed or over-consumed.

, Sand is useful for breaking down ice around the barn and for covering up spills inside the barn. The sand can be used to help livestock get traction when moving outside for brief outings. The rock salt can be used to break down ice.

, Check the roof of the barn and replace any frayed shingles that may look like they are damaged. The weather during winter will just increase the problem later on, which you don't want happening.


Repair leaks. On rainy days, check to see if the barn has any holes or leaks in the roof. You can also try doing this on a sunny day by shutting all the doors, covering the windows with the lights off to see if any light shines through cracks.
Clear out the rain gutters.

, If you have the money, it would be best to insulate the attic of the barn. Tight on money? Use whatever you can find and be creative. However, try to not use something the livestock won't mind munching on. Some cheap but effective insulation suggestions include bales of straw, old carpet, lining for weed control, blankets, and corn stalks.

,


If you have plumbing in the barn, use proper pipe insulation and heat tape to prevent them from freezing over and possibly bursting. Wrap the water heater in insulation.
Once snow begins to start pouring down, it can also be used as an insulator. Push the snow around the barn. Try to also remember that snow can get heavy. Don't bury the animals.
Consider getting a litmus test to make sure the barn is thoroughly insulated.

, It's important that the animals get fresh air as well as staying warm, in order to prevent respiratory illnesses.Place thick plastic on the outside of most of the windows to make it warm, but don't make it too tight; just enough to eliminate drafts.



Caulking around windows and doors is a good idea to keep out the wind.
Close louvers and soffits not used for ventilation, or that cause drafts.

, Make sure it's in good order and that the pressure is adequate for both using in the barn and for using in case of a fire. Have well pumps serviced. During winter, warm water is an important element for drinking and general use,so be sure to check the heated water supply.

, Feed should be kept in rodent proof containers and bins. Put netting around rafters to discourage birds from nesting. Place plastic owls and snakes in the barn to scare off some birds and rodents – these can be somewhat effective.

Find some paper, a pencil, or a computer with Microsoft Word, One-Note or a similar text program.,
Start brainstorming.,
Do a SWOT analysis.,
In a separate table, write four columns starting with ""Where am I at now,"" ""Where do I want to be,"" ""How do I get there"" and ""How do I know I have arrived"".,
On a different file (if you're typing on a computer) or a different piece of paper/page, start writing out your Business Plan.,
Identify the type of farm ownership.,
Tie it all together.",How to Write a Business Plan for Farming and Raising Livestock," This will enable you to write or type down everything that comes to your mind, including the goals and aspirations you have for starting up a livestock operation.;
, You don't have to make a fancy, scholarly-essay out of it, nor does proper grammar, spelling or writing skills matter here. Making bullet points of what you want to do, how you want to do it, and what you're willing to do to get there is the best way to start.


You should be mainly brainstorming about your goals and objectives. It's much more effective to run any business when you have a goal in mind to reach rather than having vague ideas of ""wanting to do something with animals"". That's simply not enough, and is certainly not going to get you anywhere fast!
As you consider your goals, remember that strategy is not the same as marketing. The strategy for your business is how you plan to deliver value to your customers (your ""value proposition""), how you intend to you convince potential customers to obtain that value from you by communicating your distinctiveness as a producer (or, what makes you different from other farms or ranches), and why you can deliver that value better than other producers (your performance anatomy). Your marketing plan should explain how you intend to communicate your strategy to your existing and potential customers.

, SWOT is a popular acronym used in businesses and economics that stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Strengths and Weaknesses are the internal or controllable characteristics of a business. Opportunities and Threats are external characteristics that are out of your, your business or an industry's control. To do a SWOT analysis, make a table with four columns, with the titles being: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Place these titles at the head of each column. Or, if you think it's going to be too tedious and inconvenient to use a table, then you can also use a separate page for every factor.


Such an analysis is very simple and flexible to use, since you can use it to analyze your personal self, your business, or the industry you are wishing to start a career in.
These four planning strategy factors should describe everything about you, from showing what you can and can't do, what you may need assistance with from more professional and knowledgeable people, what you're willing to learn, what troubles and issues you may face in your farming venture, and what chances may enable you to both succeed and become profitable.

Remember that there are two forces that will affect you and you will need to analyze:


Internal forces that you have control over such as what breeds you choose, whether you want to run an intensive or extensive operation, how you feed your animals, etc.

External forces that you have no control over such as the weather, the topography and soil-type of the land you are farming/ranching on, local, national and international industry issues, market prices, product demand and consumer preferences.




Do an internal SWOT analysis of you and your operation. Ask yourself what your good at and what needs improvement, what you can do to improve and what things may make you reconsider doing any sort of farming. This will also include the consideration of getting help from people who are more experienced than you in certain areas of your plan and your pool of knowledge. Help can range from advice from a veterinarian, an accountant that has experience in doing financial assessments of farming operations, a farm building inspector, a breeder that has been in the business you are interested in for over 20 years, etc.

Also analyze your farm, the land your farm sits on and your family. Ask similar questions as mentioned above, only with your family you will need to ask about times you should have to spend with them, what will happen if you put your farming operation before your family, what you can do to encourage and teach your kids to be involved in your operation, etc.


Do an external SWOT analysis of the type of livestock industry you plan on getting into, whether it's bovine (beef or dairy), equine, porcine, poultry, caprine/ovine, or even exotics (such as bison, elk or emu). It is highly recommended to do your research in order to complete a thorough SWOT analysis of the type of industry you are interested in. Look at everything from national industry news from well-known and local agricultural newspapers and magazines, to visiting trusted websites. For example, if you are wanting to get into the Canadian cattle business, have a look at the Canadian Cattlemen's Association webpage at CCA.org. You will find plenty of information on national industry news and concerns. Western Producer (for the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) is also a great newspaper to look through for various industry news and updates.

The more research about what you're getting into that you do at this stage, the more aware you will be of what to expect when surprises do come. When you finally get started on your business plan, you'll be far more aware of the pitfalls, challenges, needs and requirements it takes to be involved and compete in the kind of livestock/farming operation you want to have.



, Again, brainstorm your way through this. If you only come up with one or two points, that's fine, but to break down these four questions further to help you answer them, here are some points to consider when answering these questions:



Where am I at now? Include a SWOT analysis (see earlier step), for these areas: customers, operations, human resources, and finance. If you don't have a business, a SWOT analysis as mentioned in the previous step is totally fine.

Where do I want to be? This is the question where you establish all your goals and objectives that you wish to achieve within the next 3 to 5 years. Include everything such as financing, marketing, herd health, breeding, birthing, weaning, culling, selling, pasture management, feed management, costs analysis, etc.

This question is also good to address your personal, family and business goals. When doing family goals, have each of your family member write out goals for themselves, not discussing anything when writing them out, but discussing them after they have been written out.


Personal goals include things like working fewer hours, furthering your education in areas like different commodity markets or accounting and production programs, etc.
Business goals are focused mainly on the farm unit as a business entity; examples include maximum debt load to carry, possibly owning or controlling x number acres, etc.





How do I get there? This is the most important part of your business plan, because this is the area where you put on paper how you want to get the things you want for a better you, family and business. Brainstorming is great tool to use in this section, as you can always have a Plan B, C, D, etc., in addition to your Plan A.

How do I know I have arrived? If you visualize your business plan as a journey, it is not difficult to understand that you will need to measure your progress along the way and determine if you are moving towards your goals, spinning your wheels or rolling backwards. This is done by defining, collecting and reviewing metrics, measurements and Key Performance Indicators on a regular basis in order to validate your plan and decisions, direct your future activities, justify any modifications to the plan and intervene when things are not happening according to the plan. All your goals should be measurable. Metrics and measurements will give you the answer to this important question.

, Create the Business Plan by making three main plans: Strategic Plan, Operating Plan, and a Succession Plan:



Strategic Plan. This is where you tie in all your brainstorming thoughts, ideas, objectives and goals together from steps 2 to 4. Basically, the kind of business plan you would see other firms develop is the following:


Vision Statement: A statement of what you or your farm will look like in the next 5 to 10 years.

Mission: This determines or defines the purpose the organization attempts to perform in society. This statement should concisely explain what the company does, for whom and why.

Values: These are general standards or guidelines that are important to your farm and farm family.

Situational Analysis: This is the process of identifying and understanding how your business is positioned within the environment you operate, both internal and external. Step 3 is what this part of the strategic plan is all about.

Goals: What are the major achievements you would like to accomplish in the next 3 to 5 years?

Objectives: How do you plan on achieving your goals?

Critical Success Factors: Areas of performance critical to long-term successes of an organization, and its development, growth and achievement. For each CSF you should define one or more Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which are metrics you will use to determine if you are achieving your CSFs. CSFs are expressed as general statements of goals (""Maintain customer satisfaction."") while KPIs are more specific (""Decrease in number of product packaging complaints."")

Plan of Action: Strategies and actions that are implemented to meet the targeted objectives.

In a nutshell, you don't have to go through the headache of answering all of the questions posted above. Instead, use the three simple questions above in Step 4 as a means to answer all 8 of these standard business-plan questions.





Operating Plan. This is the plan where you outline the day-to-day activities of the business including what gets done, how it's done, who does it and when it's done. This plan is generally shorter term and usually revolves around a production cycle. There are four sub-plans that are important to this plan: Production plan, Marketing plan, Financial plan, and Human Resources plan:


Production Plan: What will be grown or processed to be sold? For livestock producers this includes two main components: Animals, and Cropping systems. With the animals, this is where you lay out things like breeding, culling, weaning, care of newborn animals, herd health, etc. The second includes number of acres and type of commodity to be grown to support the herd (hay, silage, green feed, pasture, grain, etc.). Identify all types of enterprises on your farm.

Production resources are also important to mention: Land base, Equipment base, and Buildings and Structures.



Marketing Plan: Where and how will you sell your commodities? Remember, selling is just getting rid of what you have. When you market, you have to plan to sell commodities at a good price.

Financial Plan: This includes budget analysis, revenues and expenses, debt, unpaid labour, opportunity costs, benchmark analysis of yourself from other operations, statements of cash flow, depreciation of machinery, animals, buildings, etc., wages, family living costs, etc.

Human Resources plan: Most farms rely on one worker (i.e., the owner) to run the operation. But, nonetheless, human resource plans should highlight hiring issues facing the business and how to address them. It should further describe the kind of people that are required to operate the business (general responsibilities, title, skills, availability and any training programs needed.)

Quality plan: Quality control is the ability to define what you will produce and the desired quality you must achieve in your products, establish the processes required to do so, continually check your product against quality parameters, recognize when you have not delivered the desired quality and have the means to improve your process activities to correct the issue and return your product to the desired quality. There are many quality frameworks and methodologies, but one of the simplest is Dr. W. Edward Deming's Continuous Quality Improvement cycle. It has four steps, which are repeated continuously to gradually improve quality and process maturity over time.


Plan: Establish the objectives for whatever it is you intend to do, the processes necessary achieve those objectives and the metrics and measurements required to control the processes and prove that the objectives are being achieved.

Do: Execute the plan and collect metrics and measurements along the way as defined in the previous phase.

Check: Review the results, metrics and measurements and determine if any improvements can and should be made to the plan.

Act: Implement the improvements so the next time the process is executed the results will be better.





Succession Planning. This can be the hardest part of a business plan, as one has to plan what should happen if the main operator is injured or worse, dies. Succession planning includes developing a continuity plan for your business and determining the process of transitioning a business to new owners. This transition may be an outside sale (equipment and land auction sale), or an inheritance sale (passing the business down to the next generation).

, There are seven main types of ownership: Proprietorship, General Partnership, Limited Partnership, Co-ownership, Joint Venture, Corporation, or Trust. These are outlined briefly next:



Proprietorship: This is the simplest form of business organization. It primarily involves one person running the whole she-bang. Debts and negligent acts committed by employees are the responsibility of the proprietor. But, all the legal complications and expenses and negotiations for agreements are not required, nor is a business name required.

General Partnership: This means two or three people running an operation. With more than one person running a farm, this means that the business must have a registered name, and each partner is responsible for all debts, obligations and liabilities of the operation. This partnership automatically dissolves with a death, bankruptcy, or insolvency.

Limited Partnership: This is basically one person is responsible for everything in the firm, whereas the other is only there to supply capital, nothing more or less. A limited partner has no active part in the goings-on of an operation, but he may inspect the books of the firm and advise management.

Co-ownership: This is where two or more persons own property jointly.

Joint Venture: This is commonly used in farming, where there is a joint partnership between parties, and is created in order to conduct a specific or limited commercial venture without creating a partnership. This is commonly a temporary arrangement between two parties.

Corporations: These are legal entities where shareholders own the corporation through the ownership of shares. It is a separate legal entity, distinct from its shareholders. The individual shareholder's liability is limited to that person's investments in the corporation, unless the shareholder has personally guaranteed the obligations of the corporation. A corporation can provide very flexible framework in terms of succession to the next generation. The owner may also give employees shares in the growth and profit of the operation without giving up management rights of a partner.

Trust: This is a relationship where legal ownership of the property is separated from beneficial ownership of the property.

, Don't be afraid to make changes to your plan. A business plan is not some rigid rule-setting standard that must be set in stone. Rather, it is a paper that can be changed as the business grows and as new ideas and new issues arise. Usually a business plan should be reviewed at least once a month to once a year to look at what was written and what changes should be made.

Shop for a ranch online.,
Determine whether you want to invest your money in a ranch.,
Talk to your local bank about financing options.,
Work your private contacts.,
Start a large, profitable ranch.,
Get a small, personal ranch.,
Look into the carrying capacity of the land.,
Take location into account.",How to Start a Ranch1," You can begin searching for a ranch online, where you will find a variety of ranching real estate sites. Real estate sites specializing in ranches usually focus on a particular region, such as California or Texas ranches. Some of the sites allow you to sort listings by location, price range and acreage., Ranches are a significant investment. If you want to keep your money in a safe investment that is a little more fun than a government bond or savings account, a ranch could be a decent investment.In California, you may pay between $5,000,000 and 21,000,000 for a ranch.
In Texas, you might be able to get a ranch for as little as 400,000. You can also easily spend upwards of 5,000,000.
You should only invest in a ranch if you want to spend significant time at the ranch, since ranches can be difficult to value and to sell.

, Some local banks work with agencies such as the USDA to help finance beginner farmers and ranchers. Ask your local bank about the local beginning farmer financing initiative, which is a special lending pool designed for young farmers.You could also look into the “Young & Beginning” program offered by Farm Credit Services. This program helps young farmers get on their feet with real estate loans, insurance, education reimbursements, youth in agriculture loans, as well as college scholarships.

, If you know any property owners, you should contact them directly to work out an arrangement to ranch on their land. Depending on your financial situation and ranching goals, you could work out a cash deal or a work-in arrangement. In other words, you could work to pay for some or all of the land or get a good deal by paying with cash., If you want to make money with a traditional working ranch, try to determine your possible sources of income from ranching, hunting rights, tourism and other sources. If you want to make money, you should look at emerging markets such as sheep farming and carbon offsetting., If you are starting a ranch for personal and lifestyle reasons, you might want to purchase a ranch that is conveniently located and hire a ranch manager to keep the cost of the ranch relatively low. If you start a small ranch, remember that it is a significant investment of time. You will be spending at least twenty hours a week working on your small ranch, in addition to whatever you do for a living.Small ranchers do not typically realize a profit, although there are exceptions.If you are mostly interested in ranching for recreational or lifestyle purposes, you may want to start with a small ranch and a few head of cattle.
A small ranch can be a great way of living an active and outdoor lifestyle, as long as you have other sources of income.

, Go to the local conservation office and ask about the production potential of the land you are looking to purchase. You want to consult with professionals about the soil type, vegetation, annual precipitation and other local ecological conditions that will determine the number of cattle your land can support.


Sellers may tell you the land can support more cattle than is realistic. If you live in the USA, the local Natural Resource Conservation Office will have helpful data to help you determine the potential productivity of the land you hope to purchase.

, Ranches in relatively close proximity to urban centers retain their value and cost a great deal, as well as ranches in high demand regions like Montana or Texas. Although you may want to get away from the city to a remote ranch, you should also consider the time it will take you to get to the ranch for a vacation.If it is a working ranch and you will also have a day job, you should consider the travel time to and from the ranch.

Determine forage quantity or yield of your pastures.,
Determine the number of acres to graze.,
Estimate the percent utilization desired.,
Get the weights of your animals.,
Estimate the rate of intake as percent of body weight per animal per day.,
Calculate it all together.,
Understand the variables prone to change.",How to Calculate Stocking Rates for Your Pastures2," The methods already discussed above are exactly the same for this method. Assume that you came up with an estimated 1600 lb/acre of forage., This is basically total amount of area to graze, or how many acres one set paddock is. Let's assume, for this example, that you are wanting to graze 20 acres., As already mentioned, the lower the forage quantity, the lower the utilization rate should be. For this example, let's stick with the 50% standard already mentioned., At this time it's safe to remind you that this method of stocking rate calculation is not excluding other livestock species. You can use sheep, goats, horses, etc. to estimate stocking rate. Mind, though, the rate of intake as mentioned in the next step. To continue this example, let's assume you're wanting to graze 1250 lb lactating cow-calf pairs., Cattle are expected, on pasture, to have a rate of intake ranging from 2 to 3.5 percent dry matter intake of body weight per day; dairy cows especially are going to be closer to 2.5 to 3.5 percent of forage DM of body weight per day. Horses are going to be about the same, and sheep and goats (lactating) are expected to have a rate of intake of 3.5 to 4 percent of their body weight in DM forage per day. Let's assume you have these cows consuming 2.5 percent of their body weight in DM forage per day., The stocking rate formula, for this method, is Stocking Rate (animals/acre) = (Total DM lb of forage/acre x # of acres x (% Utilization rate/100)) / (Animal weight (lb) x (intake rate as % BW/animal/100)). Using the example created for this article, calculate stocking rate as follows: Stocking rate = (1600 lb/acre x 20 acres x 0.5) / (1250 x 0.025) = 512 animals/acre.

Do note that this is on a daily basis. If you wanted to include the number of days animals are on pasture, then simply add a multiplication of number of days to the denominator (which is multiplying animal weight to rate of intake) to get the number of animals needed to that particular paddock for x number of days. If we were to add 2 days to the example above, then the number of animals per acre is 256 instead of 512.

, Unlike the first method above, all of the variables that are used in the formula in the previous step are prone to change. Everything from knowing the weight of your animals to knowing forage quantity is important to get an accurate estimate of stocking rate--on a daily basis--for a particular paddock or pasture."

Make sure you have everything to set up your ranch.,
Build facilities for your dude ranch.,
Hire a ranch manager.,
Buy affordable, quality cattle.",How to Start a Ranch2," In addition to the land and the cattle, you will need a lot of physical equipment to start up your ranch. For instance, you will need the following equipment:Tractor
Truck
Stock trailer
Corrals
Fencing
Fuel
ATV
Feed for all of your animals

, To get a dude ranch operation off the ground, you will need to make sure you have comfortable sleeping and dining facilities. In addition, you will need to build all of the recreational facilities that you want to offer guests. For instance, if you hope to attract tennis players, you will need to build a tennis court on the property. If you want to offer mountain bike riding, you will need to build trails.Once you have the property, startup costs for a dude ranch are between $10,000 and $50,000.
Once you have it off the ground, you may be able to charge between $700 and $2,000 per week per person.
If you start a dude ranch, you are in the hospitality business and will have to deal with some customers who may not appreciate the rustic outdoors as much as you., Ranching requires significant technical expertise, including not only business management but also cattle and grazing management.As such, you may want to a hire a ranch manager with technical expertise in these areas, as well as irrigation, rangeland, cattle and ranching equipment.Hiring a ranch manager or a management firm will allow you to focus on the more pleasurable aspects of ranching, such as horseback riding, hunting or fishing.

, Cattle are one of the biggest expenses in ranching. Develop a network of friends and professionals to give you advice on which livestock to purchase, since it is easy to overpay for livestock. You also want to make sure you are paying for good quality, genetically superior livestock, since you will be investing a lot in them every year."

Properly secure the animal to apply the tag.,
Identify the tagging site on the animal's ear.,
Keep the applicator clean to prevent infection.,
Place each half of the tag or button onto the applicator.,
Check the alignment of the tagger.,
Position the applicator in the identified tagging site on the animals ear.,
Examine the tag.,
Repeat for the other ear.,
Let the animal go.",How to Tag Cattle," Movement of the animal's head could create an undesirable situation when trying to properly apply a tag or button. This could result in injury to either the person or animal or both, and may also result in improper tagging of the animal.


For cattle the best equipment to use is a chute with a head gate, or even a squeeze chute. Place a halter, and/or nose lead or ring on the animal and tie the lead rope to the side of the head gate tight enough so that it impedes the animal to move its head as you apply the tag or button.
For young calves, a head gate is not needed. Simply putting the calf on its side by bending over the calf, grabbing the flank and neck and hoisting it onto its side, then pinning it with your knee on its neck is sufficient when tagging it.

Tagging should be left for last when you have the calf on the ground, since the applicator often will cause a calf to become a bit more vocal than you like, particularly when its momma is close at hand.

;
, Tags should be applied in the middle third of the ear between the upper and lower ribs. It is important, when using electronic identification (EID) or Radio-Frequency identification (RFID) tags or buttons, to apply the visual panel or male portion on the outside-back part of the ear and the button or tag, which is the female portion, on the inside of the ear.


Also make sure that the last few digits of visual panel matches with the digits on the button or tag.

, Use rubbing alcohol or a disinfectant solution to clean the jaw and pin portion of the applicator before and after use. You should also clean the tagging area of the animal's ear.

, The visual panel stud must be inserted completely onto the applicator pin and the panel/button portion placed under the opposite clip.


Often a new tagger applicator will have a sticker or indentation on that tagger telling which end is which when placing the parts of the tag on. If not, the best rule of thumb to go by is that the point part goes over the pin and the tag or button on the other end. Also make sure the front of the tag or pin is facing away from the male end of the stud, not towards it. Thus is much easier to remember if you have bought tags that already have a bar-code and number on them.

, This must be done before you tag. Simply close the jaw of the applicator to the point where to the two halves just meet. The stud should be in line with the hole of the button or tag.

, Firmly and quickly close the applicator and release. You will hear a loud click when the stud goes completely into the hole, and upon releasing the tagger the tag or button will have stayed in place.

, This is to verify that it's correctly, comfortably, and securely positioned. Once satisfied, you may want to record the number of that particular animal for future reference.

, Quite often a producer will need to have a button in one ear and a tag in the other. Some will go as far as placing one tag in each ear. Regardless, you have the option to put in as many tags or buttons as you feel necessary.

, Once the tag or button is in, it should stay there for years to come. Note that buttons tend to last longer than tags.

Feeding your cows is the first and most important part of taking care of dairy cows.,
Maintain a good herd health program.,
Check your cows regularly for any signs of illness or injury.,
Keep the stalls where they live or go to be milked clean with fresh bedding.,
Maintain and regularly clean the milking supplies.,
Milk them.,
Maintain a breeding program.",How to Take Care of Cows1," You have to feed them to help them produce milk. Without feed, don't expect your dairy cows to be producing much milk. You can feed them hay, grain, silage or even let them graze grass if there is plenty of grass for your cows to eat. Be sure that they have constant access to clean water; cows should never go without water, especially when they are being raised for milk. You should try to feed them every day or as many times as necessary per day or week depending on how you are feeding them. If they're on pasture, you need to ensure they have fresh pasture. If they are on a rotational grazing schedule, you will need to switch paddocks every day, or at least as many times per day or per week as necessary.


If your dairy cows are on feed, make sure they are getting a formulated ration that best suits their needs as they are producing milk. This means feeds high in calcium, phosphorus, protein and energy, which will both help produce high-quality milk and keep them in good health.
Be sure to allow your cows free access to loose mineral as well.;
, This means keeping up-to-date with vaccinations and de-worming/de-licing programs. If you haven't already, please see your local large animal veterinarian for certain vaccinations and de-worming or de-licing products that are best for your herd.

, Dairy cattle are highly susceptible to mastitis and lameness issues, which may need to be attended to as soon as possible.

, This will need to be done every day. Replace dirty bedding (in the form of straw or sawdust) that has been soiled from manure with clean bedding. If you fail to do this you may invite higher cases of mastitis in your dairy herd.

, This is so that they do not pose a risk of mastitis to the cows when you milk them, and it also ensures that the milk you get from those cows is kept clean. Milk that is contaminated with dirt pose a high risk of having E. coli, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium spp., etc which can pose a health risk to humans if consumed.

, Dairy cows need to be milked twice a day, once every 12 hours, approximately. Depending on how many cows you have, you may have to milk them by hand or by machine. It is best to have machines milking them if you have more than three cows to milk.


The conventional standard is milking them twice a day, but small-time milkers or those with only one family cow have no problem with milking their cowonce a day.

, In order for dairy cows to be productive in producing milk, they need to be bred once a year to produce a calf. See the article How to Breed Dairy Cattle for more information.

Come prepared.,
Buy the animal when and if you are confident it is what you are looking for.

If it's a milk cow you love, milk her on a regular schedule.,
If it's a calf you have bought and are bottle feeding it, make sure it gets the proper milk replacer formula and amount per day.,
Check fences regularly.",How to Have a Pet Cow," Raising a cow can be expensive, but some are friendly enough to be kept as pets. There is the upside of free milk, but that requires a bull or artificial insemination (AI). A bull is even more expensive to care for than just one cow alone and it can be dangerous. AI is used to breed most cows in North America and is relatively cheaper to have done on your cow than renting or buying a bull. AI is not an easy task to do though, as it requires an experienced and skilled technician to properly judge when and how a cow needs to be AI'd.


Even if you want a cow to milk, they take up more feed than a beef cow does. You also need space to build a shed or barn to actually be able to milk the cow in!
Cows take up space, require lots of feed to keep, and can make your yard or field a mess if they are kept there for most of their lives. Like horses, a cow needs space to move around and graze, and is not happy kept in one small area all the time. They cannot live in your house nor can they be confined to a small suburban lot.
They also make a lot of manure, can get quite dirty, and even noisy when they're hungry or when they get in heat. They are also great escape artists (though not as much as a horse is), and are susceptible to a number of illnesses and diseases. Cows take a lot of care, it's not all about just putting it out to pasture and leaving her be!;
, Do you want it for milking, for your freezer, or as a mere lawn ornament?

, Base that decision on what your purpose is for getting a cow in the first place.


If you want a milk cow, it's best to buy a cow that has been used at a dairy farm but is being sold because she is no longer productive to that dairy farmer.

Try to avoid buying dairy calves, if you can. They take a lot more care than an older cow would, and death loss from bottle calves is much higher than if you bought a cow.


If you want to buy a bovine for your freezer, buy a couple steers from a local farmer or rancher. Whether they're beef or dairy it doesn't matter, so long as you feed them well enough so they have enough meat you can get at slaughter.
If you are wanting something that is merely a lawn ornament, consider getting a breed that takes less inputs than a regular cow would, such as one that is relatively disease-resistant, can do very well on grass alone, etc.

, It is best if you have at least 5 to 10 acres to work with so that you have enough space to graze the cow and have separate areas for the animal to sleep, drink, be milked and eat.

, Also make sure you purchase feed before you go and buy your animal.


Building a shelter and purchasing feed before you buy your animal is much better than scrambling last-minute to buy feed and build a shelter before anything unpredictable happens, like some sort of storm or something that would make it harder to care for your pet bovine.

, Know what you are looking for, what questions you need to ask, those sort of things. You should have done so in the steps above.


You should ask everything from health, breed, breeding, feeding, etc. before you consider buying. .

,, You need to confine your new pet to a small pen for several days to a week to get it used to its new surroundings.


If you let your new pet out into the big corral right away it will test the fence to see if it can escape and get back home. You do not want that, so you need to keep it confined for a little while.

, Be careful about letting feed go to waste, as wastage means that you need to spend more on feed. Once a cow learns that she will get feed after she's eaten half of the bale, it'll be harder to get her to clean up after herself.


Do not overgraze a pasture, nor let it be too under-grazed. This is important if you want to maintain pasture health in order to maintain the animal's health.
See How to Feed Cattle for more information on proper feed and feed management for your cow.

, Having a good mineral program will keep your animal healthy and productive, and will also help keep a healthy immune system.

, Cows are like pet cats and dogs: they can get sick too, and need to be vaccinated once or twice a year. See your local large animal veterinarian for the best vaccines to give your cow according to your area.

, This means deciding when to breed her, when she can calve, and when that calf should be weaned and/or sold. See How to How to Breed Dairy Cattle and How to Breed Beef Cattle for more information.

, This is optional of course, as most cattle that are kept on farms and ranches or even as pets are not groomed. Cattle are not horses, and will do just fine without a brush. Your bovine may be too shy to let you near to brush it anyway.

, Don't be disappointed if your pet cow doesn't head for your newly built shelter if it starts raining. Cattle will make use of any shelter available during inclement weather, whether it be the side of a building, or in a grove of trees.

, It's best if you milk her in the morning and/or in the afternoon, so that she has time to eat during the day before her next milking.

, A calf needs 10% of its body weight in milk per day, and this should be split in two or three feedings per day.

, Your pet will try to stretch the limits of the fence you put up, so regular checks and maintenance will make the fence strong and discourage your pet from trying to escape, if the chance should arise.

Train your steer to let you ride it.,
Find an extra wide saddle.,
Steer cattle with a nose bit.,
Show off your steer at community events.,
Trail ride your steer.",How to Ride a Steer1," Not all cattle will be willing to let you ride them without training. You will likely need to “break” a steer in order to ride it, in much the same way that horse trainers break horses. While most steer are good-natured and mild-mannered, they have to get used to the concept of allowing a human to sit on them. If possible, begin training a steer when they are a calf.Make the steer comfortable with you by spending time with it and petting it. Over time, gradually place more and more pressure on their back. Once they’re comfortable with you leaning most of your weight on their back, they will likely allow you to sit on them.
Start by getting the steer comfortable with having weighted items on its back. Start with a blanket, then try two. When the steer is used to the blankets, add a saddle.
If you do not have experience breaking animals to be ridden, consider seeking the help of a professional to help you do so. However you got about breaking your steer, take extreme caution when doing so.
As an alternative, you could send your steer to a trainer, who will break them and send them back fully trained.
Note that rodeo bulls are not trained to let people ride them. Quite the opposite; rodeo bulls are often antagonized by electric prods in the shoot, and spurs worn by bull riders. Information on riding a bull is included in the following section.;
, Since riding steers is not quite as common as riding horses, it can be hard to find the right equipment. Still, you can likely find either a western or dressage saddle that will fit your cattle. Look for saddles designed to be worn by draft horses.Similarly, you’ll also need to adjust a horse bridle to fit on your steer’s head. Since the dimensions of cattle heads are different from horses, you’ll likely need to shorten or lengthen certain parts of a halter, so get one that’s adjustable.

, While horses are steered with a mouth bit attached bridle, a saddled steer is steered with a different type of tack. Most commonly, a nose bit – usually just a straight metal bar – is used to pierce a steer’s septum. This provides a method of steering similar to the nose rings used with oxen. The bar is attached to a bridle on the cow's head, which is also attached to the reins you’ll hold while riding in the saddle.Steering with reins is especially intuitive. In order to go left, pull on the left side of the reins, attached to the left side of the steer’s bridle, and vice versa. To slow down, pull back on both sides of the reins.

, Saddled steers are a big hit at local parades. Since not everyone has seen a human ride a steer, you’re sure to get some laughs and cheers. Even better, ride your steer to a friend’s birthday party or to your neighborhood senior center.Consider riding your steer at a riding show. Ask others in the cattle and horse community in your area about shows they’ve attended that allowed cattle to be shown. Contact venues that host equestrian events to see if they host events where you could show your steer.

, Steers are especially good animals to ride in the wild. For one, it takes a lot more to spook a steer than a horse. Further, when a steer is spooked, it tends to simply hold its ground and wait out whatever scared it. Compared to horse, you may actually be safer riding a steer in an area with wild animals!"

Always know where you stand financially by keeping up with bank statements, cash flow, balance sheets and income statements.,
Enjoy it.",How to Raise Cattle," You will have needed to have chosen your cattle before you purchase them in order to start up the operation you're managing.;
, You may find out soon enough that some of your plans may not work out like you expected and you may have to make some compromises whenever and however necessary.


However, usually very few plans, if any would require any major changes or rethinking if you have done your research as thoroughly as possible before purchasing your animals.
The main things that you need to follow through from your business plan include the following (a few are mentioned in the proceeding steps):


Breeding (dairy and beef cow-calf only)

Calving (dairy and beef cow-calf only)

Weaning (beef cow-calf primarily, dairy as well if calves also raised on-farm)
Marketing and selling livestock of various classes (all sectors: dairy, beef cow-calf, backgrounding/stocker and feedlot)
Replacement heifers selection criteria and management (dairy and beef cow-calf only)

Cull cow/bull/heifer criteria and management (dairy and beef cow-calf only)

Herd bull management (primarily beef cow-calf, some dairy)

Milk production (dairy only)

Care of bottle calves (dairy only) or orphaned calves (beef cow-calf)
Herd health management including vaccination/deworming schedules (all sectors)

Feeds, feeding and pasture management (all sectors)
Handling and disposal of deadstock (all sectors)
Crop and/or hay production (all sectors)
Human resource management (primarily dairy and feedlot, some beef cow-calf especially with cattle ranches)
Capital and assets including fences, machinery, equipment and buildings in terms of maintenance, repairing and building new (all sectors)
Goals and objectives for future improvements (all sectors)
Succession and dispersal of herd and/or farm (all sectors)



, You cannot raise cattle if you have nothing to feed them or no pasture for them to graze on. Make sure you have the feed available before you have purchased your animals or adequate pasture. Cattle eat grass, hay, silage and grain, and tend to be raised best on the first two or three.


What type of feeds you wish to feed your animals depends on what type of cattle you're raising, your goals and your location. For instance, you can easily raise a beef cow-calf herd on just grass and hay or raise some backgrounder/stocker calves on grass for the summer. Fattening cattle the conventional way primarily requires silage and grain, and feeding dairy cattle requires that plus moist hay in the form of haylage.

Some dairy cattle may also be allowed to graze for part of the year or most of the year as well, depending on whether the operation is an organic grass-fed dairy or not.


For pasture, make sure you have an adequate stocking rate or stocking density so you avoid overgrazing. Ideally you should try to rotationally or manage-intensive graze your pastures as much as you can.

, This especially so if it's needed. A herd health program is especially imperative if you are purchasing cattle and bringing them into your herd, because these new cattle could be carriers of disease that may affect your current herd. It's also important if you are raising them in an area where disease and illness tends to be prevalent, such as confined in a barn or out on a dirt lot, or feeding them feed, like grain, that tends to cause problems.


A herd health program is not just about what products are available to use to vaccinate, deworm/delice or treat animals, it's all about prevention as well, and what you can do to prevent illnesses and diseases from occurring. Prevention steps include and are not unlimited to vaccinations, quarantine periods, avoiding doing activities with cattle during certain times, ensuring adequate feed and minerals are available, and maintaining a good strict culling program.
You must also know and have certain items on hand in case of an emergency. Items such as calving chains, calf puller, epinephrine, dexamethazone, trocar and canola, mineral oil, esophageal tube with frick tube, rope (lariat and/or cotton or poly rope), latex gloves, shoulder-length gloves, extra needles and syringes, Dettol (or a similar disinfectant), 70% alcohol solution, among many others should be in an emergency kit (items ultimately depend on what type of cattle you have) in case anything goes wrong and a veterinarian is not able to arrive on time.

You may eventually have to face the hard truth that some animals cannot be cured, and you may have to euthanize it yourself. Most producers use a gun to put an animal down, simply by putting a bullet in the middle of the forehead just above the eyes. It is the quickest and most humane way to put a suffering animal out of its misery instead of simply letting it die a slow and painful death on its own.



, With raising livestock it's entirely expected that you may end up having a dead animal (or more) on your hands to deal with. Research your local livestock disposal laws to determine what is best to dispose of a dead animal's carcass.

, There are five main routes of selling cattle: salebarn/auction mart, private-treaty, direct sales, purebred sales and dispersal sales.


The majority of cattle are sold through the sale barn or auction mart. Emphasis is placed on cull cattle, weaned calves, and fats (cattle ready for slaughter). Usually it is here where ""problem cattle"" get dropped off to go to the kill pen or be sold for slaughter, and weaned calves change hands from the ranch where they were born to a feedlot or farm that backgrounds them and readies them for slaughter. Usually replacement stock are not purchased here, unless the prices are very good and producers are willing to get rid of more than their fair share of cattle, no matter if they have problems or not. Cattle can be sold through live internet auction or simply hauling them in the trailer to the nearest auction mart to you. Both beef and dairy cattle are sold this way.
Private treaty is where you negotiate sales or purchases of livestock between the buyer or seller, which ever you and the other person happen to be. You can sell cattle in an advertisement posted in the local newspaper, magazine or an Internet classified site such as Craigslist or Kijiji. People who read your ad may want to contact you for information or out of interest in the cattle you have up for sale. Private treaty sales may also come about from word-of-mouth, and not from reading newspaper or Internet advertisements at all.
Direct sales would also work in the same way as private-treaty, except you are mostly selling beef, not live cattle, directly to a consumer interested in your product. Direct sales happen through word-of-mouth, an advertisement posted on your website marketing your product as ""nothing but the best,"" or a little ad in a local newspaper. It also occurs when selling your product at a stand at a farmer's market.
Purebred sales are only for those with purebred seedstock or cow-calf herds and are marketing live, purebred cattle for other producers, purebred or commercial themselves, to purchase. Yearling bulls and heifers are primarily sold this way, either through auction on-farm, or through advertisements to encourage private-treaty sales.
Dispersal sales are sales where you can sell a whole herd or most of your herd of cattle to other interested buyers, be they meat packers or other producers. Dispersal sales are only for the purpose of selling almost your whole cow-calf herd, not if you were selling you're year's worth of stocker cattle you purchased several months ago.

, If you are a producer that prefers to make their own feed rather than purchase it, this is one of the most important enterprises for your operation. You may be an operation that focuses on all three, just one, or any of the two. That all depends on what kind of cattle you run and whether you aim to be more conventional (graze in the summer, confine and feed in winter), or low-cost natural (graze all year round, grass-only, no grain or silage to feed). Whatever you choose, these enterprises must be managed in such a way that they give back to you in being good-quality feed for your livestock.


Crops must be seeded and harvested on time.
Silage must be harvested at the right stage, neither too late or too soon.
Hay must be done properly to ensure no spoilage occurs, nor potential for combustion. Cut at the right time, allow it to dry, then rake and bale. Store bales as necessary, especially squares, since they're more prone to spoilage than round bales.
Machinery for any and all enterprises must be kept in good working order. They do not have to be brand new, but they must be greased, oiled, maintained and broken parts repaired in order for them to keep working smoothly and efficiently.

, Anything goes here, with simple paper records to highly detailed computerized worksheets. Regardless of the type of records you keep, be consistent about keeping up to date with all records as you go along.


Records for raising cattle include, but are not limited to:

Health records (which cattle were sick, illness ID, treatment, vaccinations, deworming, etc.)
Breeding records (which cow/heifer was bred to which bull, when they were bred, which females turned up open after breeding season, etc.)
Calving records (which female had which calf, calving troubles, when which cow calved, sex of calf born, etc.)
Financial records (expenses, loans, rent, utility bills, income, etc.)



, This is a good way to tell if you are making money or losing money. Don't panic if you see you are losing money if you are in the process of starting up a cattle operation, but you should be worried if you're still losing money if you're operating ten years down the road. If you're breaking even or even gaining a little income, give yourself a pat on the back for a job well-done.

, You won't make much money from it; so if you're in it for the money you're in the wrong business. Raising cattle has became and remained more of a way of life than a money-making enterprise, and thus is one that requires more of a want to raise cattle than a need due to the want for more money. You'll find it a challenge and a difficulty at times, sometimes asking yourself why you wanted to get involved in raising these critters in the first place, but you'll just keep loving it and keep wanting to do it.

Consider why you want to buy calves.,
Start saving up.,
Stock up on feed.,
Get water, it's the most important nutrient.,
Prepare the space and shelter.,
Find a breed you like.,
Find a place that sells the breed that you want.,
Pick out the ones you want and how many you want.,
Bring them home.",How to Raise Calves1," Ask yourself are you wanting these calves as potential freezer beef, a start of a breeding herd, or merely as a ""pet"" and a lawn ornament?;
, Calves aren't cheap, either to purchase or to raise, so you will need to save at least $500 to $1,000 for the first little bit. A Holstein calf can cost around $500 to purchase--that is, if the calf's a heifer; bull calves tend to be much cheaper--and a beef calf may be a little less, depending on the age and weight.

, It's best to purchase your feed before you purchase the calf so that you have food ready for when you bring the calves home.


Bottle-raised calves require milk-replacer specially formulated for calves. Do not purchase milk from the grocery store because it does not have the same nutritional content and good bacteria for the calf's digestive system as raw milk does. You can quickly kill a calf with pasteurized milk, even if it's homogenized.

A bottle calf will need to be started on grain and hay fairly quickly, usually within a week or two of its life. Once you get it on this feed, you can start, over the following weeks, progressively feeding less milk replacer (gradually increasing the water to powder ratio) less often.
Usually you do not need to buy colostrum because a calf needs colostrum in the first few hours of its life. If you buy a calf that is a day or two old, the colostrum will be ineffective. You are better off with milk replacer instead.


Weaned calves or those that are pre-weaning can be fed small amounts of milk replacer that is watered down. Calves at this stage (they are often around 3 to 4 months of age) can be fed grain, hay and will even graze on pasture. Dairy calves typically need to be ""grained"" a lot since they do not have the same ability to convert grass to muscle and energy like beef calves do. If you have beef calves though, it's recommended to feed less grain and more hay/pasture. If the pasture and hay is in very good quality, you can limit the grain to only a few times a week.

Note: Too much grain for beef calves can put too much fat on them when they need more protein over energy to grow--not get fat.


If you have to buy hay, the price varies as the amount does too. If you make your own hay then you will save a lot of money in the long run. Grain usually costs $350.00 per ton. Don't quite need that much? They sell small 50 lbs bags for $15. Prices very by location. Grass costs nothing if it grows wild. If not, you're going to have to buy some grass seed ($15.00 at your local store; prices vary). Milk replacer cost about $45 to $55 dollars per 50 lbs bag (prices may vary)

, Calves, especially the older ones, need plenty of water. You will need to purchase a stock tank or an automatic waterer (expect to pay around $200 to $300 for a good waterer; a little less for a stock tank) for these calves. Also, remember to fill up the stock tank with water regularly if it looks full.


Cleaning the tank out to keep the algae blooms down helps with the water quality. Clean water makes for healthy calves!

, Make sure that they have plenty of space to roam and frolic, but also make sure they have a shelter such as a lean or a barn, so that they are protected from storms.


If you're getting bottle calves, you might want to build a little or calf hutch for it. If you're buying older calves (ones close to weaning or have already been weaned, either from the bottle/bucket or from their mothers), a corral that is around 200 square feet (per calf, that is) is sufficient for the first few weeks when you get them home.

, There are many to choose from, so choose wisely. It is best to choose a breed that is local to your area and one that has young calves readily available.


It is usually far more common to find young calves of dairy breeding than beef breeding. If you were to find young calves of a particular beef breed, it would be because they were weaned early (i.e., around 3 months of age), or they are orphans a producer or small-time farmer does not have a surrogate mother to take in.

, You are more likely to find calves at a dairy farm than a cattle ranch. This is because baby calves are raised on their mothers until they get quite big (sometimes over half of their mother's size), they are never separated away from their dams permanently like with a typical dairy farm.


You may come across an advertisement in a local newspaper or on a that is looking to sell a beef calf or two, but this is considered rare.
Your best chance at finding a calf is by going to a local dairy farm and asking if they have any calves to sell, or by looking on Craigslist.com or Kijiji.com for anybody looking to sell young calves.

, Make sure you consider your abilities when picking out the number of calves you want to take in. One or two calves alone can be a handful, especially if they're no more than a day or two old, so choose according to the kind of commitment you want to make to raising calves.


If you do not want to be feeding a young calf every two to three hours for the first week, then you are better off looking for older calves that are close to weaning or that have already been weaned.

Note that the older the calf, the easier it is to look after it. Younger calves tend to be more prone to sickness and diseases than older calves, and are much more sensitive to what and how you feed it than a weaned calf.



, Larger calves (or more than two bottle calves) will need to be shipped in a small stock trailer, or in the back of a pickup truck with stock-racks attached. For younger bottle calves, many people like to use their van, jeep or even car to bring them home if they have no other alternative or find it's safer for the calf.

Do an inventory of financial resources.,
Review human, natural and physical resources.,
Figure out whether you could make money.,
Aim for a large volume of cattle.,
Budget for cattle, equipment, labor and other production costs.",How to Start a Ranch3," If you have recently inherited a ranch or purchased a ranch with existing resources, you should do a thorough financial inventory. Take an in depth inventory of existing financial resources, such as ranch bank accounts, debts that the ranch owes to banks, as well as lease agreements and other financial arrangements. Knowing the current financial state of the ranch will help you figure out what to do with it., Resources include the people who work at your ranch, as well as equipment like tractors, trailers, fences and barns. You want to look at human resources, such as current family and paid employees who put time into the ranch. Then, list all of the natural and physical resources of the ranch, such as existing equipment, buildings and the livestock. Take this inventory into account in planning your ranch operations., The profit margin in ranching is typically very thin, with only the most frugal and efficient ranchers able to make a living in this business. Smaller ranchers will usually lose money ranching.However, if you have inherited a ranch, the value of your land may be significant and could possibly allow you to keep your ranch financially feasible.For instance, gross annual income for each cow is typically $190 to $340.Each year, every cow you own will cost you between $300 and $400., If you start a ranch with a large number of cows for the operation, you will be able to spread the high costs of equipment, fuel and labor over a greater volume of animals. If you can lower the cost spent on each cow, you are more likely to make money in the competitive business of ranching.Of course, you should also make sure your land has the carrying capacity to handle the number of cows you desire.

, Since the most profitable ranches are also the most efficient in their production costs, you should aim to keep your equipment and labor costs down. So, make a realistic and efficient budget for your new ranch, which should include items like cattle, feed, tractor, ATV, stock trailer, corrals and waged labor.If you can use an old truck instead of a buying a new one, you are more likely to make a profit.

Feed or pasture them according to the seasons.,
Maintain a good herd health program.,
Check your cows regularly for signs of illness or injury.,
Maintain a breeding schedule.,
Keep a regular check on fences.",How to Take Care of Cows2," Beef cows should be let to graze out on pasture during the times when pasture is available. If pasture is no longer available or you do not have enough area to allow stockpile grazing, then you will need to confine them to a ""sacrifice area"" where you have to feed them hay regularly, preferably by bales.


Make sure you cut the strings or netting from the bales before they're fed to them.
Beef cows should be fed according to what stage of reproduction they're in, their physiological needs, and their body condition. If cows are lactating with a suckling calf at side, they'll need good quality hay and supplementation if they are losing too much condition on just hay alone. Dry (non-lactating) beef cows that are in good condition do fine on lesser-quality hay. Thin cows need good quality hay and possibly supplementation to put on weight over the winter, but fat cows can do with poor quality forage to lose weight.
With grazing, opt for rotational grazing to keep your pastures healthy and more productive than if you were to allow all of your pasture for grazing.

Annual soil samples and regular harrowing, if you do not have chickens or dung beetles you can rely on to spread the manure around, will also help keep your pasture and paddocks productive.


Always ensure your cows have access to clean water and loose mineral.

, As mentioned above with Dairy cows, keep up-to-date with vaccinations and deworming/de-licing throughout the year. Certain vaccines for your cows may only need to be given once a year, whereas with deworming and de-licing, more applications per year may be necessary. See your vet for best vaccinations and de-worming products that are best for your cows, if you haven't done so already.

, Beef cows are a bit more tougher and less reliant on humans than dairy cows are, so less checking can be done with these girls. Many people who raise beef cattle don't check on them daily or more than once a day, unless they're rotational grazing them; they often only check them once a week or every two weeks to give then fresh mineral or switch pastures.

, This is for those who opt for a defined reproductive cycle of their herd, with a defined breeding, calving and weaning period. However, there's nothing wrong with deciding to have a year-round breeding program if you want to have the option of selling weaned calves throughout the year.

, Though you may have built some good solid fences, it doesn't hurt to check them occasionally to see if one of your herd as attempted escape to freedom, or if you had a call from someone telling you your cows got out. If that happens, then it's very important to check your fences to see where they got out and to fix the break they made.

Develop your riding abilities.,
Desensitize horses to steers.,
Keep the other cattle in line.",How to Ride a Steer2," Riding a steer is a great way to get into riding generally. This is no surprise, as riding a steer is actually comparable to riding certain types of horses. Some riders use steers to lead, drive, perform tricks, and even saddle. Some steers and riders even compete in shows similar to equestrian events.In fact, most of the tasks and activities commonly enjoyed with a horse can likely be done with a steer as well. Granted, your steer will not be able to jump quite as high, nor run as fast.

, One of the bonuses of riding a steer may be the added utility of a steer that can help train horses. Some horses are skittish or aggressive around cattle until they spend enough time around them to learn that they are not a threat. A great way to acclimate a horse to being around cattle is to ride your steer while someone else rides the horse. This will help the horse recognize that cattle aren’t much different than they are., Believe it or not, you can even learn to rope or herd cattle from the back of a steer. Though the other cattle may not take you and your steer seriously at first, keep pestering them and they’ll eventually fall in line. In fact, they may come to be even more comfortable with you when they see you on the back of one their own instead of on a horse."

Get in great shape.,
Ride a steer in competition.,
Seek the help of a professional.,
Wrap a bull rope around the steer.,
Position yourself on the steer.,
Grip the rope.,
Respond to the animal’s movement.,
Count to eight.,
Dismount safely.",How to Ride a Steer3," Riding a rodeo bull is not something you can just jump into. Even at the professional level, the expected amount of time a capable adult human will stay on a rodeo bull is 8 seconds. Even with training, the amount of strength, focus, and balance required to last those 8 seconds is immense. If you hope to get into riding cattle, start an integrative strength training regimen, such as yoga or mixed-martial arts.You’ll likely need to improve your overall strength, balance, and responsiveness in order to successfully ride a steer. Integrative core exercises are great for this, as they can help you increase your stability, reduce the chance of injury, and maintain mobility.
Bodyweight exercises, such as planks, push ups, and yoga position that require you to balance are great exercises to start with.
Talk to others in the steer/bull riding community about what exercises they do to strengthen their legs and core.

, If you hope to someday ride a bull, you can start by riding steers that are less likely to buck you off immediately. Young people who hope to be bull riders have steer riding competitions that operate similarly to rodeos, but with less dangerous and aggressive cattle. Contact a local rodeo organization to see if they host steer riding competitions.

, If you can find someone who is willing to show you the ropes (literally), they might even be able to help get you in the ring to practice riding a steer. Reach out to rodeo facilities in your area to see if they know of anyone who offers training on how to ride cattle. They may offer lessons that start you out with a beginner steer until you're ready to move on to a more difficult steer, similar to how horse riding lessons progress.


A professional will also be the best source of knowledge regarding the specific type of safety equipment you’ll need to get in the ring the first time.Expect to need a helmet, boots with spurs, and leather chest and leg protection. You may be able to borrow or rent this equipment when you’re first starting out.

, Bull ropes have a loop on one end, as well as a handle along the length of the rope. Wrap the rope beneath the steer’s chest and behind its shoulders. Thread the tail of the rope through the loop on the other end. Make sure the handle, which is usually leather, is positioned on top of the steer.In training conditions, your trainer will likely help you wrap the rope or check to make sure you did so correctly until you get the hang of it.

, Since the animal will be corralled in a tight chute before being released into the ring, you will easily be able to climb onto its back. Stepping off one side of the chute, you’ll swing your other leg over the saddle and onto the steer’s other side. Do so carefully, as he may try to shift or buck immediately. Once you’re on, scoot forward towards his shoulders. The handle of the rope should be between your thighs.Squeeze the bull’s body with your legs and spurs. Keep your feet in front of the rope at all times.
Since you should not simply be saddling and riding animals without professional guidance, you and your trainer will position the saddle on the bull together.

, You’re only allowed to hold on with one arm when competing in a bull riding competition. Slip your hand beneath the rope where the handle is located. Adjust the rope to maintain the handle’s position in the center of the steer’s back. Pull the tail side of the rope to tighten the rope down on your hand. Wrap the rope’s tail around the hand that is tightly gripping the handle.Nod to the gate operator once you’re ready to ride. The chute will open and your ride will begin. Hold on tight!

, React to the steer to try and stay on him. Engage your core and leg muscles to try to keep yourself seated on the steer's back. Pull up on the rope to center yourself and pull yourself into its back. Avoid leaning too far forward or too far back. Sit up straight with your chest stuck out and your free hand in the air to help balance.If the steer goes up on his hind legs, lean forward over his shoulders and head.
If he kicks his back legs up, keep your butt against his body and lean back slightly or he’ll buck you over his head.
Continue squeezing the bull with your legs and spurs throughout the ride.

, In competitive bull riding, you must stay on the bull for 8 seconds in order to receive a score for your ride. Otherwise, the clock will stop once the bull bucks you off. The clock will also stop if you use your other arm to touch yourself, the bull, or the ground at any point. These same rules usually apply in steer-riding competitions, as they are often considered to be training competitions for someday bull riders., Once you've had enough, look for your chance to dismount. When the steer moves in the opposite direction of your riding hand, let go of the rope. For instance, if you’re holding the rope with your right hand, wait for the steer to start moving left. The rope will loosen, allowing you to jump off.Jump off sideways and backwards, moving away as you land.
If you fall during the ride, try to get as much distance between you and bull as you can while you’re falling. If possible, push off of the steer. As you land, immediately roll onto your feet and run away. If there are rodeo clowns in the ring, move towards them, as the clowns may be able to distract the animal away from you.

Saying good-bye.",How to Raise Calves2," Older calves need to be kept in a secure pen for the first few weeks to allow them to settle into their new home. If you let them out into a pasture, the chances of them escaping are quite high.


Make sure you have feed and water ready for them when they arrive.

, Bottle calves should be fed twice a day (or ever 12 hours) with two quarts of milk replacer formula per feeding. That means one four-pint bottle should be used per feeding. The milk replacer powder-to-water ratio should be higher for young calves (see the bag for directions), and much lower for calves close to weaning.


It is recommended to feed calf-starter along with the milk replacer as it will limit bacterial growth that may feed off the milk replacer.It will also help give the calf's rumen the kick-start it needs to start growing and reaching full maturity and functionality.
For weaned calves, feed hay when the bale you have given them is low or has been cleaned up. Ideally, you should get them to clean up after themselves so you minimize the amount of waste they may have caused before you give them another bale to eat. Hay must be fed ad libitum or free-choice. Grain must be limited to only around three to five pounds per calf per feeding. Dairy calves tend to require more grain than beef calves, so feel free to increase their ration, but not so much that they will bloat on it.

Hay should not be ""horse-quality"" hay. Horse-quality hay is primarily 100% grass; it's recommended to feed calves hay that has a legume content equal to or higher than grass content so that the calves are getting the protein and calcium nutrients needed for their growth. Test the hay for quality and remember: the higher the fibre content, the lower the quality.
Alternative high-protein sources to grain (corn, oats, barley, wheat, etc.) include beet pulp, soybean meal, canola meal, cottonseed meal, protein blocks, etc. Avoid any high-protein feeds with animal by-product due to concerns for BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, better known as ""Mad Cow Disease"").


Along with water, make sure you provide a mineral and salt source, ideally loose over block form. Feed alone will not give a calf all the nutrients it needs.

, If a calf is getting thin, you may need to separate it and increase the energy/protein it is getting. If a calf is getting too fat, you may want to cut back on the grain you're feeding it.


A bovine's body condition can be affected by illness. Usually thinness is merely a symptom of something more serious, and should be taken note of if other symptoms signalling that you may have a sick calf on your hands raise their ugly heads.

, Hygiene is just as important to calves as it is to humans. This means keeping their living area as clean as possible, involving such practices as putting out new bedding, or separating their eating space from their resting space. Though washing calves is not commonly practiced nor necessary, if they have excessive ""tag"" (poop on the hide) then it may be a good idea to do so.


Remember, the tamer and calmer the calf, the less stress it is to wash them. Also remember, wash only if it's necessary, not when you want to. Rain for the older calves can give them a good bathing too.
Clean the barn or bedding area is not fun, but somebody has to do it. All you have to have is a pitchfork ($12 to $20/ prices vary), shovel ($10 to $20/prices may vary), wheelbarrow ($60 to $230/prices may vary), old work clothes (coveralls, jeans, old T-shirt are ideal), and rubber boots ($30 to $40/prices may vary).

, It's not a matter of if your calves will get sick, but when. Unusual behavior is the best indicator for illness in a calf.


Symptoms such as coughing, ragged breathing, scouring (diarrhea), constipated, foaming/frothing at the mouth (usually not an indicator of rabies), refusing to get up, runny or snotty nose, appearing lame, generally looks more interested in resting and sleeping (listless) than actively playing, among other possibilities, are all indicators that mean you should call your veterinarian right away.
If your calves develop a scaly, hairless circular pattern on its skin, this is the start of what is called ""ringworm."" It is not a sickness by any means, but merely a fungal infection of the skin that does nothing for the calf except make him particularly itchy. Ringworm is contagious to humans, so be careful when handling the affected calf.

Ringworm only comes around in the cold, dry parts of the year, and soon disappears in a few months. Iodine solution, though, will help clear up the skin affliction.



, Your calf will grow into an adult animal eventually, and horns can be quite dangerous even if the animal doesn't mean to hurt you. One flick of the bovine's head and you could end up in hospital or worse. Please consider your own safety--and even the other animals on the farm--if you think that dehorning is ""too cruel"" to perform on a calf.


You can usually tell if there are some buds growing on either side of the top of the calf's head or poll (near the ears) by the way the hair is growing. Catching the calf to have a feel can give you a good indication that the calf you have is horned. If there are no buds present, this means that you have a hornless or polled calf--this is nothing to be worried about, as it is completely natural for cattle to have no horns. There are several options to removing horns available:


Burning: You can use a branding iron or an electric dehorner to take off the small horns. All you have to do is hold the calf down and burn the horns down to a nub to where they can't grow anymore. (You may need someone to help you hold the calf down, because the burning can be painful for the calf and the calf will put up a huge struggle to get away.)

Note: burning is best for calves who have the start of hard horns, not soft buds. If the calf has soft buds, caustic paste is best.



Dehorning paste: Dehorning or caustic paste is a highly corrosive substance that essentially ""burns"" the buds off by a chemical reaction between the skin of the horn buds and the paste itself. Though effective, it can be irritating for the calf as it may get the calf to start itching at the buds at its head. Make sure you get the paste only on the horns buds and not anywhere else on the calf. The calf will need to be restrained during the process.

Cutting: A dehorning ""scooper"" is a tool that is used to cut the horns right out of the base of the calf's head. This method is a bit more gory and bloody than the other two above, so proper restraint and possibly local anaesthesia may need to be considered before using this dehorning method.



, Branding really is not necessary if you do not have problems with cattle theft in your area, if you are not mixing your calves with other producers' cattle, and if you're just keeping your calves on your farm. Thus it's recommended to avoid branding especially if it's not necessary.

, This is important because nothing is worse and more dangerous than a bull that has been bottle-raised and made into a pet. Calves that grow as steers tend to be safer to handle than testerone-hyped bulls.


The best method for young calves is using a rubber band via elastrator. Make sure you have two testicles in the scrotum before you release the band. Cutting is not ideal if you do not know how to properly do it. See the wikiHow article How to Castrate Bulls and Bull Calves for more information.

, Talk to your veterinarian for the kind of vaccinations are necessary for your calves according to your area. You may need to vaccinate for such things as Blackleg, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Viruses, Bovine Respiratory Disease, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, Parainfluenza-3, Anthrax, Listeriosis, Red Water Disease and many others.

, Calves, although young, innocent and full of mischief, must know and learn that you are the dominant one at all times. Certain behaviors that seem cute now will not be cute when the calf is older. Make sure that calf knows you don't tolerate any bad behaviors that can potentially hurt you when it's older.

, Raising calves can be a lot of hard work and fun as well. Make it less of a chore and more of something to enjoy and look forward to doing every day.

, You will have to let these calves go at some point, either at the point of sale, at the time of slaughter, or when one or more dies unexpectedly on you. If the latter occurs, don't be too shocked and disheartened about it. It is sad, indeed, but it's something that you have to expect when you raise livestock. Not every animal can be saved when they get sick, but you should make sure you do everything you can to save the animal before you let it go to the other side.

The nipple of a bottle resembles the mother's teat, which should trigger the calf's natural instinct to suckle.Bottles and nipples can be purchased online or at major retail stores such as Tractor Supply Co.;
, Similar to human babies and breastmilk, the newborn calf should be fed fed colostrum, or milk produced by the mother, for the first few days. This is because the colostrum contains antibodies that the calf needs to develop a strong immune system.If you purchased the calf, chances are it didn’t receive that much needed colostrum.
Replacement colostrum can be obtained in frozen form, from a dairy farm, or from one of your other cows who has just given birth.
If you are thawing frozen colostrum, be very careful not to overheat it or you will destroy its antibodies.
Use warm water, anything less than 120°F or 50°C and allow it to thaw. A microwave oven can also be used to thaw the milk without causing damage.Replacement colostrum should be given to the calf for about four days.

, Calves need milk for the first month or so of their lives. There are several different milk options.


Cow’s milk. If one of your cows gave birth recently, you can use their milk. Most cows produce enough milk to adequately care for their young.Replacement milk. If you’re using replacement milk, always follow the directions on the package. The temperature should be high enough to allow the fats in the milk replacer to melt into liquid form. This will help the calf to better absorb it, while keeping the mix consistent. Milk replacer formula should not be too hot either.Goat’s milk. If mother’s milk isn’t available or if milk replacement is too costly, consider goat’s milk. It is easily digestible and may result in fewer cases of scours (a clinical sign associated with several diseases characterized by diarrhea), Young calves need routine, so feed them twice a day at the same times each day. Typically, the best feeding times for young calves are early morning and evening.Start slow with a half of a bottle at each feeding and gradually increase it to two full feedings.During the winter or other cold spells, you may need to increase the feedings to three times a day. The third feeding can take place mid-day.

, This is particularly important if you have recently purchased and transported the calf.


Once they are at your home, keep the routine consistent. Changes in routine may cause stress in calves, which leads to a higher likelihood of illness.If the stress is severe, your calf could develop serious medical conditions such as scours.

, Scours, unfortunately, can be deadly for a young calf. Immediately treat scours using fluid therapy, which entails giving the calf the water and electrolytes that it has lost as a result of the illness.Signs of scours include watery stool, appearing too weak to drink or stand and swaggering when they walk.
To treat a calf with scours, try the following:

Administer electrolytes through a feeder. 2 - 6 quarts of electrolytes may need to be administered on a daily basis, but should be given based on the size of the calf and the severity of the illness.Give them liquids through an IV. Fluids are administered using a catheter, which is placed directly into the jugular vein.You will need to contact a veterinarian to administer this form of treatment.
Warm them up. Take preventative measures against the cold, including warm bedding and proper shelter from the elements so that the calf does not experience excessive cold stress in addition to it's existing condition., A comfortable temperature is anywhere from 50°F to 85°F. This environment helps to promote performance, while offering the least amount of stress for the calf.If the barn is drafty or if it’s exceptionally cold, you may need to bring in a heat source for your calves. Similarly, you will need to keep their space cool, should temperatures rise.
Consider other environmental factors such as humidity, wind-chill and moisture, which can affect the temperature in the calf's space., When a calf stops relying solely on liquids such as milk and begins to eat dry, solid food, this is referred to as weaning.Make sure hay is available to the calf a few days after they are born. They should only be offered a small amount to begin with.
You will need to monitor how much hay they are consuming. Once they are eating at least 1 1/2 pounds of calf starter or hay per day, you can begin weaning them., Begin reducing the amount of milk the calf is drinking and replace it with water.


This can be done over the course of one to two weeks.
There are commercially available ""calf starter"" food products that you can purchase to help with the transition from milk to solids.

, After a week or two, only give the calf water to drink. From that point on you will need to make water, grain and hay available to the calf at all times.Don't be surprised if your calf continues to cry for the bottle in the days after you've weaned them. , One of the first things you may choose to do with a bucket calf is train it to lead (using a halter to lead it with a rope from place to place).


To prepare your calf for the process, try gently petting her while she’s drinking. You can also put a halter on a new calf and lead her to the bottle of milk. This will incentivise her to move while getting her used to the halter.
Try to lead your calf by not tugging hard on the halter. Instead, have someone apply pressure from behind, to encourage the calf to move.
Consider using a halter with padding, as it will be comfortable for the calf.
Always be patient and kind when using a halter and teaching the calf to lead.

, One way to teach the calf to enjoy being handled by people, is to groom them.Be cautious when grooming your calf. You’ll want to move slowly so as not to frighten it.
Make sure you are using a halter and only giving the calf a few inches to move.
Use a scotch comb along with a rice root brush to remove any mud and dirt that has accumulated on your calf's body.
Next, you can use a hose and soap that is made for livestock to wash your calf. Make sure the hose pressure is on low to medium.
Once you’ve washed her, use another scotch comb to ensure the hair is nice and smooth.

, Calves need some love too. Stroke her sides, belly, udder, and hind legs to get your calf used to human touch. This will help teach her to ignore or even enjoy being handled."

, Look at the judges, do everything they tells you to do.

,, The animals will be facing head-to-tail.


When the judge tells you to stop, stop your steer. Usually you can do this when you stop walking. Turn around and face your steer with the halter in your left hand.

, As you do that, switch show stick from your left hand to the right.

, You're going to set up your steer. Take the stick and use the pointy end and poke in between the two hooves. This will make the hooves move backwards so that they are lined up. Use the hooked end to pull from behind the two hooves to pull forward to line up. Either way works.


The fore-feet and one hind foot (preferably the one closest to the judge) are directly under him, and one hind foot (the one furthest from the judge) more under the animal. The rear foot that is farthest from the judge should be pulled forward or staggered.

,, Typical questions include birth date, current weight, name of and breed of the sire and dam, feeding program, etc.

, Make sure the judge is still watching you when you do comb the back so he knows you did comb it back.

, Keep looking at him and smile. He will tell you to stop your steer again. Then he will go down the line asking questions about your show animal. Answer them confidently, and be persuasive.

, Turn the steer away from you when you are turning your steer. Judges tend to like this, and you will definitely get a higher ranking.

, Don't be disappointed if you don't get Grand Champion. At least you know how to show a steer!

Set up pens and corrals for cattle to be sorted into.,
Move cattle into a smaller corral where they can be more easily handled.,
Open up the gate to where you need to sort the first group in.,
Move to one corner of the working corral, away from the gate.,
Step towards the gate opening or backward, depending on the animal.,Close the gate when all animals from the main herd is separated into the different corral.,
Do a second and third check to see if you actually did get everyone.",How to Sort Cows1," You cannot do any sorting without having other corrals to put separated cattle into. If you are wanting to hold them for a length of time, they will need watering facilities and a feeding and bedding area. If possible and necessary, access to separate pastures is also necessary to keep the groups from mixing.

This step will take significant amount of time to plan and do especially if you don't have the facilities set up yet. Room needed depends on the size of the animals and the number you have, plus the layout based on ease of access with tractors and machinery for feeding.;
, It is difficult to sort any cattle that are in a large corral or pasture because they have more room to escape and get around you to places where you don't want them to.

This corral, a ""working pen,"" needs to be central to where you intend to sort two or more groups into.

, Only one gate is needed. Sorting is made easy when you give animals only one route to ""escape,"" and you are there to control who ""escapes"" and who does not., Stay near the gate so that you can control their movements.

Cattle like to go by or around you. They don't like it if you walk with them. They especially find it distracting if one person is in with the herd trying to ""push"" them and the other is standing by the gate. In a small corral where the handler at the gate can easily manipulate their movements, only one person is needed to sort.

, Moving towards the opening stops animals from coming through, whereas taking a step backward invites them to come through the gate.,, Cows and cattle can be sneaky where one animal may be hiding in the back than wanting to go through, so it doesn't hurt to do a double and triple check to make sure you've sorted out everyone that needs to be sorted."

Put on a disposable OB suit as provided by the assistant.,
Put on a fingered shoulder length glove on the arm of your choice.,
Put on a latex glove over the glove.,
Calmly approach the cow to the left side when directed by one of the assistants.,
The assistant (or you) will pull out the plug of the cannula.,
Have your friend get your camera ready to capture your expression.

,
Form your hand into a kind of point by having your thumb touching the tips of your fingers.,
Insert your hand into the opening of the cannula while having your friend take a picture.

,
Move your arm down towards the bottom of the rumen.,
Note the different compositions of materials as you work your arm deeper into the rumen.,
You can try to feel around along the walls of the rumen for rumen papillae.,
Keep your arm still to feel for ruminal contractions.,
Try to reach to the front of the cow and see if you can feel the opening of the esophagus.,
Once you've found the esophagus, reach down below that to feel for the reticulum.,
Pose for a picture with your arm inside a cow if you haven't already.

Pull your arm out of the cow and move aside so the next person can have a turn.,
Pull your gloves off.,
Tie the clean end in a knot and throw it away in the nearest trash bin.,
Find a sink to wash your hands.

",How to Explore the Rumen of a Fistulated Cow," This will protect your clothing from any ""accidents."";
,


For most people who examine a fistulated cow, two shoulder-length gloves are best so that the material can be examined and handled by both hands. Often when one arm can't reach something, the other needs to be used instead.

, This will better protect your hands from the smell of the gastric juices

, The left side is where the cannula is always located.

, You may have to pull out the plug; to do this, you grab the top part of the handle and pull down. This will break the seal from the top down.

,, However, remember it doesn't have to be tight together like if you were rectal palpating a cow, because the opening of the fistula is large enough to put your hand through up to your shoulder.

,, You may have to pull out handfuls of feed to get your arm in there at first, depending on how full the rumen is.

,


The gas layer is at the top of the rumen and able to leak out of the rumen as the cannula plug was removed.
The second layer is the solid layer, which comprises of recently-consumed and partially digested roughage and grain. This is the stuff you should take out and examine before going in again.
The liquid portion is the bottom and third layer, comprising of grain, liquid digesta, and small particles of roughage. The particles in the liquid layer are more often half to a tenth or smaller of the size of the particles in the solid layer of the rumen.

, They are hard to feel for, however, as they are much softer and pliable projections of the rumen than things like pimples or muscles. The papillae are round-shaped projections with a narrower base near the wall of the rumen, and are responsible for absorption and uptake of nutrients into the cow's bloodstream.

, There are two main contractions: primary and secondary.


The primary contraction is the most pronounced and can be the most startling if you've never felt it before: the smooth muscle of the rumen contract in on themselves to mix digesta and microbes together to increase digestion ability.
The secondary contraction is less defined and may be harder to notice until you've identified it after the 2nd or 3rd contractions.

, You may have to go in up to your shoulder, especially if you have short arms, to feel this.


The esophagus is basically a ""hole in the wall"" with sphincter muscles, and is located above the reticulum into the rumen.

, The reticulum is always located in front of the rumen below the esophagus, and can be identified by feeling for the skin making a sudden peak from the rumen towards the front of the cow.

,,


If you are the last one to examine the cow, the plug must be replaced soon after to keep stomach contents from being expelled. The plug has to be placed so that it forms a tight impenetrable seal from the outside world to the rumen.
It's often a lot harder to put the plug back in than to pull it out. It will take a bit of manipulation to put it back in properly.

,


If you have only one hand that was gloved, take the glove off by taking the end of the glove at the shoulder and moving it down so that it turns itself inside out as you remove it. The latex glove will come off when you have the shoulder-length glove inside out already using your clean hand.
If you have a second shoulder-length glove on, take the first one off like you would with any other glove, then with the other one, take it off at the shoulder and moving it down so it turns inside on itself and keeps the other dirty glove inside as well.

, Your OB suit will also be disposable and can be taken off and tossed as well.

Move cattle through a working corral into a chute system into the squeeze.,Open and close the gates that are needed to direct the animal to where you want it to go.,
Release the animal.,
Repeat from Step 2 for the next bovine.",How to Sort Cows2," This step is so that you can check and process animals for various things like body condition score, ear or brisket tags, vaccinations, preg-checking, dehorning, castration, etc. From there, cattle released are directed to go into a particular pen you wish them to be in via gates opened or closed in the working alley.,, You could go behind and guide the animal where to go, but generally this isn't necessary because once the cow has escaped from the squeeze, she'll go to where she can escape to without any assistance., Repeat until you've sorted each animal into the groups you've planned for."

Wait for a warm day unless you have access to warm water to wash the cow with.,
Secure the cow outside with a halter or rope tied to the collar.,
Always use a quick-release type of knot so that if the cow gets tangled or falls down it can be safely released.

,
Begin by wetting the entire cow, starting with the legs and moving up to the back.,
Often cows have dirt and manure stuck tightly in their hair.,
A pressure washer can be used gently to remove the worst of the dirt, especially on the legs and tail.,
Soap up the cow.,
Once the cow is all soaped up rinse it all off, starting at the backline and moving down to the legs.,
Leave the cow out in the sun or walk her around to dry off before returning her to her pen.",How to Clean a Cow," Cows tend to get in a bad mood after a cold bath and don't behave for the rest of the day.;
, If possible, tie the cow to a wall or the side of a building and not a post, so the cow can't walk in circles or get tangled up in the rope. Leave no more than 50cm (1.5 feet) of rope, so the cow has just enough room to eat hay or grass from the ground. If your cow has never been washed before or has a poor disposition, try tying her with a shorter rope.

,, Be extremely careful at the beginning as you can never be sure how your cow will react to the water. If you want to clean the head and face, save that until later and be very careful not to get water in the ears or soap in the eyes.

, Large chunks may need to be cut out if it's possible to do so without making the cow's coat look different.

, They can work like combs to remove anything stuck in the hair. Be aware of the power of your pressure washer and don't hurt the cow by using it on sensitive areas like the belly, udder or face.

, This can be done one side at a time, then the legs and feet. Baby shampoo works well, but there are many products available specifically for washing animals that make your cow a brighter white or have better hair. Using your hands usually works fine for most of the cow's body and upper legs but a hard brush works nicely around the feet and a curry comb can help loosen up dirt on the back.

, Don't leave any soap in the fur.

, If she lies down on straw still wet, the bedding will stick to her and she won't stay clean.

Learn and know the external anatomy of a bovine.,
Learn how to tell the different ages and sexes of dairy cattle apart.,
Become familiar with the Uniform Scorecard.,
Attend local shows and observe the judging.,
Take the time to network at local cattle shows.,
Attend local 4-H, FFA and other dairy cattle show/judging meetings in your area.,
Become familiar with specific requirements for judging.,
Familiarize yourself with the Show Ring Code of Ethics, endorsed by the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association.,
Become a show judge at local events to gain experience.,
Most of all, have fun and enjoy it.",How to Become a Dairy Show Judge," You will need to learn the various terms for the different parts of an animal, as well as where their location. This is so that you understand what is judged in a dairy cattle show and what isn't.


Consider attending a bovine anatomy class at a local agricultural college. Also, many of their websites (through their extension services) have documents that clearly outline the various parts of a bovine.;
, This will help you immensely especially if you are dealing with judging mixed classes of livestock. The wikiHow article How to Tell the Difference Between Bulls, Cows, Steers and Heifers is a great how-to article to start with.

, The the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association developed this scorecard for Judging Junior Dairy Fitting and Showmanship Contests.


The scorecard describes the ideal dairy conformation. There are five major categories that are identified for judging: frame, dairy character, body capacity, feet and legs, and udder.

, Watch the movements and signals closely given by the dairy show judges. Certain things such as getting handlers to take their cattle around the ring, when to stop and get them into position to best judge them are all things in a judge's control.


Observe and learn the various words and phrases used by the show judges, including the differentiation between positive and negative terms.
Take note of the reasons given by the dairy show judge as to why certain animals received a low score and others a high score. Often understanding the poorer qualities of an animal will give you a better understanding of what a well put-together an animal should be, as well as certain things to look for when you judge cattle yourself.
Develop a checklist from the Unified Scorecard and try to judge the animals yourself. See how closely your ratings match those of the judges.

, This will help you become acquainted with the local dairy how judges and others involved in the competition. It will also give you the opportunity to learn more from the judges themselves other than what you can learn by yourself. A judge may be more than happy to answer any questions you may have about judging dairy cattle given the opportunity.

, This will also help you to identify dates of local events and meetings. Make yourself available as a volunteer.

, This can be for local levels, state/provincial levels, and national level judging. It is also advisable to learn judging rules and procedures for these levels. These can be found through your local 4-H or FFA group or county extension offices. Certain cattle judging organizations may have this information as well.

, This code covers the ethical treatment of dairy animals in their transport from show to show to ensure that they will be presented at the dairy show in a healthy state. It also states that the humane treatment of exhibition livestock will at all times be in accordance with dairy quality assurance practices.


This code is provided to protect the animals as well as the public.

, Note, however, that it requires many years of experience in order to be able to participate at the National level as a Dairy Show Judge.

, It's a great experience to be a good dairy show judge and a lot of fun to see the various cattle that you would have to look at and judge.

Feed them and/or provide plenty of pasture.,
Keep water and mineral available ad libitum.,
Maintain herd health.,
Check them regularly for signs of illness or injury.,
Maintain fences and machinery.",How to Care for Cattle," This is the most important part of taking care of cattle. You can't expect them to live very long if you don't know what nor how to feed them. Though cattle primarily eat grass and can be grazed in pastures, some operations necessitate feeds such as silage, hay and grain for cattle that need to be cared for or raised in a dry-lot or sacrifice area. Areas that experience winters with lots of snow on the ground cannot graze cattle on grass like they can during the summer months. Cattle that are fattened for slaughter are often kept in corrals with no grass to graze. Both scenarios require the producer to feed them, not let them rustle up some grub on their own.


Winter grazing is practiced in those areas where snow does accumulate, and is a sustainable and cost-saving practice to get cattle out of the corrals and onto the fields or pastures during the winter. Such winter grazing practices include swath grazing, bale grazing and stockpile grazing.

Rotational grazing is a highly recommended practice to use when grazing cattle on pasture. It better utilizes grazing space and distributes manure more evenly than with continuous grazing.;
, Another important part of caring for cattle, since water is the most important nutrient for any livestock and it would be inhumane, let alone cruel, to deny such a thing. Mineral in the form of loose mineral with salt or a salt block is also important, since cattle have a high requirement of salt with the kind of food they consume.

, Keep up-to-date with vaccinations and deworming/delicing programs. This is especially important if you do not have a closed herd (more in reference to breeding herds than backgrounding/stocker or feedlot herds) and if your herd is at risk for certain diseases such as blackleg, Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD), calf scours, and IBR (Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis). Certain classes of livestock are more prone to certain diseases than others, so be sure you check with your large animal veterinarian or other farmers/ranchers (if no such veterinarian can be found) for vaccinations best suited for your area.

, Cattle on dry-lot need to be checked more frequently than those on pasture, simply because cattle on a dry-lot are more prone to illness than those on pasture. Cattle on dry-lots are checked as often as they are fed, usually. Cattle on pasture are checked as often as they have to be switched from one pasture or paddock to the other.



Breeding herds need to be checked more frequently especially if there is more than one bull in a particular breeding herd. Herd bulls during breeding season run the risk of becoming injured due to competition between bulls for breeding rights of a particular cow or a harem of cows. Lameness or an injured or broken penis can compromise a bull's ability and success at breeding cows.

Such herds also need to be checked to record which cows have been bred and which are still in heat.


Cattle on dry-lot are at risk for getting sick with pneumonia or shipping fever, acidosis, blackleg, etc. Finisher cattle are more at risk for coming down with acidosis than backgrounding/stocker cattle are, but are just as likely to get sick with a respiratory disease from dust or dusty feed.

, Good fences make for good neighbors. Well-maintained machinery make for a happy farmer. Those sort of things need to be kept in mind when caring for cattle.


Cattle will make an escape if fences are not maintained or fixed if there's a break. Occasionally you'll get an escapee even if you make an effort to keep fences in good shape, and that's to be expected, but shouldn't be a common thing happening to you.
Machinery that is kept oiled, greased and worn or broken parts fixed and replaced, respectively, will last you for a long time. Older machinery tend to require more care than your cattle will or than new machinery do, but new machinery will wear out faster if you don't take care of it.

Ensure your calf always has fresh water.",How to Care for Calves," A maternity pen for the cow needs to be in a quiet part of your barn, in an area away from drafts. The area should also be clean, dry, well-lit, insulated, and with good air flow. Shortly before the cow gives birth, remove any soiled bedding and manure.A maternity pen should be at least 3 metres by 3 metres in size (or 10 feet by 10 feet).
When using bedding that consists of shavings or chopped straw, make sure the bedding layer is 2 to 3 inches thick.
When using bedding that consists of long straw, make sure the bedding layer is 4 to 6 inches thick.
It is vital that the calf is born in a clean area in order to prevent a navel infection and other diseases.;
, Some cows have trouble when calving and need your help. If you need to help your cow, you should make sure the maternity pen includes a stanchion that can secure your cow. It is best if the stanchion is lockable and near the ground to prevent injury to the cow (e.g. from being strangled)., After the calf is born, the placenta will be expelled from the cow’s body. When you see it come out, remove and dispose of it. It is not necessary for the cow to eat the placenta for nutritional purposes. Usually, while all of this is going on, the cow will be thoroughly cleaning her calf, which you should allow her to do., Your calf’s navel can allow bacteria to get into her bloodstream, where the infection can work its way to her liver. Your calf’s navel should be dry, thin, and not swollen. If your calf’s navel does not meet these criteria, you should have your veterinarian come see your calf.Immediately after your calf is born, you can dip her navel in iodine. Not only does this help dry out the umbilical cord, it helps prevent infection. A 20% iodine solution works best.
For the first two weeks of your calf’s life, check her navel every day.
If your calf experiences any type of pain when you touch her navel, this may also require a veterinarian visit.
Also check to make sure your calf’s navel is not draining any liquid and doesn’t have a bad smell.

, It is essential that a calf consumes colostrum within the first five hours of life. If your calf has any trouble feeding from its mother, you may need to physically help her by holding her up and showing her the teat.Colostrum is the liquid that is produced by the mother immediately before and after she gives birth. Colostrum contains antibodies that help the calf develop an effective immune system, which will eventually allow the calf to fight off infections and diseases.
Note, if you purchase a calf from a feed lot or auction, it is possible the calf never had a first feeding from her mother and did not consume any colostrum.Your calf should feed from its mother at least 3 to 4 times within the first 24 hours of her life.

, Unfortunately, calves can easily develop a number of different infections and diseases which can be fatal. In order to help prevent these infections and diseases, it is best to keep the calf in a hutch or pen of its own. Not only does this allow you to monitor the calf, it prevents multiple calves (if you have more than one) from having to compete for food when feeding.Move your calf to a pen or hutch of her own after she has been with her mother for 24 hours and has fed 3 or 4 times.
Once the calf is 2 months old, she can be moved back to a group pen with her mother or other cows.
Each hutch should always have fresh, clean, and dry straw for bedding.
Note, this step is an absolute requirement if your eventual plan is to use the calf for dairy production. If you simply want to raise the calf for the production of beef, the calf does not need to be separated from her mother.

, While your calf is in her hutch, keep an eye on her feces and urine, as well as her food intake. Specifically, watch for any changes in how much food your calf consumes, and the consistency and frequency of feces and urine production. If you notice any changes, consult with your veterinarian., If you have purchased a calf and do not have the mother, your only option is to do a complete weaning. If the calf was born on your property, and the mother is around, you can also consider doing partial weaning.Complete weaning means that the cow and calf are separated 24 hours after birth and do not come into contact with each other again.
Partial weaning is only possible if the cow and calf are in the same location. Partial weaning means that the cow and calf stay in contact with each other, but the calf is only allowed to feed from the mother at certain times.

, Complete weaning means that the calf and cow are separated completed and are never put in the same place again. If you have purchased a calf without its mother, this is your only option. However, if you have the ability to choose between complete and partial weaning, here are a few pros can cons to keep in mind regarding complete weaning:This option is useful if you are already using the calf’s mother for dairy production and do not want the calf to consume that milk.
This option is sometimes better in the long-term because complete weaning allows your calf’s stomach to develop quickly so the calf can eat dry feed and grass. A calf that is able to have as much of her mother’s milk as she wants won’t be as interested in dry food.
Note, if you sell your milk and the cost of buying and using milk replacers for your calf is more expensive than selling your milk, it may be better to partially wean your calf.

, A calf that is being completely weaned will need to consume milk replacers before it can be fed dry feed. Unfortunately, powdered milk replacers can sometimes cause a calf to get diarrhea, so be observant of her feces. And, the equipment used to feed your calf must be kept clean and disinfected at all times.From the time you separate the calf from her mother, you should start to feed her two bottles of milk or milk replacer a day.Milk replacer comes in large sacks of powder and needs to be mixed with water before given to the calf. Follow the instructions on the milk replacer package for the exact mixing instructions.

, If your calf is being partially weaned, you will be able to keep the cow and calf together. They can either be together in a large pen or paddock, or they can be placed in separate small pens beside each other. The important part of partial weaning is that the calf gets to interact with her mother via touch, sight, and sound., During the daytime, the cow and calf can be together in a pasture or pen. While together, the calf can feed from the cow anytime it wants. At night, both the cow and calf are brought into the barn and put into separate pens. The pens should be right beside each other, but the calf should not be able to reach trough the pen to feed from the cow.While at pasture during the day, the calf should start to graze on its own. This is helpful as it speeds up the development of calf’s stomach and will get her use to grass and forage.

, If the cow is milked twice a day, it is best to keep the cow and calf near each other in smaller pens where the calf cannot reach the cow. When the cow is milked in the morning and evening, do not allow her to be completely milked. Leave some of the milk for the calf. Once milking is done, the calf can be allowed near the cow to feed. In-between milkings, the calf can be hand-fed fresh hay or grass, fed concentrates (dry feed), and given water.In this setup, the cow and calf are not allowed in the same pen or pasture together and the calf is not allowed to free-feed from the cow.

, If you want a calf for the purpose of dairy production, the best place you can buy that calf is from a daily farm. You can also purchase a calf at an auction or at a feed lot.Buying a calf from a dairy farm is good because you know that farm is concerned about having healthy cows for milk production. Therefore, it is likely that the calf was fed colostrum for at least the first 24 hours.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will know much about the calf’s history if you purchase her from an auction or feedlot, and there is no guarantee that the calf has been given colostrum.

One way to test if the calf was already given colostrum, and therefore had been feeding from her mother, is to see if she will suck your fingers.



, Colostrum can be collected from a cow who has just given birth and stored in the freezer. For calves who do not have access to their mother, this colostrum can be fed to them via a bottle and can help them remain healthy.For calves who are raised with their mothers, saving some colostrum is still helpful. Unfortunately, some cows die shortly after giving birth, which will prevent the calf from receiving enough colostrum from her mother. Colostrum from another cow can be used instead.

, In order for a grown cow to be able to consume grass, she needs her stomach to be able to digest that grass. In order to ensure a calf grows up to be able to digest grass, she should be allowed to eat all the grass she wants from the day she is born.If you calf is penned in a smaller area with no grass, you can tie clippings of grass to the fence of the pen for your calf to nibble. Do not place the grass on the ground.

, Concentrate is essentially dry cow feed. Concentrate should be available to the calf from the start, but you may not notice her eating it right away. A calf should, however, be eating a little concentrate regularly by the time she is a month old.Provide a small amount of concentrate at the beginning and observe how much the calf eats.
Once the calf starts to eat the concentrate, add a little more to her bowl the next day.
Remove any uneaten concentrate on a daily basis.

, By the time your calf is two weeks old, she should be eating grass and concentrate on her own. However, the milk or milk replacer cannot be taken away until you are sure she’s getting enough food via other means. Just like you slowly introduced more concentrate to your calf’s diet, slowly remove the milk from her diet.By the time your calf is 8 to 10 weeks old, she should no longer be consuming milk or milk replacers.
If the calf is being bottle fed, a good way to reduce the amount of milk your calf consumes is to slowly replace some of the powder in the milk replacer with water. Eventually, the bottle will be all water and the calf will be weaned off milk.This method should take around a week to complete.



, Your calf will probably start drinking water when she is 1 to 2 weeks old. In order to stay healthy and hydrated, your calf must consume water regularly. By the time your calf is 6 weeks old, she should be drinking 4 litres of water a day.Fresh and clean water must be given to your calf. Do not allow the water trough to become dirty or filled with other material.
Note, if your calf is sick (especially if she has a fever) and will not drink water on her own, you may need to call your veterinarian and place a tube into her stomach in order to give her water. If you do not do this, your calf will become dehydrated and probably not survive.

Read some books on animal behaviour or herding/handling cattle.,
Go to a farm or ranch to observe and study actual cattle behaviour.,
Note the behaviour that is being displayed between animals and/or towards you.,
Ask yourself whether the cattle are exhibiting good behaviours or bad ones.,
Consider the frame of mind the cattle might be in.,
Familiarize yourself with such behaviours, and try to memorize them for future reference.",How to Understand Bovine Behaviour," Books that have been written by people who have studied animal behaviour are the best to start with.


Often your local bookstores may not have such books, so the best place to buy them is either at an online bookstore such as Amazon.com, or from a college or university bookstore that sells such books for students taking animal care/agricultural-type courses.
Websites such as Grandin.comand other scientific journals may also be good resources to study up on cattle behaviour. Recent scientific papers like those posted in the Journal of Animal Science are one of the best to look through if you are looking for research papers on cattle behaviour.;
, Make sure the animals cannot see or smell you, otherwise they will come up to the fence and stare at you, expecting some form of treat, or run away where you cannot observe them.


Sometimes, however, them seeing you can be a good thing, and may encourage the animals to perform certain behaviours towards you, be those behaviours good or bad.

, A cattle herd is set up in hierarchy, with one animal being the boss, progressing all the way down to the one at the bottom. This is also called ""pecking order"" or ""the totem-pole effect,"" however you want to put it:


The ""alpha"" bovine, be it a bull, cow, steer or heifer, will boss the ""omega"" bovine by either staring directly at it until it moves away, or lower its head (to expose the poll, with the chin tucked in) to head-butt the lower-level animal. If the omega challenges the alpha for leadership, then there will be a head-butting and shoving match until either one wins. The winner will chase or herd the loser around the pen until the loser, the new omega, submits by slightly lowering the head (much like a dog or wolf lowering its head to the alpha male or female), or turning away from the more alpha animal. Often submission behaviours are so subtle that it can be hard for a person unfamiliar with bovine behaviour to see.
This sort of fighting will occur in two types of situations: new animals enter the herd, or bulls fighting for breeding rights and in defense of their harem.
Very rarely does fighting between cows, heifers or steers end in death. However, it is more common in bulls, especially between two rivals that are of the same size as the other, or if an older bull feels that the younger bull is a threat that should be dealt with in more ways than trying to get him to submit to the older fellow. This is even more of a risk factor if one of the bulls is horned.

,


Good or normal behaviours include:

Grazing or eating from a feed trough or hay bale
Curiosity about your presence or something that is different in the corral or pasture (this is where they are watching and sniffing and even licking, if they get the nerve to come close enough to this strange ""thing"")
Scratching an itch on a fence, tree or the side of a building
Tossing their head back over the shoulder (only if flies are bothering them)
Any other activity that involves licking itself or another friend
Chewing their cud, be it standing or laying down
Going to find a place to lie down
Watching you with an expression of mild to somewhat-intent interest
Raising and bobbing their heads to smell you, if you've got their attention
The bull ""courting"" the cows (sniffing and licking the genital area, attempting to mount, etc.)


Bad or threatening behaviours include (mostly exhibited by an over-protective bull or mother cow):

Wrinkling of the muzzle much like a dog (it's less obvious than what you would see in a dog, but if you look close enough you may be able to see it)

Glaring or intently staring or fixation on you or a predator
Pawing the ground
Showing their side
Growling (sounds something like a low ""RRrrrruuumph!"" Rrrruummph!"")
Shaking or tossing of the head
Charging towards you and stopping short (definitely a challenge and a threat)


Non-threatening behaviours that mean that the animal is anything but calm and relaxed include:

Head up, ears perked forward means alert, very nervous, tense, and a little scared and unsure.
Stilting, high-stepping walk, still staring at you in the same manner as previously mentioned means the animal is alert and on the verge of flight because of fear.
Showing the whites of the eyes - could mean that the animal is unsure, nervous, tense, or slightly fearful
Mad switching of the tail (this indicates intense anxiety, except when calves are suckling from momma or the flies are really bugging the cattle).
Startling at a sudden movement, shying away from something, etc. all indicates tension, insecurity and fear.
Stampede only results if the fear they feel is overwhelming and they need to get away from it as fast as possible. Because cattle are prey animals, flight and keeping with the herd is their best (but not the only) defense mechanism against the offending stimulus.



, Are they nervous, calm, excited, agitated, unsure or frightened? See the above points for indicators.

An important thing to remember is that, like all animals, cattle are sensitive to what your feelings are. If you are tense, frustrated, scared, unsure or excited, then they will mirror those feelings by acting in the same way or reacting to your feelings. Cattle will always act nervous, fearful and unsure whenever they meet someone new, but if you spend enough time with them (at least 30 minutes) and remain calm and relaxed, then they will also be calm and relax.

,  Memorizing bovine behaviour and psychology will help you improve your practices in working with cattle and, if you are afflicted with bovinophobia, help work through your fears.

During the year you are going through with your cattle operation, keep track of how each and every cow, bull and calf does during that year.,
When deemed necessary, separate those animals that are on your cull list into a separate pen or corral from the rest of the herd using calm herding practices.,
Phone the auction barn and go load them up into a stock trailer.,
Haul them to the auction.

,
Back up to the stockyard entrance where you can unload your culls, then go to the office and pick up your bill.,
After you have picked up your cheque, take yourself, your truck and that empty trailer home and enjoy the rest of the day.

",How to Cull Cattle," You should be able to do this using any of the following criteria: body condition and ability to gain weight with no to little supplementation, fertility rate during breeding and calving season, age, conformation, temperament and health. You may also have to cull because you have too many animals on your farm or ranch to take care of. Weaning calves from cows and selling them is one culling method. Other instances are when you have a year of drought and you are forced to get rid of up to more than half your herd to keep you from running out of feed too soon.



Body Condition and weight gain: If a bovine in your herd is not able to gain weight efficiently on pasture alone, or gain weight after calving while nursing a calf and going into winter feeding, she should be shipped.
Cows that come up open during preg-checking, are late calvers or late breeders should be culled. Bulls that are infertile or cannot settle all the cows he's been exposed to should be culled. Often health and nutrition are factors affecting the fertility of your cow herd, and you may have to look at that as well if a lot of your cows are coming up open.
Some cows can be too old to calve out or even raise a calf. This is apparent when their teeth have been worn down to the gums, when they have poorer fertility than the rest of the herd, or are generally not as productive and thrifty as they used to be.

Good conformation in cattle is necessary if you are to keep a good, high producing cow herd. Cows must have good feet and udders, maintaining the depth in their ribs and rumps, and be overall as feminine as their breeding allows. Bulls must have great feet and legs, good scrotal conformation, good depth in the ribs and rump and have good masculinity and muscling. Replacement heifers should be growthier than other calves and have good conformation like their dams if they are to be retained. Any bovine in your herd that does not meet any of the criteria mentioned in the conformation article link above, they should be culled.
Temperament is just as crucial as fertility and conformation in your cow herd. You should not be allowing any wild or unruly cows to be kept in your herd, as they are often dangerous to you, and can even stir up an unnecessary fuss in the herd. Any cows that are crazy, not docile, overly protective or aggressive towards you, or try to run to the hills whenever you're out checking cows should be culled. Any bull that challenges you and does not respect you (often when they've come to realize they're bigger and stronger and more intimidating than you) should be shipped ASAP.

You may have some cattle that are just too wild to be put in the trailer. It may be more humane to put them down in the pasture and butcher them for the freezer right there. It'll save the headache and stress of forcing them to get in the trailer.


There is a longer list for any potential health issues that will make you consider culling some cows from your herd. You may be the kind of producer that doesn't want to spend the money on vet medicine to treat a sick cow, bull or calf, and may choose to put them down instead. However, you may be the kind of producer that will try to treat a sick bovine, only to find their fertility has decreased, or they are chronically ill. Some diseases, like Johne's disease, are simply untreatable, and you will have to not only cull the cow with Johne's, but all her daughters and sons from your herd. Some animals you will find may be carriers for a genetic defect that is affecting your calf crop, and you may have to cull those as well. Mastitis in a dairy cow will often reduce her milk productivity, and she will be culled as well.

Any bovines that have prolapsed, have pink-eye or cancer eye, have sunburnt or frost bitten udders or testicles, or consistently have been difficult with calving, must be culled.


Please see your local large animal veterinarian for any information on diseases you will need to keep an eye out for in your cow herd.
Selling your year's calf crop is another form of culling, though this is really a result of your year's work of keeping the cow herd in top condition and quality. If you choose to keep your calves back for a while, remember you are doubling your herd size if you do so, and need more pasture and/or feed to keep these calves for an extra few months or even a year (if necessary). It's highly recommended, if you are primarily a cow-calf producer and not a cow-yearling producer, to sell your calves right after they've been weaned.;
, The top priority animals that should be culled out of the herd sooner (if possible) are those with bad temperament issues and/or health issues. Some animals with bad health issues can be kept back particularly if you are willing and able to treat them back to health. Other animals with health issues that cannot be treated and should be culled as soon as possible. When it comes to bad temperamental issues, however, it is highly recommended that you get rid of these animals right away. If you are working alone, you will need to call someone to help you separate the bad animal from the herd, or wait until you can sell your other culls to separate that animal with the other culls.

, It's best if you separate your cattle into different groups before you haul them to the auction mart. For example, you may only have one cow with health issues, one bad tempered bull, and five cows that are too old to continue being production or bad conformation, and the rest of your culls are weaned calves you are intent on selling, but it's a good idea to load your cows and/or bulls together in one load, then your weaned calves in a separate load.

,, Your animals will be weighed first before you get the bill of sale, and how much your animals sell for goes according to what the current prices are for each type and size of animal.

Find a place to sit and something to sit on in the calf's pen.,
Bring a book or tablet to read from.,
Remain in your spot for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.,
Leave your spot and return the next day or a few hours later.,
Make feeding time a time your calf will associate you with good things.,
When not feeding, and after the calf is comfortable sitting or eating with you, you can try to coax him with a handful of grass or hay, or a taste of pellets or grain.,
Once the calf has become comfortable enough to come and eat from the pile next to you, try once again to get him to eat from your hands.,
If you finally have the calf eating from your hands, now try to touch him.,
Once you have him comfortable with touching him, then you can start training him to come to you.",How to Get a Hand Shy Calf to Let You Approach It," The best place to sit is where the calf can see and smell you and come up to you on his own. You can choose to start in the corner of the pen for the time being, or near its food and water.

Use a pail or stool or log to sit on, or anything that is relatively comfortable. This is because you may be seated for about a half-hour at a time or more. Sitting is also better than squatting, though both methods are used to make you look smaller and more vulnerable than you actually are.
If you find a clean place on the ground to sit on and wish to sit there instead, then feel free to use that. This will certainly eliminating the need for a pail, cut log, stool, or anything else bring and sit on.;
, This will give the calf the impression that your focus is completely off him and only on the object in your hand, making you appear less threatening.

It's completely up to you if you feel comfortable reading silently or out loud the calf. Some may recommend reading out loud to get the calf used to your voice, and some may not. It just depends on your comfort level.

, Read aloud, or silently (your choice), and look around every so often to see how the calf is reacting to you. He may be curious at first and make some movement to come up to you, or he may stand and stare at you, then go find a place to hide or get as far away from you as possible. This completely normal, especially for a calf that is both not used to you nor accustomed to human contact.

If he does come up to you out of curiosity, move very little and avoid petting him. Just let him sniff at you and move away when he wants to.
Don't be disappointed if the calf is more interested in its food or sleeping than you, because this may actually be a good sign. If a calf is feeling alarmed or frightened of you he won't be interested in eating or finding a place to nap. Rather he will be pacing around his pen, avoiding you, and trying to find a way out. He may just be walking around a lot, casting nervous glances at you.

, Do the same again as indicated in the steps above. Continue to do this until the calf appears comfortable around you: This is indicated by eating or grazing, and/or laying down in your presence. This may take you anywhere from after 3 attempts to at least 10. It will depend on the individual calf., This may mean taking your time with feeding the calf, talking to him as you do so, and staying for a few minutes afterward. If you've figured out a name for him, then use that so he knows who you're calling him by.

Don't try to reach out and pet the calf just yet, because you should be more focused on him getting comfortable being near you than you trying to touch it.

, Try to offer the feed to him at first with your hand, holding it somewhat low where you're sitting. If that fails after several minutes, then leave it on the ground in a pile near you; not under you. Stay where you are, and try not to pay too much attention to the calf, which includes not touching him if he comes to sniff at the pile you left for him. If he doesn't come close to eat the pile or attempts to sniff your hand, then leave the calf be and try again the next time., This may take several tries in combination with the step above, so patience and time is needed. But don't spend too long at it; 10 to 20 minutes is ideal for each session.

Take this as an opportunity to stand up while offering the feed. He will have seen you standing and walking as you come in and out of his pen to clean out his bedding and feed him, so in combination with you sitting and reading with him, this part shouldn't cause much trouble with the calf. Especially if you are consistent in being the one to bed and feed him regularly.

, Avoid touching the top of the head or the muzzle; instead start from the chin and under the jaw, with a gentle touch at first. If the calf doesn't move away from you with that touch, turn it into a gentle scratch for a couple seconds.

From there you can move, using the calf as a guide to let you know how comfortable he is with you (don't force yourself on him, in other words), from his chin and jaw down his neck to his chest. It's very important that you move in baby steps, repeating from the same or similar spot you started him with before moving just a little farther each time. But don't push it. If he moves away because he's not comfortable with the new spot your scratching him on, let him move away, but get him to come back to you right away so that you're not ending on a negative note.
It's at this time you can also try to get him comfortable with putting and having a halter on to start halter-breaking him. Once you have the halter on him you can really begin to get him to get comfortable with you touching and grooming him. Remember to use yourself and the halter as a source where good things come from.

, Bovines are very food-motivated, calves especially, so ""bribing"" him with food will be very easy especially now that he understands who and where his feed is coming from. Call his name as you do so. Eventually you may be able to call his name without having any treats for him and he'll readily come to you."

Select a 12' to 15' (feet) (3.6m to 4.5m) length of half-inch (1.27cm) three-stranded rope.,
Finish one end of the rope by whipping it, clamping it with a ferrule, dipping, or heat-treating it.,
Mark a point with your hand about 12 to 15 inches (30.5cm to 38cm) from the whipped end of the rope.,
Place the short end on your right and the long end on your left.,
Isolate any one of the open strands with your thumb and index finger of your left hand.,
Position the rope so that the eye loop is on your left hand with the short end pointing towards 3 o'clock and the long end pointing towards 6 o'clock.,
Use your left hand to insert the long end of the rope from the bottom up under and through these two strands.,
With the eye loop in your right, grasp the short end of the rope between your left thumb and forefinger about 2 inches (5cm) from the whipped end.,
Line these three loops up in order and work a sharpened stick of the same diameter of the rope into the loops.,
Run the long end of the rope into and through the eye of the loop.,
Permanently finish the long end of the rope halter in the manner you choose.",How to Make an Adjustable Rope Halter," Any type of rope, from cotton to nylon will work. However your choice depends on the strength needed, durability required, and the cost. Smaller rope that is 1/4"" to 3/8"" (6.35mm to 9.52mm) diameter is suitable for sheep and goats.;
, Note that the method you select depends on your wishes and the type of rope being used. Failure to finish the rope ends will result in fraying and un-laying.


Temporarily finish the other end of the rope with tape or string.
You will need to form a crown knot into this end after the halter is completed.

, Refer to this length as the short end of the rope. The remaining length is the long end.

, Grasp the rope at the 12"" to 15"" (30.5cm x 38cm) mark between your thumb and first two fingers (fore and middle) of both hands.


Separate your right and left hands by around 2"" (5cm) apart.
Rotate the rope clockwise with your right hand and counterclockwise with your left. This will open the strands of the rope between your hands.

, Use your right hand to insert the whipped end of the short end of the rope under the strand opening until the loop formed has an eye opening of around double the diameter of the rope.

, Grasp the eye loop and the single strand running across the short end of the rope between your left thumb and forefinger.


With your right thumb and forefinger, grasp the short end of the rope at a point near the eye loop.
Twist the eye-loop and short end of the rope with your hands until you have isolated two strands between your right thumb and forefinger.

,


Pull it completely through until there's no slack. If you have done it properly up to now, one side of the loop will show three strands lying smoothly side-by-side. This is important because they will be positioned against the animal's face.

, Two inches farther from the whipped end, grasp it in the same manner in your right hand (your hands should be 2 inches apart, the left closest to the short end than the right).


Open the strands by twisting clockwise with your right hand and counterclockwise with your left.
When the strands are opened wide, push your hands together. This will cause the strands to buckle and fold over, forming three loops.

, Use your right hand to feed the long end of the rope into the loops, starting at the one closest to the eye loop. Remove the stick from one loop at a time as you run the long end of the rope through them.

, This completes the halter!

, Consider making a crown knot at the end because a crown knot and back splice creates a convenient handle.


Do not use a hog ring to finish the end since it could catch and tear the skin of your hand.

Understand what body scoring is.,
Get the cattle in.,
Eye up the general condition of the cow.,
Work on the animal's right side.,
Start with the area over the last rib and the spine above that point.,
Note the body condition score of each cow that you do.,
Repeat with other cows that are to be scored.

",How to Judge Body Condition Scores in Cattle," Body condition scoring (BCS) is, by definition, the level of fatness on the body of an animal. There are two different scales of scoring that one can use for judging condition in cattle:


1 to 9, which is the American scoring system (or some refer this as the Beef Cattle scoring system); or
1 to 5, which is the Scottish (or Canadian) scoring system, or, for some, the Dairy Cattle scoring system.
One (1) refers to extreme emaciation, and 5 (or 9) refers to overly fat or obese.;
, Round up the cows using proper herding techniques to get them in the handling facility and to the crush or squeeze chute.


Body condition scoring, especially with beef cows, needs to be done when they are restrained. Some cows can be so tame that they will let you touch them, but most should be restrained with a head-gate to do the scoring.

, Using your eyes is one way to judge body condition, but this can be difficult with cattle, like Highland or Galloway cattle, because the thick hair hides a lot of what you can feel by touch. Cattle that have their winter coats on will also pose the same issue for you.

, The rumen on the left will only hinder your ability to do a proper scoring on the cow.

, The area between the last rib and the hooks (first hip protuberance) is a major area that is used for judging BCS. Note the fat covering over the ribs and spine of this area. Then work your way over the hooks and pins, the thurl and the tailhead of the animal. Note the following (using the Canadian or Dairy Body Condition Scoring method):



BCS of 1: Entire animal will be extremely thin; this will be very noticeable in cows that have a short hair coat. All skeletal structures are visible, with no fat in the tail docks or brisket, nor will there be any muscle tissue or external fat present. Individual vertebrae on the spine are evident, and you should be able to place your fingers in between each vertebrae. The short ribs are visually prominent, and they feel sharp to the touch. The thurl over the hip is sunken in, and the hooks and pins are very sharp and prominent.






Animals of this score are much too thin, and are a cause of great concern to those involved in animal rescue societies like the SPCA and even animal-rights people.

Cows this thin do not have a good survival rate because of the lack of fat and muscle tissue in and over their bodies; malnutrition and sickness is a very high risk for animals in this condition.
Cows will have a lot of trouble calving out with a BCS of 1 because of the lack of stored energy (fat) and muscle tissue they need when dealing with the stress of calving, thus dystocia will be a big problem for her. Emaciated cows will give little to no milk after calving, and will come back into estrus very late, unless she is given the proper feed and nutrition to help her gain weight.
Emaciated and thin cows eat a lot because of their condition, and because cattle are capable of a weight-gaining process called compensatory gain. Thin cows have a higher temperature threshold than fat or normal condition cows because of the lack of fat and energy reserves needed to survive cold weather.





BCS of 2: The entire animal is thin, with the upper skeleton prominent, and there is some muscle tissue present. There is also some tissue over the tail dock, hip bones and flank. Individual vertebrae can be felt in the backbone, but they are not sharp. You shouldn't be able to place your fingers in between the vertebrae. Individual ribs can also be felt, though they will not be as sharp as with the BCS of 1.






Though deemed thin at this point, she will not be as high at risk for malnutrition or illness as a cow with a BCS of 1. However, she will breed back later and have more calving issues, and still needs to gain weight in order to be conceived as a healthy bovine.



BCS of 3: This is ideal condition for calving. The ribs are slightly visible, and the hooks and pins are visible, but not prominent. Muscle tissue is nearing its maximum, and there is fat already forming behind the shoulder and in the brisket area. The backbone is somewhat defined, but it'll be difficult to feel the tops of the vertebrae. The short ribs are completely covered with fat, with the fat beginning to spread over the rump, and individual ribs can only be felt with firm pressure.






Cows in this condition are the ideal keepers, even though they are considered to be on the borderline of being thin. They are much more likely to calve out on their own with little to no difficulty, and are also able to produce adequate amounts of milk for their calves.
Feed costs are certainly lowered when you have cows of this condition (or higher) because they are not eating as much nor have as high a nutritional requirement as cows that are below this condition score.
Critical low temperatures are lower for cows like these (at around -20ºC/-4ºF), making them more able to survive and even thrive in the wintertime.

However, your cows should not be in this condition going into the winter months; this is the condition they should be in when the spring grasses start to grow and they can regain their weight lost in the winter.





BCS of 4: The skeletal structure will be difficult to identify, because there are obvious fat deposits behind the shoulder, at the tailhead, on the brisket and over the shoulder. The back will have a flat appearance over the top-line, and individual vertebrae cannot be felt. Folds of fat are beginning to develop over the ribs and thighs, and individual ribs cannot be felt even with firm pressure.






Cows are deemed as moderately fat to fat at this point, but this is also the optimum condition cows should be in when going into the winter months, because this means that they can be fed a lower quality feed or be on low quality pasture without too much worry about malnutrition concerns during wintertime. They will lose weight over winter, of course, as this is natural for any herbivore going into the most difficult season of the year.

However, some cows at this condition may have a few issues with calving and milking ability than cows with a normal BCS of 3. This is because fat deposits start to form around the birth canal make calving out more difficult (fat deposits hinder the birth canal's ability to stretch far enough to allow the delivery of a calf), and fat deposits in the udder may have the cow to produce less milk than what is needed.
Between BCS of 4 and 5 is the best condition to move backgrounded cattle onto the feedlot, or for small-time farmers to have their steers slaughtered.





BCS of 5: This is the point where the bovine is considered obese. The animal will have a blocky look about it, with a dominating flat appearance. The brisket will be heavy with fat, and the hips and tailhead of the animal will be pretty well buried in fat. The animal will have a flat back and individual vertebrae cannot be felt at all. The short ribs are not present because they are completely covered by fat. Mobility may be impaired because of the excess of fat.






As mentioned above with BCS of 5, calving and milking ability will be hindered for cows in this condition. Cows that have a BCS of 4 or greater need to be put on a low-quality diet so that they will lose weight in time for breeding and/or calving season.

Bulls in this condition will experience fertility issues because fat deposits in the scrotum increase the temperature of the testes, which will harm proper sperm production.
North American meat packers downgrade carcasses that are overly fat because of the excess fat that needs to be trimmed off and the excessive marbling.

However with the Japanese Kobe beef, animals that are at this condition are considered desirable since beef with this high of marbling is considered a delicacy.







, It would help to write down which cow has what condition score, so you can later on determine if any of the thinner cows need to be separated from the fatter ones.

Acknowledge how your frame of mind and behaviour will influence animal movement.,
Understand the difference between human instinct versus bovine instinct.,
Recognize the possibility that instinctual human behaviour has a significant influence on how animals are going to respond.,
Understand how cattle think and what they like to do.,
Familiarize yourself with how cattle move in response to pressure.,
Understand why release is important after applying pressure.,
Watch some cattle handling videos by stockmanship experts to get a feel of what's involved.",How to Herd Cattle1," All animals, including cattle, are incredibly sensitive to our attitude and our frame of mind, and will always be a mirror to what we're actually feeling, even when we don't realize it at the time. If you are excited or tense, they will also be excited and tense. If you are calm and quiet, they will also be calm and quiet.

When working with cattle, then, it is so very important to be in the right frame of mind because cattle are more likely to respond well versus if you were not in the right frame of mind.
In other words, if you are working cattle in an anything-but-calm emotional state, those animals are surely going to be anything but calm too.
You may find that you can work with cattle--and this goes for any other animal, dogs, cats, goats, horses, or even chickens--if you allow yourself to have a clear head and a calm attitude. You may find that, by putting yourself in a calm state, you will be able to think more clearly and deliberately communicate your intentions to the animals you are working with. And the animals are less likely to be confused as well.
Your behaviour has a huge influence on how even an individual cow, not to mention an entire herd, regardless of size, will perceive you. If your behaviour is such that you don't care or are holding back too much, they'll take advantage of that and not interested in doing as you ask. On the opposite spectrum, if you're too aggressive and forceful, they also won't be interested in listening to you. So, to be successful, pick the middle of the road: Be intentional in your actions, be deliberate, and be assertive, but never to the point of being aggressive and forceful.;
, Just to give you a taste, humans and cattle sit at the opposite end of the spectrum: We have humans, which are predatory animals, and cattle, which are prey animals.

Humans, as predatory animals, aren't much different from other predatory animals in how we perceive ourselves and those around us. When working with animals, not just cattle, our instincts are to:

Slow or stop animals
Want animals to face us; give us eye-contact, not turn away (because, to us this means they're ""going to run away."")

Keep pushing or push from behind, even when animals are already on their way and know where they're going.
Circle around (classic predatory behaviour), to ""cut off"" or, as already mentioned, stop or slow down animals.
To give chase because we think something is trying to run away. (This goes right back to instinctually wanting to slow or stop an animal.)
Not to back up, but rather stay put or just keep pushing forward, or even turn away.


Cows and other prey animals (horses, goats, bison, sheep, chickens, elk, buffalo, and even pigs) think differently from us. Their instincts are to:

Want to see what is pressuring them.
Move in the direction they are headed (i.e., if they want to go to that patch of woods, that's where they'll go; if they're heading straight they'll go straight).
Follow other animals.
Have very little patience. In other words, they won't wait around for long if you're trying to figure out how to move them, so they'll just keep going or doing what they were going to do in the first place, or whatever first pops in their heads.



, We have to remember that, because cattle are prey animals, they are going to respond as prey animals will, and that is if they find any animal acting as a predator, regardless if it's a wolf or a man, they will act as any prey animal will and choose flight first before stopping and facing said predator as a last-ditch defence. Cattle instinctually know how to avoid predators; those that have had to live for extended periods without human contact (and there are many of such animals that exist in many parts of the world), have had to tap into those instincts to survive.

Some livestock handling methods recommend to ""act like a predator"" to successfully move cattle, but these methods may not always work, because it doesn't build trust nor give your animals the means to believe that you are not there to hurt them or cause fear. Instinctively, predatory actions induce fear into prey animals, which goes hand-in-hand with mistrust. Just like you'd want your horse to trust you enough to allow you on his back, you should want your cattle to trust that you are going to move them to some place where they feel safe, and also move them in a way that they are all going to willingly go there.

You can easily tell if your animals do not trust you and don't want to do as you are ""asking"" by the way their heads are held (high up, ears pricked, bodies tense with that ""look"" like they're ready to flee), and how they are hesitate and resistant to move.



, Going back to the second part of step 2 above, the instincts of cattle are basically from that of a one-track mind: They just want to go where they're headed, see what's pressuring them, and follow others. Going beyond that, when working closely with cattle, some extra points to realize that livestock like doing:

Livestock like to go by us;
They also like to go around us.
Cattle always like to go back the same way they came from; they prefer to go back to the last place they felt safe.

, Each individual animal has what is called a ""flight bubble"" or ""flight zone"", which can also be called a ""pressure zone"", though arguably the pressure zone is just slightly outside of the true flight zone. This zone is basically an invisible oval bubble surrounding the animal. Its size varies for each animal, from almost no discernible zone, to a zone that can be least 50 yards (46 m) in size. For example, bison typically have a larger pressure/flight zone bubble than cattle do.

This ""bubble"" is used as a means to move animals, done so in a way that it takes advantage of an animal's zone of comfort as well as point of vision. Thus, when moving an animal, you should always be where the animal can see you.

Cattle have a 330º field of vision. They don't see very well right in front of their noses and can't see directly behind them, so do not pressure them at either of these points. Instead, to take advantage of this pressure zone, you must apply pressure from either hip or either shoulder right up to the neck.

A cow will move forward if you continually correct her, from the hip or by crossing in behind, whenever she needs to turn her head to see you.

This is why it's so important to make sure you are where you can be seen!!


To turn an animal, go in the opposite direction of where you want the cow to go, just like you would with backing up a trailer.
If an animal is turning to look at you, it's because you're not in a place where they can see you or feel you pressuring them to move. Either you need to move out farther to the side, or you need to move closer.




Manipulating this bubble so that the animal goes to where you ask it takes patience and knowing how to move on your part. You will not always be moving forward, you will have to often either stop, move away, walk with the animals, or back up to release pressure off the animal.

, Release is a form of reward and a way to remove the stress we put on animals to get them moving in the direction we ask them to. Release works hand-in-hand with pressure, and should always be kept in conjunction with pressure in order to give animals the sense that they're doing something good and that it's always going to come after pressure is applied.

To apply release is to slow down, stop, move away, walk with the animals, or back up, depending on the location of where animals are being handled and how they are responding to pressure. Doing these will not only relieve pressure on the animals for us to be able to make necessary adjustments, but also draw animals toward us, or slow down/stop the animals.

, The first taste of learning proper herdsmanship or stockmanship of working cattle is going to seem confusing and will require lots of practice and continual learning. Bud Williams, for instance, was always learning how to best handle cattle up to when he passed away. Other stockmen like Steve Cote, Richard McConnell and Tina Williams, Dylan Biggs, and Curt Pate are other good people worth looking into and learning more from. Temple Grandin is also good for a lot of basics with handling cattle."
"
Realize that each situation you walk into will be different.,
Assess the animals.,
Get them up and started.,
Develop good movement of the herd.,
Maintain good movement.,
Move them towards and through the gate.,
Slow them down or stop them.",How to Herd Cattle2," You will want to do and try different things with them, and they will certainly be posing different challenges for you that you need to be ready for and let the animals teach you about. No herding scenario is going to be perfect each and every time., Watch their behaviour before you go in and gather them up. They may already be laying down or watching you intently with the ears pricked and heads up. You will need to react and start them accordingly., The first thing, and most important thing, that you need to do is to get the herd started. This is also the first part of training of both you and the cattle to drive properly. Getting started is generally getting the herd gathered up enough that you're getting good movement from them. The herd, as from step 2 above, may either be calmly laying down and chewing their cud, or watching you intently as you move closer to them. The added difficulty will be when working with cattle that have not yet been trained to herd properly, so be prepared for some flighty animals at first.

It's important to give them time to think and gather themselves up–let them stretch, if you have cows to gather up and join up with their calves, take a few bites of grass, etc.–before getting them moving. Allow them to take a few steps ahead before you begin pressuring and guiding them to generate that good movement.

Good movement means that animals will be moving freely and comfortably, acting and feeling relaxed with their heads bobbing as they walk along.

When animals are going in the direction you want them to, stragglers will be drawn in to the main herd, and they will even stay where you ""place"" them if good movement was used to get them there.


If they are flighty and high-headed, don't feel the need to rush into things. Instead, go slowly and take your time. If they run away, let them. But you will need to keep moving and trail them where they go, never moving at them, directly behind them, nor curve around them. Make straight lines as a form of pressure-and-release until they settle down and realize you are not a threat.
If animals are laying down and quietly chewing their cud, then you will need to get them up. To do this, walk to the hip or shoulder until they make the movement to get up, then immediately move away to the next animal. If there's an animal already getting up before you get to it, move away from that and keep going until all animals are up and ready to go.

It's so important to never ever give that one little extra push when they're already doing what you want them to do. Once they're already up and/or moving away, then just let them. You can come back and correct where they're going soon enough.
The hardest part of getting them started is actually getting them started. The next problem is getting them going in a direction you want to go and leaving them alone as soon as they do so. The other challenging part is how far out, in a straight line, you need to go to get animals moving or to turn them without compromising movement or direction of travel. This will take much experimenting on your part and continual reading of how animals will respond.



, Once the animals are up and beginning to move, you will need to move in straight lines–never straight to the head nor straight at the rear–to get the herd moving in the direction you want to go. The rule of thumb to use is to generally move perpendicular to the direction the herd should be going; when walking behind a herd in a pasture, this means straight zig-zag patterns.

When making zig-zags, it's completely fine to cross behind an animal, and to make an angle to the hip, shoulder, belly or neck of the outside animal to get maximum influence of movement. Just remember, once the animal is going in the direction you want it to, leave it immediately.
Think of moving a herd being like moving a wall by yourself. You have to walk to one edge and back to another to get movement going straight ahead. If you want to turn a certain way, little movement is needed on one end versus the other, depending on how sharp or wide a turn that needs to be made, and how much space you have to do it.

To move a herd to the right, go left. To move a herd to the left, go right.

This is no different when trying to turn an individual cow. In order to get her moving straight, zig-zags back and forth to guide her is what will get her going straight, relatively speaking.




Depending on how far strung-out the herd is, the zig-zag pattern may vary from one step in one direction and another step the other, or several steps one way and several steps the other way. Use your animals (and your choice direction) as a guide to tell how many steps you need to make one way versus another.

, As already mentioned, good movement is achieved when animals are relaxed, their heads are bobbing as they walk, and they're moving at a comfortable pace. Other stock will be drawn out from wherever they are hiding, and come in to the main herd. It's important to not pay much attention to these stragglers, but also to make sure you are not ahead of the rear-most animal.

You too must maintain that zig-zag pattern to keep that good movement going, as the points and steps above have already mentioned. There is no defined number of steps you need to cut in or out to maintain good movement and direction; this is far more of a matter of constant trial-and-error and learning to read your animals effectively.
Good movement isn't always nor necessarily slow and steady. If animals are feeling a little frisky and lively, they may run for a little ways, and you'll have to do your part to keep up! And if they want to move slow, then let them move slow.

You can also control their speed. If you angle a bit more harder into them, they will speed up. Angle less into them, they will slow down.
A herd with good movement will always draw in the stragglers, no matter where they are.


Animals will tell you if you are too close or too far behind. Too much turning may mean you need to back off and give them a little more space. But if they're turning around to look at you, you may need to either move up closer, or move farther out.
It's less important to know where the gate is than it is to get them going in a direction you want them to go. Adjustments to direction may need to be made if there are certain objects in the way–ranging from a hill to a telephone pole–but generally the direction of travel should go back to where you are intending.

, While this may sound like a scary challenge, it doesn't have to be. Just remember, always ""T to the gate."" Think of an upside-down T, with the end of this upside-down T at the gate, and the perpendicular line to this T your direction of travel. The herd is along the line between the gate and your perpendicular direction of movement.

Your job is to guide the herd from the rear towards the gate opening, guiding from the corners and pressuring from the side. This T will be continually shifting according to the changes made by the herd. Remember, you are always working back and forth in a straight, zig-zag pattern.
If the herd is not moving in a straight line to the gate, then shift your line so you continue to work in a straight line to the gate. Your ""angle of attack"" should always be move right to move the animals left and move left to get the animals to move right.
Continue with this T to the gate even as they go through. It's very important to never encircle the herd or create a horse-shoe because this could cause one or more animals to break away from the gate. Keep working in a straight line until all animals are through that gate.
It's also critically important to never post someone near the gate. This actually distracts the animals and causes some to break away.

In other words, if you are worrying about animals not going through the gate, and feel the urge to go and ""correct"" some potential movement, then don't. You are more likely to create the very problem you're worried that's going to happen; rather, you are more likely to make animals not go through the gate if you try to ""correct"" them versus if you just maintained your T to the gate movements until all animals are past that gate.


The ""T to the gate"" is very similar to and can be also used when loading cattle onto a trailer in the middle of a pasture.

It's also used for any size of herd. But the larger the herd, the larger the T, and the more people that may be needed to form this T to the gate.


This method, used properly, will eliminate the need for using fences as wings to funnel cattle into a gate or onto a trailer. Wings to a gate only act as a bottle-neck to crowd animals in, and can cause more trouble than they're worth.

, In order to slow them down and stop them, walk parallel to or with the animals. This will naturally get them to stop or slow down.

Stopping is another part of a training exercise that is important with working cattle. They are easier to handle when they (and you) understand the art and science behind starting and stopping movement.

"
"
Perform the steps mentioned above for starting and developing good movement in a herd.,
Focus on one or more animals to split out.,
Begin working animals so that you are walking past the ones you don't want to bring with you.,
Herd the animals, similar to that mentioned in the last section, to the place where you want to place them.",How to Herd Cattle3," It's always important to get the start of movement going before you focus on separating out some select animals from the main group., You should have already assessed the group for the ones you want to split from the herd, so keep an eye on them and begin to ignore the rest., When you walk past these animals, they will slow down and stop. The ones still ahead of you should continue movement as long as they can see you are still applying pressure and release with your zig-zag movements.

Ignore the other animals that want to follow, unless one or more of them are a part of the group you want to gather up. The other ""unwanted"" cattle will soon figure out you do not want them with the group you're herding; they will soon stop and go about their own business.
If you are splitting out just one animal, and they are not used to you driving them, they may try to stop and ""challenge"" you or try to get back to the herd.

If they are facing you in a challenge, just stop, and shift your weight from one foot to another to allow them to think. If they make a move to go around you, step in that direction to discourage that movement. Repeat until you teach the animal to understand that you mean no harm, and you just want them to walk with you, yet you are still the boss and are the one responsible for leading or herding them to where they should go.

This may take a few minutes, but take your time, and keep watching and reading the animal.


If they do break away back to the herd, then repeat the process again until you are able to successfully drive the cow, heifer, steer, or even bull without them trying to get around or challenge you.


There is no need to worry if there's one or two extra cattle in with the group that want to stay with the group. You can split them off later on, when they move from the front of the herd to the back. Once they get near the back you can adjust your movements so that you are no longer applying pressure for them to stay with the group you've already collected.

, Your zig-zag movements will be minimal for a small group or one animal. But you are always going to be guiding from the corners and pressuring from the sides."
"
Move cattle from the pasture or corral using the steps from the sections above into a holding pen.,
Move a smaller group from the main holding pen (or one of them if there is more than one such pen) into a smaller pen or holding alley.,
Move the first small group into the crowding tub or bud box.,
Put them down the working alley from the tub or box.,
Encourage movement into the squeeze by walking in the opposite direction that they are to go.,
Process each animal in the squeeze or head-gate, or just hold them for a few seconds then release them.",How to Herd Cattle4," This pen will be the first place where your cattle are going to move into and through the handling facility., This is a good time for sorting cattle if this needs to be done. Use the same principles and practices mentioned above for splitting out one or more cattle from the main herd, without actively herding them.

It's important to never push from the back, but rather move from the front, through the gate from where you want the animals to go.

When working in a smaller area there is less room for error and less time to react. But the basics still apply with controlling movement. In this instance, you can stand beside the gate, or move in towards the back if this is a long pen, and move a step forward or backward to stop or encourage movement through the gate.
The wider the gate, though, the more in the opening of that gate you will need to stand.


Standing by the gate and moving back and forth (or side to side, depending on the shape of the pen and where the animals are in that pen) will slow down the number of animals that enter the holding alley leading to the next pen. You are usually not wanting all animals to go through, but only a certain amount out of a larger herd at a time.
There is almost no need to have someone going in behind the group to push them up. That is, unless there's a big area behind them where they shouldn't be. If there's enough crowding going on that the pressure you apply when at the gate makes them go through that gate, then you are only needed at that gate and not needing someone else behind to move them up.

, You only need a group of half a dozen head in a 14' by 20' box (or a group of four or five for a 12' crowding tub) to work with., In a Bud box system, you only need to be standing right by the opening they're to go through. Just as with the second step above, stepping forward or backward will control movement through to the alley. Some instances you just need to stand there to encourage them to go by and around you to feel like they're going to go back the way they came., In order to get to that point, when you step away from the box or tub, make a wide loop around then walk straight up the chute towards the tub. They will quickly go to the head-gate or squeeze chute.

If you have a calf or cow that gets turned around in the alley, then just walk down the alley from the box or tub to get them back into the tub or box. Repeat your stance by the opening to the alley. If the calf balks before the squeeze, then once again, make a wide loop towards the squeeze or head-gate then walk up beside the alley to encourage movement forward.

, Repeat the same steps as above for the next group of cattle."
"
Study the characteristics and differences of each type of cattle.,
Observe the characteristic of horns in cattle.,
Understand the characteristic of ""scurred"", found in some cattle.,
Understand what polled cattle are.,
Memorize the characteristics of each trait.

,
Go on a field trip or road trip to see if you can find any farms and ranches that have cattle that are polled, horned, scurred or dehorned.","How to Identify Horned, Scurred and Polled Cattle"," The following process will explain each identification strategy.;
, Horns are probably the most obvious and well-known characteristic of all bovines. All cattle are capable of having horns and it is not a sex-linked trait or a trait only meant for bulls or steers to have. The poll is flat and the horns of a bovine are found on opposite sides of an animal's head, immediately above the ears and point outwards, upwards or downwards on either side of the head. They are made of keratin and bone and are filled with blood vessels, and stay with a bovine throughout its life, unless they are removed manually or are broken off from getting a horn stuck somewhere where it cannot be removed without removing the horn itself.


The way horns grow ultimately depends on the breed. Horns that grow outward then curve up is a characteristic typically found in most to all European/British breeds such as Texas Longhorn, Florida Cracker/Pineywoods, Corriente and Scottish Highland cattle breeds. English Longhorn is the only breed that have the horns of cattle growing downwards. With the majority of the Bos indicus breeds though, like that of Brahman cattle, horns point out and up. A large number of African Bos Taurus breeds such as Ankole cattle also have their horns pointing more up than out.
Almost all cattle breeds in the world are naturally horned. Those that are not naturally horned will be mentioned further on below.

Animals that have had their horns removed are still considered horned, not polled.

Dehorned cattle are cattle which have had their horns removed, usually a few days after birth or around or after being weaned. Proper dehorning removes the entire horn right to the skull, leaving a circular bare patch above the ears. Dehorned cattle should never be considered polled, especially from a genetics point of view. Dehorned cattle typically have a flat-looking poll, unlike that of truly polled cattle, described below.





, Scurred is a characteristic that can be present in cattle that have been selected to be polled but are historically known to be horned. Scurred is a term describing the soft incomplete buds that would otherwise develop into bony horns. These buds are typically soft and loose or malleable on a bovine's head.


The scurred trait can be found in any breed that comprises both polled and horned cattle, but has also been known to crop up in naturally polled breeds, especially like that in Angus or Red Angus cattle. Other breeds that scurs can occur in are:

Charolais
Hereford
Maine Anjou
Simmental
Shorthorn
Gelbvieh
Braunvieh
Tarentaise
Holstein
Brown Swiss

Jersey.



, Polled cattle have absolutely no horns, nor scurs nor bare spaces where a pair of horns may have been, whatsoever. The best way to tell is if a cow, bull, steer or heifer is polled is by looking at the poll, itself located just above and between the ears. If it forms some sort of peak, then the animal is indeed polled, not horned, scurred or dehorned.


Many cattle breeds that are being used for commercial beef and dairy which have been historically horned also have cattle which are polled. This includes all breeds listed above, and others not mentioned. Naturally polled breeds, though, do not have both horned and polled cattle. Such breeds include the following:

Angus (also known as Black Angus)
Red Angus
Galloway
Belted Galloway
Red Poll
British White
American White Park
Speckle Park
Brangus
Red Brangus

Murray Grey.



,, Take pictures of what you think are cattle of each of the four characteristics, and analyze those pictures when you get back home.


Note that finding scurred cattle is much rarer than finding polled, horned or dehorned cattle.

Start by looking at pictures.,
Start by first looking at the overall condition and body of the animal, before closing in and doing a close study of the bull or cow, from head to tail to feet.,
The overall body conformation of a bull and a cow should be deep with plenty of capacity.,
A beef animal should be moderately trim in its underline and brisket to prevent excessive waste.,
The Topline.,
Shoulders.,
The Heart-girth.,
Rump characteristics: The rump of an animal should be deep, wide, long and level in its top.,
Flank conformation.,
The Forehead: The forehead (from the poll to just above the eyes) in a bull should be broad and wide, but not so much so that it makes him look like he has a ""pallet head,"" or a forehead that is flat and bony without much characteristic as far as masculinity is concerned.,
In cows and heifers (and even in steers), head characteristics should be the opposite of a bull's.,
The Eyes: Funny though it seems, eye structure in cattle is quite important, especially in areas where tall plants, dust, and other foreign objects can easily enter the eye and cause such problems as pink eye or cancer eye.,
The Jaw: A bovine's jaw should be evenly set, neither undershot nor overshot.,
Teeth: Teeth impact production because they are needed to graze and break down foodstuffs into smaller particles, and must be in good condition to do so.,
Neck conformation in bulls is very important.,
Neck conformation in cows draws a line between too long and too short.,
Scrotal conformation in bulls: The scrotum of a bull should look foot-ball shaped, and for most yearlings, scrotal circumference should range from 35"" to 40"", depending on the breed.,
Teat and udder conformation in cows: A cow should have an udder with uniform quarters and small teats.,
Poor udder conformation in your beef or dairy herd will reduce udder longevity of your cattle.,
Legs should be squarely set under each of the four corners of the animal and be reasonably, naturally straight.,
Front leg conformation.,
Hind leg conformation: The common issues that come with bad conformation of the hind legs always tends to start at the hocks and the pasterns.,
Toes: Toe structure of the bovine will also have an impact on mobility and stance.",How to Judge Conformation in Cattle," You can start judging conformation of a bull, cow, steer or heifer just by looking at pictures on the Internet or in any book or magazine that has cattle in it. Your local agricultural newspaper is also a good source, as it often has advertisements for bull sales showing the ""top bulls"" that are going to be for sale, according to their breed (i.e., Angus, Red Angus, Hereford, Simmental, Limousin, Beefmaster, Brahman, etc.)


If you do a search on the Web and type in ""bull sales"" or ""cattle sales"" in the heading of such popular search engines as Google or Yahoo!, you will find different pictures of cattle to study from. More often than not, these kind of pictures are the best to critique from, conformationally speaking.

, The following is a guideline of what characteristics ideal in a typical bovine how they may be faulty.

, They should also be long-bodied, but not too long, nor too short. Long-bodied cattle tend to have lower quality carcass grades and are later maturing. Short-bodied cattle tend to put on fat more quickly than what is desirable, and also have poor growth rates.
, At the same time, it should show good depth indicating body capacity. The chest floor, as well as spring of ribs, should exhibit good body capacity and overall productiveness. Adequate width between front and hind legs also indicate good and muscling body capacity., The topline is the spinal column from the neck to the tailhead of an animal. Most of the topline is taken from the last two thirds of the animal, from the middle of the shoulders to the rump. The top line must be straight, with no spinal protrusions or bumps along it.


Roach-backed bulls are strongly selected against because this impedes a bull's ability to breed properly and to travel long distances without creating some sort of leg or spinal injury sometime in the future. It's not so bad in cows, but it can make them cull themselves in a matter of time.
Sway-backed cattle are also selected against, as this can also hamper movement and ability to properly displace weight on the feet. Sway backs are typically attributed to backs that are too long in length, and results in weakness in structural support of the vertebrae, and also causes irregular-shaped loin muscles. Good loin muscle is correlated to high fertility, and bad or weak loin muscle is a sign of poor fertility.

, Good shoulder width in either cows or bulls indicates good capacity in the ribcage, where the heart and lungs are located.



In bulls. Generally, the wider the shoulders in bulls, the better. A bull should have shoulders that are 2 inches (5cm) or more wider than his rump. Wide shoulders indicate masculinity in bulls and is the highest indicator of reproductive efficiency. He is also able to sire sons, when mated to proper phenotypical (feminine) cows, that make great herd sires. His daughters will reach puberty early, breed back and wean a heavy calf. Wide shoulders usually means a larger scrotum, since masculinity in a bull is in the wide, deep shoulders and short neck with a rump similar in width to the front.

Yearling bulls with good shoulder widths correlates with uniform gestation periods, birth weights, better calving ease and more uniform weaning weights.



In cows. Shoulder width should not exceed the width of the rump by more than +/- half an inch (1.27cm). Too deep and wide a shoulder leads to reduced femininity and lack of good milk production. Too narrow or shallow, and the cow is a higher maintenance and even poses reproductive issues and increased risk of genital defects in herself and her daughters and sons.
Shoulders in cattle should be of even length, and not go over the topline (which is typically called ""coarse-shouldered""). Shoulders should also not be open nor extremely heavy (where they can exceed rump width by over 2 inches/5cm), as they are often indicators of calving difficulties.

, The heart girth is the area from behind the shoulders down to behind the elbows. Good depth of heart girth in cattle is a sign of good forage convertibility and good feet and leg conformation. The heart girth is where the organs (heart, lungs, etc) sit, enabling the animal to do and live as it does. The circumference of the heart girth should be equal to or greater than the top line. The closer in measurement the heart girth is in the animal, the more adaptable, vigorous and efficient the animal will be.


Smaller heart girths are undesirable, because they can allow bad conformation in the front feet (feet toe out, for instance), they cannot do well in grass alone, and are an overall high maintenance animal.

, The loin in bulls should be allowed to bow out slightly over the rump's topline.



Rump length in bulls and cows. Rump length should not be too tall nor too short. Tall rumps often indicate poorer muscling ability and thus higher maintenance, especially on grass. Taller animals tend to finish later and require more energy-based feeds to actually reach finished weight. The ideal rump length in cows is 38 percent to 40 percent of two thirds of the topline.

Rump width in bulls and cows. The greater the width of the rump, the better. Wider rumps and hips in cows is a sign of good calving-ability and fertility, as well as early maturing and low maintenance. Wide rumps in bulls correlate to wide shoulders and shorter necks, which is indicative of masculinity.

, The higher the flank circumference is than the heart-girth, the higher the reproductive ability of the cow. This is because the flank is located right on the hindquarters of an animal.

,


In most bulls, like in Charolais and Herefords, curly hair on the forehead commonly symbolizes a bull's good fertility and masculinity.
Calving-ease bulls (those bulls who sire calves that are born small and light-weight, according to breed standards) tend to have a smaller head in proportion to the rest of their body than bulls who are not considered calving-ease.

, She (or ""he"" for a steer) should look more feminine and refined than a bull of her breeding. For instance, Hereford or Charolais cows and heifers do not have the curly foreheads of their male counterparts., Pink eye and cancer eye are serious eye diseases in those animals that lack pigment around their eyes and tend to have poor eye conformation.



The ideal eye structure of a bovine should not be bulged out with the lashes almost horizontal with the ground. Eyes should be well-set, or placed well in the eye-sockets of the animal. Cattle with well-set eyes have lashes that are more parallel to the side of the animal's face than to the ground.

Good pigmentation (not partial) in and around their eyes are far less predisposed to eye injury and cancer eye, as well as sun glare, UV light and reduced fly-related issues.



, They should be free of abscesses, swellings, and any other lesions or injuries that would impede the animal to eat properly nor gain in weight like it usually should. Often undershot/overshot jaw characteristics are genetic defects that are passed on to offspring.


Note, though, that young calves that have undershot or overshot jaws tend to grow out of that and retain normal jaw conformation as they grow older. It can be serious in other animals though, and these are the ones that need to be culled.

, Teeth that are worn down to the gums affects body condition, pregnancy status and production.


Depending on the vegetation that cows are on, most wearing, on average, begins to show between five to seven years of age. By age twelve, many or most of the teeth may be triangular in shape or worn smooth to the gum line. Sandy soil environments tend to have a greater impact on teeth wear than any other environment.
Cows and bulls with teeth that are down to the gums or that have deteriorated should be culled from the herd.

, A good bull should have a thick crest over his neck as well as a short neck. Short necks in bulls are a good indicator of libido and high testosterone, as well as larger scrotal circumference (which relate to higher levels of hormones) and wider, more muscular shoulders. Short-necked bulls tend to sire wide-rumped (more depth in the hindquarters) daughters, and daughters that mature early.



Bulls with longer necks. On the contrary, bulls with longer necks (and therefore less of a crest) are later maturing, have poorer libido and testosterone levels, are hard-keepers and sire daughters that are later-maturing. Bulls with longer necks aren't worth the effort to keep around because of their overall lack in masculinity and inferior genetics.

, Long-necked cows tend to be too dairy and higher maintenance. This is because cows that have longer necks tend to be over-productive milkers, and because of this higher selection in milking ability, will be later maturing and late breeders.


Cows that have too short of necks, on the other hand, are more masculine in conformation, with big shoulders, poorer milking ability and loss of femininity.
A cow should have a neck length that is half the length of her body, neither too long nor too short., Smaller bulls tend to have smaller scrotal circumferences than big bulls. Irregular shaped testicles (uneven size, epididymis not at the bottom of the testes, etc.) can be genetically passed on to sons and daughters. Scrotal conformation in sons could be worse, and in daughters, udder conformation could cause decrease in milking ability, large teats, sagginess in the udder, and cause the udder to break down early.

, Each teat should be equally spaced under each quarter. Teats should not be large, as large teats make it more difficult for a newborn calf to latch onto and suckle from or to get adequate colostrum from.


The udder should the tucked neatly away in between her hind legs, with a level udder floor and no exhibition of any quartering (i.e., one quarter is larger than the other). The udder should blend in with the lower part of the belly quite smoothly, with no V or crevice between the udder and the belly. It should attach high up behind the back legs, and not be tilted up in front or down in the back.

The median suspensory ligament is responsible for proper attachment to the cow's body wall. A poor suspensory ligament will allow the udder to hang down too far from the body and subjects the udder to serious problems like mastitis and risk of injury.



, Like in dairy cows, producers that select for more milk production in terms of higher maternal weaning weight and milk Expected Progeny Difference (EPD) values have a moderate genetic antagonism with udder quality.


Thus, it is always best to match genetics with environmental conditions you are raising your cattle in, and never go to extremes, especially with beef cows.

, The movement of the animal should have a free and easy gait as opposed to being uncoordinated, slow, stiff and/or restricted. Animals with uneven, small, curled or twisted toes and/or crooked feet usually become lame.

, Common issues that come with the front legs and feet are conditions like being buck-kneed, calf-kneed, toed-out and toed-in.



Buck-kneed cattle tend to have an over-extension of the knee, making them seem like they're going to bend down onto their knees instead of standing straight.

Calf-kneed cattle are the opposite of buck-kneed, with the knee extending backwards, pushing the feet forward. This condition is also called back-at-the-knee.


Toed-out or splay-footed cattle have knees that are pointed in towards each other causing their front feet to face outward than straight ahead. Cattle tend to have a gait where they swing the feet out and back in.

Toed-in or pigeon-toed cattle are the opposite of being toed-out (knees pointing out instead of in), and move the opposite way as well: swinging their feet inward then out as they walk.

, If the hocks and pasterns are positioned wrong, then this affects the stance of the feet. For instance, a bovine with cow-hocked legs will have back feet that are toed-in, and a bovine that is wide-at-the-hocks have back feet that are toed out.



Cow-hocked or splay-footed cattle are those that have their hocks pointing in towards each other.

Wide-at-the-hocks or pigeon-toed is opposite of the previously mentioned, with the hocks pointing away from each other at an outwards angle.

Both bad hind leg conformation make the animal make a twisting, rotation action when moving.



Post-legged animals have very little curvature in the hocks. Animals with post-leggedness are predisposed to stifle injury and often have a short, stilted stride.

Sickle-hocked animals are the extreme opposite to being post-legged: the animal has too much angle in the hocks, making it sit back on the heels of the foot and develop hock weaknesses.

Narrow-stance at the hind legs is where the hind legs are literally so close together that you can't see the front of the animal.

Animals with this bad conformation may also be slightly cow-hocked, and be predisposed to soreness and raw skin from the hind feet rubbing together so often.
Animals with this stance tend to walk with each foot moving in on each other or in towards the middle of their body.



, Bulls and cows that have overgrown toes will not walk normally, and walk on the back of their heels than on their whole foot.


Toes of uneven width and length will also affect the mobility and weight distribution of the animal.
Bulls with a condition called screw claw, which is a highly heritable condition and occurs when one toe is thinner than the other and will grow over the other toe, will be predisposed to lameness and lack of proper mobility. Bulls with this condition should be culled.
Other toe abnormalities to watch out for are:

Short hooves that are worn at the toe, indicating the foot has been dragged as the animal walks
Long, narrow hooves with shallow heels, often associated with weak hocks and pasterns and sometimes form scissor hooves (toes cross over each other as they grow).

Your finances are the most important records to keep for your ranch. They are what determine how successful you are in your operations, whether you are actually making money through net income (which is your profitability in the business) or whether you're losing your hat. Using cash flow can help you prepare what to expect for the next fiscal year.

Remember that just because you can cash flow something doesn't always make it profitable.

;
,  Buildings typically require much less attention than fences do, but when there's something broken that needs to be fixed, then it should be fixed as soon as possible. Perimeter and pasture fencing needs to be checked regularly, particularly before cattle are to be moved into a pasture and after they have been moved out.


Fix any broken or loose wires or posts that you may find, and trees that may have fallen on the fence line. It is also highly recommended that you fix any fence that has been damaged by cattle that have attempted to get out (or in), especially if a bull decides to make an exit to see some cows that are in heat at a neighbour's ranch.
Be aware of local laws relating to escaped animals. You can be held liable for damage done by straying stock belonging to you in many jurisdictions––this is another reason why it's important to mend fences quickly.

, Machinery that involves every part of the ranch operation, be it for haying, silage and/or grain production, needs to be maintained so that they are working properly when they are needed for the ranch's operations. It's recommended that machinery is checked regularly, even during the seasons where it is not being used.


No matter how many pieces of machinery you have, from just an ATV and a bale truck to tractors, tillage machinery, combine harvesters, forage harvesters, swathers, mowers/haybines, balers, grain trucks, augers, etc., each piece needs to be inspected, oiled, greased, have broken parts replaced, and be in complete working order before being used in the fields.

, Soil, vegetation and topography on your land dictate how you need to (and would like to) manage your land in the form of grazing cattle on pasture or rangeland. Pay attention to your stocking rates, carrying capacity, rest/recovery periods and animal impact when stocking pastures.


Take notice of any wildlife habitat or signs of wildlife that are on your ranch. Some species of wildlife may be rare or endangered and only have limited or specific areas for breeding, nesting/birthing, or feeding in. To maintain these species of wildlife, you will need to manage your land and cattle so that you are not disrupting the natural patterns of these wild animals while at the same time encouraging them to return to these areas through such your responsible management practices.

Join a local wildlife conservation organization such as Ducks Unlimited so that you have a means to continue to manage your land for both the wildlife and your cattle. In some jurisdictions, government grants or philanthropic organization funding may be available to assist you.


Be aware of the various types of grazing practices available at your disposal and manage such practices according to your goals and objectives, vegetation, soil and topography. It doesn't hurt to look for online or local courses to attend from time to time, so that you can benefit from the most up-to-date information available.
Stay on top of government grants that go toward land maintenance and improvement. Also look for programs that seek to help you recycle nutrients from waste products rather than discharging them downstream or off your land––you can save a lot of money recycling soil and vegetation nutrients rather than buying in artificial fertilizers and the like.

, Feed only during times of need, such as drought or during the wintertime. Cows usually just need hay, but you may choose to feed them silage or supplement with grain as well.


Be aware that for most North American (especially those in Canada and northern USA) and European ranches winter feeding is the biggest source of financial loss in a ranch operation. It is often what makes or breaks the ranch as a business, so requires very careful management with an eye to absolutely no waste.

Try to take advantage of winter grazing to lower such costs if you are in an area where you get cold winters and snow for four to six months of the year. Options such as swath grazing, bale grazing, stockpile grazing, crop-residue grazing or standing-corn grazing, are available for all cattle producers to try to help lower feed costs and general overhead costs during the winter.



, You need to know when the right times are for seeding, spraying (if necessary), cutting and harvesting. With hay, you only need to worry about when to cut, rake and bale.


As mentioned previously each ranch is different, which means the times that are allotted to you to cut hay or begin seeding will be different for one part of the country (or world) than the other.
Note that some ranches may only have one forage/grain enterprise operations, while others may have all three enterprises. Others may have be able to get around with none of the forage/grain enterprises and are able to graze their cattle year-round, especially in temperate and warm climate zones.

, The vaccinations that are required for your area will be different for those in other areas, so it is best to check with your local large animal veterinarian for the best vaccines to use for your animals.

, Depending on what time of the year you have your calving season, you should always have things prepared for when calving season is projected to start. Keep an eye out for cows that may be ready to calve, and have the tools necessary to assist with any calving difficulties.]


Many ranches prefer to calve out heifers before the cows, since the heifers typically need more attention during calving than the cows do.

, You will need to keep an eye on the young calves for signs if illness like scours and pneumonia, injuries like broken legs or feet from being stepped on, cows that may decide to either not accept their calves or steal another cow's calf, predators going after young calves, etc.

, Post-calving you need to tag, vaccinate calves and castrate any bull calves that you are not planning on raising as potential sires. Branding should be done when calves are, on average, around two to three months of age.


With branding time, you can't be expected to do this by yourself or just your immediate family. Branding in the traditional ranching community is a social event and should be treated as such. Get your neighbors, family and friends out by letting them know that you're getting ready for branding and need some extra help. They'll likely be more than pleased to give you a hand. Be sure to reciprocate the help for fellow ranchers.

, Your bulls, whether they have been recently purchased or are already a part of your herd, are worth half of your herd. They need to be semen tested a week or two before breeding season starts. Semen testing will tell you how well he's producing and whether he has healthy sperm as far as motility, morphology and good counts are concerned. You may also need to split your cowherd up into different breeding groups, especially if you have more than one bull of the same size and age. This will reduce competition between these bulls and potential injuries to these bulls as well.


However, this should be up to your discretion. Having separate breeding pastures may be more work than simply letting the bulls do their job in a bigger pasture with all the cows in it.

Heifers should be bred a week or so before the main cow herd, so that the calving season of these heifers start before the rest of the cow herd does.
Typically one mature bull can easily handle breeding 30 to 40 cows, especially if they're more spread out. A bull will be able to service over 50 cows if they're in a smaller pasture. Younger bulls may only be able to breed 30 cows or heifers at the most.
Not all ranches use bull power to breed their heifers and cows. AI (Artificial Insemination) is gaining ground in beef operations as well, and can be made a part of your breeding decisions for your herd.

, Some ranches have one or the other, others have both, or even none. Whether you choose to have a backgrounding and finishing operation along with your cow-calf enterprise, that is up to you and what you can handle. For each you will need to make or purchase extra feed, set aside land, have more machinery and manage your background or finisher herds in a different manner than you would for your cow-calf herd.


In order to manage a backgrounding/finishing operation, you need to remember you are managing for growth and average daily gain, not for pounds per calf weaned.

, Your cows cannot live forever and need to be culled or may suddenly die on you for whatever reason. Replacement heifers are there for you to use as new breeding females for your cow-calf herd, and need to be selected for various traits including but not limited to maternal ability, growth, calving ease, and pounds per calf weaned.


You should try to manage your replacement heifers like you do with your cow herd, not like you do with stocker or backgrounder cattle, since, after all, they are growing into cows, not feeder steers.
If you are a purebred operation, you will need to also manage those heifers that you are planning to sell the way you would manage your replacements. It's not uncommon for ranches to raise purebred heifers to sell the same way they'd raise their heifers for their own cowherd.

, Your heifers, cows and bulls may have to be culled from herd and sold. Culling is simply taking out undesirable animals from your herd with the intention of improving your base herd. Cattle may be culled for: bad temperament, poor conformation, maternal issues (heifer or cow refuses to accept calf, undesirable milking ability), lack of forage efficiency, health issues (Johnes disease, chronic bloat), lack of teeth, breedability (cows/heifers come up open , bull fails semen test, cows and heifers had prolapsed vagina), injuries (bull has broken penis, cow has lameness issues that can't be fixed with antibiotics), etc.

, There are several options you can use to wean calves off of cows and heifers, from pre-conditioned weaning to on-the-truck weaning, the latter being more stressful for both cows and calves than the other.

, This includes those animals that need to be culled, excess stock including the weaned calves, heifers and steers that have finished the backgrounding or stocker phase, or cattle that have been finished and are being sold to be slaughtered. You will need to decide to sell your cattle through private-treaty or the auction. Either way you will be selling your cattle under a $/lb or $/cwt basis.


Exceptions are if you are a purebred seedstock operation and you are selling purebred bulls and heifers to other producers.

, There is more to your cows than having them able to be bred and raise a calf, they have to be cared for and managed in such a way that they are in good health, good body condition and are getting sufficient minerals and nutrients in the forage they have access to.


Perform body condition scoring of cows after calves have been weaned as well as preg-checking to verify if they have been bred or not.

, Like with the cows in the step above, your bulls also need to be in good condition and good health in order to be ready to breed for the next season. They need a sufficient diet to recover from breeding season and to help maintain their fertility.

, As mentioned previously, your cows (and cattle) will not live forever. There will be instances on your operation that cows, calves, bulls, steers and heifers will die, and it's your responsibility to properly dispose them according to local laws.

, You may be the type of ranch that likes to stick with the old ways of doing things, including using horses and dogs to herd and work cattle. You need to look after your horses so that they're in good health and sound condition to work cattle when needed, and the same with your stock dogs. Though they are work animals, they don't have to be not treated as part of the family either.


Even if you do choose to go the way of the traditional way of ranching and ""punching"" cows, note that many ranchers have not gone without having some form of handling facilities to work their herd with, including those that choose to keep to tradition.

Handling facilities are such that can take cattle from the pasture or range and put them through the sorting pens, working alley, crowding pen or tub, the working chute, then to the squeeze chute. If they're being loaded up to be taken some place off the ranch or being shipped to the auction, they are moved down a different or adjoining chute to the loading ramp/chute to go onto the trailer.



, However, nothing is the same from year to year. Like with farmers, ranchers are always working according to changes in the environment and weather and are heavily influenced by these changes. Weather, climate, and land are just a few factors that cannot be changed in your ranch operation but must simply be worked with and managed around. Calving season, breeding season, the breed or breeds of your cows and bulls, when to sell and when to wean are liable to change and are of your choice to change. Markets, weather and consumer preferences are not. Your management decisions are never set in stone in a ranching operation either––you always have to be flexible and ready to learn how to turn lemons thrown at you into lemonade.


A business plan is not set in stone either, and is one that's prone to change. If you haven't created one already, it would be a great idea to do so, so that you can clearly see what your goals are and where you are in your business.

, Ranching is a way of life, no doubt, as well as a business, but it shouldn't be the very thing that completely rules your life. Don't forget to take some time for yourself and your family when you can, even if it's for a few hours or a couple of days. A change of scenery always helps clear your mind of all the work that needs to be done on the ranch and gives you a chance to even take a little break.


Do a deal with a neighbouring rancher that lets each of you take care of the ranch in the absence of the other for short periods of time. This will let both of you find the opportunity to take a well-deserved break now and then.

As the auction begins, listen to the auctioneer closely and note the animals or group of animals that are being run through.,
See the auction through.,
If you got what you want, then arrange to take them home if you haven't the equipment to take them home yourself.",How to Buy Cattle at an Auction," It is usually best to choose local sale-barns to find what you're looking for, however there's nothing wrong with going for a distant auction mart to find some ideal cattle to purchase. Where you want to go depends on what cattle you are looking to buy, as well as the prices they are going to be selling them at. Some sale barns sell cattle at a cheaper or expensive price than others, and others sell more variety of breeds than others.


If you're looking to buy some bred females or cow-calf pairs, the best auction to go through is a herd dispersal sale. This is where usually the best females are sold. Any other auction may be potential for you purchasing someone else's problems.;
, Most cattle are sold on a $/lb or $ per cwt (hundred weight or one hundred pounds) basis, where total price depends on the weight of the animal. Prices will reflect the health status, body condition and the presence of certain necessities as horns or ""extra ear"" like you would find with Brahman-type cattle. Prices will decrease if any of the cattle are poor in health, has bad temperament, thinner than normal, have horns, or have that extra ear (this is an exception for areas that encourage the use of Brahman-type cattle). Colour may also have an effect on prices: Expect black cattle (especially Angus) to go for more than other coloured cattle.


The owner selling will have an influence on prices because they know the history of the animals they are selling, from health to temperament.
Cattle are docked if they have horns because of the safety issue associated with cattle having horns. Horns are dangerous and are well known to causing serious injuries to both humans and other animals.
Prices differ from week to week, and fluctuate on a 10-year cycle. It's recommended to keep an eye on changes in prices and try to predict what the best prices may be for purchasing cattle without risking spending too much money.

, What terms are used depends on where you are purchasing cattle from. Steers and heifers should be obvious, but feeders, canners, cutters and bologna bulls (also called ""butcher bulls"") are not. The first is for cattle that have been just weaned and are being raised on forage for beef. Canners and cutters are old cows that are sold to be slaughtered as hamburger and/or pet food. The latter refers to old or rank bulls that have worn out their use as breeding animals and are to be sold for slaughter.


Cows, especially in Canada may be called D1 or D2 cows, still referring to the same as above, except that it refers to meat quality, not its ultimate destination. Same type of cattle may also be called ""butcher cows"" and ""heiferettes.""
You may also come across terms like first-calf heifers, heiferettes, first-calvers, feeder bulls, cow-calf pairs (or 3-in-1's), bred cows, bred heifers, dairy steers/calves, etc. All such terms define the type, sex/gender, and class of cattle to buy. For example, ""heiferettes"" are generally older heifers that are not bred but raised for slaughter. Cow-calf pairs or 3-in-1's are cows that are pregnant with a calf at side. First-calvers or first-calf heifers usually mean a heifer that has calved for the first time. Occasionally some places may define such animals as heifers that came from a first-time-calving cow.

, Don't go into an auction mart and think you're going to want to buy something just because it's there or you want to have it. You need to know what you want to buy and what price you're willing to pay for it. Just be careful to not to over- or underestimate the kind of prices a certain pair or a group of cattle will go at.

, This is especially necessary if you don't know what to expect at a livestock sale or what animals you should be looking out for in terms of what to and what not to purchase. This friend can help you point out the animals that are more sickly-looking, or have the kind of temperament that you may not be able to handle.

, Calmly walk around and study the animals that have been sorted into each pen and assess whether they have the potential to be a good purchases for you or not. Note body condition scores, conformation (if applicable--especially if you're wanting to buy breeding animals), health status, temperament, and number of like animals in the pen that are likely going to be sold in the auction.


All pens will have a number associated with them. Note what numberof the pens you find the type of animals you are interested in so that you know what are going to be bidding for when the auction begins. All pens usually have a lot number (i.e., Lot #12) attached.

, You will need this if you are going to have a hope of purchasing some of the animals you want. You will need to purchase this at the front desk or service counter where current market prices are viewed and where a lot of the accounting work is done.


Your ticket usually has a number on it. This is to identify you as a bidder when the auction goes on and you are going to get into a ""bidding war"" with a number of other individuals that may be interested in the same animalas you.

, Sit where the auctioneer can see you and where you can see the animals being run through, as well as where you can see other bidders, although the latter isn't as important as the first two. Relax and note the kind of other people around that you are likely to be bidding against.

, If the lot number you are interested comes up and the auctioneer opens with a high number, don't stick your hand up (nor make eye contact nor nod at the sales guys down below) with your number until he lowers it to the lowest price the animals should go to. Stick to the highest price you want to bid at, and don't go over it if you think it's too far and above what you are asking for. If a lot is going for more than you want it for, don't stick up your hand nor nod or make eye contact with the sellers.


Be calm and as unemotional as possible. You need to not get overly excited or anxious in the sale as the other bidders you're going against will see this as a weakness and try their best to outdo you. Don't even act remotely excited if a group of cattle get sold to you.

, The results of an auction can go two ways: either a lot will get sold to you, or not. It all depends on how hard you're bidding, whether you're bidding at all and what price the animals eventually get sold at. If you get what you want, great! If not, then there's always another sale and another set of cattle to bid on.

, Hopefully you will have everything arranged prior to their arrival, including feed, water, shelter, and a good fenced-in area where you can keep them for the next couple weeks to allow them to get accustomed to their new home.

Choose your cow-calf type operation accordingly.,
Choose your breed.,
Find a good reputable breeder or someone who is selling the kind of cattle you're looking for.,
Look at the breeder/seller's cattle.,
Ask questions.,
Go back home and make your decision.,
Pass up or pay up.",How to Choose Cattle for a Foundation Herd," Look at what you're capable of and what you want to achieve when you buy cattle. Are you ready to take on the responsibilities of a seedstock/purebred breeder? Or would you rather start on the easy route that involves buying cows to sell calves at the end of every year?



Purebred or Seedstock cow-calf operations involve starting with and ending with superior parent stock in order to sell top-quality bulls and heifers that other producers want or need for their herds. Knowledge in genetics, EPDs (expected progeny differences), conformation, marketing, financing, record keeping, among other things, is crucial if you want to have a purebred operation. With these types of operations, you get to choose your favorite breed and improve on it and use it as a selling point to other breeders.

Commercial cow-calf operations involve starting with average to good parent stock that can be purebred, straight-bred or crossbred in order to produce calves that are sold to the beef market. You're not doing nearly as much marketing, campaigning and record keeping as purebred breeders are, but you've still got to sell your calves and keep track of your herd's progress. With commercial operations, you can start with any breed or crossbred you like, with the outcome to produce calves, with good weaning or yearling weights, to be sold to the beef market.;
, Where you live, your climate, seasons, terrain, and vegetation zone are primary factors that will affect your decisions on choosing what cows you want. Some things to consider include:


Look for cows that are low maintenance, maintain good condition on forage alone, have very little to no calving problems, good conformation (udder and feet most important), good temperament, and have good mothering ability.
Choose cows that will do well in your climate and on the kind of vegetation you will have them on; they have to not just survive, but to thrive. Also choose your breeds on what your personal preferences are, what local markets are looking for, coat colour, horns/polled, etc.

, A purebred breeder may be the best place to start for any beginner cattle-person.


Find a breeder that has been in the business for at least 20 years, and one that reflects how you're going to care for and raise your cattle.

, Ask if you can come over to look at his or her cows and other animals for sale, and take pictures of them. Study them later in the comfort of your home, to see how the animals match up as far as conformation and body condition is concerned.

, Ask questions about health history, what and how they've been fed over the years, how they've been raised, average weight of the cows, weaning weight of the calves, breeding, EPDs, and so forth. Make a list of questions to ask before you go over there so you don't forget anything you ""should have"" or ""could have"" asked. Check off each question as you get an answer, so that you're sure you've covered all you wanted to know.

, Study all the pictures you took as thoroughly as you can, and read and answer all the questions that you remember you asked the breeder. Maybe log on to one of the cattle forums on the web like Cattle Today, Ranchers,Backyardherds, or HomesteadingToday, or any other one you come across (the original author this article highly recommends going to first, to get other cattlefolk's opinions on the quality and kind of cows you are getting.

, Contact the seller to let them know if you're wanting to bring them home, or if you've decided to go look somewhere else. Naturally, be polite about it. If you decided those are what you're looking for, great! Welcome to the world of raising cattle! If not, then keep looking, as you will eventually come across the ones you want. Good luck with your purchase and future herd!

Place the calf in a warm, safe and secure area.,
Buy proper nursing and feeding supplies as soon as possible.,
Bottle or bucket-feed the calf every two to three hours until it is a few days old.,
Offer clean fresh water to the calf at all times.,
Feed the calf a ration of high-quality calf feeds.,
Talk to a vet about what sort of vaccinations and vitamin/mineral injections are needed for the calf.,
Keep the area where the calf is clean.,
Watch the calf closely for any signs of illness.,
Keep up with feeding, nursing and caring for the calf, and soon it will be time to wean him and watch him grow into a healthy bovine!

",How to Care for an Orphan Calf," Any place that provides shelter for the calf away from inclement weather or other animals will be sufficient. A barn with a small pen inside is sufficient. A calf hutch, be it bought or made, is also good for the calf. The fence should be enough so the calf cannot escape should he decide to wonder away for a little bit.


Make sure you pack the ground with straw for the calf to sleep on (applicable to those who calve in the winter or early spring). Do not simply put a calf in a barn without any sort of bedding. Calves are much more susceptible to cold than cows are, and a thick bed of straw will keep the calf nice and warm.
For those calves born in the summer, he should have an area where he will be shaded from the sun for most of the day. However, calves also need their Vitamin D, so don't devoid him completely of any access to any sunny areas the calf might like to sleep in.;
, Colostrum should be priority and should be on-hand before you get any other supplies. Powdered colostrum can be obtained at a local feed store or your local large animal veterinarian.


You must feed the calf colostrum within 24 to 72 hours after birth. Any time after and the calf is more subject to illnesses and diseases that could easily kill it.

Colostrum needs to be fed once every 2 to 3 hours. Depending on the weight of the calf, you need to feed one or two quarts per feeding. If the calf will not take the bottle right away, then you will have to use an esophageal feeder to feed the calf, especially if it is weak from the cold or from a difficult birth.

If the young calf is hungry, it will accept the bottle right away, especially if you give it a taste of milk by rubbing milk formula over its nose and in its mouth. Young calves that haven't been suckling at their dams are the quickest learners. Older calves are much harder to get to accept the bottle because they have become accustomed to suckling from their mothers.





, Between that time you can slowly change the milk formula from colostrum to normal calf-milk formula. After that you can start feeding the calf three times a day: morning, noon and night. Make sure you give the calf 10% of his body weight in milk per day.


As the calf gets older, the number of feedings per day can start to decrease. Decrease to twice a day when the calf reaches a month old, then once a day when the calf reaches a little over 2 months old. Bottle calves are typically weaned from the bottle by the time they are 3 to 4 months old.

, Keep a bucket available that the calf cannot turn over. Calves are always curious, and they soon figure out that that clear liquid stuff in the pail is good to drink.

, Special formulated calf-starter diets can be purchased at your local feed store, and are good to get a calf started on to help him grow. These feeds are high in protein, calcium, phosphorus, energy and other important nutrients that he needs for growth.


Also let the calf have access to high-quality hay. Make sure you feed-test the hay to ensure it is the high quality that it looks, because quite often hay that looks like is good is mere gut-filler, even if it is green. The hay should be 60% legume (alfalfa or clover) and 40% grass.

, Depending on the health and age of the calf and where you are located, certain injections that a newborn needs include Vitamin A, D and E, Selenium (only for Selenium-deficient areas!), etc.


More vaccinations will be needed if you did not vaccinate your cows for illnesses such as scours, or if you did not feed the calf the colostrum from his mother. Certain vaccinations need to be done when the calf is 2 to 3 months of age, which also often require boosters.

, Replace soiled straw every day with fresh straw, and use a fork and shovel (or one of those forks specially designed for mucking out horse's stables) to remove any feces or soiled straw. Also check to see if any ""accidents"" were made in the calf's feed area, and remove any soiled feed if you see any.

, If your calf develops scours (calf diarrhea), infection (i.e., joint ill or navel ill), respiratory problems, or anything that seems out of the ordinary, call a vet.


It's easy to over-react when you hear your calf cough for some reason or other. Sometimes coughing or sneezing comes from a little bit of feed it got caught in its throat or he inhaled too much dust or feed by accident. If the coughing or sneezing is not regular, then it is nothing to worry about. If he's coughing all the time and develops other symptoms, then it's time to call the vet.
Not keeping regular scheduled feedings will cause a calf's stomach to get upset and make him get scours. Keeping a routine will prevent this.
Check the calf for ticks, fleas, lice and other bugs that can spread disease. Spray to alleviate flies and mosquitoes as well.

Bring the cattle home.",How to Buy Cattle," You need to already know what breed, age, weight, class and type of cattle you're looking for. The type of cattle you're looking for determines what breed (or composite) you're interested in.


Type = beef or dairy.
Class = age/sex group for a particular kind of livestock, in this case cattle. Classes for sale cattle include the following:

Bulls: bull calf, weaner/weanling bull, yearling bull, 2-year old bull, mature bull, bologna bull
Cows: bred cow, open cow, three-in-one (cow bred with calf at side), cutter cow, canner cow, slaughter cow.
Heifer: bred heifer, feeder heifer, open heifer, heiferette, weaned heifer, heifer calf
Steer: feeder steer, dairy steer, steer calf


Weight is always approximate, rounded to 100 pounds (45 kg).
A word about breeds with large horns: Be aware that large horns mean an increased risk of harming yourself when handling the cattle, as well as intimidating other animals including horses. Be sure you want to own cattle with large horns; they look good but they're harder to transport and to tether.;
, This is always important, as you don't want to be buying an animal that you can't pay up front right away. It's also important to have a firm limit in mind when attending an auction, to avoid getting carried away.


Of course if you don't have the money right on hand, you will have to make arrangements to pay later, preferably as soon as possible so you don't forget.

, You have two main options: private sale, or auction. Wherever you wish to buy is your choice. Just remember that the auction (located at a local auction mart or ""sale barn"") is usually for selling culled or slaughter-only animals. You will need to be very vigilant and not wear your heart on your sleeve when picking and choosing which animalto bid on and ultimately buy. You also won't be able to talk to or even get to know the owner of the animals going through the auction ring. There are exceptions, though. Farm or herd-dispersal auctions quite often are those that sell quality breeding stock to other producers to purchase. The cows, heifers and bulls being sold are what the owner had worked hard to raise and, because of retirement or switching to a different enterprise, a choice to sell them via auction is the best solution. And many auction marts or sale barns sell weaned steers that are quite healthy, though their destination is to be turned into beef, not as breeding stock. Private-treaty may be the best choice, as you have a chance to look at and study the animals you are wanting to buy and to talk to the owner as well if you have any questions. It also means a much reduced potential for exposure to disease that would occur in a generalized place of sale.


Other places for purchasing cattle include breed registry or the breeders' websites, state, province or county fairs, online auction sites/forums/email lists (buyer beware), local media and magazines, and possibly your local veterinarian/agricultural teacher/other professionals involved in agriculture.

, Phone the owner to explain that you're interested in coming over to look at his or her animals. Ask what time and date you should be expected to be there. For the auction you will have to phone the auction mart to get times on sale dates and what cattle are being sold on what date.

, You should be able to get a look at the other animals the owner has on his/her farm to see the overall condition and health they're in. Ask questions about breed, breeding, calving, weaning, age, health history, etc.
For the auction, you should be able to have a look at the cattle in their pens prior to the start of sale, and when they go through the ring to make a quick judgement call on whether they're worth buying or not. Particular signs to look for include:


Eyes: Should be bright, clear and not runny (no discharge), crusty or bloodshot.
Nose: Should be cool, moist muzzle, with frequent licking; breathing should be regular, and not labored; beware of nasal discharge, coughing, wheezing or irregular/shallow breathing.
Coat: Glossy, clean and generally unmatted (especially for long-haired breeds), free of extensive ""tag"" or dried feces over the body (exceptions can be made if there's some tag on the rump, though tails covered in tag need to be questioned); beware of hair coats that appear mangy with some or a lot of hair-loss, have crusty lesions (typically ring-worm), or appear dull and/or dry.
Weight: Cattle should look to be at their average weight for their breeding; beware of severely emaciated or thin cattle (even with dairy cattle; if you can plainly see their ribs they're likely undernourished), or overly fat ones. Note, though, that judging body condition can be subjective.
Attitude: Curious, alert and contented; beware of cattle that stand apart from the herd, seem disinterested in you, or show signs of aggressiveness, no matter how subtle those signs are. Check the location of the whorl on the forehead––the lower the whorl, the less flighty the animal.Mobility: Walking should be smooth and free of limps, legs and feet should look normal and free of sores, swelling, or lesions; beware of uneven gaits or subtle signs of injury by how the animal stands and walks on. Placement of hind feet to front feet is especially important with breeding stock, but not so much with stock being raised for meat.
Udder (for dairy/breeding): It should be healthy; size isn't necessarily an indicator of a good udder, but rather placement of both front and hind ligaments. It should sit forward and square, not sag too much either in the front and rear quarters, and not be too meaty (or appear to have too many fat deposits). Observe the cow when she walks––the udder should not show too much sideways movement. Teats should be small and neatly grouped under the udder, not too large and/or sticking at odd angles.

, It is helpful to know what is a good price for the animals that are being sold beforehand to avoid getting ripped off (paying more than what they're worth) or worse. Most cattle sold by private treaty are either sold according to current prices on a $/cwt (one hundred weight) basis, except for purebred stock, which may be a little more expensive. In the auction, you have to have a maximum price you can bid up to for a particular animal, and keep bidding until either it gets sold to you, or the price is too high for you to bid on.


If the animalaren't worth your time or not to your expectations, neither buy nor bid on them. For buying cattle one-on-one, tell the owner you're just shopping around and exchange other small talk, then say a friendly ""thanks for letting me look at your animals.""
When negotiating the price, don't just think about cash and cattle. Also request expertise as part of the price, namely, the ability to call the owner for a set time in the future to ask questions or seek help, especially where problems might arise.
Ask to see––and then check––the relevant registration papers before signing for purchase. Also ask to see vaccination, de-worming and production records.

, If they're worth it, and the owner and you agree on a price for them, buy them. When paying for the cattle, don't bring your credit card, debit card or any other card with you. Cash or cheque (check) is best for this sort of purchase. Most auctions are an exception though, as normally they will accept debit or even credit cards, in addition to cash or cheque (check).


Ask if there is a guarantee. Not all sellers are willing to give this but where the seller is, get it in writing.

, Normally the person buying the livestock should have a trailer to take them home in. If you don't have a trailer as of yet, you can arrange with the seller to haul them home for you. Once home, settle them into their new surrounds gradually, feeding them well and keeping a close eye on them for the first few days until they seem contented.


Always have a separate area set up for new cattle being brought home. This gives them a chance to acclimate to their new space, see your existing cattle without actually having to meet them immediately and generally feel comfortable while settling in.
If bringing home a bottle calf, have his or her milk replacement ready.
If this is your first time for owning cattle, already know who your vet will be and have his or her contact details somewhere easily accessible. Also, have a halter and lead, adequate food, grooming gear and appropriate shelter.

Start off by gathering your bottles.,
Now that the bottles are ready, start cutting!,
Bend each slit piece backwards so that they take on a petal like shape.,
Using a paint kit or any color substitutes (nail polish does it just right as well), paint each petal to your liking, both above and below.,Drill a hole in the corks of the ""flowers"", just slightly larger than the diameter of the fairy bulbs so that they fit perfectly into the corks without sliding out.,
Finally, secure your flowers unto the fairy bulbs and put the switch on!",How to Make Creative Flowers from Water Bottles for Fairy Lights," You would want to make sure you have just enough to accommodate the number of fairy bulbs you will be decorating with flowers. Be sure that all the bottles have their caps on because they play an important part in this making. Using clear water bottles would produce an even better outcome after the colors are added, however, bottles of other colors can be used.
,

Cut the bottles just a few inches above the cap or any measurement suitable, depending on the size of flower you desire.
Take into consideration the size of the fairy bulbs as well. You wouldn't want the two to be out of proportion. Now you have what looks like a champagne glass with no base.
Carefully, make slits from the top of the ""champagne glass"" to the cap of the bottle. Five to six slits should be enough.

, Make sure they remain bent backward. At this point your newly formed petals have square, sharp edges. Very neatly, cut the edges round so as to create an actual petal shape and to eliminate sharp edges., Your flowers can each have a different color or each petal can differ in color. Leave them to dry after painting.,, The colors of the lights against the colors of the petals would have you not regretting one minute spent making those flowers."

Get a box that can fit all your items.,
With your box (it should be big) find a spot to bury the capsule.

,
Decorate the box if you are hiding it.

,
Put your name and date you buried/hide it on the box.

,
Write a letter to the finder of the time capsule or to yourself.

Everything you do in your life should reflect the goodness of God. Show positivity, smile, and do good works.Don’t talk behind other people’s backs. Be kind to all people, including those who aren’t popular. Love thy neighbor as thyself. Walk the walk, don’t just talk the talk.
Be a leader. Don’t participate or laugh at sinful stuff. Just walk away. But also try to get people to stop doing it. If you see bullying occurring, intervene. Be the one person at your school that doesn't tolerate cussing or gossip.
Don’t drink, smoke, party, cheat on tests, gossip or engage in other negative behaviors. Be someone who spends Friday night on their knees in prayer rather than at a party getting wasted.;
, If people can't tell you're a Christian by your actions and words, you're doing it wrong. You need to live every single day with the right attitude.


Love others and be willing to help them even at cost to yourself.This is a fundamental commandment that Jesus gave during his time on Earth. To love others as you love yourself is so important. Don’t let ego and status stop you from treating others as you would your own brothers and sisters.
Don't be close minded. Love all people of all religions, races, sexual orientations, beliefs. Don't swear or speak about inappropriate things. You can't make a positive difference if you are cursing or making dirty jokes. Be respectful, honorable, and pure.
Set an example of Christianity every day at work or school, or both. Be humble, kind, patient, and respectful when engaging with non-Christians.

, Jesus showed love to people who were treated negatively by others or regarded lowly by society. Never give up on someone, and especially never give up on God, in the good times and the bad.


You will encounter islands in school and other settings. This means there are people who only hang out with certain people because they don't know anyone else and won't make an effort to know anyone else. It is something everyone does. You need to step up and be a bridge, which means stepping out of your comfort zone.
You can sit with someone who sits alone at lunch and just be a friend. Or you could lend a listening ear to them. Building a personal relationship is a great first step to leading someone to Christ. A subtle but effective way to spread faith is to plant seeds and allow the Holy Spirit to take root within others.
You have the relationships with the people around you already, and you can be the one who encourages them, offers prayers, and lives out the Bible so as to be an example of God's love and grace. Treat everyone as an equal. Whatever their status in life or profession, remember that all people are God's creation and deserve a chance to be understood.

, You should be happy to do the good deeds you do. However, it can be more challenging to show a positive attitude when you are rejected or otherwise face negativity in your life.


When confronted about your beliefs, don't freak out. Remember that everyone has a different story as to how they became a Christian, whether it was a dramatic conversion or they just grew up in it, but no matter how you became a Christian, it's your firsthand account. Tell people why you believe what you believe even if they ridicule you for it.Turn the other cheek. If someone is rude to you or cruel, show them forgiveness and love. Forgiveness is a Christian trait. We are all born sinners, and we all struggle and we all fall at times. Don’t let that discourage you. If someone’s hurt you, find a way to forgive.
When you fall, forgive yourself too, and pick yourself back up and try again. What matters to God is how many times you stand up. Strive to grow in a positive way. You are unique, you have your own gifts, talents, strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes. Grow the positive aspects of your personality.

, Continue to study and learn about your faith as you get older. Know that even adults still work on the tough questions.


Come to youth group with a heart that wants to learn. People will notice a change in your group. Start answering questions and step out of your comfort zone. Once you step out of your comfort zone, others will start to step out of theirs.Spouting verse is all well and good, but understanding the deeper meaning behind it all, how it fits into the entire narrative of the Bible, is more important. You can say ""God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son..."" (John 3:16), but until you can show that same love to others, it's difficult for others to see the positive change caused by your faith.

, You could try to read a scripture a day. God’s word is vital to a Christian life because it provides guidelines. You could also listen to podcasts or watch YouTube videos on your faith.


Ask questions. You won’t know everything. There are many Christians who have studied faith for their whole lives, but they still don’t know everything. Keep in mind that historical context, language, translation, context or meaning can matter when reading Christian teachings.
Seek out older religious teachers and show them great respect, such as a pastor or priest or a Sunday school teacher. Ask them to help you learn more about your faith. Make sure that you keep involved in a Bible study, preferably involving kids your age. This is much more effective in helping you learn and relate to the Bible than attending only traditional worship services.

, You can simply start off by saying, “God, I do not know what to do, but I have this desire in my heart to make a difference.” God doesn’t care what you say to Him. He just loves to listen to you.You could start a prayer journal so that you can remember what you prayed for and then see how God has answered your prayers. Don’t forget to pray for others too, not just for yourself.
You should attend church as much as you can and ask your parents if they can drive you. Try memorizing some important prayers and saying them before you go to bed and every meal. Just take time out of your day to relax and think about God, what are you thankful for and what you did wrong and could improve.
Ask God what to do through prayer. God knows all your abilities, strengths, and weaknesses and he knows what’s right for you to do to make a difference. Don't let your age or comfort zones get in the way of doing what God calls you to do.

, Maybe you start out by collecting spare change or donating your allowance. Find a worthy cause, and help collect donations for it. Or just give whatever money you have to a good cause.You could use an online donation site. You can also help by joining or helping a cause that revolves around helping people know about God and His Word; there are many organizations that cater to the needs of less fortunate people all across the world as well as teach them about Christ.
Perhaps you do car washes or lemonade stands. Sell your old books. It’s not necessarily how much you donate that counts. It’s the fact you’re giving most or all of what you have that matters.

, This is another way that you can give back: By getting involved with group activities associated with your church. Try to get involved in your local church's mission trips, whether they are around the world, national, or local. If your church does not have these types of trips, you could bring the idea to the congregation.Try tithing (giving 10% of your money to your church), or donating some of the stuff you don't use anymore. Inviting your friends to church or youth group are great ideas too.
Don’t treat youth group like school, and don’t act like it bores you. Dedicate yourself to God, and show this by always staying happy and cheerful and giving what you can to the group. You could also start/join a Christian club at your school (if it's allowed)
Remember that a mission doesn't have to be across an ocean. You could go on a mission trip to a local college or high school and help out staff with some church friends and talk about Jesus to anyone willing to listen.

, At times, this might be very difficult. You might feel like the only Christian youth around who is open about faith. Stand your ground. Actively develop your relationship with Christ. Get out and interact with people and develop relationships.Christian youth are ambassadors, not secret agents. In order to change people's hearts, you first need to interact with them. Be as outward as possible about your faith. You could wear shirts that spark conversations.
Stand up for and voice your moral beliefs. You can do this in a way that sounds positive, not negative. Be willing to stand up for what you believe in. Be a witness to what God has done for you as a Christian. A lot of young people have some, little, or absolutely no faith in God whatsoever. By being walking proof about what the word has to offer, you are making a difference somewhere.

, You could help the homeless, take care of an elderly or disabled person, or work at an animal shelter. Help at your church, school, and in your home too.


You can also give back in smaller ways by simply being a positive force in your environment. Help classmates with schoolwork out of class, for example. You can organize park cleanups or volunteer for blood drives.
Help your church. Basically just volunteer to help your church. It could be something as simple as holding the door for people visiting your church. You could offer to clean up after the services.

, This doesn’t mean that you try to push your beliefs on others. However, if someone asks you about what keeps you strong in all you do, gently tell them you believe in God, and you put all your worries/fears/pain onto God so that you can help others with theirs.


Also don't be afraid to share your testimony- talk to your youth minister/pastor about opportunities to share your story, and where you can help within the church. The important thing to remember is that simply letting people know you are a Christian can sometimes be enough as long as you are happy and friendly and don't force anything down anyone's throat.
It’s a good idea to let more people know that God has their back if you perceive that a person is struggling and receptive to the message. However, understand that being a Christian is not about showing up other religions. Christianity is a peaceful and loving religion. Learn to love the people around you for who they are and that you cannot change them by shoving a Bible down their throat. If you want to show how Christianity has made you a better person, be kind to those around you regardless of their beliefs.

Shower daily!",How to Look Beautiful in Middle School (Girls)," Find something you think is beautiful about yourself and flaunt it! Do you have gorgeous hair? Leave it down on your shoulders. Dazzling eyes? Brighten them with mascara. Elegant figure? Wear clothes that flatter your shape. Choose something that you find pretty about yourself to accentuate, and draw attention away from things you don't like.;
, Do you have large hips? Wear a black dress or a belt. Do you have heavy thighs? Wear a bold printed top. Do you have a smaller bustline? Wear some colored skinny jeans. If there's something that you don`t like about your body, you can mask it, but just remember to have confidence.

, Are you girly? Wear floral patterns, pastel colors, skirts and dresses. Preppy? Try polos, chinos, capris, knee lengths skirts and dresses and oxfords. Edgy? Leather jackets, miniskirts, short tight dresses, band tees, lace skirts and skinny jeans. Shop at stores that sell clothes that you like, not just trends. Dress to flatter your body and dress for the season. You wouldn't want to be caught in the snow in a miniskirt would you?

, Don't wear too much makeup or too tight or short clothes. You're just a kid, after all. A lot of girls wear too much makeup, super trendy clothes and high heels just fit in. But if that's not who you are, don't be it! Express yourself! If you like music, wear guitar earrings. If you like art, wear paint splattered jeans. Be yourself! There's only one you, so be it.

, Don't stop taking showers, washing your hair and wearing deodorant because you're ""being yourself"" or ""making a statement"". It's unhealthy. Take showers and wash everywhere.


Shave if you're allowed and it's necessary. Don't shave just to shave. However, you might wish to. shave if you're wearing, shorts, a dress, a skirts, or it's a special occasion.
Wash your hair as frequently as you think you need to. If you are unsure, ask your hairdresser, your mom or even a trusted friend (with healthy hair).
Get a trim every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends and avoid heat styling as much as possible.
Brush your teeth, use mouthwash, and floss three times everyday. Any less than that is unhealthy. Get routine dental checkups to make sure everything is in tip-top shape.
Use deodorant, antiperspirant, or combination every morning and after P.E. You can use perfume if you want, but just a bit.

, If she says yes, don't wear too much. For middle school, wear: Mascara, chap stick, light lip gloss, and concealer. Don't overdo it, you are in middle school and you will look fake.

, Body language is the way we communicate to people without words. Use kind, open, warm and inviting body language. There is nothing people hate more than a rude, snotty, ""thinks she`s above the world"" kind of girl. When you sit, plant your feet firmly on the ground and place your hands in your lap. Avoid crossing your arms or sitting sloppily, lazily, or not being involved. It makes people think you can't be bothered to talk to them, and that's the last thing you want.

, When people are talking to you, make eye contact with them. It lets them know that you're paying attention and listening to them. Try to break eye contact occasionally, or else it's creepy. Also don`t make with people having a conversation that you're not part of, or else there going to think you're snooping.

, Teachers appreciate it when students pay attention during their lesson. It lets them know they're doing there job. Also, if they ask questions, raise your hands. But only if you know the answer because they call on you, you could wind up super embarrassed.

, Don't care what people think about you. Just have fun! Just remember, you have friends who like you for who you are, so who cares what those snobs think about you!

, Don't look down on people who are different then you are. They are just expressing themselves just like you are. Also, don't pick fights with ""popular"" people for making fun of you. If you get into a fight with them, you are just as bad as they are. The best thing to do would be to just walk away. Be the bigger person.

, Don't be afraid to be bold. If someone dares you to do something, as long as it's safe, do it! Try bungee jumping, rock climbing, skydiving or scuba diving.

, Do your homework and be safe. However, don`t be a nag. If you see someone doing something wrong, quietly walk of and tell someone in authority Don`t go up to them and tell them off.

, It is more fun to be behaved than not, don't get into trouble.

, Decorate your room with posters and cute pillows and blankets. Decorate your locker with stickers, magnets, whiteboards, pictures, and mirror. When you are in class keep your supplies for your current class (for example. binder and notebook) and put the rest of your stuff in your desk. Clean your room and your locker regularly. It will be much easier to find stuff.

, Get a cellphone, a tablet, an MP3 player (maybe an iPod), a laptop and an Ereader. Get cool cases for all you stuff with thinks like, animals, snacks, and things you like (for example. Minions). Charge your devices regularly. It`s awful when your battery dies when your in the middle of doing your homework on your laptop!

, Get binders, notebooks, pencil cases, folders and caddies in pretty colors and patterns like pink, blue, yellow, orange, and green. Patterns include cats, polka dots, stripes, chevron and cool geometric patterns.

, Do cool activities with your friends and don`t take things to seriously.

, Make sure this matches what you need to fix, whether it's oily skin, dry skin, acne, pimples, or protection against breakouts. If you don't use face cleansers at least once a day, you'll be surprised at how quickly you'll develop skin issues,


If you have sensitive skin, Simple is a fantastic British brand that helps even the most sensitive skin in need of major protection.

, This gives your skin a natural glow and really protects from dirt and grime. Use with caution, however - exfoliating before at least 3 days since your last use can cause breakouts, as your skin is over-exfoliated.

, Find a good brand of moisturizer for your face and put it on daily to protect from any dirt and grime that wants to enter your pores. It also leaves you skin silky-soft and smooth as a bonus, so lather up!


Moisturizer can also be used a base for makeup instead of BB Cream.

, Put lotion on your arms and legs for a natural glowing, smooth texture to your skin. Adding this to your shoulders and neck can also be a good place. In the summer, lotions with built-in UV protection will double as sunscreen without the sticky feel and salty smell.

, Especially in Winter, apply Chapstick every night before you go to bed and when you wake up, and carry one with you throughout the day.

, And if you can't find some for your hair, you must have something really special, because nowadays there's natural heat protectants, hydrators, featherweight, dye protection, natural hair lighteners, etc. You can find practically anything! Just remember not to be afraid to mix and match types. If you have both frizzy and thick hair, combining a featherweight shampoo with a frizz-control conditioner will work amazingly.


Don't use 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner, because while conditioner is meant to stay in your hair for a long period of time, shampoo can only stay in for 10 seconds. It's like dividing by zero - you can't do it, and shouldn't try!

, This means blow dryers, straighteners, crimpers, and curlers/curling irons. Unless you really need it (i.e. a curly piece of hair mixed with straight hair, or a straight piece mixed with a curly piece) or there's a special occasion (i.e. a dance, a wedding, a funeral)


There are plenty of ways to naturally dry, straighten, curl, and crimp your hair. YouTube and WikiHow provide many ways to do so!

, This can permanently damage it and will give your hair an odd texture over time. It's unhealthy for your hair, even if you wash it and use hair-nutritious products in it. Just because it looks nice doesn't mean it'll be nice. Beware!

, Leave-in shampoo keep your hair less frizzy and silky smooth, while leave-in conditioner keeps your hair healthy, frizz-free, and quite soft and manageable. These contain vitamins and nutrients that are essential for hair, and while normal shampoo and conditioner gives them to your hair, it doesn't last the whole day!

, With BB cream, squeeze some onto the center of your forehead, nose, either cheek, and chin. Then, use your fingers to even this out. Don't forget any spots, or you might have a lighter or darker patch of skin!

, Find a foundation that is a bit lighter than your skin tone. When applying, coat the liquid onto problem spots (bumps, acne, red spots, dark eye circles) and spread it with your finger. Don't blend this into your skin, just coat it on while it still is obviously unnatural. Next, apply powder. This powder should match your skin as best as possible. Powder your entire face, even going over your foundation. Going over your foundation with powder is what makes it look natural while it's still caked on.

, This is quite simple - all you have to do is fill in your lips. Use the thick edge to fill in the main part, and the tipped edge to get into the corners of your lips. If your lips are smaller or thin and the lipstick is dark, use the tipped edge to create the shape you want. It seems like it'd look strange, but it's really a fantastic illusion. You'd have to really look close to notice.


Bright colors and nudes are popular in warm seasons, while darker colors are popular in cold seasons.

, You can use clear or black mascara for your top lashes, and clear for your bottoms. Take the brush out of the tube and rub it against the edges. Then position yourself in front of a mirror to monitor what you're doing. Take the mascara brush and sweep it over your eyelashes the same amount of time on either eye. Then, take your brush and hold it vertically, rubbing against your lashes to avoid clumping.


Another way to avoid clumping is to take your brush horizontally and sweep it left-to-right on the tips of your lashes.

, If you're a less developed girl (has not gone through puberty), you can probably get away with showering every other day if needed. Wash your hair with separate shampoo and conditioner, and have a skin-loving, sweet-smelling body wash to put on. Make sure to shave all places necessary (if you don't feel like shaving your arms, this is fine, as many, many girls and women don't do it).


Keep body wash scents by season! Of course this is optional if you have really sensitive skin but, smelling like a tropical forest won't always do in the winter, and smelling a like a candied apple or peppermint chocolate isn't the best option in summer.

Acknowledge that today isn't a good day, but it isn't the end of the world. People go through bad times. They all have times when they don't feel happy, involved, loved, satisfied, enough, etc. Sometimes there is an obvious reason for these moods and days, at other times there isn't. They just can't get going. They wallow, they waste time and they think too much. They bring themselves down. It happens. It doesn't make you a bad person or a failure., Do you want to carry out feeling as you have them? Sometimes, when you hit apathetic days, they can make you feel low and magnify every small problem you have. You may not want to continue this way, so change directions. You don't have to go anywhere but you do have to tell this feeling you are leaving it behind for a while., If you haven't been looking after yourself properly, groom yourself. Try cleaning your teeth or brushing your hair. If you are not dressed, put clothes on. Tell yourself that your day will not be completely wasted. This is an affirmation that motivators and coaches loves., It doesn't have to be a massive thing, but it should be something you perhaps should have done today but haven't., You are going to spend a few minutes trying to achieve whatever you are doing., You are worth it. Something has brought you down to this lazy, apathetic or sad state and you don't want to be like this any longer today. Make yourself active, for just a minute or two. Jump on the spot, wave your arms around, touch your toes, or do anything for just a few minutes in order to get the blood pumping. Go on. Not for long - just for a couple of minutes. Now, go and put some music on., Let that small bit of momentum carry you forward. Go and be - and again, it only has to be for a few minutes - the best person you can be. If no one else is around, go and smile in the mirror. Force a grin., Consider whether there was anyone or anything in particular that has caused your bad feelings, your apathy, or your sadness. Think about it. If someone else is to blame, try to forgive the person at least temporarily. Put whatever is getting to you out of your mind by saying you refuse to think about it right now., It doesn't have to be awesome - it just has to be something you are going to do and something that you will better about doing., Just move towards whatever it is you are going to spend time doing, even if it's something as boring and tedious as the washing-up or clearing something away. You can do this, you can find something to distract you for the next hour or so., Apathy, and sometimes laziness, can bring people down. Too much time spent doing nothing, but thinking lots, doesn't really help them. Oh, people need rest. They all need to reflect on things. But who wants to feel useless, miserable, like a failure, pathetic, moody, etc., for too much of their time?, It goes against all their instincts to move out of that gloomy place. But if they don't learn to kick-start ourselves, life will continue to remain dreary., There is this moment, right now, when people can change things. Don't look back, don't look forward, just change right now. The only one who can do that is you."

Learn as much as you possibly can while you're still young.,
Stay away from unfriendly cliques at school.,
Always be you!,
Do well in school.,
Listen to the thoughts of others.,
Talk to people!,
Make friends.,
Never discriminate against people.,
Avoid making bad choices.",How to Live Life As a Kid," You probably have all sorts of questions coming to mind every day-- try your best to get them answered! Your questions might annoy adults, but you're at an age when your brain is flexible enough to learn things easily. When you get older, it'll be tougher. So go ahead! Ask about leaves, cows, books, dinosaurs, buildings, anything!


To learn new things, have new experiences. Try playing a sport, hanging out with the new kid, or trying a new food.;
, It's natural for people to feel more comfortable around people similar to them. However, this can sometimes lead to distrust and suspicion of ""outsiders."" Stay away from groups that exclude people! You have so many potential friends out there. Why hang out with a group that will chase them away?

, You'll hear this a lot in life, but it's a good rule to follow. The world wouldn't be interesting if everyone acted, dressed, and looked the same-- and people would be miserable in keeping up the act. Let your true self shine and you'll be much happier for it.

, No excuses! Sometimes school seems like a chore, yes, but it's helping you grow and preparing you for your future. Now's the time to create good study habits-- things will get really tough in a few years! Do your best and never sell yourself short for any reason.

, Everyone has a different point of view on a lot of things, but there's no need to fight about it. Listen carefully to others and you may learn a lot about them-- and maybe yourself, too!

, Talking is the first step to new relationships, whether they're friendships or romantic. It's also a great way to learn from people-- try talking to a foreign exchange student or an elder. You never know what you might learn!

, Having friends is healthy. Try to grow at least one close friendship, where you can tell each other secrets and have serious conversations.


As demonstrated by the many wikiHow ""Popularity"" articles, lots of people desire a large group of friends, and that might be true of you. Keep in mind, though, that you only have so much time that you can dedicate to friends; in spreading out this time between friends, you might not have enough time to really bond. If you have a small friend group, there's plenty of time to bond with each.
Choose your friends carefully. The most important things to look for in a friend are trust, respect, loyalty, cooperation, and accountability.

Examples of each: Feeling safe in telling your friend secrets is trust. Knowing your friend treats you well and equally is respect. Knowing your friend will stand up for you is loyalty. Getting along well is cooperation. Knowing they will make good on any promises is accountability.



, Discrimination means avoiding or mistreating someone just because they're from a certain group. You might run into discrimination against women, racial minorities, non-straight people, disabled people, poor people, the elderly, and heavy people. None of these are okay. Surely you're annoyed when someone ignores or makes fun of you for being a kid. How would you feel if you had to deal with that your whole life? Well, that's similar to how people feel when they face discrimination. Keep that feeling in mind.

, You never know how a situation could get out of hand, so it's best to play it safe. Avoid drugs, alcohol, and gangs. These are all things you will always regret in the end.


If you are faced with the ""chicken"" taunt, explain that you're not scared; you're just smart enough to avoid asking for trouble.

Know your limits.,
Look for signs.,
Talk to your friends.,
Accept that some things you just have to grow out of.,
Find a way to embrace your childlike personality.,
Be confident in your choices.,
Ask.",How to Know if You're Too Old for Something," What you can and can't do will change with time and age. Perhaps what you could do at age 6 you can't do at age 16. If you know you are not in the right physical or mental condition to do something, you probably shouldn't do it. You should also avoid doing anything that gets unsafe with a certain size or weight. For example, a plastic kiddie slide may not be able to hold anything that weighs more than 50 pounds and could break if you weigh more. Or if a playground says you must be under 4 feet tall to play, you may risk hitting your head on something if you are taller. Safety should always be your number one concern when deciding if you are too old for something.;
, Labels and signs can often be a deciding factor. For example, a public playground may have a sign that says the equipment was designed for ages 5 to 12, or the packaging of a toy may say it is intended for ages 6 to 16. Those are merely age suggestions, but they can give you hints as to whether or not you are too old for something. While it's perfectly acceptable to play at the playground at 13, it may not be as acceptable at 20. If your age differs by more than 3 to 5 years from the suggestion, it is often a sign that you are too old for that activity.

, Everyone does at least one thing in their lifetime that they think they might be too old for. You never know, maybe your buddies do some of the same activities you love, and you can have fun and be childlike together.

, Remember, there are a few things that you can be too old for, like talking like a three-year-old when you're not one, or whining about how your ice cream's melted. These acts may have been fine when you were younger, but they aren't as you grow into an adult. In fact, they could make people think that you are immature and whiny. Continuing to play and have fun is totally normal and acceptable, but use your common sense; there are certain things you outgrow, and this is part of life. Work on being mature and kind, while still finding ways to do what you love.

, Babysitting is a great way to play, because you can have fun with the children without getting judged. It's more socially acceptable, and you can get paid for it. You could also get a job making video games, acting, or producing toys where the work is fun-spirited too. You don't always have to hide your interests; there's always something out there for you.

, Enjoy dolls and toy cars at 40, or scream your head off at a boy band concert at 50 if that's what you want to do. None of these activities are very dignified, but who cares as long as you respect yourself! Don't worry too much about being too old to enjoy something, because your interests will grow and change at your own pace. You are your own judge; society can't make these decisions for you. Rock your lifestyle choices in your own unique way!

, Some people may do some things that you like that others consider silly. So find someone who likes what you like.

Determine whether or not it is necessary to serve alcohol at the party.,
Try to gauge how many teens will be at the party, and the likelihood of underage drinking.,
If possible, have a bartender or someone who is in charge of dispensing alcoholic beverages.,
Check with the parents of any children or teens.,
Buy child/teen friendly beverages.,
Keep children/teens busy.",How to Keep Teens from Drinking at a Party Where Alcohol is Served," Depending on the type of party or the people there, serving alcohol may not the best choice.;
, If adults outnumber children or teens, the likelihood of drinking will go down because of more supervision. However, be aware this does not guarantee anything, because children and teens can often evade adult supervision.

, Make sure this person only serves alcohol to people age 21 (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) and older.

, See how they feel about alcohol, and what guidelines they have set for their children. You should also tell them that regardless of their attitude towards underage drinking, you will not allow a minor to drink at any of your events.

, Be sure to have plenty sodas and juices on hand for both younger guest and adults. Alcohol-free beer and wine and non-alcoholic cocktails are great for older teens who may find having a soft drink in photographs embarrassing. They will also be a hit with any adults abstaining from alcohol because they are driving or for personal reasons.

, They will be less inclined to get into trouble if they something else to do. Movies and board games work especially well and have a social element. If possible, set up a separate area (with supervision of course) away from alcohol for the younger guests.

Adopt a beginner’s mind.,
Switch up the way you do things.,
Be curious about those you meet.,
Stop worrying about being wrong.",How to Keep a Playful Mindset As an Adult1," Because their knowledge and experience are limited, children often approach activities and situations with a beginner’s mind. You can use this same concept when perceiving the world around you.Open yourself up to new ideas and beliefs by viewing your surroundings through a fresh lens. For example, instead of assuming that you know what someone is about to say, listen actively until their entire message has been delivered.
Let’s say, you are a seasoned horseback rider. It could help to retake lessons or observe a novice learning how to ride. You will undoubtedly learn something new yourself.;
, Adults live by routines, but so much structure can limit your opportunity for growth. Shake up your routine each week by challenging yourself to do things differently.For instance, try to walk backwards. Have dessert for dinner. Eat with the opposite hand. Watch TV in another language. Or, instead of dropping on the couch right after work, do something else like walk your dog or phone your mom.
You can also try a new hobby or a creative activity. Try out something that you might not be good at naturally.

, Some kids have a knack for talking to anyone and everyone. For this reason, they typically don’t have much trouble making new friends. Adults might shy away from conversing with people they perceive as different. Be aware of this shortcoming, and open yourself up to talking to the people around you.For example, start a conversation with the person behind you in line at the store. Ask a retail representative for their advice. Compliment someone on a fashion choice and ask how they would describe their own style.
After you interact with someone new, try asking yourself questions to check in with yourself, such as “How did that go?” and “Did I learn something new?”

, One strength of childhood is no caring if you’re wrong. As you get older, you start to care what people think. As a result, you try to limit your mistakes. However, mistakes help you learn and challenge yourself.Do something without caring about the outcome. Ask your teacher or boss a question without concern about whether you look stupid.
In addition, try taking a course in which you have little knowledge on the subject. Think about something you have always wanted to do but didn't because you worried about your skill level or abilities. Sign up and let go of your worries. If you feel embarrassed about taking a class, then look into online classes.

Try organizing the fight somewhere other than just outside of your house, like a park. It's good to get out of the house sometimes!







, Try buying or checking out books, or getting them to read things other than books, such as magazines or a newspaper. Reading magazines and newspapers helps your children stay informed with what's going on in the world.


Get your children reading some nonfiction books. This is effective in helping them learn, because nonfiction books tend to be based on history, people's lives, etc.







, Try something like melted crayon art, making a box, or anything else you can think of! Crafts are a great way to keep your kids busy and entertained for hours!! Also, try getting your materials before the day you're going to do your craft project, as this makes things easier for you.

, Frozen treats are extremely refreshing during summer months as it's very hot. There are a variety of options, including ice cream, popsicles, smoothies and frozen yogurt.


Try having the children make the treats themselves to keep them busy -- and learn how to make something new!

Try a room divider.,
Use chest of drawers.,
Paint the room different color schemes.",How to Keep the Peace Between Kids Who Share a Room1," Keep conflicts due to lack of personal space and privacy at a minimum by dividing the room evenly. Room dividers are a great way to divide up a space for your kids. You can either use a traditional room divider, or you can turn other pieces of furniture into a room divider. For example, use a tall bookshelf or wardrobe to divide a room.You can also set up a curtain to divide a space. This is especially helpful if a brother and sister share a room together since the curtain ensures privacy.
If your children who are sharing a room have a significant age gap, try using a gate, like a baby gate, to divide the room.;
, If the room is too small for a room divider, you can use a simple set of drawers to divide the room evenly. Place the drawers between your children’s beds. Reinforce the idea that the drawers serve as a boundary between each kids’ side of the room. This may help reduce conflict between children who share a small room.Set up shelves above each child’s bed where they can store their toys and personal belongings.

Administer flea, tick, and heartworm prevention medications as needed.,
Spay or neuter your dog.,
License your dog.",How to Be a Good Dog Owner1," Regular veterinary care is essential to protect your dog’s health, so good dog owners take their dogs to the vet at least once per year for a checkup and make sure their dogs are up to date on their shots. When you first get your dog, you should take him to the veterinarian for his first check-up and initial shots as well. Then, make sure that you take your dog to the veterinarian once per year for a checkup and updates on shots.Observe your dog for signs of a health issue. Being a good dog owner also means taking your dog to the veterinarian right away if you suspect that he is having a health issue. If you notice that your dog seems sick or that his behavior has changed, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian right away to find out what is going on.;
, Flea, tick, and heartworm medications are necessary to protect your dog from preventable health problems. Make sure that you administer these medications as recommended by your veterinarian along with any other medications that your veterinarian prescribes for your dog., This helps stem the tide of companion-animal overpopulation. Spaying female dogs reduces the stress and discomfort endured during heat periods, eliminates the risk of uterine cancer, and greatly reduces the risk of mammary cancer. Neutering makes male dogs much less likely to roam or fight and prevents testicular cancer., Getting your dog licensed and purchasing dog tags for him is important in case he ever runs away or gets lost. It doesn’t cost much to license your dog and in most states you are required to license your dog and keep his tags on his collar at all times. Not doing so may cost you up to $250.Your dog’s tags should include his name, and your phone number or street address.

Spend time with children.,
Get a pet, or volunteer with animals.,
Cultivate friendships that support you being you.",How to Keep a Playful Mindset As an Adult2," Kids, especially younger ones, are unabashed about their interests and desires. If they want to play, they play. If they have a question, they ask. Make a commitment to spend time with children, and maybe their carefree attitudes will rub off.

Get on the floor and play with your own children or those of a friend or family member. Volunteer at a recreational center. Or, simply go to the park and observe children at play., Animals, particularly young dogs, can help you connect with your inner child, too. Adopt a pet from a local animal shelter. Visit a relative or neighbor who has a youthful dog. Or, start a volunteer commitment with an animal shelter in your area.If you are not sure if you feel ready to commit to caring for a pet or volunteering on a regular basis, then try volunteering one time as a dog walker and see if it is something you would like to do again.

, An enviable trait many kids have is the ability to just be who they are. At least while they are young, they don’t edit themselves. It can help you become more playful to hang out with people who don’t make you edit yourself.Think about the people in your life who you can be your silly, quirky self around. Choose to spend more time with these people.
If you don’t have people like this in your life, you may try to make new friends or be bolder in your current relationships.

, Most kids had a secret desire to discover new lands or long-buried treasure. While such dreams may prove unrealistic in adulthood, you can still maintain the role of explorer. Although exploring means traveling to new environments to learn more about them, you can put on your explorer hat in your own city or town.Dedicate some time each week to visit a new area in your town. Hike on a newly discovered trail. Wander through shops you’ve never visited and check out interesting restaurants.
If you have the time and resources, you may venture further and travel to foreign lands.
You can even start off more simply by looking at information about different locations on the internet or by watching a video.

Teach your children to ask nicely before borrowing.,
Use a timer.,
Make beds off-limits.,
Create noise, light, and bedtime guidelines.,
Involve the children in setting up the rules.,
Set up consequences.",How to Keep the Peace Between Kids Who Share a Room2," One way to avoid conflicts over toys and possessions is to make rules about borrowing possessions. Teach your children to ask each other nicely if they can use their sibling’s toys or possessions before borrowing them. Reinforce the idea that even if the sibling isn’t around, they still need to ask the parent for permission before using the toy.Let each child have a few special toys that they don’t have to share unless they want to. Make sure they also have a special place to store these toys.

, If your kids both want to play with the same toy, set up a schedule for how long each child can play with the toy. Make sure the amount of time is equal. Also, have guidelines for deciding who gets to play with the toy first.For example, if the toy is a personal belonging, then the owner has priority. If the toy is neutral, then teach your children how to be fair by flipping a coin to see who gets to play with the toy first.

, Your children’s beds are their most private spaces when sharing a room. Make a rule that states that explicit permission from the sibling must be granted before the other child sits or lies on their bed. This will make your children feel like they have control over their own personal space, and hopefully reduce conflicts., Noise, light, and having different bedtimes can also create potential conflicts between siblings. Therefore, make sure to include guidelines that designate times for quiet and play to meet each child's needs.For example, designate an hour of quiet time where noise and lights are kept at a minimum in order to do homework or take a nap.
If your children have a two or three year age gap, do not make them go to bed at the same time. Instead, designate separate, but developmentally appropriate, bedtimes for each child.

, By involving your children in making the rules, they will have a personal investment in them. This way, they are more likely to remember and follow them, as well as enforce the rules themselves.Once you and your children have settled on a few simple rules, formally type them up and print them on a piece of paper. Hang them up in their bedroom as a reminder.
Make the rules as simple and positive as possible, for example, “Ask nicely before borrowing a toy” and “Treat other people’s possessions with respect and care.”

, All rules must have consequences if they are broken. Consequences help reinforce the rules and standards. Make sure to follow through each time one of your children breaks a rule. Like with rules, you and your children can also create and agree on the appropriate consequences for each rule.For example, if a child plays with a toy longer than the scheduled time, the amount of time they went over will be subtracted from the next round of playing.
Additionally, if the children begin to fight over a toy, make the toy off-limits until they can figure out a way to share it.

Teach them to express their feelings.,
Encourage them to work out their conflicts.,
Intervene.,
Seek professional help.",How to Keep the Peace Between Kids Who Share a Room3," Help your children find the words to express their feelings instead of yelling at one another or calling each other names. To help them express their feelings, you can set up an emotion board.Whenever a conflict is erupting, have them go to the emotion board and point out which face reflects how they are feeling.
Teach them to explain why they feel that way, for example, “I feel angry because he took my toy without asking first.”

, Unless the conflict becomes physically or emotionally violent, try not to intervene. However, you should monitor the conflict to see if they can work it out on their own. If they try to involve you, remind them that because they are responsible for creating the conflict, they are also responsible for resolving the conflict. Praise and reward your children if they resolve the conflict on their own.If you see that one of your children is afraid of or avoiding the other sibling, and always the victim, then you may need to intervene to prevent the conflict from becoming emotionally violent.
Try to encourage win-win situations where each child gains something.
If your children are young, for example toddlers, then you will probably need to intervene to help resolve the conflict.

, If a conflict becomes violent, you must stop the fight immediately and separate the children. Once your children have calmed down, bring them back together to talk about what happened. Let them know that violence is not a valid solution and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.For example, “Conflicts are inevitable and natural, but I will not tolerate physical or emotional violence as a solution. There are better ways to resolve a conflict, and both of you will be punished if violence occurs.”

, If fights become violent on a regular basis, and you cannot find a way to stop them, then you might need to seek professional help from a child or behavioral therapist. Also, contact a professional if one sibling is frightened by the other sibling, won’t fight back, and is always the victim. These are signs of sibling abuse."

Wash your dog as needed.,
Brush your dog.,
Clip your dog's nails.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,

Make sure your dog always has access to fresh clean water.,
Give treats for good behavior.",How to Be a Good Dog Owner3," The amount and frequency of your dog’s feedings will depend on the age and size of your dog.

Play with your dog.,
Give your dog plenty of opportunities to go outside.",How to Be a Good Dog Owner4," Dogs require daily exercise to be healthy and happy. Walking your dog every day is great way to help your dog get the exercise he or she needs. Your dog’s exercise needs will vary based on his or her breed, which means that some dogs will be content with a quick walk around the neighborhood, while others will require at least an hour of walking every day.Consider your dog’s energy level to determine how much and how often you should be walking him or her.

, Since not all dogs can do what they were bred to do, such as hunt or dig, it is important to play with them every day to keep them from forming destructive behaviors.

Consider enrolling your dog in an obedience course.,
Keep training sessions short and regular.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Ignore bad behavior.",How to Be a Good Dog Owner5," Good dog owners put in the time and effort that is needed to train their dog basic commands. An obedience course can help you teach your dog some basic obedience skills such as sit, stay, and lay down. Going through an obedience course with your dog can also help you to build a better bond with your dog, which will benefit both of you.You may also consider working one-on-one with a certified professional dog trainer. This is a good option if your dog is not a big fan of other dogs and people, or if you just want more attention and help from the trainer.

, For the best results, train your dog in short sessions and repeat the sessions regularly. One way that you can train is by doing 5-15 repetitions of a behavior, such as teaching your dog to sit. Then, switch to a different behavior, and then another. Do these repetitions during one 15 minute session every day. Keeping training sessions short will help your dog pay attention. The frequency of your training sessions will help reinforce what you want your dog to learn., To teach your dog to do what you want him to do, it is important to reward his good behavior as soon as he does it. For example, if you ask you dog to sit and he does, praise and pet him right away so that he knows that he did something good. Try to reward your dog whenever he does good things so that he knows that these are the behaviors you like., Teach your dog to stop doing bad behaviors by ignoring him when he is naughty. For example, if your dog wants to go for a walk and he is jumping on you to let you know, ignore him and wait until he stops jumping. When he stops and stands still, put on his leash and take him for a walk. Repeat this process every time you walk your dog to help him understand that you do not want him to jump. He will learn that jumping up and down does not lead to a walk, but standing still does.Never hit or scream at your dog if he does something bad. Punishing your dog in this way does not solve the problem and it may even make the problem worse.
Consult an animal behaviorist or certified professional dog trainer if you are having problems with training your dog.

Keep your dog at a healthy weight.,
Avoid giving your dog “people food” or medicine.,
Register your dog with a veterinary clinic.,
Neuter or spay your dog.",How to Be a Responsible Dog Owner1," Get recommendations from your vet or breeder as to which foods work best for your dog’s breed. The type and amount will vary according to your pet’s age, weight, and activity level, so be sure to consult the packaging for the correct serving sizes.A dog’s digestion will be healthiest if you give them a consistent diet. If you do change your dog’s food, introduce the new kind gradually by mixing it in with the old at first.
Keep in mind that how much you feed your dog is almost as important as what you feed them. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis.
Since you want to feed your dog a set amount, it’s best to control their feeding times rather than letting them graze throughout the day. Establish meal times once or twice a day to give your dog a sense of routine.
Monitor your dog’s treats. It’s always wonderful to reward your canine companions with treats, but be sure that you’re adjusting their normal food intake accordingly. If you feed your dog a bone, reduce the amount of kibble they’ll get for dinner.;
, Hydration is critical for your dog’s nutrition, digestion, and joint health. It’s also critical for the regulation of their body temperature. Your dog should always have a dish of fresh, clean water available, even at night.If you go on car trips or outings, take water with you for your dog.
Be sure to clean your dog’s food bowl and water dish regularly to prevent mold, dirt, and bacteria from building up.

, It’s your job to monitor your pet’s food intake and feed them an appropriate amount for their size and ideal weight. While it may seem cruel to deny your dog the food that they’re begging for, letting your dog get obese is more cruel since it compromises their health and well-being.If your dog is overweight, ask your vet to recommend a diet to help get them get back to an appropriate weight.

, Canines have very different nutritional needs than humans, so stick to feeding them dog food to ensure they’re getting a healthy and well-balanced diet. They also have different medical needs, so never assume that the remedies that work for us will work for them.Be aware that many of our common food items are poisonous or even lethal to dogs, like raisins, grapes, mushrooms, onions, macadamia nuts, caffeine, chocolate (especially dark chocolate and baking chocolate), alcoholic beverages, dairy products such as milk, and citrus fruits such as oranges.Only give your dog medicines that have been explicitly prescribed or approved by a vet. Many human drugs—over-the-counter or prescription—can kill your dog. For instance, aspirin may be given to a dog if your vet tells you it is alright and tells you the proper dosage. But acetaminophen and ibuprofen are highly poisonous for your pooch.Have a canine first aid kit on hand to address your dog’s medical needs. You can either buy one or put one together yourself. Make sure it includes basic supplies like a pet first-aid book, self-cling bandages, gauze pads, an antibacterial ointment or antiseptic wipes, disposable gloves, scissors, and tweezers., Having an established veterinarian-owner-patient relationship with regular check-ups will help ensure that your dog is as healthy as possible and up-to-date with their vaccinations and parasite control.When searching for a vet, be sure to choose one that is nearby to where you live and has good online reviews.
Go to your vet regularly to minimize your dog’s risk of contracting and spreading dangerous diseases (like rabies or kennel cough) or parasites (like fleas and heartworm). Your vet will keep records to remind you when preventative treatments need to be administered.
How often you should visit the vet will depend on the health and age of your dog. Puppies will need several appointments in their first year, but a normal, healthy adult dog can generally get by with an annual check-up. Senior dogs who are pushing ten years of age should probably go in at least twice a year.Your vet can also help you decide when it’s time to let go. When your pet is stuck in a cycle of incurable suffering due to sickness or old age, the best thing you can do for them is to seek your vet’s help to end your pet's life humanely., Responsible dog owners will control their pet’s reproduction. Neuter or spay your dog as soon as your vet recommends doing so to prevent unwanted litters adding to the numbers in shelters as well as adolescent behavior problems that arise from sex hormones."

Ideally, a dog that works in film should have a calm and agreeable demeanor. Your dog should not be easily scared or aggravated as a lot of noise and commotion occurs on set.
Dogs who work in television should work well with other animals. There might be more than one dog or animal on scene. You do not want a dog that gets distracted or disruptive around other pets.
Shelter and rescue dogs are often not suited for show business as they tend to have behavioral issues. However, with an experienced trainer and a lot of patience many dogs can overcome poor behaviors.;
, Physically, television work is demanding. Dogs need to be high energy and in good shape to work on TV. Get your dog evaluated by a veterinarian to make sure he's fit for a career in showbiz.

A certain breed might be unpopular for one month and then in high demand the next., Dogs in show business need to be very intelligent but also trainable. A dog who is stubborn, even if very smart, might not be well-suited for a show business career. Ask yourself whether your dog really listens to commands and is enthusiastic about pleasing people. If your dog tends to be rambunctious or rebellious, a TV career might not be a good choice.

, Before trying to get your dog on TV, take some time to consider the logistics of the career. Television work is demanding. You will have to keep your dog well-groomed and disciplined. Even successful television animals often struggle to find steady work. Travel is a big factor. If you expect your dog to be a big hit, you might have to relocate to New York or LA. Take some time to weigh the pros and cons of getting your dog on TV., If your dog has any behavioral issues, they should be worked out before you try to get him/her on television. Bad behaviors are not likely to be tolerated on set and could cost your dog a job.


Basic commands like sit, stay, and come are important. These sorts of commands can be used to settle your dog during tense situations. For many dogs, such commands are learned early in life. If you have an older dog who has not yet mastered these commands, take some time to work on them together.Issues with aggression, shyness, barking, or leash manners are also frowned upon in the television industry. Filming is a high stress situation and no one wants to deal with an unruly dog. Try to work through troublesome behaviors. If necessary, seek out the help of a professional dog trainer or veterinarian.Understand that, if you have a rescue dog, some behavioral issues may never completely disappear. Even with hard work and discipline, if your dog was abused or neglected in the past s/he may never be well behaved enough to work in TV., Television producers look for dogs with a diversity of skill. Go beyond basic commands like sit and stay and teach your dog some marketable tricks.


It may take time to teach your dog tricks. It can take a dog a few weeks or months to master a new trick. Having patience and keeping a consistent schedule can help.

Move towards them in a slow, deliberate way.It may also help to make soft clicking noises with your tongue to get the dog’s attention without alarming it.;
, Only approach them if they are in an open area where the dog can clearly see you for your entire approach and has an easy escape route. If a dog feels cornered, they may lash out in fear., You don’t want to stare directly at the dog or make prolonged eye contact. Instead, keep your gaze directed to one side of the dog.It’s also good to crouch down to make yourself smaller but not to get down on your hands and knees since this puts you in a vulnerable position if the dog should attack.

, Instead of going the whole way to the dog, stop at least 10 feet short of where they are. This allows the dog to approach you on their own initiative. Stay still and crouching while not making direct eye contact. Speak to them in a calm, friendly voice to encourage them to come., If the stray shows interest by moving towards you, slowly put your hand out with your palm down for them to smell. This a way for them to greet and identify you.Do not make any sudden movements or try to pet them. Just stay still and let the stray have a good sniff.

You should also have a means of transportation for getting dogs around and a suitable space in which to care for foster dogs.You’ll need to have your own vehicle or reliable access to someone else’s and/or dog-friendly public transportation so that you can get dogs to veterinary exams and meetings with potential adopters.
Many programs for fostering dogs require that you have a fenced-in outdoor area to make it easy for dogs to go out throughout the day.
If you do not own your home, be sure that your landlord allows dogs on the premises.
Keep in mind that foster programs will typically require you to go through an in-depth application, interview, and training process. They may also require references.;
, Besides basic care, many foster dogs require training and socialization. Fostering requires daily effort that will adjust your typical schedule to accommodate a dog’s needs and routine. You don’t need to be around 24 hours a day, but it’s important that you plan on being around more often than you’re not.It’s also important to decide in advance how long you’re willing to foster a dog for. Fostering can range from a couple weeks to a few months.
It’s best not to have any travel planned while you’re fostering a particular dog.
Some foster programs may require that you’re around during the day.

, If you live with other people or pets, you should take them and their needs into consideration before you commit to fostering. Be sure that everyone you live with is on board before you begin fostering dogs.For instance, if you have a pet who is not keen on other dogs, it’s probably not a good idea to bring new ones into your home. If you have other pets, you should not foster puppies who are not fully immunized or dogs with communicable illnesses.
If you have young children, it’s risky to invite an unsocialized dog into your home. Also, keep in mind that the children will also need training in order to ensure a positive fostering experience for everyone.

, Many foster dogs will have special needs that makes the shelter an unsuitable environment for them. These may include puppies that are too young to be adopted, pregnant females, and adult dogs in need of socialization or special care due to injury or illness.Consider which behavioral and medical issues that you’re willing to deal with in advance. Fostering programs will provide you with briefs about a dog’s health needs and temperament before assigning them to you.

, Animal shelters and pet rescue organizations will often have associated foster programs. Do an online search for “fostering dogs” and your closest town or city to find programs in your vicinity.Keep in mind that most foster programs require you to live in the immediate area, so that it’s easy for you to bring the dog in for medical care and arrange visits with potential owners.
You can also contact shelters and rescues in your area over the phone or visit them in person to see if they offer fostering.

, Once you know which programs exist locally, find out more information about each program. You can do this by calling the host organizations directly or by visiting their websites. Be sure that you find out about the resources and requirements for each program to be sure that they align with your needs and qualifications.The best programs will provide supplies and veterinary care for foster dogs as well as training and support for you.
You should also inquire about what types of dogs are most common in their fostering program to make sure that you’re prepared to deal with them.
Some programs have prerequisites for dog foster carers, such as day-time availability, a fenced-in yard, or a home without pets or children. Be sure to check that you fit with their qualifications.

, All programs will require you to fill out an online or paper application to become a foster carer. The form will ask you for details about your contact information, lifestyle, and living situation as well as about your preferences for the number and type of rescue dogs you’re willing to host.Filling out this form thoroughly will help programs match you with compatible dogs.

, Responsible foster programs require a home visit before they’ll place a dog with you. An employee or volunteer associated with the organization will come to your residence to ensure that it’s safe and suitable for dogs. They’ll also be able to answer any questions that you may have about the program and offer advice about caring for dogs and making your living space more dog-friendly.Some programs require the whole family or all housemates to be present so that they can verify that the foster dog will be entering a friendly, willing environment.

, Most foster programs offer an orientation and free training courses for volunteers that will teach you how to care for foster dogs. They will also provide information about how to handle any special training needs or behavioral issues associated with your wards.Never accept a dog that has behavioral or medical issues that you have not been trained to deal with by a qualified trainer.

, The majority of foster programs will provide you with the necessary supplies to foster a dog, including food, bowls, toys, a crate, bedding, collar, and leash. They are, however, always grateful if you can supply these basic needs yourself.Keep in mind that you may need to supplement these supplies with additional food and/or treats. See if your dogs have any special dietary needs before purchasing kibble or snacks or them.
If a program does not provide basic supplies, be sure that you’re ready to assume the financial costs of caring for a dog before you commit to fostering. Even the most basic pet care supplies can run you $500 or more per year., Since it may be difficult for foster dogs to adjust to their new environment, help them be at ease by immediately introducing a healthy routine that they can count on. Their daily schedule should involve feeding, walking, socializing, and being let out regularly.It may also include training and/or grooming as necessary.

, The most urgent training that most foster dogs require is basic socialization. Many of them will have had limited or negative contact with humans. It’s your job as a foster parent to prepare them for life in a new home by giving them plenty of positive attention.Be sure to let dogs spend time around people throughout the day. For instance, encourage them to be in the living room while your family watches television together.
Give the dog plenty of individual attention each day by petting and playing with them.

, The foster program should supply you with grooming tools and training about how to keep each specific breed in fine fettle. Well-groomed dogs are more likely to be adopted, so it’s important to help maintain their coats and cleanliness.Most dogs will only require daily to weekly brushing and a good wipe-down with a towel when they go outside in sloppy weather.
Other specialized grooming requirements, such as trimming their fur or nails, can be left to professionals at the shelters.

, The shelter you’re fostering for will advertise that your dog is available for adoption. However, if you want to speed the process of finding your foster dog a forever home, you can help advertise them to potential owners.Write an attractive but honest description of the dog, and post it to community forums like Craigslist or dedicated pet adoption sites like Petfinder. People are much more likely to respond if you include current, appealing photos of the dog.
You can also advertise on social media by posting cute photos and descriptions of your ward and tagging or providing a link to the shelter where they’re available. There’s a chance that someone in your network is looking for a dog like yours!
The shelter will appreciate it if you put potential dog parents in touch with them. However, let the shelter handle the adoption process itself.

Your dog will find your voice soothing and familiar, which can help with the stress of not being able to see as well.This is a great opportunity to talk to your pet even more. Let him know when you are coming near and before you touch him. This will reduce the chances of you surprising him, which can be more likely and more stressful when he is visually impaired.;
, Having a visually impaired dog can be tough on both of you, especially if this is a change for your pet. Do your best to remain positive and keep his routine the same.

It will be pretty difficult for other people to tell that your dog is blind, so you’ll want to make sure they know when they approach. Let them know it is okay to pet your dog, if you want to let them, but they should tell the dog they are near, and let him sniff their hands first.One way you can help is to give your dog a bandana or other clothing that clearly says “I’m Blind,” or something similar. This can be especially helpful if you are walking in an area with lots of people, and don’t want to have to stop all of them., If you think, or know, that your dog’s eyesight is weakening, talk to your vet about care and other changes you should make in your life.

For you, this means letting try doing new things, like finding his way around the house.

, Some dogs treat oncoming blindness as if it were an enemy, something they can fight against. This will make your dog more aggressive, which can lead to him lashing out at you or others in your house. You’ll want to find ways to minimize situations that lead to aggression. This is a careful balance between being too kind, which will only encourage the behavior, or being too stern, which will help escalate the situation., When dogs would rather back down from an aggressor, they will probably react to losing their sight by retreating. These dogs will move slowly, lower their heads, ears, and tails, eat and do less, and sleep longer. The best thing you can do is not reinforce these feelings by remaining positive and connected to your dog, touching and petting him whenever possible. If you feel like you might be sad or cry, give your dog a toy and separate yourself from him until you feel better., Some dogs will use you as a crutch, following you around and making you do everything with them. It can be very tempting to want to help your pet, but you need to resist this impulse. Make sure your dog is able to learn to do new things without you. It may take a little time, but as your dog learns to cope, he will gain more confidence in his ability., Your dog is going to need some assistance navigating the world with more limited sight, so this is an opportunity to teach your dog new commands. You want to focus on commands that will help your dog adjust, so teach things like “Stop” or “Step” to alert your dog when he is coming near an obstacle.Another good command is to get your dog to respond to a sound like your fingers snapping. This is a simple, repeatable sound that your dog can associate with you. This can be very effective if you are somewhere loud or with other people, as you’ll want something more distinctive to get your dog’s attention., This will let your dog get some exercise while not over-exerting his limited vision. Look for games that force him to rely on his other senses, especially hearing and smell. Play catch on a driveway or hard surface, making sure your stick or ball bounces on the hard surface to let your dog hear where it is., When you take your dog out for a walk, make sure to use a harness rather than a collar, and use a shorter leash. The harness will feel more secure for your pet, while the shorter leash gives you greater control, and can prevent tripping., Dogs communicate a lot with body language, especially the way they approach one another. Because your dog can’t see very well, he won’t react as much when meeting a new dog. The new dog may interpret the lack of reaction as an aggressive posture, creating potential trouble. Make sure new dogs approach yours slowly, giving both of them time to figure one another out.


In spite of this difficulty with meeting new dogs, it is important for your dog’s mental health to spend time around other dogs if possible. Dogs are social animals, and generally enjoy interacting with each other., Put your dog’s food, water, crate, and other familiar items in the same area. This will give your dog a familiar and comfortable place to go to if he starts to feel lost or disoriented. Plus, he will always know where his food and water are, which can be very helpful.For the water bowl, you may consider using a drinking fountain that provides water to the dish. The bubbling sound will help your dog find the bowl when he needs the water, and can help lead him to his base camp., If your dog can’t see, it will be a big help to him that you keep large furniture arranged in the same way. If your dog’s eyesight is starting to fade, he may try to walk around the house to get a good sense of where large obstacles are. Keeping a standard layout will help your dog’s confidence in his surroundings, making the visual impairment easier to handle.This doesn’t mean that you can’t rearrange furniture. Assuming your dog is in a positive mood, and you are willing to help him navigate around the new layout, you can lead guide him through it for a few days. Just avoid doing this too often, for both of your sakes.If you do rearrange things, take some time to crawl on the floor at your dog’s eye level. This will help you see potential problem areas, and let you cover up future danger spots like sharp corners.

, When your dog has limited vision, you’ll want to find some ways to make certain items and areas recognizable for him. Using his sense of smell and hearing, you can create signals that let your dog know that something, or someone, is near.The easiest thing to do is add bells to yourself and your family members. The jingling sound helps to let your dog know you are nearby. Consider adding bells to the collars of other dogs, as they are more likely to approach their housemate without talking first.Using scents and odors is another way to help your dog understand where he is. Place flavored extracts, scented oils, colognes, and other smells in important areas like stairs or doorways so your dog can recognize those areas when he gets near them.
If you are out of the house, consider leaving on a TV or radio for some additional ambient noise. The extra sound will be familiar to your dog, and help calm his anxiety from not knowing where you are. Plus, knowing there the TV is will help him stay oriented in the house.
Outside your home, a wind chime is a nice, unobtrusive addition that can help your dog always “hear” where the house is when he wants to go back.

, Not in your whole house, but in areas where your dog will be. Put down rugs or plastic mats in specific places, say your dog’s base camp or near the top of stairs. This will help your dog recognize where he is around the house, and let him know that he is in a safe place, or near something dangerous. When you place these new textures down, it can be helpful to take your dog to them, and walk him over the transition areas so he gets comfortable with what the new floor means.Just make sure to make these textures varied depending on what you want your dog to know. It won’t help your dog if “top of the stairs” feels the same as “my safe space.”
Outside, it can be helpful to put a “warning track” of mulch or bark chips around trees, buildings, or other large objects. This will let your dog know he is getting close to something, and either slow down or change direction.

, If there are parts of your home that you can’t make safe for your dog, say a room with lots of heavy furniture or a pool, consider closing it off. A baby gate can work inside the house, though for something outdoors like a pool you may need to install a fence. This will help keep your dog from wandering into areas where he can get hurt, and gives him another landmark to look for."

Talk to the dog's owner.,
Offer to take on some of the responsibility.,
Look for volunteer dog walking organizations.,
Try to improve the dog's behavior.,
Argue for the dog's well being.",How to Convince Someone Not to Give up Their Dog," Ask questions to find out why exactly they might give up the pet. You'll need to understand the issues before you can offer solutions. Choose the steps below that best match the issues the owner brings up.


Do not accuse the owner of exaggerating, especially if you don't live in the same house as the dog. Take their complaints seriously.
Take a moment to consider the facts. If the owner is really unable to give the dog the attention and care it deserves, your priority should be finding a way to get the dog that care, even if it means moving the dog to another home.;
, If the owner lacks the time, energy, or money to take care of the dog, offer to look after it part of the time. If you are able to host the dog for a couple days at a time, or visit the dog to walk it every day, you can make dog ownership more manageable.


Look into nearby friends of the owner who might be willing to drop by and spend time with the dog now and then when the owner has a rough day.

, If the owner doesn't have the money to hire someone, look for charity organizations that connect dogs with animal-loving volunteers.

The Cinnamon Trust is one example, a UK organization that provides free pet assistance for elderly owners.

, Put in your own time training the dog, or offer to hire a professional dog trainer.


If the dog has severe behavior issues that cannot be address with regular training, it is the dog owner's responsibility to take it to a specialist trainer, even if the eventual plan is to give the dog away. A dog with behavioral issues is unlikely to be adopted, and could even injure an unsuspecting new family.

, Some people treat dogs as interchangeable, or do not think it's a big deal for the dog to go to a shelter. Make sure the dog owner understands that abandonment and shelter life causes the dog stress and anxiety. Bringing a dog into the household is a long term responsibility, and if nothing major changed to make the situation more difficult, that's a responsibility the owner still has.


Use this tactic only if the owner fails to understand the situation, not if there are serious unsolved issues. Even if you guilt the owner into keeping, the dog will still be in an unhealthy situation.

Create a space suited to your dog.,
Make your home safe.,
Let your dog out regularly.,
Make your yard secure.,
Get the proper supplies.",How to Be a Responsible Dog Owner2," Dogs need appropriate shelter. At minimum, that means space to move around, climate control, and clean bedding.Start by picking a dog that’s suited to the space you have. For instance, it’s not a good idea to get an active, territorial breed, like a German Shepard, if you live in a studio apartment. Don’t get a high-energy dog like a Border Collie if you don’t have a yard or nearby field where it can run around.
Keep your dog warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Because of their fur and limited perspiration, dogs are easily affected by the heat. Never leave them in a car or place without shade.
Give your dog a designated place to sleep, whether it be a blanket, dog bed, or crate. If you choose to use a crate, be sure that it’s just big enough for your dog to stand up, sit, lie down, and turn around in.When you first bring a new puppy home, it is especially important to have a specific area available only for your puppy. If there are other pets in the home, such as a cat, it is crucial to keep them separated for at least one to two weeks. During that time, they will adjust to each other by scent and will be less likely to provoke each other later., “Dog-proof” your house before your pet arrives. That means moving anything that’s valuable and/or breakable out of their reach, blocking access to any area you want to be dog-free, and securely storing any potentially toxic substances.Keep garbage cans either out-of-reach (in a low cabinet or in a closed pantry), or make them impossible to get into (using a can with a closed lid). Dogs are often attracted to eating garbage. If you don’t deny them access to it, it’ll create a mess for you to clean up and health problems for them.
Keep cleaning agents and other poisonous household substances, like antifreeze, out-of-reach.

, Grown-up dogs need to urinate at least every 8 to 10 hours; puppies every few hours. Besides taking your pet on walks, get in the habit of letting them out first thing in the morning, directly before bed, and after mealtimes. Doing so will keep them healthy and your floors safe from accidents.Make regular stops if you take your dog on a long road trip, so that he can get out for some exercise and have a drink of water. Never leave your dog unattended in the car!

, It’s essential to let your dog out, so be sure that the outside is safe for their sake and contained for the sake of your neighbors. Outdoor areas should have a controlled border, established by physical or invisible fencing. Keep dangerous tools (like axes) and substances (like fertilizer) in locked storage.Check for holes in the fences or gates, especially if you have a small dog. If you have a puppy, you might want to put wire over gates with gaps in them as very small dogs may be able to fit through the bars.
Some plants, like poinsettias or holly bushes, are poisonous to dogs. Do an online search for which species are toxic to canines, and then keep them out of reach or remove them to keep your dog safe.

, At the very least, you’ll need a food dish, water bowl, collar and/or harness, leash, toys, and bedding. Many people also get a carrier case and crate. Local pet shops can help you pick the most appropriate supplies for your breed of dog."
"
Bring the dog food regularly.,
Slowly work your way closer to the feeding site.,
Hand-feed the stray dog.,
Pet the dog of the side of the head.",How to Gain the Trust of a Stray Dog2," If you notice that the stray hangs out in a particular place, bring a dish of food there at the same time each day. Put the bowl on the ground, and walk away from it so that the stray will feel that it’s safe to approach.A dry dog kibble will often work fine for a hungry animal. However, if you want to be sure to attract them, you may want to add something that’s irresistibly smelly, like leftover meat or some wet dog food.
Food is the best way of establishing trust since it establishes you as a provider.

, At first, you want to leave the dog to eat the food on their own. Then, see if the dog will eat if you stay and watch from a distance. Each day, move gradually closer to where the dish is located while they eat until you’re standing next to them., Once the dog is at ease with you standing next to them while they eat, try offering them food from your hand. Crouch down so that the dog can eat comfortably from your palm.It may take a while and many attempts for the dog to approach your hand. Give them time to adjust, and go back to standing next to them for that day if they resist what you’re offering a few times.
Once they eat kibble from your hand, consider giving them treats the same way as a reward. If you keep the treats in your pocket, they’ll have your scent on them, which will help further establish trust with the dog.

, After the stray is comfortable eating out of your hand for a few consecutive sessions, you may try reaching out to pet them. Put your hand on the side of their neck or body, and stroke them gently and slowly.Don’t try to petting them on the top of their head since reaching over them can be startling.
To reinforce the sense of trust, reward them with treats with one hand while petting them with the other.

Evaluate the dog’s behavior.,
Stop and slowly back away at any sign of aggression.,
Watch for signs of rabies.,
Keep other pets out of the mix.",How to Gain the Trust of a Stray Dog3," Before you try to gain a dog’s trust, take time to observe them. Watch their behavior from a safe distance. If they seem fearful, aggressive, erratic, or sickly, even from far away, it’s best not to approach them. Instead, contact your local animal control to notify them of the situation.Some tell-tale warning signs include unusual gaits or movements, excessive salivation, skittish or predatory behavior, intense tracking of you or other animals at a distance, howling, barking, snapping, or growling at distant people or animals.

, If a dog growls or bares their teeth at you at any point, do not continue to approach them or stand near to them. Avoid eye contact and immediately begin backing away at a slow pace.Other potential signals of aggression include a low bark, erect ears, a stiff tail, and the hair on their back standing up.
It’s important to remain calm as you back away. If you turn and run, an aggressive dog is likely to chase after you like prey.

, Stray dogs may carry diseases. Be especially wary of canines that exhibit symptoms of rabies, like foaming at the mouth, disorientation and restlessness, light sensitivity, and/or aggression. If you think a stray might be rabid, contact your local animal control immediately.If you are attacked by a stray dog, go to the hospital immediately for treatment and a rabies test. You should also contact the police and animal control to warn them that there’s an aggressive dog on the loose.

, When you’re trying to gain the trust of a stray dog, it’s best not to involve other animals in the situation. Strays are skittish and unpredictable, so you want to limit their social interactions and keep them as simple and controlled as possible.For example, bringing your own dog to meet the stray can put both at risk while compromising the trust you’ve built with the stray.
If you do end up trying to help the stray dog, it’s still a good idea to keep them apart from your other animals until you’re sure that they’ve been vaccinated.

Slip a leash on the dog.,
Check for identification.,
Advertise a found dog.,
Bring the dog to an animal shelter.",How to Gain the Trust of a Stray Dog4," Once you have gained dog’s trust, it’s time to figure out if you can help it. Start by using a slip lead to secure the stray, so you can guide them away.Slip leads are convenient because they require no collar. You simply put the loop at the end of it over the dog’s head and tighten the slide on the rope so that it won’t slip off.
If the dog has a collar, you can use a normal leash.

, Don’t assume that the stray is ownerless; they might be a lost dog. Look for tags (if they’re wearing a collar), a tattoo, or a microchip to see if you can locate their family.Tattoos are generally located on the inner ear or leg.
Go to a vet to scan the dog to see if they have been microchipped.

, Make simple posters for your neighborhood and post brief ads online on community forums like Craigslist and Petfinder. Include a partial description of the dog, where you found them, and your contact information.You don’t want to provide too much information about the dog in the ads. Responders should be able to give a detailed description of their missing dog; otherwise, they’re probably not the true owners.
Be sure to distribute posters to local vet offices, pet stores, and animal rescues. While you’re doing so, show a photo of the stray to employees to see if they recognize it.

, Most shelters have facilities for housing lost or stray dogs and can advise you about how to help locate any possible owners through contacting public agencies. They also have resources available if you decide that you would like to foster the dog yourself."
"
Tag and microchip your dog.,
Monitor your dog’s behavior.,
Socialize your dog.,
Train your dog.,
Pick up after your dog.,
Keep your dog leashed in public at all times.",How to Be a Responsible Dog Owner3," These identification services are available through most vets and are essential to your dog’s safety. If you ever lose them, local authorities will be easily able to track you down if your information is up-to-date in the associated databases., You are responsible for ensuring that your dog doesn’t have a negative impact on other people or animals.Besides being sure that your dog is under control and supervised at all times when in public, responsible dog owners will get to know their pet’s patterns of behavior so that they can anticipate any issues. For instance, if you notice that your dog growls at strollers, give them a wide berth whenever possible until your dog grows more comfortable with them.
It’s always the best policy to avoid putting your dog in situations that you know will make them uncomfortable. For example, if your dog is suspicious of or aggressive towards other dogs, it’s not a good idea to let them loose in a crowded dog park because that is not setting them up to behave well.

, Gradually introduce your dog to new people and environments. Exposing them to a variety of people and places will help them be more comfortable with the world around them.Socialization is a slow process, so don’t ask too much of your dog all at once. For instance, if you’re dog has not been in crowds before, it’s not a good idea to take them to an outdoor carnival. You want them to continuously learn more about the world, but you don’t want to overwhelm them.
When your dog remains calm with new people and settings, reward their good behavior with praise and/or treats.

, Obedience training and socialization classes can help ensure that your dog will become a well-mannered family and community member. Training will strengthen your bond with your pet, prevent or correct unwanted behaviors, and create a well-balanced, happy pooch.At the very least, every dog should know basic commands, including ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""lie down,"" ""come,"" and ""heel."" You might see variations on these command phrases, but the behaviors that they need to learn are the same: responding to you immediately, exercising self-control, staying in a given position, coming at your request, and walking well on a leash.Ask your vet, local animal shelter, breeder, or fellow dog owners for trainer recommendations.
Contract a trainer via phone or visit their website to verify their qualifications. Make sure that the trainer you pick has significant experience, can offer good references, and uses humane methods of “positive reinforcement.” Never go to a trainer whose methods involve physical restraint or violence.

, Make sure that your canine is leaving no trace on the environment. Always dispose of your dog's waste in the proper manner and immediately address other damage they might cause, for instance, by filling in any holes they may dig.Use a bag to pick up your dog’s feces and dispose of it right away in an authorized trash receptacle. Consider using biodegradable bags to minimize your environmental impact.
Besides being considerate to your neighbors, cleaning up waste helps prevent the spread of disease.

, This will prevent your dog from running away, chasing animals, or jumping on other dogs or people.Oftentimes, local law insists that you keep your dog on a leash, so you risk fines if you don’t observe it. Be sure you’re familiar with the dog-related regulations in your area.
If you’d like to let your dog loose, find an off-lead dog park where they can run free.

Be a devoted, consistent friend.,
Exercise your dog.,
Give your dog mental exercise.,
Groom your dog.",How to Be a Responsible Dog Owner4," Dogs are social creatures, and you’re the center of their universe. They don’t like to be left alone all day. If you’re going to have one as a pet, be sure that you plan on being around more often than not. It’s not fair to your dog to leave them unattended for long periods and may lead to behavioral issues like aggression and anxiety.Many pet owners who work during the day get a companion pet for their dogs so that they can keep each other company. You should also consider having a friend or family member visit your pooch, taking them to doggy daycare, or hiring a dog-walker to get your pet out of the house.

, Your dog needs daily exercise for the sake of their health and well-being. Play with them, and take them for at least one, but preferably two, walks a day to ensure they’re getting enough physical and mental stimulation.Without proper exercise, your dog will become bored and many behavior problems may arise (like chewing, excessive barking, jumping, and hyperactivity).

Play with your dog. Canines have instincts to chew, fetch, chase, hunt, spar, dig, and herd. Help them exercise these instincts in constructive ways through supervised play. For instance, if your dog loves to hunt things, get them a toy that they can safely chase after, like a wooly chew toy at the end of a long rope. That way, your dog can act on their instinct while keeping them away from real animals and at a safe distance from you., Besides working their bodies, you should work your dog’s mind. This means giving them specific tasks (like fetching or finding something) and rewarding them for completing them (with praise and/or treats).Most breeds love to have jobs. Giving them work to do will make them more alert and boost their sense of well-being.

, Besides brushing them regularly, you’ll need to occasionally bathe your dog, keep their toe nails clipped, and see that their coat is neatly trimmed. You can consult with an expert to learn how to do these tricky processes yourself or go to a professional groomer to get the job done.Comb your dog’s coat at least once a week (or more for long-haired dogs) to control shedding and keep their fur from getting tangled and matted. Brushing can also help clean your dog’s skin and distribute its natural oils. Be sure to use a brush that’s appropriate for your dog’s size and hair length.Only bathe your dog when it’s absolutely necessary. Frequent washing can dry out the natural oils in their skins, leaving your pet with constant itches and rashes. When you do, use a mild dog shampoo and warm water. Since dogs have sensitive ears, only wash them from the neck down.
Keep your dog’s nails short to keep them comfortable and avoid them scratching up your house. Be sure to consult with a groomer or vet about how to clip your dog’s nails before you do it yourself. It’s a tricky process that can easily harm your pet if you do it wrong, so learn the right method from an expert or leave it to a trained professional.Some canines are more high-maintenance than others. If you have a breed that requires grooming, like a Poodle or Pekingese, make sure you have a regular appointment set up with a professional groomer."

Prevent separation anxiety.",How to Give Your Dog Healthy Attention," Any attention you give your dog should always be gentle and loving. This can cultivate a sense of security and stability in your dog and strengthen your bond.Praise your dog while giving it attention such as petting or playtime. Use the dog’s name to reinforce your message. For example, “What a fine and good dog you are, Leo! Gimme a shake. Good boy, you’re such a smart dog!”Avoid yelling or using loud tones when giving your dog attention. This could cause your dog to be fearful or anxious and may undermine the healthy attention you provide.;
, Dogs are pack animals that are not made to spend a lot of time alone.In addition, humans first bred dogs to work. Because of these factors, dogs naturally crave play that simulates work. Enjoying daily playtime with your dog can ensure that your dog gets enough exercise while strengthening your bond through healthy attention.Schedule at least 30 to 60 minutes of play with your dog every day. This could be an activity you do together such as running, walking, fetching, catching a Frisbee or ball, or visiting a local dog park.

, Make yourself more accessible when giving your dog attention. Sitting or lying on the floor can promote relaxation and bonding as well as build trust.Sitting on the sofa or in a chair can also get your dog to comfortably approach you.

, Your dog may show you affection during playtime or other instances, such as after meals. Show your dog that you enjoy its attention by reciprocating its actions. Ways your dog may show its affection for you include:Cuddling with you after eating. Cuddling back is a healthy form of attention and love.
Sleeping with you. You can let your dog lay next to you in bed or in its own bed in the room.
Approaching you and wagging its tail when you come home. Saying “It’s great to see you, too, Elsa,” followed by petting or a hug gives your dog the attention and love it missed while you were away.
Sitting with you in your office while you work or “helping” as you prepare dinner. Incorporating your dog into these daily activities is a great way to show attention and affection., Play is one of the best ways to give your dog healthy attention. Regular brisk walks are a feel-good activity that not only strengthen your bond through attention, but also fulfill your dog’s need to travel and explore.Aim to walk briskly for 30 to 40 minutes at least once a day and ideally two. This can ensure your dog’s brain releases feel-good hormones.

, Dogs love chasing and retrieving objects. Throw toys across a room or outdoor space for your dog to chase and fetch. This can ensure your dog gets plenty of healthy attention during the day.Use items such as medium to large balls or toys on rope. Make sure no item is too small that your dog could swallow it, such as a ping pong or tennis ball.
Get your dog’s attention before throwing the toy so that it can anticipate where to run. Try faking out your dog by moving one hand in a throwing motion and then saying her name as you toss the toy in the opposite direction.
Use an exciting voice and give your dog lots of encouragement and praise as you play. For example, “Fetch that ball, Spike! Whoa, you caught it! Great job! Now bring it back to me for another go.”

, Grabbing and pulling things is a natural canine urge. Taking the time to have a tug of war with your dog provides it healthy attention while also showing affection.Use a piece of soft and comfortable material to play tug of war. This could be an old clean rag or a soft piece of rope. Even a piece of bungee material makes a great pull toy. The material should be between one and three feet long., Much like cats, dogs also enjoy pouncing and shaking objects. This mimics hunting, which is one of their natural instincts. Giving your dog a squeaky toy on which to pounce and then shake can provide enjoyment. Make sure you praise your dog during pounce and shake play to let it know you’re paying attention., Some dogs may get bored with play or being petted. If this happens, give the dog a bone—or chew toy. This not only shows your dog attention and love, but also provides entertainment that engages the mouth. Chew toys can also improve a dog’s dental health.Get a chew toy made from either natural materials or nylon. You can also offer natural chew toys such as beef bones, rawhide bones, and non-rawhide chews made from vegetables and chicken.
Consider a chew toy that cleans your dog’s teeth.

, It can be difficult to leave your dog at home, but you might need to work or attend school. This can bore your dog from lack of attention and activity. Providing your dog toys can help it beat the boredom and “give” it attention until you get home. Some objects to occupy your dog include:Hard rubber toys for chewing and carrying around.
Rope toys.
Balls.
“Busy box” toys with hiding places for snacks.
Soft, stuffed and/or squeaky toys.
Dirty laundry that smells like you.

, As you give your dog attention, remember to praise and reward it. A small treat, such as a bit of kibble, provides extra attention while letting the dog know hat you enjoy its company. Rewards can also strengthen the bond between you and your dog.

, There are times when dogs want or need alone time and shouldn’t be disturbed. This includes when it is eating or aggressive. Giving your dog attention at the right times can ensure that it is not only healthy, but also strengthens the bond between you and your dog.Share love and attention when your dog is in a calm-submissive state. Good times to do this are after your dog has eaten or exercised, changed an unwanted behavior, or responded to a rule or command.
Use discretion in giving your dog attention if it is whining, begging, or barking. Investigate the cause of the behavior and proceed accordingly. For example, if your dog is barking because it saw a stranger in the yard, offer it some comfort by saying, “It’s ok, Todd, it was just a person dropping off a package.”
Avoid showing affection if your dog is fearful, anxious, dominant, possessive, aggressive, or breaking a rule.

, Dogs in the wild live in the social order of their pack. Your dog will look to you as the leader of its pack. Establishing your dominance can ensure your dog is loved, trained, and lively without being spoiled or uncontrollable. Failing to step into the alpha role may signal to your dog that it is the alpha. This can lead to uncontrollable behaviors such as eating off the table, jumping on others, or an inability to be alone. You can establish yourself as the alpha in your home by:Interacting with your dog as if you own it, not in a timid manner.
Offering praise quickly and warmly.
Reprimanding it fairly and quickly then move on.
Making your dog obey on the first command.
Giving and denying permission.
Being a model of confidence and authority to your dog.

, Many human foods such as chips, raw meat, onions, and chocolate can be toxic for dogs.Beyond this, feeding your dog table scraps can lead to undesirable behaviors such as begging or not wanting to eat dog food.Providing dog food and an occasional human treat can help you avoid unhealthy attention and further establish you as pack leader.


Recognize that an occasional scrap of human food is fine. However, this should be only once in a great while and as praise for something, and shouldn't be given from the table.
Choose dog friendly treats such as steamed or baked potatoes, plain rice, oatmeal, bits of cooked chicken or turkey, or finely chopped or steamed unseasoned vegetables.

, Dogs greet each other with nose-to-nose contact. When your dog sees you or guests, it likely wants to give a warm greeting in the same way. However, this can be a dangerous behavior that injures you or your guests, especially if they are children and/or frail adults. Train your dog to do a preferred behavior, such as sitting, to greet and get attention from you and others.Give your dog the “sit” command anytime it stands up to greet others. Don’t give the dog any attention until it stays seated.
Ask your guests to help with the training. Tell them to turn and walk away if your dog isn’t sitting when they arrive. Then repeat, “Sit!” to your dog and let your guests approach it again.

, Dogs are social animals that live in packs in the wild. As a result, leaving your dog alone can result in separation anxiety, which is common. But separation anxiety can lead to destructive behaviors such as chewing, whining, scratching, and defecation. Preventing separation anxiety is key to avoiding unhealthy attention and bad behavior in your dog. You can prevent separation anxiety by:Not making a fuss about leaving or returning.
Leaving recently worn clothing that smells like you with your dog.
Establishing a word with your dog that lets it know you’ll be back.
Confining the dog loosely in a room or crate that simulates a den.
Providing busy toys for distraction.

Deal with your grief.",How to Give Away Your Dog when You Don't Want To," Take some time to think about why you have arrived at the decision to give your dog away. Remember that dogs are a lot of responsibility, but you should try to keep your commitment as a pet owner as much as you can. Talk to the other people who live in your house and make sure everyone is clear about the reasons and still thinks giving the dog away is the best solution.Some reasons that you might be considering giving up your dog include family member allergies, living arrangement restrictions, aggressive dog behavior, or not having enough time to give the dog the attention it needs.;
, If you are sad about giving away your dog, try to exhaust all possible options before deciding to go that route. Brainstorm with your family members about what you could do instead of giving the dog away.If a family member has allergies, consider allergy medications.
Try to talk to your landlord about making special allowances for your pet. Perhaps you could offer to pay an extra pet deposit.
If your pet is destructive, think about taking the dog to obedience training. Or consider putting the dog in a crate while you’re gone during the day as long as it is only for a few hours at a time.
If you don’t have enough time to spend with your dog, consider taking it to doggie daycare during the day. Or ask some of your friends or relatives to help out with watching the dog while you’re at work. You could also consider hiring a dog sitter.

, It's very hard to give away a family pet, but sometimes there are reasons why you have to do these things. Start (if you have kids) with telling your kids that you have to give the family dog away so they know what you are doing. The children will be upset about this, but giving them a little time to come to terms with the decision before you give the dog away may help your child cope with their emotions about the situation.Tell your children or other family members that you don’t want to get rid of the dog, but that there is no other option. Let them express how they feel and talk about the situation with them.
Try saying something like, “You know how much we all love Fido, but, unfortunately, we are going to have to give him away. The new landlord doesn’t allow pets and there is no way for us to move to another place. I know this is a sad thing, but we will find Fido a good home where he can be happy.”

, Take some time to ask your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers if they, or anyone they know and trust, would be interested in adopting your dog. You will ultimately feel more comfortable giving your dog to someone you already know will take good care of your pet.Make sure they have the time to dedicate to a pet and enough room for the dog in their home.
You could also ask your veterinarian for recommendations. They might know of someone who would be interested in adopting your dog.

, Look for a caring, good home for your dog by advertising your pet in various ways. Make a private post on your social media accounts that only your friends can see. Put up fliers at local pet stores and veterinarian offices. Include a picture of your dog and some information about what kind of personality the dog has.You may want to avoid advertising online (unless it is a private post that only your friends and acquaintances can see) because there are many scams and people who want to adopt dogs for fighting, re-selling, or other unfortunate reasons. You want to avoid these kinds of inquiries.

, When you find someone who is interested in adopting your pet (especially if you don’t know them already), it’s important to ask them a few questions to figure out if they would be a good fit for your pet. You want to make sure they have the kind of home you want your pet to live in and that you are confident they would be able to care for your pet appropriately.


For example, if you know your dog is not very good with children, you’ll want to inform the potential adopters about this fact and make sure they don’t have any small children in their home.
Be sure to ask if new owners have enough time to walk, train, and care for the dog. If they don't, look for some other owners. Remember that you are responsible for finding a good home for your dog.

, Once you have found an adopter that you are comfortable with, agree on a date for your dog to go to its new home. Make sure that the date works for both parties (you and the adopters) and agree on who will be transporting the dog.


Be sure to bring all of your dog’s possessions with you to its new home. This includes things like old toys, food dishes, dog bed, leash, and any bags of food you may have.

, Giving your dog up to an animal shelter should be an absolute last option when you have no other choice. Your dog may not get the attention and care it needs at an animal shelter because of the problems with funding and lack of staff members that many shelters deal with on a daily basis. And it is very likely that the dog will stay there for weeks before being adopted, if it even gets adopted at all.Many animal shelters are kill shelters, which means that they euthanize animals who are not adopted after a certain amount of time. You don’t want that to happen to your family pet, so make sure you inquire about the shelter’s euthanization policies before you hand over your dog. You only want to give your dog to a no-kill shelter.

, Sit down with your family and take turns petting it and loving on it. Talk about why you are giving the dog away. These conversations will help your family come to terms with losing their beloved pet. Make sure everyone has a chance to say goodbye to the dog.Spending quality time with the dog before it goes will give everyone a chance to say goodbye and to feel a little bit better about the situation.
But be careful not to go too overboard with this process. If you are too overly emotional, the dog may sense something is wrong and feel anxious and upset.

, Remember that the dog doesn’t deserve to be treated poorly just because you have to give it away. It's okay to be sad, but it isn't okay to take out your emotions on the dog in a negative way. Explain to your family (especially if you have kids) that your dog will have good new home, and it's important to act normally for the dog since dogs live in the moment.


Until the dog leaves for its new home, it is still part of your family. Treat the dog with love and kindness even if it is hard for you to do because you are sad it is leaving.

, When the farewell time comes, be ready. Spend some time saying goodbye to your dog and giving it a proper sending off. Be happy that your dog will have a good new family. Hug the dog and be confident that you have done the right thing.Let the dog take its treats, toys, dog bed, and any other possessions you bought the dog to its new home so that it will make the transition a bit easier on your pup.

, It’s normal to expect that you will be sad after you give your dog away. Try to deal with your grief by talking about it to your friends and family or by spending time with other animals in your life (like your best friend’s pet or your neighbor’s dog).


You may also want to consider going to counseling or seeking the help of a grief support group if the pain seems unmanageable or if it lasts a long time.

It is important to be as specific as possible in preparing the person taking care of your dog, especially if that person has little or no experience with dogs or other animals., Especially if your dog has a unique diet or you make food at home, preparing these in advance will make it easier for your sitter to care for the dog. You can place the food for each meal in a ziplock bag or other food storage container. Label each container to make it easy for your pet sitter to find just the right meal.

Set a routine.,
Plan ahead.,
Be flexible.,
Include the dog in your daily activities.,
Give your dog their due.",How to Give Your Dog Enough of Your Time1," You will have more success spending time with your dog if you plan your activities into your day and week. Schedule times that you will feed, walk, and play with your dog. This schedule will also benefit your dog by giving them structure in their day.


Dogs should generally be fed twice a day, walked one once or twice, and taken out often to eliminate. They are also social creatures and will want to spend time with you while you are home.;
, Dogs can cut into your social life. While you can still go out, you will have to plan ahead to make sure that your dog's needs are met.For example, if you know you are going to be working late one day, ask someone if they would be willing to walk your dog for you. If you are leaving on a weekend trip, find a friend to dog sit.

, While you should have a regular schedule, you do not have to plan your entire day around your dog. Your dog may not mind if you come home late one day or if you miss your weekly dog park visit for an appointment, as long as you do not do it too often.

, An easy way to increase the time you spend with your dog is to let them join you on your daily tasks. Whether you are at home or out doing errands, you can fit the dog into your lifestyle. You can:


Take the dog on car trips.
Talk to the dog while doing chores.Visit the pet store together.
Take the dog with you to the beach or park.
Ask your friends if you can bring your dog when you visit.

, Spending time with your dog should not feel like a chore. Appreciate your dog, and remember that they are a member of your family. Express gratitude to your dog for their love and loyalty, and reward them with your attention.


Occasional treats when your dog has behaved well is a great way to surprise your dog. Some people like to give holiday or birthday gifts to their dog. You can even find specialty dog treats at certain pet bakeries and stores.
You might consider bringing your dog on holiday with you. While you will have to find transportation and lodgings that allow dogs, the quality time and memories you make together will be invaluable.

Greet the dog with a treat when you enter the home.",How to Take Care of a Friend's Dog," If a friend asks you to watch their dog, only agree to do so if you have the time and space in your life. If you live in a tiny apartment and already have two dogs, adding a third might be stressful and overwhelming. If you work a 60 hour week and barely have any spare time, you might not be the best dog sitting candidate for your friend.Consider the dog’s activity level. Is it a dog that is very energetic that needs lots of time outside to run around each day? Or, is it a dog that is more mellow and relaxed? Make sure your lifestyle matches the dog you’re being asked to watch so that you’ll both be happy and comfortable.
Make sure you’re comfortable with the amount of time you’ll be caring for the dog. While a day or two might not be too overwhelming, a few week might be too much for you to handle. Discuss this with the dog’s owner beforehand.;
, If you’ve never actually met or become acquainted with the dog you’ll be caring for, it’s important to meet the dog before it’s time for the dog to be in your care. You want to make sure you’re comfortable with the dog, and that the dog is also comfortable around you. Try meeting up with your friend and the dog on neutral ground, like at a park. Spend a little while getting to know the dog.


If you’ve already met the dog you’ll be caring for, still try to spend a little bit of time with the dog before it’s in your care to renew your bond.

, Before the dog is left in your care, talk to its owner about what medications it’s on. Whether it’s medicine they have to take daily, or something they’ll need to take just once while they’re with you, make sure you have all the instructions for each medication before the owner leaves. It’s a good idea to have the owner write down these instructions, or for you to take notes yourself as they explain.Leave the instructions with the bottles of medication in a place where you can see it, but that is out of reach of the dog and/or any children in the house.
Having the number for the dog’s veterinarian is important, even if they aren’t on any medications. You’ll want someone to reach out to if anything goes wrong. Their vet will have all the dog’s records, so they can provide the best care in an emergency. They can also advise you on any medications if you lose the instructions, or aren’t sure about anything.

, Many dogs are on very specific diets. Make sure you know how much to feed the dog as well as when to feed them. Ask the owner if the dog likes to “graze,” or eat a little bit now and then throughout the day. This would mean leaving his food down all day, so if you have a pet of your own that might eat the food, make sure you work this out. Ask about any foods the dog isn’t allowed to have, and how many treats they’re allowed on a daily basis.Keep in mind that some dogs might be a little stressed out when their owner goes away, so their eating habits might change a bit until they adjust.

, Before you are left alone with the dog, make sure you’re aware of any possible aggression issues, housebreaking problems, or even shyness the dog might be dealing with. Some dogs might have leash aggression, or they might be very timid around new people. Some dogs might occasionally still have accidents in the house. Make sure you’re prepared for these potential problems, and talk with the dog’s owner about ways to deal with them successfully.If the dog has serious aggression issues, you might suggest that the owner board them with a professional boarding facility that is better equipped to handle that sort of behavior.

, If the dog will be staying at your home and you have pets in the house, make time to introduce the dog to your pets prior to the dog’s stay with you. Introduce your friend’s dog to your dog somewhere neutral first, like a park. Then, you can bring the dog to your home after they’ve been acquainted. Make sure they get along with any other pets in the house, like cats. If there are any issues, you’ll have time to sort them out before the owner leaves.Consider keeping the dog separate from your pets when you are not home. Since they are still new to one another, there might be a chance for one to become territorial over toys or aggressive when you aren’t there to intervene.

, Even if the dog sleeps in a crate at night, or stays in one while home alone, you really shouldn’t keep the dog in its crate just as a means of keeping it in one place. It’s a good idea to put up baby gates to confine the dog to a “safe” area of the house, or even to keep the dog separate from your pets while you aren’t around.If you plan to confine the dog to a certain part of your home, make sure that the dog still has access to water.

, Ask the owner how the dog usually sleeps at night in its own home. Does the dog sleep in bed with the owner? Does the dog sleep in a crate? Does the dog have its own bed? However the dog sleeps, set up a similar sleeping situation for it in your home. If the dog has its own bed, for example, bring that bed over to your house so it will have a familiar place to lie down and rest at night. If he sleeps in a crate, bring the crate to your house.Having something from the dog’s own home can be helpful. The item will smell like home, and it might act as a comfort for the dog. So, even if the dog sleeps in a crate, make sure to bring a blanket or pillow from its home to put in the crate with him.
If the dog usually sleeps in bed with its owner, but you aren’t comfortable with the dog sleeping in your bed, find some middle ground. For example, you could set up the dog’s own bed right beside yours on the floor.

, If you can, just use the dog’s regular bowls from its home. Make sure you know whether or not to leave food down all day for the dog, and make sure your own pets won’t eat the dog’s food. Make sure the dog always has access to fresh water. Change the water in the water bowl a few times a day to make sure it stays clean and fresh.


To deter your own pets from eating the dog’s food, try feeding them in separate rooms, or keeping them separated when you aren’t around if the dog needs food down all the time.
Consider putting down a mat or towel under the bowls. This will keep water from sloshing onto the floor, and help keep the dog’s food bowl in place while he eats.

, To ensure the safety of the dog, make sure to put all fragile and/or toxic or harmful items out of reach. Put up loose cords, remove items from the coffee table, put away the trash can or make sure the lid is securely shut, keep all food put away and out of reach, and keep toilet lids shut. This will help keep the dog out of trouble, as it might be a little more curious than usual being in a new environment.Ask the owner if the dog has any chewing habits. If so, make sure to put shoes away in the closet and shut the door securely.

, Depending on the length of time you’ll be caring for the dog, you might consider simply staying at your friend’s home for your own convenience. Or, if you will just be caring for the dog a short time, simply checking in a few times a day might suffice. Either way, you will want to discuss this with your friend beforehand.


How often you check in might depend on the dog’s needs and activity level. For example, an older, more mellow dog might only need one or two short walks a day, while a younger, more active dog might require more frequent attention and checking on.

, Ask the owner what the normal routine is for the dog. Is the dog allowed on the furniture? Does the dog get one or two walks per day? Is the dog allowed in the backyard without a leash? Should you leave the dog’s food down all day? Whatever the normal rules and routines of the house are, try to stick to them as best you can. That way, the dog will feel more relaxed and won’t develop any bad habits while the owner is away.If the dog is usually left alone during certain hours of the day, it might be a good idea to let him be during that time. Since it’s part of his routine, it will be easier for him to get back to normal when his owner returns.
If the dog has a certain walk routine—like walks at certain times of the day—try sticking to that schedule. This will help keep the dog in its usual routine, even while its owner is away.

, If you’ll be going in and out of a friend’s home while they are out of town, make sure the neighbors know you’re allowed to be doing so. You don’t want to end up with police knocking on the door because a neighbor saw a strange person! Before the owner leaves, be sure to have them introduce you to the neighbors and let the neighbors know that you’ll be dogsitting.The neighbors might also be able to pop in and let the dog out if you have an emergency, so ask the owner to leave a key with a neighbor they trust, and get that neighbor’s contact information.

, Once the owner leaves, the dog might be surprised to see someone unfamiliar entering the home. Keep a little bag of treats in your car or bag, and offer the dog one when you enter the door. Make sure you use a type of treat that the dog usually gets—try grabbing a handful of the treats their owner already has. This will help the dog relax and trust you when you first enter.You might not have to do this every time you enter. Just do it the first few times until the dog is used to you coming in, instead of its owner.

, All dogs should be taught obedience routines. Find out whether the dog knows how to respond to commands to sit, lay, stay, come, heel, and other simple behaviors. If so, try the commands and use food rewards. This command and treat process helps to create bonding with people. You get to know the dog better and its behavioral issues, quirks and preferences.

, Some dogs consider it a threat. Look off to the side. Dogs bare their teeth when they are ready to lash out and may take your pearly whites the wrong way.

, This is a good way to start. However, observe signs that the dog is done with being petted. Many dogs won't let you pet them when they want to play, so play with them instead.


When petting the dog, find its ""sweet spot."" For example, if you are scratching its ear and it leans its head towards you, that shows that it likes it. If you rub its belly and its leg twitches, that's also a good thing. However, if it leans away from you when you scratch it somewhere, the dog obviously doesn't like it.

, The fastest way to a dog's heart is through its stomach. Soft treats that give off a strong meat scent are usually a great way to get attention. If the dog is being trained, get him or her to sit, or lie down, or stay before giving the treat. Don't offer treats too often if you're using them in training. If they come too easily, the dog thinks every action is the correct one.


Remember, if the dog isn't your own, always ask permission from its owner before attempting to feed the dog.
Treats are fun for you and the dog––you get to see the dog do tricks and the dog gets a treat for doing it.






Don't overdo treats––an overweight dog carries health risks.

, Don't always be smothering the dog, or it may begin to avoid you. Every animal needs some time to not be bothered, so respect its space and it'll enjoy the time around you more.

, For example, say ""Good dog/Fido"".

, Every dog likes a pet on the back!

, However, you must ask its owner if it likes these first. While most dogs love belly rubs, some don't. If the dog loves it, you will love it too as you get to observe the way its little tongue sticks out, with its little eyes looking at you with happiness.

, If you can, offer to occasionally take it on a longer walk every weekend or any day where you have additional time to walk the dog. This gives exercise for you and the dog and gets you in the good books with the owner, as walking regularly or for long distances can be hard for an owner to fit in all the time. This will make the dog happy and provides more bonding time for you.


Ensure that the dog knows how to heel properly; this ensures that you can direct it without the dog pulling you over or tripping you. This skill also helps the dog to release energy.







, Take a few minutes out of your day to brush the dog. It'll benefit from the daily attention, and its coat will be healthier too. Plus, if you keep complaining to your date that there is dog hair everywhere, you'll be helping to reduce it!

, This will help the dog to get to know you better and reassures the dog that you like him or her.

, This will help it to find your place its own territory too, which will help raise you in its esteem. Just make sure you do not use the digging area for plants or garden.

,, You can care for the dog each day, including letting the dog outside for at least 30 minutes a day and playing with it outdoors.

, The more time you interact with the dog, the greater the chance it will grow to love you.

This way he won't have to worry about when he may or may not get in trouble. Your dog will know he's loved, because he feels safe in the knowledge that you're in charge and taking care of him.Part of nurturing your dog is rewarding your dog's good behavior with food, attention, or play, and knowing how to correct bad behavior. This way, he won't repeat the action.;
, Since your dog will share your home, he needs to understand your rules and expectations, such as where to toilet, not chewing furniture, and not stealing food off of the table. If you don't set limits, your dog will find yours by doing something that upsets you. Setting boundaries also helps him cope with the outside world, making him less likely to act out dangerously.For example, if you don't set boundaries, don't be surprised if your dog one day tries to bite your partner or chews your favorite designer handbag.

, When you notice your dog breaking a rule, don't just ignore it sometimes and enforce it other times. This will send a confusing message to your dog, so that when you do correct him, he'll become conflicted and distressed. He may even challenge you by growling or attempting to bite.For example, if your dog is breaking a ""no dog on the sofa"" rule, distract him so he jumps down, then reward the good behavior of getting down. You may distract him by playing with his favorite toy or dropping a treat on the floor.
If the dog disobeys you again, you may need to put a leash on him in the house to keep him off the sofa. Or, you may need to put him out of the room, withdrawing attention.

, Start paying attention to your dog's body language in order to understand your dog better and what he's trying to tell you. For example, pay attention to signs that your dog feels uncomfortable. His head will lower, he'll glance away, cower down, and tuck his tail low. This will tell you that he's stressed and help you respond to his discomfort.By understanding how your dog feels, you can react appropriately by removing the dog from what's scaring him, distracting him with some training exercises, or backing away and reducing the pressure on your dog.

, Always respect your dog and the love that your dog has brought into the house. Be kind, caring and considerate in the way that you treat your dog. Your dog is a family member. Dogs read a lot into your tone of voice, so speak kindly to him and he will understand your intentions.Make your dog feel secure by never fighting with your family in front of the dog. Watching an argument may distress him.

, Your dog loves getting attention from you. Every day, set aside some time to spend with your dog, even if you're just watching TV together or stroking your dog's ears and resting. Make sure to talk to him, which will help develop your own language together. You might also encourage your kids or family members to read to your dog. Don't forget to rub, scratch, or massage your dog's tummy. This is a great way to show your love.


If your dog puts his head in your lap, it's not because he wants you to scratch behind his ears. He's actually trying to figure out where you've been, who you've been with, and what you just ate.

, Routines give a dog a sense of stability,which makes them feel more secure. He doesn't have to worry about future meals or walks because they always occur at set times. In a dog's world, routine means knowing what time he gets up, goes for a walk, has his meals, and when he's groomed. Having those things happen at a predictable time shows your love for your pet.Experts believe that a grieving or depressed dog can be cheered up by enforcing a routine rather than deviating from it.

, While your dog may enjoy treats, this doesn't mean he should always get them, instead of nutritious food. Instead, talk with your veterinarian about recommending a healthy dog food and correct amount to feed your dog. This way, your dog gets the vitamins and minerals he needs to thrive.By caring for your dog's health and only occasionally rewarding him with treats, you show him that you care.

, Make sure your dog has his own sleeping area that's set out of the way of people or storage. This will give your dog a space to withdraw to if he's simply had enough and needs to relax or calm down. He should have a den or safe place that contains a comfortable bed.Consider crate training him, which gives your dog a space to lie down in. You may want to partially cover the crate, so it's secluded and he can feel like he's in a den. This will help him relax when he's overwhelmed or tired.

, Depending on your dog's breed, being cooped up could potentially drive him crazy. Working and herding dogs typically have a lot of energy, and that energy needs to go somewhere productive and fun. Play fetch to get your dog running around or go for a walk (or jog, if you both like a challenge). Walks also give a dog a chance to see their world and sniff around as dogs naturally do.</ref>


A well-exercised dog is a fulfilled dog, who is far less like to have behavioral issues such as destructiveness or disobedience.
Small dogs have a lot of energy, but it is quickly used up. A short walk should give a small dog enough exercise for the day.
Dogs with thicker builds are typically more sedentary and will be less interested in exercise. Still, it's good to get them outside once in a while.

, Look into reward-based training programs. Try to do two 10 to 20 minute training sessions every day and make them fun. If your dog doesn't already know them, start with the basics like, ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""come."" Your dog will love earning rewards and showing off his skills to other people when he learns a trick.Training keeps dogs mentally stimulated and is a great chance for some one-on-one attention, which they love. Keeping your dog mentally active is a great way to show you love him, because it adds purpose and stimulation to his life, and helps him look forward to each day.

, Let your dog know he's behaving well by rewarding him with small food treats, extra praise, or a game with a favorite toy. If you give food treats, choose ones that are healthy and made specially for dogs. Or, you can make them at home. Remember to immediately reward the dog for good behavior so that he makes a positive association with the action."

If you're thinking about getting a dog, be prepared for a lot of responsibility.,
Make sure you have everything your dog will need, such as a dog bed, dog bowls for food and water, good quality dog food, and a leash and collar before adopting or purchasing your dog.

,
Spend time with them.,
Provide somewhere suitable to sleep.,
Be sure to feed your dog at least three times a day.,
Feed your dog the right kind of food to have a healthy diet.,
Make sure you have time to walk your dog at least once a day so that they can get exercise.,
Groom and wash your dog.,
Train carefully and consistently.,
Provide substitute care when you're gone.",How to Look After Your Dog," Think of them as your furry baby. You'll need to spend a lot of time with them, care for them, and buy them the things they need. Before you decide on a dog, do a bit of research to find the kind of dog that will be best for you. Some breeds are easier to care for than others, and some dogs will need special care for disabilities or illnesses. If you have the time and money for it, always try to get a dog like this. They are difficult to find homes for and are usually put down by shelters.;
,, Dogs are very social animals, so you need to pay lots of attention to them to make them feel happy and loved. Pet them and play with them every day. Getting another dog is usually a good idea to prevent them from getting lonely, if you have the space and money for it and you have enough room

, When your dog is a puppy, they will need to go to bed early. Make sure you have a comfy bed for them to sleep in and that they go to bed as often as they need to. On average, dogs need about 12-14 hours of sleep, but may need more or less depending on their breed, size and age., Provide fresh water at all times.

, If your dog isn't eating, you might want to try changing the brand of food that you're giving them; however, they may be sick, and will need to see a vet if they still won't eat.

, If dogs aren't walked enough, they may develop heart problems, become overweight, or develop destructive tendencies. Remember not to overwork your dog: they need to build stamina the same way humans do, so you want to take it easy on them at first, especially if they're already overweight.

, Make sure you buy a quality brush that fits the needs of your dog's coat. You should also be sure to wash your dog when ever they get too dirty, but not too often, as your dog's skin may become too irritated; bathing your dog every week or every other week is too often. If they don't like bathing, be sure to reward them afterwards. If you're having trouble grooming your dog by yourself, or they have a difficult coat to look after, take them to a groomer every six to eight weeks, depending on how fast their hair and nails grow.

, When training your dog, make sure it's in a big place such as a park or a big backyard.


Always reward your dog, with a treat or a pet, when it has done something well during training. This will reinforce that they are doing a good thing, and will make them listen to your commands more often

, If you are away on vacation, make sure to leave your dog with a pet-sitter or at a kennel so that they are taken care of, even without you there.

Socialize your dog with others.",How to Treat Your Dog," These fundamental needs can't be ignored, even for a day. Puppies need to eat three times a day, but full-grown dogs usually eat just twice. Fresh, clean water should be provided at all times, so your dog can drink whenever it gets thirsty.Pick out the right kind of food for your dog's size, age, and breed. Different types of dogs have different nutritional needs. Most dog food packages detail how much food should be given daily depending on the size of the dog.
Make sure to buy food with high quality ingredients. Dogs have sensitive digestive systems and can become ill if they aren't fed high quality food. Don't feed dogs human food, especially junk food that's high in salt and sugar. A good rule of thumb is to look at the first ingredient on the dog food package. If it is a meat - not cornmeal -- this food will be higher in those essential proteins your dog needs daily.
Consult with your veterinarian about how often your puppy or dog should be fed to meet its metabolic needs.;
, Dogs may be distantly related to wolves, but they're domesticated creatures who enjoy the creature-comforts of home as much as we humans do. Your dog needs a clean, dry, and warm place to sleep at night. Whether your dog sleeps indoors or outside, make sure it has a space that's sheltered from the elements with a regulated temperature.


If your dog spends a lot of time outside, it needs a place to take shelter when it rains, snows, or gets too hot or cold. Do not leave your dog outside in inclement weather.
Many dogs enjoy sleeping in kennels lined with comfy blankets with a few toys. Others prefer to sleep on a dog bed in their masters' bedroom, or in a special spot somewhere in the house., Dogs, like humans, need to move around to stay fit and healthy. Some breeds need to exercise for hours every day, while others are fine if they only go outside a few times each day. It's important to understand the needs of your breed and meet them. If you have a high-energy dog, be sure it gets plenty of exercise.


At the very least, walk your dog twice a day for 20 minutes. This is especially important if your dog has to stay cooped up in the house or apartment all day while you're gone.While you are walking your dog, make sure to know the leash law in the area. Do not let your pet off-leash unless the area is enclosed and your pet is protected from traffic.Dogs love going to dog parks and other facilities where they get the chance to run freely. However, be sure your pet is fully vaccinated before taking it to an area with other dogs. Diseases like parvovirus can stay dormant in the environment for several months putting unvaccinated puppies and dogs at risk when exposed to that environment., Your dog should see a vet about once a year to stay updated on all the necessary shots and receive an annual checkup. If your dog shows symptoms of illness in between regular appointments, call the vet and take it in for a diagnosis.If your dog has not been spayed or neutered, consider having the surgery done. It's a measure recommended by the ASPCA as a way to prevent the population of stray dogs from growing.Your dog should receive a rabies vaccination as well as other mandatory shots.

, Part of your responsibility as a dog owner is to keep your dog safe, just as you would a child. That means keeping your dog leashed when you're around traffic, making sure your yard is fenced so your dog can't run away and get into a dangerous situation, protecting your dog from larger dogs, and generally keeping it out of harm's way.Microchips can help identify your dog if it gets lost. Many companies actually offer services that’ll notify you if your dog has run astray.For example, make sure your dog doesn't fight with a wild animal by keeping it on a leash in areas where leash laws are in effect. Many wild animals carry dangerous diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. It is a good idea to bring your dog to a veterinarian if your dog comes into contact with a wild animal.Keep your house and yard free of dangerous objects your dog might try to eat, like electrical wires.Puppies are the most likely to chew on dangerous objects. A good way to make sure they stay safe is to place them in a small, puppy-proofed kennel area when you are not there to monitor their actions. Use this time to train them to chew on their toys only., You and your dog will both be happier if you spend time on proper house training. It's important to start early, when the dog is still a puppy. All puppies have accidents in the house at first, but with patience you can teach yours to go to the door when it needs to be let out. Reward your dog for going to the bathroom outside each and every time. Eventually, it will begin to understand that going outside is preferable to going inside.Take your dog to the same spot outside every time, so it will associate that place with going to the bathroom.

, If your dog likes to play-bite and bark a lot, you can train it to play more nicely. The most effective trick is to ignore your dog when it exhibits bad behavior, since dogs usually bite and bark for attention. When you withhold attention, your dog will realize the better way to get noticed is be well-behaved. If your puppy insists on trying to bite when you are ignoring it, simply walk away from the puppy. Reward good behavior with treats and praise., Learning how to sit, stay, and come are important commands for any dog. Your dog will be more obedient and you'll be able to take it out more often if you know it will come when called. A dog who knows how to sit, stay and come is safer than one who won't listen. Any dog can learn these basic commands. Remember to use patience and positive reinforcement when you're training your dog. Here are the commands every dog should know:


How to sit
How to stay
How to come

, Dogs are excellent at learning how to do tricks, and teaching your dog how to do them can be a great bonding experience. Not every dog can do back flips or ride a pony, but most can do a few tricks, especially when they're rewarded with treats. Here are a few tricks that most dogs have no trouble mastering:


Rolling over
Begging
Shaking hands
Playing dead
Fetching

, If you're mean to your dog, your dog will become afraid of you. Dogs look up to their owners like little kids look up to their parents. Treat your dog lovingly by speaking to it in a pleasant voice, spending time petting and cuddling, and showing lots of affection. When your dog is good, give it a treat and a belly scratch. Your dog will reward you with endless affection in return.


Research shows that dogs enjoy being petted even more than receiving praise. Pet your dog every day to show your dog how much you care., Yelling at your dog or hitting your dog is always a bad idea. It's cruel and also ineffective. Dogs who get treated meanly end up confused and scared; they don't know what you want them to do, so they either act out or cower. Never punish your dog for doing something wrong. Instead, reward your dog for what it does right to build trust and help your dog see the right thing to do.Positive reinforcement is the best way to get your dog to behave the way you want. Reward good behavior.Punishing your dog creates fear and general discontent.

, Dogs make wonderful companions you can take with you to the places you enjoy, like parks, beaches, or even just around the neighborhood. Your dog will enjoy excursions just as much as you, and taking it along is a great way to bond and have some fun together.


If you take your dog along in the car, open the window so it can enjoy the air. Just make sure it's not down so far that the dog can jump out.
If you take your dog along to places you like, make sure you follow leash rules and pay attention if dogs aren't allowed in a certain place.

, If your dog spends time around lots of other people and dogs, it will learn to be friendly and social. A good way to socialize your dog is to take it to the dog park, where it will get a chance to play with other dogs and dog-friendly owners.


Many dog parks are members-only, requiring pet owners to fill out an application before they're given a pass to enter the park. This is to make sure that all the dogs in the park have received their shots and prevent the spread of disease."

Introduce your dog to their sitter.,
Stay away for brief periods.,
Take a vacation with your pet.",How to Have Your Dog Taken Care of During a Vacation3," In addition to making sure your sitter is ready to care for your dog, you’ll need to do your best to get your pup ready for your vacation. Before you leave, spend extra time with your dog. Go for longer walks, sleep in late, and spend extra time playing fetch or tug of war. Whatever you like to do with your dog, spend some extra time with it so you’ll both feel better about your being away for vacation., This is essential. You can never know for sure how a dog will react to a person in their home when you’re away. However, the better acquainted your dog is with their sitter, the less likely they are to react poorly. If at all possible, have your sitter visit your home when you’re not there after the initial introduction to your dog to ensure the pup will respond positively to them when you’re away., This allows your dog to get used to you being gone. It will decrease your dog’s stress or anxiety when you’re away for the vacation. Start by going out for dinner directly after work. Then, stay overnight with a friend. If your sitter can feed or care for the dog while you take this extra time away that’s even better. Your dog will learn that, even if you’re gone for what feels like a long time, you always come back. This is important to prevent separation anxiety., If you can’t bring yourself to leave your pup at home, consider choosing a pet-friendly hotel and bringing your pup along. You can also plan pet-friendly vacations like hiking or camping. If you’re traveling by plane, you can even arrange to take your pet along.

Try to walk your dog twice a day—once in the morning and once in the early evening.


If you work, you should try to walk them before you leave for work and once when you get home from work.
If you walk your dog at the same time every day, soon your dog will start to expect walks at those times. This will help you set an important routine that improves their health and your relationship.

, Games provide both physical and mental stimulation for your dog. Set aside some time every day to play with your dog. You can play tug of war, hide and seek, fetch, or pounce and shake.You can look for toys that you can use to play with your dog. These include ropes, rubber rings, balls, and squeaky toys.

You can ask your boss or human resources if this is an option for you.If they initially say no, you might convince them to let you bring your dog. You can point out the benefits of bringing a dog to work, such as lower stress and higher morale. Some shops have even found that having a dog at work increases their business.Be respectful of people who have allergies or fears of dogs. If you have a coworker who does not want dogs at work, you should find another solution.

, If you have enough time, you might consider spending your lunch break at home with your dog. This will give you an opportunity to feed your dog and play with them for a little while before you have to return to work., If you can spare a little sleep, you might try waking up a half-hour or hour earlier than usual, and spend that time with your dog. You can take them on a walk, play with them, or groom them. This will help your dog get in some social activity before you leave for the day.If you already wake up very early, you may want to consider a different way to increase your time with your dog.

, If you cannot manage to come home, you might want to consider asking someone if they can walk and play with your dog during the day. If you have a friend or family member willing to do this, you could ask them. You can also hire a dog sitter or professional dog walker.You do not need someone to spend all day with your dog. It may be enough to have someone visit for half an hour in the late morning or early afternoon.
Doggy daycares are another option to help socialize your dog during the day. Your pup can play with other dogs and people. This can be a more expensive option, however.

, When you can’t be with your dog, it is important that you provide ways for your dog to entertain themselves. The best way to do this is to leave the dog with a variety of interesting toys that they can play with. This will ensure that the dog does not become destructive or bored while you are gone, and it can reduce their dependency on your company while you are home.


Food puzzles are a great way for your dog to keep busy. Stick a treat or peanut butter inside of one. Your dog may spend a long time trying to get it out.Chew toys can keep your dog busy for long periods of time. If you want to give your dog a bone, make sure you buy specially marked natural bones meant for chewing. Cooked bones can splinter and injure your dog.If your dog grows tired of a toy, put it away for a while and give the dog a new toy. When the dog tires of the new toy, you can give them the old one back again."

Obtain a list of requirements.,
Get your dog vaccinated.,

You can also search online. Type “your city or county” and “dog license.” Search through the results and look for an official government website.
Don’t delay. Depending on when you buy the dog, you might not be able to wait. For example, in Montgomery County, Ohio, you must register your dog immediately if you get it after January 31.;
, Each city will have different requirements you must meet. Generally, many cities will require that your dog have a rabies vaccination. San Francisco, for example, has this requirement.There also might be an age requirement. For example, many places require that dogs be licensed as soon as they reach three months old.

, Find a vet in your area and schedule a rabies vaccination. Give yourself enough time so that your dog is vaccinated before you apply for your dog license.


If your dog is too sick to handle the rabies vaccine, then you should contact your animal control office and ask what to do. In some cities, your dog will be excused from the vaccination requirement if your vet writes a letter stating that a rabies vaccination would harm the dog because of its age., Even where this isn’t a requirement, you might be able to pay a lower fee if your dog was spayed or neutered. For example, in New York City, you can pay $8.50 for a dog that has been sterilized but $34.00 if not.Get a copy of the sterilization certificate from your vet’s office. You will probably have to show it to the city office.
If your dog was spayed or neutered before you got it, then ask your vet to write a letter. In the letter, your vet can state they didn’t perform the surgery but have observed the dog and can confirm it has been sterilized."

Have your dog examined for hip problems.,
Keep your dog lean.,
Avoid allowing your dog to jump off furniture, cars and other high places.,
Perform hip strengthening exercises.,
Add traction to your home's floors.,
Avoid the ""weekend warrior"" syndrome.",How to Prevent Hip Problems in Dogs," By the time a dog is 2 years old, their skeleton usually shows signs of hip disease even if outward symptoms are lacking. If you suspect your dog is at risk of hip problems, visit an orthopedic specialist for an exam.;
, Obesity puts more stress on hip joints, which increases the risk of dog hip problems. When looking at your dog you should be able to see a faint outline of your dog's ribs and a slight waistline. Help your dog stay slim by basing meal amounts on how much activity your dog gets throughout the day, not necessarily on the recommendations provided on the bag of food. You can also consult with your veterinarian to find the right amount of food for your dog's age, breed and size.

, The impact of hitting the ground places excessive stress on your dog's hip joints. Instead, you can assist your dog by using a ramp or dog harness with a handle. By eliminating this high impact behavior, you are showing your dog better ways to ascend and descend places, which will be especially helpful as your dog slows down because of age-related decline.

, Consult with a certified canine rehabilitation therapist to learn specific exercises that can build stamina and strength in your dog's core muscles, which will better support aging hips. A canine rehabilitation specialist can design a dog hip exercise program just for your dog. In addition, simple exercises such as sit-ups and sit-downs can be done at home to help strengthen dog hips.

, Slippery floors are a sliding and tripping hazard to the aging dog and place strain on the hips each time your dog must sit down, get up or walk around without traction. If your home has slippery floors you can make your dog's life easier by adding carpet runners and throw rugs in places where your dog spends the most amount of time.

, A dog who only exercises once a week is at greater risk of dog hip problems than a dog who exercises several times a week. Explosive running and chasing does not provide the same kind of quality exercise that at-home strengthening and swimming in a warm pool offers. Instead of spending one long Saturday afternoon wearing out your dog at the dog park, break up your activity time into small daily sessions. When it comes to strengthening dog hips, it's not about quantity of time that you exercise together but the quality of exercises you perform together.

Complete the application.,
Pay your fee.,
Wait for the license.,
Replace lost tags.,
Renew your license.",How to License Your Dog2," Your city or county office should have an application you can complete. Some applications are available online. Each application is different, but they will generally ask for common information. In Maricopa County, Arizona, for example, you must provide the following when applying for a license for the first time:your name and address as the owner
name, breed, color, and age of your dog
date of rabies vaccination
manufacturer and serial or lot number of the vaccination used
date when re-vaccination is required
hospital or clinic where your dog was vaccinated
veterinarian’s license or ID number and signature that they gave the vaccination
proof of sterilization (if applicable)

, Submit your application to the appropriate address and pay your fee. The amount of the fee will vary depending on where you license your dog. Call ahead of time and ask about acceptable methods of payment.


In some places, such as Los Angeles, seniors qualify for a reduced fee.You should ask the office if discounts are available.

, Processing times will vary. For example, in New York City, you will need to wait two to four weeks to receive your license and tags.You may have to wait longer, depending on where you live.

, Typically, the city will charge you a small fee to replace the tags if you lose them. Contact the appropriate office and ask how to request a replacement.

Determine if your dog is a service animal.,
Apply for your license.,
Obtain a special service animal tag.,
Avoid buying certificates or permits.",How to License Your Dog3," The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal as any dog that helps a disabled person. Your dog is a service dog if it meets this requirement. A service dog generally does the following:alerts you to dangers if you are hearing or vision impaired
pulls wheelchairs or carries things for you
assists you with balance

, Your city might have a special application you need to fill out to license your service dog. You can get this from the same office that licenses every other dog in your city or county. Stop in or look online.


You also must pay a licensing fee and meet all other licensing requirements.

, Your city or county might have special tags reserved for service animals. These tags are convenient because they tell business owners that your dog is a licensed service dog. In New York City, you can get a service animal tag for free.These tags are usually optional. In the U.S., a business owner must allow you to use your service animal if you are disabled regardless of whether the dog has a particular tag.

, A license is not a permit or a certificate, and you shouldn’t confuse them. You must license your service dog, just as you would any other dog. However, you rarely need a permit or certificate for a service animal.Some countries require that service animals be certified. However, the U.S. does not have this requirement.
You should never register or seek a permit/certificate for your service animal with a private company. These are usually scams that provide no benefit to you. All the scammer does is print off a piece of paper and accept your money in return.
If someone contacts you about getting a certificate or permit, then call your county or city office. Ask whether you need any permit/certification apart from a dog license. Working only with government agencies protects you from being taken advantage of.

Take your dog to the vet.",How to Prevent Hypoglycemia in Dogs1," Toy breeds and puppies require more glucose than larger dogs, so they are more susceptible to hypoglycemia. To avoid this, feed your small dog often.Feed your dog a meal high in quality protein, high in fat, with complex carbs, like white rice.Make sure to keep small dogs warm if they are underweight or don’t eat.;
, Puppies under three months old can get hypoglycemia because they haven’t developed enough to regulate their blood sugar. Because of this, stress can bring on hypoglycemia. Limit stressors, such as poor nutrition, cold environments, and intestinal parasites., If your dog is going to be engaging in high levels of activity, such as hunting, then you need to feed him beforehand. Give him food a few hours before the activity. The food should be high in protein and fat.Intense exercise when a dog hasn’t eaten can cause hypoglycemia.

, Hypoglycemia is associated with certain conditions. If your dog has diabetes mellitus, she may develop hypoglycemia if she does not eat and is then given a dose of insulin, or is given too large a dose of insulin. Dogs with Addison’s disease, severe liver disease, pancreatic tumors, or portosystemic shunts are also at risk.If your dog has any of these conditions, then make sure to monitor her energy levels and make sure she eats often enough, and eats the right kind of foods.

, Dogs who have diabetes could end up with hypoglycemia if given too much insulin. It is more likely if the dog isn't eating well, if the dog skips a meal, if the dog vomits, or if amount of food changes.If your dog gets daily insulin, make sure the same person does it every day. This can cut down on double doses. Giving a dog too much insulin can result in death.Make a food and activity log for your dog to make sure he is getting consistent levels of food and activity.

, Pregnancy can cause blood sugar irregularities. If you have a pregnant dog, monitor her food intake and energy levels., If your dog gets hypoglycemia because he is not eating, you should want to find out why. Your vet can figure out if there is an underlying condition. There may be other factors that cause hypoglycemia, which can also cause problems and need to be checked by the vet.

Minimize exposure to chemical such as flame retardants, weedkillers, tobacco smoke, vehicle exhaust, detergents, and air fresheners.;
, Holistic veterinarians argue that over-vaccination is a stimulus for cancer in dogs. While there does seem to be a slight risk of sarcoma (a cancer of the soft tissues at the site of injection) with the rabies vaccine, this needs to be balanced against the horrific consequences of acquiring rabies infection. As for other vaccinations, there is no hard and fast evidence that this is the case, and more work needs to be done to prove the point one way or the other.In the case of the rabies vaccine, the cause of the increased risk is not known, and one theory is that stabilizers added to the vaccine (rather than the rabies virus itself) are responsible. Of these, aluminium has been most mentioned, although this argument is not completely convincing, as some vaccines that don't contain aluminum have also caused sarcoma.
Discuss the risks with your veterinarian (as reactions are very rare, especially in dogs) before deciding not to have the vaccination.Deciding against vaccination to err on the side of caution about causing cancer, does place your pet at the considerably greater risk of picking up diseases that can be fatal or debilitating. Be aware if you opt against vaccination, you could be reducing a tiny risk but increasing a larger risk, so your decision should be carefully balanced on a risk evaluation basis.
Also be aware that if you opt against giving the rabies vaccination you may be breaking the law in your state.

, It is a good idea to keep your dog in lean or normal body condition by controlling how much he eats, rather than letting him become overweight. There is also a vocal lobby who believe that additives in prepared dog food are a cancer risk.There are no clinically proven studies to prove this point, so this is something you need to consider for yourself. It is best to reach your own conclusion by researching the literature and checking for trustworthy scientific papers where the weight of evidence is compelling. At the present time, this evidence is lacking, which means one opinion is as good as another.
The alternative to a commercial diet is a home-cooked diet made from organic foods. However, this is not as simple as it seems because dogs have complex nutritional needs. It is all too easy to feed a dog a diet deficient in vital minerals or proteins. In the long term this can cause deficiency disease, which is every bit as debilitating as some forms of cancer.

, While neutering can decrease the risk of certain cancers, it increases the chances of others. Because the risk of certain cancers depends heavily on a variety of factors, such as age and breed, these pros and cons should be thoughtfully discussed with your veterinarian in order to decide the best course of action for your particular dog.Some of the debates about desexing revolve around at what age to spay and neuter animals. At present, one of the strong arguments for spaying a female dog is that it protects her against mammary cancer in later life. The chances of mammary cancer in a spayed female after she has had two menstrual cycles is one in four. For a female spayed between her first and second season, this risk falls to one in 10,000, while for a bitch spayed before her first season the risk is just one in 25,000. This is a compelling reason to get females spayed at a very young age.However, early spay seems to place female dogs at slightly greater risk of certain other cancers, such as hemangiosarcoma (cancer of the blood vessels) and osteosarcoma (bone cancer), especially in larger breeds.This increased risk is lower than that of mammary cancer, but these other cancers are all potentially aggressive and difficult to treat, whereas there is a spectrum of seriousness for mammary cancer.
With regard to male dogs, neutering removes the testicles and therefore the risk of testicular cancer. However, studies indicate a slightly increased risk of prostatic cancer and bone cancer (again, especially in large breed dogs).

, Be vigilant for general changes in your pet's eating habits, bowel movements, and demeanour. If these become abnormal the cancer is just one possible explanation amongst many, but again, the sooner it is checked out the better the likely outcome for the pet.

, It is essential to check your dog over regularly in order to detect new lumps and bumps. Once a week check your pet over from head to tail, feeling her skin, and becoming familiar with how her body feels.


If you find a skin mass or a lump under the skin, the very least you should do is monitor it. Measure the lump with a ruler once a week and write the measurement down. If the lump is increasing in size rapidly, then a vet check is essential.

, Getting a lump checked by a professional early gives your dog the best chance of a full recovery if the lump is cancerous. In a worst case scenario, where the lump is malignant and liable to spread, surgical removal at the earliest opportunity reduces that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.


Plus, intervention when a lump is small means surgery is less complex and the outcome is more likely to be successful.

Increased hunger
Blurred vision
Confusion
Lack of energy
Loss of consciousness
Anxiety
Shivering
Heart palpitations
Seizures

, Hypoglycemia is generally a symptom of some other disease.The symptoms of hypoglycemia might also be confused with other conditions. The best way to figure out if it it hypoglycemia is to check the dog’s blood sugar., You can treat the hypoglycemia in a few ways. You can give the dog food and find a way to keep him warm. If the dog won’t eat, try giving him some honey, syrup, or glucose gel. You can rub the sweetener on the dog’s gums if he won’t swallow.


If your small dog is refusing to eat and shows signs of low blood sugar, you can give him glucose.

To help you remember, create a simple tick box chart and note when you've give the medicine. If you need to give medication twice a day, it's most effective to give each dosage at twelve hour intervals. For example, give one dose at 8 am and the other at 8 pm. You should also ask if the medication needs to be taken with meals.Charting when you medicate can be especially helpful if you're sharing nursing duties with a partner. This way, you know if the other person has treated the dog.;
, A dog's demeanor says a lot about how he's physically feeling. You'll need to make sure his health is gradually improving and responding to treatment. For example, he should begin to pay attention to you, wag his tail, and get up to greet you. It's also a good sign if he perks up and starts asking for food.


If you notice your dog becoming less interactive (just lying still), he may be getting worse and need medical attention., If he is vomiting and not drinking then you need to make sure he doesn't become dehydrated. After he vomits, withhold food for 12 to 24 hours, but keep offering water.If he is unable to keep fluids down either, immediately contact the veterinarian.


Be prepared to tell your vet how many times in a specific span of time your dog has vomited. However, if he's vomited just once and resumed eating and drinking again, it's probably no cause for alarm., You'll need to follow your dog into the yard to see what he eliminates. While a little diarrhea might be expected with your dog's illness, contact the vet if you notice large volumes of watery diarrhea. You should also check his stools for blood (another reason to see the vet). Your dog may need intensive supportive care like intravenous fluids.Even if your dog has a little diarrhea, be sure to offer lots of fluid. Ensure that he's getting more fluid than he's losing.

, Look at your dog's gums, which should be pink and moist. If they're dry feeling, he may be dehydrated. You can also lift up the scruff of your dog's neck and let it drop. If hydrated, it should immediately return to the original position. If dehydrated, the skin will slowly fall back over the course of a few seconds, rather than snap back. Dehydration in a sick dog is a cause for concern, so take your dog to the vet.


If you notice your dog is dehydrated, you can try offering fluids. If he takes them, continue to watch for dehydration. However, if he can't keep fluids down, get immediate medical care. Your dog may need medication of intravenous fluids to prevent organ damage., Your dog's breathing can tell you a lot about how he's feeling. If he's in pain, he may breathe heavily or pant. Coughing and heavy breathing are signs of a chest infection. You should also check your dog's gums if his breathing causes exaggerated chest movements. The gums should be pink and healthy, but if they look pale or tinged blue, contact the vet. Your dog might not be getting enough oxygen and could be in respiratory distress.Count how many breaths your dog takes a minute (normal is 20 - 30) and keep an hourly record. If the rate steadily increases, his condition is deteriorated and you need to contact the vet., Your sick dog should have somewhere he can lie down and rest. He might like a padded bed (like a bean bag) or sheepskin rug that's soft and supportive. Set up a resting area in a quiet spot so he's not disturbed. If your dog is small or shaking and shivering, cover him with a blanket or offer a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel (so it doesn't scald his skin).


If he is liable to vomit or dribble urine, you may want to lay a puppy pad over the bed to soak up any bodily fluids. Puppy pads also prevent your dog from lying in his mess.
Your dog should change positions regularly if he's not moving around much. To prevent pressure sores, turn your dog to rest on his opposite side every hour, if he's not sleeping.

, If your dog is allowed to drink, make sure that he has a water bowl within reach so that he can lap without getting up. It may be a good idea to place several water bowls around the house. This can remind him to drink and prevent dehydration. If your dog is staying hydrated, you'll also want to take him out for regular toilet breaks, such as every four hours.


If your dog has diarrhea, he should be able to get to a toilet area quickly, especially if he can't make it outside. Ensure he has a flap, leave a door open, or put puppy pads down so he can easily eliminate without feeling guilty.

, If your dog has vomited, don't feed him anything for 12 to 24 hours. This will give his stomach a chance to rest.When he's ready to eat, feed him smaller meals frequently. You might want to divide his daily ration into six smaller portions, feeding them every two or three hours throughout the day. If he's not eating well, try warming the food slightly and hand feed him. Remember to take your dog out for a toilet break after eating.Your veterinarian may suggest a special diet for your sick dog. For example, dogs with sickness or diarrhea should eat a bland, easy to digest diet like cooked chicken breast or white fish with boiled white rice.

, Your sick dog may soil himself with urine or feces. Not only will this make him uncomfortable, but the urine can burn the skin (urine scald). If he does soil himself, give him a blanket bath. Soak a cloth in clean water and wash the fur, refreshing and rinsing it in clean water until the cloth comes away clean. If he's constantly dribbling urine, apply a layer of petroleum jelly to the skin of his belly and be sure to wash the area regularly.


If you're using them, remember to change soiled puppy pads for fresh ones.Your dog probably won't groom himself often while he's sick. Use balls of damp cotton wool to keep his eyes clean and free of discharge.

, It's understandable that your dog may feel vulnerable when he's sick. If you act calmly and quiet around your dog, this can reassure him. Stroke him gently to relax him. When he appears to be improving, brush or groom him to improve his mood and self-esteem.


Your dog should be in a warm, comfortable place where he's able to get rest. Check on him periodically to let him know you're around and watching out for him.

Get supportive care.",How to Prevent Canine Distemper," A puppy should be given a full course of vaccinations as soon as possible. Typically the first dose of vaccination is given from 6- 8 weeks of age, and then every 3 - 4 weeks until the pup reaches 16 - 20 weeks of age.When the puppy reaches around 14 months of age it requires a top-up booster vaccination. After that, it will need another booster every three years for the rest of its life.Dogs that are most at risk of distemper are those that do not have any immunity to it. Typically these are puppies aged 3 - 6 months, or dogs that have not been vaccinated against distemper and have no natural immunity to this disease.;
, The mainstay of prevention is vaccination. An effective vaccination is available and all responsible dog owners should make sure their dogs are vaccinated and receive regular booster doses of vaccine. This is especially important given that apparently healthy dogs may be excreting distemper virus, thus putting other dogs at risk but without giving any warning signs., Breeding bitches should be up-to-date with their distemper vaccination prior to falling pregnant. This helps ensure that they pass on a good level of passive immunity to the pups when the suckle. A nursing bitch produces antibodies which pass via the milk to the puppies - these are known as maternally derived antibodies, and they give the puppy passive protection for the first few weeks of life (typically up to about 6 - 8 weeks of age.) , Be aware that if you have wildlife populations in the area, your dogs may be at increased risk. This is because of the ability of foxes or raccoons to harbor distemper virus and act as a reservoir of infection for domestic dogs. Thus, it is important to get your dog vaccinated., It makes good sense to keep food and water bowls clean, not just because of the risk of distemper infection, but as a measure of good hygiene. Most regular household disinfectants kill distemper virus, including a 1:20 dilution of household bleach with water , Distemper virus in the environment is not particularly hardy, and is destroyed by heat and dry conditions, as well as most common disinfectants. However, it can survive for a few weeks at temperatures just above freezing.The most common source of infection is through contact with bodily fluids. This might be through contact with diarrhea or vomit containing the virus, or through the air when the dog sneezes.
Dogs can become infected if they use contaminated food or water bowls. They can also get infected if they sniff and explore in an environment contaminated with viral particles.This is why the virus is so infectious and why it's so important to have your dog vaccinated.

, This means that you should not take an infected dog to a dog park or any area where there are a lot of other dogs. Unvaccinated dogs need to be kept away from dogs with distemper. This includes dogs who have recently recovered from an illness that could have been due to distemper.


An added complication is that dogs can shed distemper virus for several months after they have recovered from the first stage of the disease. Thus, outwardly they appear fine but they remain an infection risk to other dogs.Socializing a dog that is infected with distemper can be hard. If you have another dog that you are absolutely sure is properly vaccinated, then you can have them interact. However, it is always better to be safe than sorry. Dogs do not have a lifelong resistance to distemper once they are vaccinated once. The vaccination must be boosted regularly to keep its effectiveness.If you are in doubt at all, keep the infected dog away from all other dogs.

, Distemper is caused by a morbillivirus from the family paramyxovirus. It is highly contagious between members of the dog family and wildlife, such as mink, ferrets, raccoons, skunks, coyotes, and foxes.The virus is very much like the measles in humans.It can impact a dog's respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems, as well as its vision., It is important to understand the symptoms of distemper so that the illness can be treated, and the animal can be isolated, as quickly as possible. Signs of distemper include:Fever: One of the first signs is a raised temperature, as the virus multiplies in the body. The fever may make the dog depressed, quiet, and listless. It is likely to go off its food.
Respiratory signs: These include a cough, with a snotty nasal discharge and a gummy discharge around the eyes.
Gastrointestinal signs: Next the dog develops vomiting and diarrhea. He is progressively weaker due to a lack of appetite, and fluid loss from the sickness and diarrhea. Some dogs succumb at this point and die, whilst others do recover.
Neurological signs: These can develop weeks to months after recovery from the respiratory and gastrointestinal signs. The dog may develop seizures, become blind, or become poorly coordinated.
Hardpad: One of the lasting effects for dogs that survive distemper is that they develop hard pads and nose. This is why the common alternative name for distemper is ""hardpad.""

, The prognosis for a dog with distemper is not good. Some dogs do survive, but not usually. This is especially true if the dog has the neurological signs of the virus.However, your veterinarian should give the dog treatment to ease any discomfort and eliminate any secondary infections.


Treatment can include IV fluids, anti-seizure medications, anti-diarrheals, and antibiotics.
You should also focus on making the dog as physically comfortable as possible. Keep it warm and cozy at home. Shower the dog with love and attention while you still have time with it. Basically, do all that you can to ease its suffering and make the time it has left as pleasant as possible.

If the veterinarian advises intravenous fluids are necessary, where possible take that advice because it could save your dog's life. Be aware a dog with parvo will produce large volumes of bloody diarrhea and it can be difficult to cope safely with the volumes involved. Also, if you own multiple dogs and take a sick dog home to nurse, without the proper ""barrier"" nursing, to prevent accidentally spreading infection on shoes or utensils, then you are putting your other dogs at risk. Veterinary clinics have special isolation facilities, and protocols for dealing with such infections in order to prevent spread.If your dog stayed at the vet, the vet would likely give your dog IV fluids to help rehydrate your dog and medications such as anti-nausea medications to treat the symptoms. Your vet would also be able to continue to analyze your dog's electrolyte and protein levels, providing treatment as needed.She would be able to isolate your dog better than you can do at home, especially if you have other dogs.
Parvo is a viral infection, which is why it is passed so easily and why it is difficult to treat. It is most prevalent in puppies up to 6 months old. The gastrointestinal version affects your dog's digestive tract primarily, leading to dehydration and the dog not be able to take in the nutrition he needs. The other type of parvo affects the heart, and it is not readily treatable at home.;
, You deliver subcutaneous fluids under the skin. IV fluids are better, which are given in a vein, but you will not likely be equipped to provide IV fluids at home. Your dog needs fluids because parvo dehydrates your dog through diarrhea and vomiting, and he may not be able to take them orally at first due to the vomiting.These fluids help with the dehydration. However, in seriously ill animals, their circulation is often so poor that the fluids are poorly absorbed from beneath the skin.


Your vet is the best place to find these types of fluids.
In addition, your vet can give you advice on what type of fluids and how much to administer to your dog.

, You will need a syringe with a 20 gauge needle, though slightly smaller (22 gauge) or slightly larger (18 gauge) needles may be used for differently sized dogs. Ask your vet what the right size is for your dog. You can use a differently sized needle for drawing fluids, say slightly smaller, so you don't inject the fluids with the one you used on the dog. Use a new sterile needle for each injection.

, The fluids will likely be in a plastic bag contained in a larger bag. Tear the larger bag off the fluids. The most common type you'll see is Lactated Ringers Solution (LRS). Sterilize the injection port by using an antiseptic on a cotton ball, and take off the cap. Insert the needle into the injection port. Pull back on the plunger to draw fluids into the syringe. How much you give is based on how much your dog is losing and how much your dog needs over 12 hours, information provided a few steps down.


Throw the needle you're using away when you're done. It shouldn't go back into the fluids.
You may not want to use the fluids again at all. Talk to your vet about whether or not it's appropriate to keep fluids for more than one use.

, You must know your dog's weight before you begin. Weigh your dog if you need to do so. For instance, puppies that weigh 5 pounds or under need 50 to 75 cubic centimeters of fluid every 12 hours. You definitely want to offer fluids more than every 12 hours; these amounts should be spread out over 12 hours. Ask your vet how often you should be giving subcutaneous fluids and how much you should be giving each time.You may need to provide fluids as often as every hour.


Dogs that weigh about 10 pounds need 100 to 150 cubic centimeters every 12 hours, while 20 pound dogs need 150 to 300 cubic centimeters and 40 pound dogs need 200 to 400 cubic centimeters.For 50 pound dogs, give 300 to 500 cubic centimeters ever 12 hours.Keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates. A dog losing extra fluid in the form of sickness or diarrhea requires extra fluids. Be aware that placing large volumes of fluid under the skin can actually damage the skin, and cause it to die off and slough away in a few days time. Again, where possible, go with intravenous fluids.

, Take a moment to calm your dog by petting him and talking gently to him. Have him lay down, and if possible, have someone else hold on to him while you're working so he doesn't run away. Lift the loose skin on your dog's back. Insert the needle into the loose skin only.You can administer the fluids anywhere along the back of the neck or back, as long as there is enough loose skin. Steadily push the plunger in to release the fluid under the skin.
The fluids will make a bump under the skin, but they will be taken into the bloodstream soon as long as the dog is not in shock and has a good circulatory system., While doing so, use your fingers to squeeze around the hole, massaging the area as you do. You don't want the fluids to come back out., Fluids may pool under your dog's skin if you are giving too much. You'll see swelling around the sides of the chests and sometimes in the legs. If that happens, watch your dog until the pools disappear, and then resume giving him liquids, though you should lessen how much you are giving him., Your veterinarian can provide you with drugs to ease the vomiting. Since you can only treat the symptoms of parvo, not the actual disease, this step is one of the most important to provide comfort for your dog.Your dog may also need a medication to control diarrhea.Brace your dog against your body or a wall. Use one arm to hold him.Fill the syringe with the amount recommended on the bottle. Insert it gently between the cheek and teeth.Slowly push in the plunger. Let the medication drain into your dog's mouth., Though antibiotics will not do anything for the parvo, they will stop another infection from taking over. Your doctor can provide you with antibiotics, as well. Follow the directions on the bottle, and give the liquid orally as provided in the previous step., If your dog is particularly severe, your vet may need to provide pain relief, as well. You give this medication the same way as the others as needed., One study found that a using a certain medication regimen at home greatly increased a dog's chances of surviving. The first part of the regimen is giving a strong anti-nausea drug, Maropitant, once a day. The other part of the regimen is having the vet give one dose of long-lasting antibiotic under the skin when the dog is diagnosed (Convenia), and then having the pet parent give subcutaneous fluids 3 times every day. Ask your vet if these drugs are right for your dog., You only give subcutaneous fluids while you are trying to slow down your dog's vomiting. Once your dog is able to keep fluids down, you can use an electrolyte-infused drink, such as Pedialyte, to help your dog get hydrated., These syringes have a stronger, wider tip, so they make it easier to give your dog fluids. You will not put a needle on the end to provide oral fluids.

, Use the syringe to draw up fluids. Stick the syringe in the bottle, and pull back the plunger to the appropriate line.Give 2 to 4 cubic centimeters for each pound your dog weighs per hour., Your dog will likely be weak from parvo, anyway. However, if your dog fights, you will need to hold your dog or have someone hold him for you while you give him oral fluids.Try bracing the dog against your body so that he can't move around as much.Hold him with one arm while you give him the liquid with the other., Start by inserting a finger into the mouth between the cheek and the teeth. Push the syringe gently in. The jaw does not have to be open. Push the plunger down, releasing the liquid into the mouth. The liquid should drain through the teeth., It may be tempting to lift your dog's chin to help the liquid drain to the back of the throat. However, doing so can make your dog breathe in the liquid, causing aspiration., Keep an eye on your dog after giving him liquids. If your dog throws it up, wait until later to try giving oral fluids again., Parvo is extremely contagious, which is one reason it is such a difficult disease. Your dog can remain contagious for as long as 2 months. Make sure to isolate your infected dog from other dogs in the family if possible, and keep him away from public spaces while he is still contagious. Even vaccinated dogs can still get parvo, so it's best to keep all dogs separate.Parvo is mainly passed through feces and fluids passing from one dog to another. It can even be passed by your dog sniffing another dog.If you have other dogs in the house, make sure that your sick dog is using the bathroom in a different area from your other dogs, as your dogs can catch it from the sick dog's feces as long as 2 months after the symptoms have passed., A dog's temperature usually runs between 101 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a dog's rectal thermometer to take your dog's temperature.Add petroleum jelly to the end. You can use another type of oil, such as baby oil, if you don't have have petroleum jelly. Insert the thermometer into the anus, going in about an inch. Go slowly, and be gentle. Digital thermometers should give you a reading in less than a minute.If your dog is too cold, you may need to warm fluids before giving them under the skin. You may also need to provide a heating pad. Just be sure to provide protection from the heating pad, as your puppy could be burned if he is directly on it. Use a thick towel or blanket between the dog and the heating pad., Once your dog has stopped vomiting and shows an interest in food, start with bland food. Skip the kibble for now. Instead, try very lean ground beef boiled with rice (be sure to skim off any fat) or cottage cheese. Yogurt is also a good option. Ask your vet for other options., Mix 30 parts of water with 1 part bleach. Use that mixture to sanitize hard surfaces in your home, especially ones where your dog has been. That will kill the virus but only on hard surfaces.For other areas, such as carpet and couches, wipe as clean as possible, and then get them steam cleaned. You might also consider quaternary ammonia for cleaning soft surfaces.For outdoor areas, the best you can do is pick up any of your dog's feces and water the yard a bit more often. The dilution can help lower the amount of virus in your yard over time, and the sun will also kill some of it., Once your dog has stopped showing symptoms, give him a bath with antibacterial shampoo. Repeat in a week.Make sure to let the shampoo sit for at least 5 minutes so it can work.Also, ensure you keep your dog warm while bathing by using warm water and warm towels when he gets out of the bathtub."

Limit your dog's exposure to high-risk environments.,
Get your dog vaccinated.,
Remove anything that attracts vermin.,
Isolate infected dogs.,
Disinfect any contaminated areas.",How to Prevent Canine Leptospirosis1," The bulk of leptospirosis prevention focuses on limiting your dog’s exposure to the environments where leptospirosis is likely to be lurking. Leptospirosis is often transmitted through stagnant bodies of water where infected wild animals have urinated or defecated.Keep your dog on a leash when walking or hiking in high risk areas, like marshy land or around stagnant ponds so that he doesn’t drink standing water. Don't allow your dog to drink or swim in standing water. When your dog is outside, provide fresh clean water and change his water regularly to prevent his drinking water from becoming infected.
You should also keep your dog away from raw sewage.
Keep your dog away from other dog’s feces and urine when you take him for a walk.
Separate infected dogs from healthy dogs as well.;
, Vaccinations are available that protect against the common leptospirosis strands.The initial vaccination is given to healthy dogs 10 weeks of age or older followed by a booster three to four weeks later.The vaccination lasts for a year and should be boosted each year.
These vaccines are only effective for the forms of leptospirosis which are more commonly found to cause disease symptoms in dogs. For the most part this will be adequate for the average dog.
Vaccinations do not work immediately after the first vaccine. After the booster vaccine the dog will then have full protection against leptospirosis.

, Another way to prevent leptospirosis is to remove or fix situations that might attract vermin to your property. Animals such as raccoons, skunks, opossums, and rodents can carry leptospirosis.Drain any stagnant water on your property. Stagnant water attracts vermin.
Keep garbage cans covered so these animals won’t be tempted to search for food in the garbage can.
Monitor bird feeders so they don’t attract these pests to your yard.
Trap any bothersome creatures with a live trap and release far away from your home or consult an animal exterminator if you cannot get rid of them.

, If your dog comes down with leptospirosis, you will need to keep in mind that he can spread leptospirosis to you or other animals. Put your infected dog in a separate room or area than other dogs.Make sure your other pets or family members don’t come in contact with the infected dog’s waste.
If you have to handle the infected dog, make sure to wear gloves at all times. Wash your hands after coming in contact with the dog.

, Dogs may pick up the bacteria from areas that haven't been disinfected. Properly cleaning any bodily fluids your pet sheds while infected can help reduce the risk of the bacteria spreading to other dogs.Be careful when handling your dog’s waste. Use gloves to pick up any stool. Make sure the dog only uses the bathroom in a spot that can be cleaned, like concrete. Don’t let the dog use the bathroom on the ground or dirt because the bacteria can soak into the ground and spread.
Most common household disinfectants will kill the leptospirosis germ, so bleach or other disinfectants can be used to clean the bathroom area, dog kennel, and water and food bowls.
Make sure to wash your hands well after touching the infected dog or his waste.

Look for the signs of infection.,
Take your dog to its veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Prevent Canine Infectious Hepatitis," The best way to prevent canine infectious hepatitis is to get your dog vaccinated against the disease. This vaccination can be done at the same time as a distemper vaccination, starting when a dog is 9 to 12 weeks old.Older dogs with an unknown vaccination status should be given the vaccine followed by a second one in 3-4 weeks. After the initial vaccines are done, it is common practice for a puppy or dog to get a yearly follow up vaccine to provide continuous protection.Because of the prevalence of vaccination, this disease is very, very rare.;
, Very young puppies (less than six weeks of age) should be kept close to home and away from other dogs, as the disease is spread with contact to infected feces, urine, or saliva.The only exception to this is if you know for a fact that the other dogs are fully vaccinated against the common dog diseases, including canine infectious hepatitis.


Do not let unknown dogs sniff at areas where dog’s urinate or at other dog’s feces, since the virus is spread via these routes. Also don't let unknown dogs lick your puppy, as the infection can travel in saliva as well.Also do not let your puppy drink or eat from bowls, dishes or other spots other dogs use. This is because saliva can spread the virus as well.

, Since infectious canine hepatitis is particularly hard on puppies, make sure the mother is properly vaccinated prior to breeding. This will help assure that newborn puppies are not born with the infection.


Mother dogs transfer some of their immunity to the disease to their puppies.However, there is no guarantee that the puppy will be fully protected from the disease in this manner, so keep the puppy isolated until it can receive its own vaccinations.
In addition, the protection passed on from the mother immune system can interfere with the puppy's own vaccinations. This is one of the reasons that vaccination is usually not done until the puppy is 9 to 12 weeks old.

, Canine infectious hepatitis is spread by contact with feces, urine, saliva, or other bodily fluids. In order to eliminate the chance of it spreading, it's important to keep public areas where dogs go to the bathroom clean, whether it be your front yard or the local dog park.


This means that before you let your dog roam a new area, you should make sure it is free of feces. This will not completely eliminate the chance of it being spread via urine or saliva, but it will decrease the chances.
If your dog is vaccinated for the disease, then it is protected from getting canine infectious hepatitis, even if it comes into contact with infected bodily fluids.
If your dog is infected, you should make sure that it does not go to the bathroom in any public areas. The dog can release the infection through its feces or urine even after it has been treated., Canine infectious hepatitis can be transmitted from foxes, wolves, bears, and other wild carnivores. In order to keep the risk of transmission low, try to dissuade these animals from coming into your yard, as they may go to the bathroom and expose your dog to the disease.The disease is uncommon, due to high rates of vaccination, but contact with wild animals is one reason that dogs still need to be vaccinated.

, Canine infectious hepatitis is a viral disease caused by a virus called canine adenovirus 1 or CAV-1 1.This virus is spread from an infected dog to healthy dogs by saliva, urine, and feces. Once it gains entry into the nose and mouth of the healthy dog, the virus will cause a local infection in the tonsils, and then spread via the bloodstream to the eyes, kidneys, liver, the blood vessels and other internal organs.If the dog’s immune system does not destroy the virus, it will go to the liver where it will reproduce. In the process it will also start to destroy the liver tissue.
It also travels to the kidneys and will be passed out in the urine for six to nine months if the body does not destroy the virus. This will create the potential for the infected dog to pass the illness on further.

, These are important to spot especially if you have an unvaccinated dog. However, some dogs will have what is called an unapparent infection, or the disease with no obvious signs. Signs of infection include:Fever often greater than 104 °F
Lack of appetite
Lethargy
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Bruising or “blood spots” on the skin
Swollen lymph nodes
Sudden death
Blue eye or bluish discoloration of the eye

, The consulting veterinarian will examine the sick dog and also run blood work to check for signs of infection and damage to the liver and other organs. These are typically a complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry.


An ultrasound and/or X-ray may also be done to check for liver enlargement or other internal abnormalities.
It's important to get a puppy that you suspect has the infection to a veterinarian as quickly as possible. A puppy's immune system may not be strong enough to fight off the infections, and the puppy could die if not treated quickly.

, Treatment of canine infectious hepatitis is usually supportive as there is no specific medication that can destroy the virus.Treatment will help support the patient’s body until the body can destroy the virus.


These treatments include IV fluids and good nutrition.Medications to treat fever, shock and/or to support the liver and kidneys may also be used on a case-by-case basis.

Check for muscle aches.,
Check for other general symptoms.,
Monitor for symptoms in humans.",How to Prevent Canine Leptospirosis2," If your dog has leptospirosis, he may exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms. He may suddenly have a decreased appetite and refuse to eat like he did before.Your dog may also start vomiting or have diarrhea.

, Leptospirosis may also affect your dog’s urinary tract. Pay attention to any changes in your dog’s bathroom habits. He may exhibit increased thirst, which may lead to him urinating more. This means he may need to go out more or start having accidents in the house.Your dog may also experience dehydration.
Leptospirosis may lead to kidney failure. If this happens, you may find blood in your dog’s urine.

, The condition may cause bleeding disorders or abnormal bleeding in your dog. Look for any bleeding from abnormal places, like a nosebleed. Look for any blood on the skin or gums.If your dog vomits, check it for any blood. Check your dog’s stool for any blood.
Your female dog may have a bloody discharge from her vaginal area.

, Your dog may exhibit lung problems. This includes difficulty breathing, so watch for your dog to start wheezing or struggling to get air. He may also start panting or breathing heavily when he shouldn’t be.Your dog may also start coughing more.

, Muscle aches can be a symptom for leptospirosis. Watch your dog when he moves and notice any limping or favoring of limbs. Notice if he is whimpering or whining when he moves or when you touch him. Look for any negative reactions when you pet him.If your dog feels pain or tenderness in his muscles, he may not want to move. This means he may lay around more and not be as active as he was before.

, Leptospirosis may cause other general symptoms that may be connected to other conditions. These symptoms include fever and eye inflammation.Your dog may also seem depressed or weak.
Leptospirosis may also cause liver problems, like jaundice, but may even cause liver failure.

, Leptospirosis can affect humans as well as dogs. Some people infected with the bacteria may have no symptoms, while others have more obvious signs. It can take two days to a month for a person to become sick after being exposed to the bacteria.The initial symptoms usually include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Untreated, the illness can result in kidney or liver failure or meningitis.
A person can be sick for a few days or up to a month. Recovery can take several months without proper treatment.

Diagnose leptospirosis.,
Treat the condition.,
Learn what leptospirosis is.,
Know how leptospirosis is spread.",How to Prevent Canine Leptospirosis3," There is no specific way to diagnose leptospirosis because there are so many variations of the disease. Diagnosis is done on suspicion of the disease. For example, the vet will consider the geographical area and the exposure of the dog to likely contaminated environments. The vet will also consider the dog’s symptoms.A dog with a fever of unknown origin, with acute kidney or liver failure, and likely exposure should be suspected of having leptospirosis.
There are blood tests that can be done to check for a few variations, but these are not commonly available in the veterinary clinic. Blood test results may show signs of infection or kidney or liver damage. Urine testing may also show kidney damage or infection.

, Treatment is usually supportive care and antibiotics. Supportive care can include IV fluids to help with kidney or liver damage or to rehydrate a dog that is vomiting or having diarrhea. Anti-vomiting medication and medication to control diarrhea can also be used.


The most commonly used antibiotic is doxycycline, which is used for at least two weeks. Only your veterinarian can prescribe antibiotics., Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria called leptospires.There are a number of varieties of leptospirosis, and which one your dog may be exposed to depends upon your geographical location.The bacteria travel via the bloodstream and lymphatic system throughout the body. They grow until the body’s immune system fights them.If the body is unable to fight the bacteria, the bacteria will replicate in many body organs for three to 20 days before circulating in the blood. Eventually, the spirochetes are excreted from the body via the urine to be spread to other animals, including dogs and possibly humans., The disease is most common in warm climates with high annual rainfall and in rural areas where dogs are more likely to come into contact with wildlife and livestock which have contaminated the environment and water with their urine.Dogs can also contract it in urban areas with heavy rat populations or by coming in contact with raw sewage in an urban environment.Dogs become infected by either drinking contaminated water or by the spirochetes entering the body through mucous membranes, cuts, or abrasions.
Bites from an infected animal or consuming flesh of infected animals can also spread this disease.
Children are at the highest risk for humans to contract leptospirosis from their pets."

Understand what is involved with the neutering surgery.,
Take your dog home.,
Keep your dog as calm as possible.,
Check the incision site twice a day.,
Keep your dog from excessively licking the incision site.",How to Neuter a Dog," There are three main benefits to neutering a male dog. These include a decrease in unwanted puppies, medical benefits to the neutered dog, and a reduction in negative behaviors associated with intact (unneutered) dogs.


Population control. A male dog that is neutered cannot produce any offspring. There already are 3.7 million unwanted pets that are euthanized (put to sleep) in the United States each year.By neutering your dog you take away the possibility of him contributing to this overwhelming problem.
Medical benefits. By removing the testicles any cancer or disease that affects these organs is prevented. Also, as a male dog ages it enlarges and it can become infected. Neutering prevents both of these problems and it decreases the chance of your dog developing prostate cancer.Negative behaviors. Intact male dogs develop behaviors that most people find repugnant. These include urine marking, aggression, roaming (to find females to mate with), and mounting behaviors.While neutering can completely eliminate these tendencies it can greatly reduce the occurrence and make behavior training a bit easier to perform.;
, You need to make sure your dog is healthy enough to undergo anesthesia, as it will be sedated and under anesthesia during the surgery. This always carries a little risk to the dog, so be sure your dog is healthy.


Proper feeding, exercise, and vaccinations will go a long way to ensure your dog is as healthy as possible.

, You will need to call your veterinary clinic or hospital to schedule a surgical appointment. They will give you their pre-operation protocol, which generally includes withholding food the night before surgery and discontinuation of certain medications.


They will also let you know if your dog will be able to go home the day of surgery or if they prefer to keep them overnight for observation.

, When you bring your dog to the veterinary office the day of surgery, your dog will be weighed and examined to make sure it is ready for surgery. If so, the dog will then be prepared for surgery.


This generally includes giving a sedative, placing a tube down the windpipe, putting the dog on anesthesia, putting in an IV (in the vein) line for fluids and medication administration, and shaving and cleansing of the surgery site.

, The operation itself is straightforward. An incision will be made either directly in the skin on top of the testicles or immediately forward of the testicles. Each testicle will be teased from the body, the blood vessels and attachments will be “tied off” with suture material, and then the testicles will be removed.


After carefully making sure there is no bleeding the incision site will be sutured, stapled or glued shut depending on the surgeon’s preference. The anesthetic gas will be turned off and the dog will slowly awaken from the anesthetic.

, Be gentle with it and give it some love and care. Follow your veterinarian’s advice about follow-up check ups after the operation and give all medications for pain as instructed.


Some veterinarians choose to “bury” sutures, which means there are no visible sutures. Others use sutures in the skin, which will need to be removed in 7-10 days at the veterinarian’s office.

, For the first 24 hours after surgery, most dogs are quiet, as they are groggy from the sedation and anesthetic. For up to a week after the operation the dog should be kept reasonably quiet (no vigorous play, running) and dry (no swimming or bathing).


Your dog can resume normal activity and exercise a week after the operation, as the incision should be healed enough to allow this activity.

, The incision should not gap nor bleed. The skin should be pale, or the normal skin color, around the incision. In light skinned dogs you may see some light bruising as well. Things that should be looked for and brought to the attention of your veterinarian include:Gaps in the surgery site
Redness of the site and the skin around it
Any discharge or swelling around the surgical site
Any other abnormalities, such as blood dripping from the wound or unusual smells.

, Most dogs recover uneventfully from the surgery as long as the incision is keep clean and dry and the dog does not lick at the incision. Licking can cause the wound to open, leading to a chance of infection.


If you catch your dog constantly licking the incision site, it may need to wear an Elizabethan (E)-collar, or the dreaded cone, to keep it from hindering healing.

Use a flea comb to remove the fleas.,
Rinse your dog.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Dogs1," After bathing your dog, brush the vinegar through the dog's coat. It will improve the shine of your dog’s coat and will act as a deodorant. Do not use if your dog’s skin is dry, broken, or otherwise irritated.Treating your dog's skin this way will help prevent dry skin and itchiness.;
, The antibacterial properties of apple cider vinegar make it ideal to clean out a dog's ears. It will help to prevent infection and ward off parasites that are susceptible to the acid in ACV. Soak a small cotton ball or piece of clean cloth in the vinegar and gently wipe your dog's ears as carefully as you can., If your dog spends a lot of time romping around during the summer, using ACV may keep fleas away. Mix two cups of water and two cups of ACV in a clean spray bottle. Once a week, spray your dog's fur with the mixture. Although not scientifically proven to get rid of flea, the acidic taste of the vinegar may repel fleas and other parasites.If your dog dislikes being sprayed, dip a washcloth into the mixture and rub your dog's coat. There is no need to rinse your dog afterward. The smell will dissipate after the ACV dries.

, If your dog has a case of fleas, you can get rid of them by using a mixture of soapy water and ACV. The soapy water kills the fleas and the ACV keeps them from coming back. Make a mixture of 1/4 cup dish soap, 1/2 gallon water and 1/2 gallon ACV.Put on long sleeves and gloves. Before you start treating your dog, it's important to protect your own skin from flea bites. Work outside if you're dealing with live fleas and ticks.
Bathe your dog in the solution. Avoid getting the solution in its eyes. Cover every part of its fur and use your fingers to work the solution all the way to the skin. You want to work up a good lather to help kill the fleas. Let the solution sit on your dog for ten minutes. If it's a particularly bad infestation, have a second batch of the solution handy so you can do a double flea treatment.

, Carefully comb through the fur section by section to remove live fleas and their eggs. Dip the flea comb into a bowl of soapy water, which will drown the fleas on impact. The fleas should come off of your dog easily, since they'll be repelled by the taste of the ACV., When you're finished rinse to remove all traces of soap and dead fleas. Follow up by spraying its coat with a fifty-fifty ACV and water solution. Then let it completely air dry.

Make an ACV mixture that your dog enjoys.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Dogs2," Feeding your dog ACV this often will help to keep its skin and fur healthy as well as keeping fleas at bay. To feed your dog ACV, just add a teaspoon to its water dish twice a week.Keep in mind that apple cider vinegar's effects will vary from dog to dog. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that it improves the health of every dog. Some effects may be the result of the placebo effect.

, If your dog has digestive problems such as constipation or diarrhea, try using ACV once a day. Add a teaspoon to a large bowl of water daily. This will help improve diarrhea episodes and can fix constipation in a dog with repeated use.A large dog can handle twice a day treatments. If your dog is over fifty pounds, use two teaspoons per day.
If your dog's symptoms don't improve after a week, you should take it to the vet to see if a stronger medication is required., If your dog seems to hate the taste or smell, it's best not to force it to eat it. Mix it in with its food instead. Or create a special ACV treat by mixing it with a teaspoon of peanut butter."

Know the benefits of ACV.,
Know the risks associated with ACV.,
Choose the best ACV.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Dogs3," ACV has antibacterial properties that are beneficial to dogs' skin, ears, and digestive systems. It also alters dogs' internal pH level, helping to repel fleas. Regularly feeding your dog ACV helps to promote good health, both inside and outside.Keeping a good pH level is important. Pests like fleas, ticks, bacteria, parasites, ringworm, fungi, staphylococcus, streptococcus, pneumococcus, and mange are less likely to bother dogs with slightly more acidic urine and an acidic skin/fur coat outer layer. Apple cider vinegar can promote these qualities.Opponents of ACV use argue that there is no proven scientific data that shows that ACV effectively repels fleas. They argue that any benefits derived from bathing in ACV are likely to be a result of regular flea combing and treating the environment, rather than the ACV directly.

, It can sting when applied to broken skin or sores. Don’t use on broken skin. If you are planning on using ACV to fend off fleas, then be aware that if the fleas have irritated your dog’s skin enough, it will probably burn.


Bladder stones can form after prolonged ACV use. ACV is acidic and raises the level of acid in your dog's urine. Highly acidic urine in dogs leads to oxalate bladder stones. This is because oxalate crystals precipitate out of ACV solution. Potentially, the bladder stone could block the urethra (the tube through which the dog urinates), limiting your dog's ability to urinate. This is an emergency situation, which will require surgery to remedy.It is certainly NOT advisable to give ACV to any animal with a history of bladder stones of the oxalate variety. In theory, you could monitor the dog's urinary pH using dipsticks. The ideal pH should be around 6.2 - 6.4, so if the dipstick indicates a pH more acidic than this (below 6.2) then it would be best to discontinue using ACV until the pH recovered. , There are manufactured forms of apple cider vinegar and organic versions. Choose the latter. The best apple cider vinegar to use is fermented and unfiltered, also referred to as ""raw."" Raw ACV contains a cloudy substance called ""the mother,"" which contains healthy enzymes and minerals."

Give aspirin to otherwise healthy dogs.,
Set up an appointment with your vet.,
Recognize signs of renal disease that mean you should not give your dog aspirin.,
Make sure to give your dog the right amount of aspirin.,
Give your dog aspirin with food.,
Stop giving your dog the medication immediately if the dog vomits or has diarrhea.,
Watch for signs of aspirin overdose.",How to Use Aspirin for Arthritis Pain Relief in Dogs1," Despite the fact that your dog may need aspirin to control pain from arthritis, your dog should otherwise be healthy in order to take this medication.


Signs that your dog is pretty healthy include drinking normally, having a healthy appetite, maintaining a stable weight, and have regular bowel movements.;
, It is always a good idea to confirm that you can give your dog aspirin with your vet. Your vet will do a thorough check up of your dog, and will run some blood tests to make sure that your dog’s kidneys are up for processing the aspirin.

, If your dog’s kidneys are weak, it is important that you do not give him aspirin, as aspirin can be very challenging for the kidneys to process. Signs of renal problems include:


Increased thirst.
Passing larger than normal volumes of urine.
Vomiting.
Losing weight without explanation.

, Aspirin comes in 75 mg and 300 mg tablets, and is available over the counter at your local pharmacy.


The recommended dose is 10 mg per kg of body weight every 12 hours. This is equivalent to giving a 30 kg dog one 300 mg aspirin tablet twice a day., You can also give you dog aspirin right after he has eaten. Doing this can help to decrease the chances of the aspirin coming into direct contact with the lining of the stomach wall.


When aspirin does come into contact with the wall of the stomach, there is a chance that gastric ulcers will form.

, If your dog vomits and is depressed, seek veterinary attention.


If your dog is bright and cheerful, but the vomiting persists for 24 hours, seek veterinary attention.
If your dog vomits despite the aspirin being given on a full stomach, do not give your dog another dose of aspirin, as his stomach can most likely no handle it.

, Aspirin can cause side effects if an incorrect (too high) dose is given, or if the dog has impaired kidney function. Impaired kidney function causes blood levels of aspirin to rise. Signs include:


Depression (the dog lacks energy and does not want to take part in his regular daily routine)
Vomiting (possibly blood-tinged)
Loss of appetite (due to nausea and gastric discomfort)
Rapid breathing.

"
Never give aspirin to a dehydrated dog.,
Do not give a dog aspirin that has a clotting disorder.,
Make sure to avoid giving your dog aspirin if he has a heart condition.,
Feed your dog before giving him aspirin.,
Familiarize yourself with the drugs that do not react well with aspirin.",How to Use Aspirin for Arthritis Pain Relief in Dogs2," Dehydration decreases the effectiveness of the kidneys, which means levels of aspirin are likely to rise if you give your dog aspirin. This creates another vicious circle whereby the aspirin impairs the function of the kidneys, which can then lead to kidney damage.To tell if your dog is dehydrated, grasp a fold of his scruff between his shoulders and lift it away from his backbone. Let go of the skin and watch to see how quickly it springs back into position. In a well-hydrated dog this happens instantly. If the dog is dehydrated the skin ""tents"", which means it retains a peaked shape for a second or two, before drifting down to the normal position.

, Clotting disorders refer to an inability of the blood to form clumps and stop bleeding from occurring. One such disease is Von Willebrand’s disease.


Aspirin slows down platelet aggregation (the building blocks of a clot) which is bad news if the dog already has a tendency towards bleeding.

, This is because many heart diseases are treated either with furosemide or digoxin, both of which should not be taken with aspirin.


If your dog has epilepsy and takes phenobarbitone, you should also avoid giving your dog aspirin.

, Aspirin should never be given on an empty stomach, so do not give it to your dog if your dog has not eaten.


If you give your dog aspirin when he has an empty stomach, his risk of developing stomach ulcers increases.
Do not give aspirin to dogs that have diarrhea, as aspirin heightens the risk of complications such as gastric irritation and ulceration.

, If your dog is taking any of the following medications, do not give him aspirin.Aminoglycoside antibiotics: There is a slightly increased risk of renal damage if these two medications are given together.
Corticosteroids: Steroids cause aspirin to be less effective by speeding up its excretion via the kidney. To receive adequate pain relief, a higher than recommended dose is necessary and this promotes gastric ulceration.
Digoxin: Aspirin causes blood levels of digoxin (a heart medication) to rise which can cause toxicity leading to a heart attack.
Furosemide: Diuretics (drugs that cause fluid excretion) compete for excretion and so levels of aspirin can rise unexpectedly if the furosemide wins.
Heparin: Aspirin magnifies the anticoagulant effect of heparin (an anticoagulant) which can lead to bleeding problems.
NSAIDs: Never combine aspirin with NSAIDs since this is equivalent to doubling up and promotes kidney failure and gastric ulceration.
Phenobarbital: Aspirin increases the rate of excretion of phenobarbital, which causes a fall in blood levels of this anticonvulsant, which could allow seizures to break through.
If your dog is on a medication that is not listed above, always check with the prescribing veterinarian before starting aspirin therapy.

Understand how arthritis occurs.,
Use aspirin to reduce the inflammation and pain caused by arthritis.,
Talk to your vet about stronger forms of pain relief.",How to Use Aspirin for Arthritis Pain Relief in Dogs3," Arthritis is a common condition especially for older pets. Arthritis is an inflammatory condition, where the joint becomes inflamed and releases chemical distress signals such as cytokines and prostaglandins. However, inflammation is strongly linked to creating pain, and the joints become sore and painful.


In the longer term, inflammation weakens the cartilage lining the joint which is then more prone to chipping or damage, which creates yet more inflammation. In an attempt to repair damage, new bone is laid down, and this accounts for the distortion of joints that is associated with arthritis.

, Aspirin reduces the release of inflammatory markers such as prostaglandins and cytokines, and thus helps to reduce inflammation, and therefore pain.

, Aspirin provides relief against mild or moderate pain, but is not sufficiently potent to help severe pain. Increasing the dose of aspirin should not be attempted, because this makes overdose more likely (without improving pain relief).

Understand that there is no medical ""cure"" for canine influenza.Rather, your dog's veterinarian will offer what is called ""supportive care."",
Give your dog fluids.The vet may offer your dog extra fluids, sometimes via an IV, if your dog has become dehydrated as a result of fighting off canine influenza.,
Encourage your dog to eat.,
Ask about medications for symptom management.While it is never wise to try and give your dog human medications (such as Tylenol, Advil, or other cold and flu medications), your vet can advise you as to pet-friendly alternatives that can help to decrease the bothersome symptoms for your dog, as his or her immune system works to fight off the virus.",How to Treat Dog Flu1," Supportive care is basically a combination of symptom management and rest, so that your dog's immune system is optimized and best able to fight off the virus. Your dog's immune system is the only thing that can actually fight off the bug itself.


Keep your dog's eyes and nose clean. Wipe these areas down with a cotton pad soaked in water that has been boiled, then cooled to room temperature.
Make sure your dog's bed has plenty of padding. If your dog isn't moving very much, they can develop bed sores. Provide additional padding with a few extra blankets.
Keep your dog indoors and make sure it is not too hot or too cold.;
, If the dehydration is only mild, encouraging your dog to drink more water orally may be sufficient.


A dog needs to drink 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) of water for every kg body weight (so, if your dog weighs 22kg or 50 lbs, they need 1,100 ml of water daily). If your dog is not motivated to drink, you can syringe water in through the side of their mouth in small, frequent doses throughout the day.

, A sick dog may not have much interest in eating, but it is important for your dog to keep their strength up. If your dog will not eat, try warming some wet or canned food and offering it to them. The dog may allow you to hand-feed them or may be interested in eating their favorite treats. If nothing seems to be working, ask your vet about Oralade, a liquid food that you can give your dog via syringe., Speak to your vet if you would like medications to help with pain, fever, and/or runny nose and congestion symptoms in your dog (all of which are often present in cases of canine influenza).

"
"
Opt for antibiotics for your dog.Although canine influenza is a viral infection, many veterinarians will offer your dog antibiotics in order to prevent what is called a ""secondary bacterial infection."",
Prevent the spread of infection to other dogs.While your dog is recovering from canine influenza, it is important to keep them at home and isolated from other dogs.,
Monitor your dog's progress.Your dog should begin to feel better over the course of a few days to a week or so, and symptoms should begin to dissipate and ultimately disappear.",How to Treat Dog Flu2," What this means is that, while your dog's immune system is busy fighting off the virus, it can become weakened and susceptible to bacterial infections. The antibiotics help to prevent this, and to ensure that your dog has the quickest recovery possible.

, The virus can be spread through droplets, so if your dog sneezes around other dogs, the infection can spread. Avoid public places with other dogs such as doggy daycare, doggy boarding places, and public dog parks. Although it can be a hassle to keep your dog at home, you would appreciate the same done by another dog owner if his or her pet was infected.


Make sure you wash your hands after touching your dog or anything that might be infected (your dog's food bowl, toys, bedding, etc.) and before you touch another dog.
If you work during the day and need care for your dog, consider hiring a dog walker for the duration of the illness.
They can stop in during the day to check in on your dog, and walk your dog while avoiding the need to go to a public place where other dogs could become infected.

, If you find that your dog is getting worse, or failing to show any signs of improvement after one week, bring them back to the vet for a follow-up examination. It could be that your dog needs additional care, and/or hospitalization in the more severe cases. Although this is rarely needed, it is best to see your vet and to be safe rather than sorry.



Watch for signs of dehydration, especially if your dog does not seem to be drinking much water.
Check to make sure your dog is not soiling themselves, especially if they are not moving from their bed.

Check your dog's temperature twice daily. A normal temperature is between 100 and 102.5°F (37.7 and 39.4°C).If your dog has an underlying health conditions, such as heart or kidney disease, then you will need to take extra measures to support them as they fight the infection. Work with the vet to ensure they are getting the necessary care, which may include staying at the veterinary clinic.

Understand that you must get a prescription for sedative drugs.,
Give your dog Acepromazine (PromAce®).,
Consider giving your dog Diazepam (Valium®).",How to Safely Sedate a Dog1," The drugs used to sedate a dog are very effective, so they require a prescription from a veterinarian and can only be administered by a veterinarian.


The two most common drugs used by veterinarians to calm dogs are acepromazine (PromAce®), and diazepam (Valium®).
These drugs block certain signals in the CNS or central nervous system making the animal calm or sedated.;
, Acepromazine is used to calm fractious or aggressive animals. It alleviates itching, and also has anti-emetic properties (prevents vomiting), making it ideal for animals that are being transported long distances.

, Diazepam is also a sedative which has muscle relaxant properties, appetite stimulating properties, and anti-convulsant properties, making it ideal for dogs with seizure and/or appetite problems.

Take puppies to the vet.,
Treat dehydration in puppies at home.,
Feed the puppy bland food.,
Give the dog antibiotics only when there's an underlying condition.,
Manage coronavirus in adult dogs.",How to Treat Canine Coronavirus1," In puppies, the risk of complications from the coronavirus (CCV) is greater since they are more prone to dehydration. Any puppy with diarrhea that is off color or who is vomiting should be checked by a vet. Likewise any puppy that has diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours should be seen by a vet because of the risk of dehydration.


To check for dehydration, grasp the skin of the scruff and lift it up away from the shoulders. When you release the skin it should spring immediately back into place. If you can see the skin settle back down or it takes a second or more, then the puppy is dehydrated.
If you are able to detect dehydration this way, then the dog may need intravenous fluids to support his circulation and protect organ function.
Your puppy may also have the respiratory type of CCV, which presents with symptoms that look like a respiratory infection. Take your puppy to the vet if he has any respiratory symptoms.;
, The most concerning type of CCV is the virus that presents with digestive symptoms. Because dogs with the coronavirus most often get diarrhea, dehydration is the most concerning result of a CCV infection. If you are concerned about dehydration but the puppy isn't clinically dehydrated, then make sure he is drinking. If he is reluctant to drink fluids, then gently syringe water into his mouth. Give a little bit at the time and often, but never squirt the fluid in quickly. Give the puppy a chance to swallow so that the fluid isn't accidentally inhaled into the lungs.If you have access to an electrolyte replacement fluid, such as Lectade or dioralyte, this will pass more easily across the dog's stomach wall than water and is better at preventing dehydration.

, If your pet has had diarrhea connected to the canine coronavirus, you should feed him a bland diet that is easy on his stomach. Feed little and often, such as four to six small portions spread over the day.A prescription enteritis diet is better than chicken and rice since it contains vitamins and minerals that a growing puppy needs.

, Though you may think your dog needs medicine to help him get better, your dog may not need it. Antibiotics are unlikely to make any difference since the infection is viral. However, if your puppy is sick, the vet may prescribe antibiotics to control any secondary infections he may have developed.For example, if your dog has the respiratory type of CCV, he may develop a respiratory infection that requires antibiotics.

, Coronavirus cannot be treated directly because it is a virus and drugs are ineffective at killing viruses. In adult dogs, the infection is usually not dangerous and the diarrhea will go away of its own accord after 12 days or so. In adult dogs, you should manage the diarrhea by providing plenty of fresh drinking water so that the dog can replace lost fluids and doesn't become dehydrated.In addition, a bland diet such as chicken and rice, or a commercial prescription diet designed to soothe gastroenteritis, can speed up resolution of the stomach upset. Divide the daily food allowance into four servings, and space the four meals out over the day.

Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise.,
Bring your dog’s favorite toys, blanket or rug when travelling.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Use products that contain appeasing pheromones.,
Use melatonin supplements.,
Try calming herbal agents.,
Prepare your own herbal concoction.",How to Safely Sedate a Dog2," Many experts on dog behavior recommend that a dog be exercised before travelling, or before being engaged in any activity that might get the dog restless and agitated.


A well exercised dog will be very inclined to rest because it has burned off its excess energy. Therefore, it's a good idea to schedule a brisk 30 minute walk before taking off.

, Your dog’s favorite blanket or toys contain a lot of familiar scents, and will reduce anxiety when the dog is brought to an unfamiliar place.

, Do this by placing a few drops of lavender oil on your hands and massaging the dog at the back of its head, or the base of the spine. Lavender oil has a calming scent and is used in spas for humans.

, Studies have shown that pheromones are present in all mammals during the nursing stage. In dogs, this is the hormone secreted by the puppies’ mother, so when the puppies smell this hormone it calms them and re-assures them that mom is around.


Examples of products that contain this hormone are: Adaptil ®collar and spray, Sentry ® Calming collar, and Comfort Zone ® Diffuser with Dog Appeasing Pheromone.These products are very easy to use, the collars are simply placed on the dog’s neck to provide a sustained release of the pheromone which lasts for a month.
For products like the diffuser, it is simply plugged into a socket, and the pheromone is slowly and continuously released for a month. This type of product is ideal for rooms. Spray preparations can be used to spray cages, cars, or any carrier where the dog is placed.

, Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. It is a sleeping hormone that causes the animal to have a good rest at night. It has a seasonal variation in animals and humans, increasing when there are fewer hours of daylight in winter.


Melatonin has sedative properties, anticonvulsant properties, regulates body rhythms and reproductive cycles. It is mainly used in the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs, and other stressful or frightening conditions like noise anxieties brought about by fireworks or thunder storms.
Give this drug to your dog before travelling and or before introducing your dog to a potentially frightening situation. An example of a product containing Melatonin is K9 Choice ™ Melatonin 3 mg tablets.
The dose is 3 mg for every 35 to 100 pounds body weight, twice a day. For smaller dogs below 35 pounds the dose is 1.5 mg of melatonin, and for larger dogs greater than 100 pounds the dose is 6 mg twice times a day., Herbal pills and oils prepared specifically for dogs are commercially available, examples include Dorwest Herbs ™ Scullcap and Valerian tablets. This herbal medicine preparation can be used for the relief of anxiety, restlessness, excitability, and travel behavioral problems, and can even be used as a supporting supplement for epilepsy. It has been been proven effective in dogs with noise phobias, travel anxiety, and hyper activity.Skullcap and Valerian Tablets are safe for long term and short term use and can be given from 2 months of age onwards. The dose for Dorwest Herbs ™ Scullcap and Valerian tablets is 1 to 2 tablets per 5 kg of body weight daily. For one off occasions, use 2 tablets per 5kg of body weight 12 hours before and again 2 hours before the desired effect is required. Note: Not recommended for pregnant or lactating females.
Vetzyme Stay Calm Liquid ®: this herbal oil is composed of a unique blend of Chamomile and Ginger oils. Research has shown that these two herbs posses calming, soothing, and relaxing properties. The dose is at 2.5ml of the oil mixed into the dogs food daily., Do this by mixing one teaspoon each of German Chamomile, skullcap and catnip. Place these in a cup and set aside.


Heat half a cup of water to boiling level, and pour this over the cup of herbs. Leave and let it steep for 6 minutes, then strain the liquid and pour three tablespoons of honey into the concoction.
Store it at room temperature for 24 hours before giving it to the dog."

Treat the underlying cause of bleeding.",How to Treat a Dog Sneezing Blood," If your dog is actively bleeding it may be upset or agitated by that. Focus on keeping the dog calm by petting it and reassuring it if you can. This will help its mental state, as well as keeping its blood pressure down and thus limiting the amount of bleeding.


However, do not give it any medication to keep it calm unless you discuss that option with a veterinarian before you do.Also put the dog in a location where it is comfortable but its blood will not damage any surfaces in your home. This will help you focus on your dog's health instead of mopping up blood immediately.;
, If your dog's nose continues to bleed after it sneezed, try icing the area to stop the bleeding. Icing the area will restrict the blood vessels, hopefully cutting off the flow of blood that is coming out of your dog's nose.It can be difficult to ice the nose of a dog. Be patient and calm with your dog and do what you can.
If you are unable to ice your dog's snout, usually due to resistance from the dog, then you should simply focus on getting it to a veterinary clinic for treatment instead.

, Call your veterinary office if it is open and tell them what is occurring with your dog. If your dog only expelled blood while it sneezed and no more blood followed, then it is likely that you can wait for an appointment to get your dog checked out.If your dog is actively bleeding, take your dog immediately to a veterinarian but call the veterinary office on the way to warm them that you are coming in. This will allow the veterinary office staff to prepare for dealing with a bleeding animal.
If your dog sneezed blood and then no more blood came out that doesn't mean that you can forget about it and not take your dog to a veterinarian. Any time a dog sneezes blood it should be seen by a veterinarian.

, If your dog's nose bled or is bleeding it should be taken to a veterinarian. If the bleeding stopped quickly after the sneeze, then you can call your veterinary office, discuss the issue, and make an appointment to bring your dog in. If the bleeding has not stopped or took a long time to stop, then the dog should be taken to a veterinarian immediately, as the blood loss alone can be a threat to your dog's health.


If your regular veterinary office is closed while your dog's nose is bleeding, then you should take your dog to an emergency pet hospital in your area. If your dog's nose stopped bleeding shortly after the sneeze, call the emergency pet hospital and discuss whether to bring the dog in or to wait until the dog's normal veterinary office is open.

, In order to get a diagnosis, your veterinarian will need to do a variety of tests on your dog. These tests, which may require several rounds of testing, will allow your vet to narrow in on the cause of the bleeding. Possible tests your vet will want to perform include:


Blood cell count
Urinalysis
X-rays
RhinoscopyBlood pressure
Cultures from nose
Additional specialized testing

, There are a variety of things that could be causing your dog's nose to bleed. Once your veterinarian gives you a definitive diagnosis, they should also present you with a treatment plan.Your dog's bloody nose could have simply been caused by the force of your dog sneezing or by a foreign body in the nose. If this is the case your dog should easily recover on its own once any foreign bodies are removed. However, this may not be the case if there is an underlying problem with the dog's blood clotting ability.
Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a simple sinus infection. A sinus infection is usually treated with a round of antibiotics and can be cleared up quickly.Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a tumor. Treatment for a malignant tumor usually includes surgery and chemotherapy, although these treatments can be difficult for tumors in the sinuses.Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by an infection in its teeth that traveled up into its sinus cavity. If the dog's teeth are infected, your dog will need to go to a veterinary dentist and have its dental infection treated.

Find some Raw Extra Virgin Cold Pressed Coconut Oil.,
Take about a tablespoon at a time (If the coconut oil is kept in a warm environment/room, it will look like a clear liquid.,
Take some in your hand and rub your hands together, this will turn it to a more oily consistency if is in the white ""lard"" state.,
Rub into the fur or skin of your dog where he/she has fleas, dry flaky skin, raw skin from scratching, or a loss of fur.,
Take some extra in your hands and run it through the outer layers of your dogs fur and their under belly as well.

,
Put a sweater on your dog for the day or overnight so the oil can set, and prevent the dog from licking it up because it tastes good, although it is safe if they do try to lick it, unlike some commercial flea treatments.

,
Reapply each day, or a few times a week, until you know how it'll work on your pet and you notice all fleas are gone and not returning, and/or when you see the skin clearing up and possibly fur regrowing back.

",How to Use Coconut Oil for Flea and Skin Treatment on Dogs," It contains lauric acid, which kills and prevents fleas. It can be bought at the grocery store, at the pharmacy in the GNC section, or really anywhere they sell food and cooking oils. They can also be found in the Care for Hair aisle, as it is also used to replenish hair with shine!!;
, If the coconut oil is in a cooler climate, it will be white and look like lard)

, Or pour some into a small container so that you can just scoop some out with your hand/fingers if it is in the clear liquid state.

, It will be a bit oily of course, but rub it in very, very well. The fleas will die within 5 mins.

Watch for digestive issues.,
Check for respiratory problems.,
Monitor for other symptoms.",How to Treat Canine Coronavirus2," In one type of CCV, the principal sign of infection is diarrhea. The diarrhea is usually serious, explosive, and runny, but generally doesn’t contain mucous.The feces may be green, yellowish, or even orange. Your dog may also experience vomiting.The diarrhea usually lasts for a few days.
This type of CCV affects the digestive system, and this is the most common type of CCV infection in dogs. Diarrhea from this type of CCV is the most common symptom in dogs.
However, since diarrhea is a general symptom with many possible causes, just because the dog has an upset stomach doesn't mean he has coronavirus.

, In the other type of CCV, respiratory problems are the most common symptoms. The respiratory ailments the virus may cause include coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge.If your dog has other respiratory problems, he may end up with pneumonia.
Respiratory coronavirus is another type of canine coronavirus. This virus affects the respiratory system. This type of CCV is not as common as the digestive type.

, While diarrhea and respiratory problems are the most common symptoms, your dog may present with other symptoms. For example, your dog may become lethargic or depressed. He may also run a fever or have a loss of appetite.These symptoms may point to other illnesses, so you should take your dog to the vet immediately to get him checked out.
The symptoms for parvovirus and CCV are very similar. However, parvovirus is deadly, while CCV is not. You should always take your dog to the vet to get a correct diagnosis.

"
"
Identify how dogs get infected with CCV.,
Recognize which dogs are at the greatest risk.,
Be aware that CCV isn’t fatal.",How to Treat Canine Coronavirus3," Dogs become infected with the canine coronavirus by coming into contact with feces or saliva of dogs with a coronavirus infection. This can be through a food bowl, the feces of an infected dog, or direct contact with an infected dog.Try to prevent the coronavirus in your dog by getting him vaccinated and keeping him away from areas where dogs go to the bathroom.
Adult dogs may develop diarrhea and possibly a reduced appetite, but often the infection is asymptomatic and the dog shows no signs because the immune system has successfully defended the body against the virus. This means your dog can come in contact with an infected dog without you knowing it.

, Those dogs at greatest risk are puppies under 12 weeks of age. Puppies are more vulnerable to dehydration, and because their immune system is still developing and therefore weak, the virus has a greater impact and the diarrhea can be more severe.


Take care with puppies to make sure they have limited contact with anything that could spread the coronavirus., Coronavirus is not fatal for most dogs. Many dogs even have an immunity to the virus. If the dog is in good health, the virus becomes an inconvenience. Diarrhea is the most common symptom for puppies or adults, and it lasts for a few days before the dog recovers.If the dog has a weak immune system, CCV can be a much worse condition. For example, puppies and older dogs are more vulnerable to complications.

Listen to your dog’s cough.,
Monitor the cough.,
Look for vomiting linked to coughing.,
Check your dog for fever.,
Check to see if your dog’s lymph nodes are swollen.,
See what happens when your dog goes outside.,
Understand that some dogs may present with extra symptoms.,
Know how long this condition will last.",How to Recognize Kennel Cough in Dogs1," The first and most obvious symptom of this condition is a cough. This cough starts suddenly, often overnight, and is a harsh, barking, hacking cough. Many owners phone a vet clinic and describe their pet as having ""something stuck in his throat"" because of the harsh, hacking, retching sound the dog makes.This is no quiet cough, but a whole body movement where the dog extends his neck to straighten his airway and coughs so forcefully that his whole body shudders.;
, Often a trigger starts the dog coughing, such as inhaling cold air which tickles the sensitized windpipe, or the dog pulls on his collar which pinches his windpipe and starts an episode of coughing.


Once they start coughing, some dogs find it difficult to stop and can cough anywhere from a few minutes to hours.

, When the whole body is involved in a cough, muscular contractions of the abdomen sometimes make a dog vomit, but this in not because of a stomach disorder; it is a secondary effect of the physical act of harsh coughing.


Some owners mistakenly believe the dog has a vomiting/gastrointestinal problem, rather than a cough that is so severe as to cause vomiting. A veterinarian, after examining the dog, will swiftly clear up this confusion.

, Some dogs may be feverish, and running a temperature can put them off their food. A feverish dog may radiate heat and his nose, ears, and paws may feel warmer than your own body temperature. A dog's temperature should be below 39 C, above this is considered high, and above 39.5 C is feverish.The gold standard is to take the dog's temperature with a rectal thermometer. To do this a digital thermometer (a regular human thermometer is fine—just don't reuse it on a person) is gently inserted into the anus, keeping the thermometer parallel to the line of the backbone.
Never apply pressure, if the thermometer does not slip into the rectum with gentle forward movement then stop and try again. This is not a painful procedure and how cooperative the dog is depends on his temperament. If your dog resents having his temperature taken, it is best to stop and let the professional deal with it!

, Sometimes the lymph nodes in the throat (the ""glands"" in the throat) swell as the body mounts a fight back against infection. These glands are located on the left and right hand side of the neck, in the angle of the jaw. They are normally difficult for the untrained person to feel. Enlargement makes them easier to locate.


In a Labrador sized dog you may feel a firm, smooth swelling (about the size of a walnut) in the angle where the jawbone meets the throat.
Anything above walnut-sized would be considered abnormal in a dog of this size.

, Another symptom of this condition is a very sensitive windpipe. The infectious agents cause inflammation in the lining of the windpipe, which has the effect of sensitizing it and making it more ""ticklish"". Thus, the temperature change going from a warm house out into cold air can trigger a coughing episode.


A simple test many veterinarians use when diagnosing kennel cough is to gently pinch the wind pipe. If the dog has kennel cough this precipitates a harsh cough (this is not the case if the dog has heart disease or another cause of a cough). You may notice this effect when your dog pulls on the collar and he coughs.

, Some dogs may have other signs of an upper respiratory infection such as a sticky yellow-green discharge from the eyes, or clear nasal discharge. However, unlike in people with a heavy cold or flu, these are not typical symptoms of kennel cough and the absence of these signs is common.

, Kennel cough lasts for 7 to 21 days and your dog should be considered infectious to other canines while he is still coughing. Once the cough stops, he is no longer infectious."

Wash your dog with dish soap, vinegar, and glycerin.,
Try castile soap, vinegar, and water.,
Add rosemary water for a shiny coat.",How to Make Dog Shampoo1," A simple, all purpose dog shampoo can be made using one cup of dish soap, one cup of apple cider vinegar, and 2 ounces of glycerin. Glycerin is a form of sugar alcohol you can purchase online or at a drug store. You will also want jars to mix your shampoo, and an empty shampoo bottle to put it in when you're finished.Pour all your ingredients into a jar, making sure to pour the dish soap first.
Shake the ingredients thoroughly until mixed evenly. Place the mixture into an empty shampoo bottle and store in your bathroom until you're ready to bathe your dog.;
, Another type of natural shampoo can be made with castile soap, vinegar, and water. Make sure to use non-scented castile soap, as it has less irritants. You can buy your ingredients at a drug store or local supermarket.You can either grate 2 to 3 tablespoons of castile soap flakes from a bar using a cheese grater or you can use 2 to 3 tablespoons of liquid castile soap.
Add your castile soap to 4 cups of hot water. Use a spoon to mix until the soap flakes dissolve. Then, add white or apple cider vinegar and mix.
Transfer the mixture to a bottle and seal. Always shake the mixture before using it on your dog.

, If you want to give your dog's coat some shine after a bath, you can use rosemary water. You can buy fresh rosemary leaves online, or at a local health food store.Bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add 2 teaspoons of rosemary leaves. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Then, strain the rosemary out of the water. Set the water aside until it's room temperature. You can pour the water over your dog after a bath, giving her coat a sweet scent and a nice shine.

Be aware that a cough is a sign of many different conditions.,
Get your vet to take a look at your dog’s heart.,
Know that bronchitis will last longer than kennel cough.,
Check for lung tumors.,
Have your dog tested for lungworm.,
Get antibiotics for your dog.",How to Recognize Kennel Cough in Dogs2," A cough is quite a general sign and can occur not just as a result of infection, but because of bronchitis (thickening of the airways), heart disease, lung tumors, and lungworm.


It can be difficult even for a trained veterinarian to diagnose the reason for a cough, without the aid of imaging such as x-rays to look at the lungs, and ultrasound to study the heart.
However, the distinctive signs of kennel cough include the harsh hacking nature of the cough, the sudden onset, tracheal sensitivity, and enlarged lymph nodes in the throat.

, The vet will listen to see if a heart murmur is present (the absence of a murmur makes heart disease less likely) and to listen to the nature of the lung sounds.


A heart-related cough often causes gurgly, bubbly sounds in the lungs - again, it can be difficult to differentiate pulmonary oedema (fluid retained on the lungs because of heart failure) from pneumonia, by sound alone. In this case the vet will run blood tests to see if the dog is mounting an immune response to an infection (a raised white cell count).

, Conditions such as bronchitis are usually long term and worsens gradually over weeks to months. Also, when a dog has bronchitis, the lungs tend to have a distinctive harsh crackly sound because of the thickened and stiff nature of the airways., Lung tumors cause a cough when they grow to a size where they press on an airway. A diagnosis cannot be made on a physical exam alone and radiography is essential is a lung tumor is suspected.

, Lungworm infection is a serious lung infection caused by angiostrongylus vasorum. These worms invade the lungs and impair the body's ability to clot blood.Labored breathing, along with pale gums (because of hemorrhage), in a dog not routinely treated against lungworm, should raise suspicion of this life-threatening condition. A blood test is available that gives a ""yes"" ""no"" answer about lungworm infection.

, If suspicious of kennel cough many veterinarians will treat with antibiotics and see if the symptoms resolve (diagnosis by treatment!) If the cough remains then further tests are warranted.

Determine how poor your dog is feeling before seeking help from the vet.,
Keep your dog away from other dogs until the cough has gone.,
Give your dog a medication for his cough.,
Seek veterinary help if your dog’s symptoms get worse.",How to Recognize Kennel Cough in Dogs3," How poorly your dog is influences whether it is essential he is seen by a veterinarian or not. If he has kennel cough but is otherwise bright, has a normal temperature, and eating well (as is quite common) then he does not necessarily need to see the vet, other than to confirm the condition.


Fit healthy dogs will mount an immune response and destroy the virus within 7 to 21 days.

, In this condition, it is the coughing phase that is infectious. Other dogs can potentially pick up infection by contact with aerosol droplets on surfaces, so regular washing of floors (with dilute bleach) and bedding is advisable.


Anecdotally, not all the dogs living in one house come down with kennel cough—it seems exposure to a low dose of virus and a healthy immune system are enough to see off infection in some dogs.

, The cough can be tiring for the dog, especially if it keeps him awake at night. It is fine to give a codeine based human cough medicine (a teaspoon/5ml per large dog, half a teaspoon for dogs under 10kg) at night.Do not attempt to stop the cough 24 hours a day because the cough serves to move mucus and bacteria up out of the lungs. However, it is ok to settle the cough at night so that your dog can get some rest.

, Always seek veterinary advice if you are uncertain the dog has kennel cough, if he:


Is lethargic
Coughing so much he vomits
Not eating.

Learn when a dry bath is needed.,
Make a mixture of baking soda, corn starch, and essential oils.,
Sprinkle the mixture over your dog's back.,
Rub the mixture into your dog's fur.,
Brush your dog.",How to Make Dog Shampoo3," Sometimes, you may want to bathe your dog with dry shampoo. A dry bath may be optimal if your dog gets smelly or dirty frequently. Bathing her every time you notice a smell can result in dry skin. Dogs should not be bathed more than once a month. If you feel your dog needs a bath more frequently than this, try using a dry bath., To make a dry bath, you'll mix 1 cup of baking soda, 1 cup of corn starch, and a few drops of essential oils together. Essential oils can be found at a local supermarket, drug store, or health food store. They can also be purchased online.Be very careful when using essential oils. You should always dilute oils in a carrier oil, like olive oil, before using them directly on your dog's skin.Do not use Oregano or Thyme oils on animals. You should also be extremely careful not to get essential oils anywhere near your dog's eyes.

, You do not need to use all of the dry shampoo. Sprinkle a small amount along your dog's bath. You may also sprinkle some on top of your dog's head, being careful to avoid your dog's eyes. You should use a cup of the mixture for mid-sized dogs and half a cup for small dogs., Use your fingers to gently massage the mixture into the dog's skin. You can also use a comb if you do not want the mixture to get on your hands. Massage the mixture until its dispersed evenly throughout your dog's coat., Allow your dog to shake vigorously when you're done, as this will get a lot of the dry shampoo out of her coat. Then, brush her thoroughly to get rid of the remaining dry shampoo.Make sure you brush the dog until you do not notice any dry shampoo residue. Baking soda can dry out a dog's skin if it's left on for a long time."

Watch for signs of an adverse reaction.",How to Make Dog Shampoo4," When using ingredients like dish soap on your dog, read the ingredient list thoroughly beforehand. You want to make sure the soap does not contain any ingredients that are toxic to a dog's skin. Choose a different brand of dish soap to use if you notice any of the following ingredients listed:Ammonium
Chlorine
Glycol Ethers
Formaldehyde

, You should never substitute laundry detergent for dish soap when making homemade dog shampoo. Brands of laundry detergent like Tide, Cheer, and Downey all contain ingredients that are toxic for dogs.You should also not use things like bathroom cleaners and all-purpose cleaners in place of dish soap.

, While all natural cleaners can save you money, certain problems should be addressed by a vet. If your dog has fleas, seek a veterinarian's advice on treatment to prevent the problem from spreading. You should also talk to a vet if your dog has consistently dry, itchy, or flaky skin that does not respond to at home treatments., Your dog may have an adverse reaction to certain homemade cleaners.

Get the right equipment.,
Help your dog get used to the process.,
Brush your dog's teeth regularly.",How to Keep Your Dog's Breath Fresh1," The most effective method for keeping your dog's teeth healthy and breath fresh is brushing its teeth as often as possible.Before you can brush your dog's teeth, you need appropriate supplies. Choose dog-friendly products from the pet store or your veterinarian.


Human toothpastes are not suitable for dogs because they are not safe to swallow in large amounts. You can find dog toothpaste at your local pet store. These come in a variety of flavors including chicken, liver, and peanut butter. Try a few different types until you find one your pet likes.Pet stores also sell toothbrushes for dogs, including some that fit on your finger. They also sell dental sponges that work equally well. A piece of clean gauze wrapped around your finger will also work as a toothbrush.If you have problems using toothpaste and a brush, you can also use single-use pet dental wipes. These come pre-moistened with a cleaning product suitable for your dog's teeth.;
, Do not expect to be able to thoroughly brush your dog's teeth immediately. You'll need to teach the dog that brushing is a pleasant experience.


Start by dipping a finger in peanut butter, chicken broth or something else the dog likes. Let the pet lick it off your finger. While it is doing this, gently rub your finger against the dog's teeth and gums.
If the dog allows you to rub its gums, lift its lip as you would if you were brushing the teeth. Do this for a few days, alternating tasty treats with your dog's toothpaste.Once your dog is comfortable with you touching its teeth and gums, you can move on to using a brush or sponge.Don't rush this. Make sure to go at your dog's pace and stop if it seems nervous or aggressive. Your safety and your pet's comfort are important.

, Once your dog will allow you, brush its teeth often. Daily brushing is ideal, but even doing it a few times a week can help ward off dental disease. Here are some tips for effective brushing:Use a small amount of toothpaste on the brush or sponge.
Place the brush or sponge against the teeth at a 45-degree angle to the surface of the tooth. If using a brush, point the bristles, toward the gumline.
Work the toothbrush in a circular motion, covering two or three teeth at a time.
Brush all the teeth if possible, but concentrate your attention on the outer surfaces of the upper teeth.
Try to spend about 15 seconds on each side of the mouth.
When finished, reward your dog with a play session, a special toy, or a dental chew. This will help build a positive association with tooth brushing.

Get your dog vaccinated.,
Get your dog's vaccination updated.,
Keep unvaccinated dogs away from other dogs.,
Don't allow your dog to drink out of communal water dishes.,
Look for the symptoms of kennel cough.,
Keep an eye out for symptoms of an even more severe infection.,
Keep a dog with possible infection away from other dogs.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment and care.",How to Prevent Kennel Cough," The primary way to prevent kennel cough is to keep your dog vaccinated. The core vaccine also includes vaccination against common viruses that contribute to kennel cough development.There is also a vaccine effective against Bordetella bronchiseptica, which can also cause kennel cough. Your veterinarian will let you know which vaccinations are more important for your dog to receive.;
, Just doing the vaccination one time is not effective forever. You need to get your dog a booster of its vaccination on a regular basis. In general, the first booster is given after one year, and then subsequent boosters are given every three years.New strains of kennel cough occur regularly. Getting your dog's vaccination updated can increase the likelihood that your dog will be protected.
Because of the many causes of kennel cough, vaccination will not guarantee 100% that your dog will not get the disease. However, it will reduce the chances considerably., Dogs and puppies that are exposed to a lot of other dogs are at increased risk for this disease. This contact can occur at dog parks, groomers, puppy classes, obedience classes, and boarding at kennels.


Keeping puppies isolated from other dogs, except litter mates and the mother, until they can get vaccinated is a good idea. Puppies don't usually get vaccinated against the causes of kennel cough until they are around four months old.However, some of the intranasal drops can be given to puppies as young as three weeks of age., When dogs drink out of a common bowl, droplets from an infected dog’s nasal and mouth secretion can contaminate the water and bowl with Bordatella. When an uninfected and unvaccinated dog laps the water, it can contract the bacteria and come down with kennel cough.To avoid this completely don’t share water or food bowls and wash them frequently in hot, soapy water. The same applies to toys that dogs may share while they are playing.

, The most notable sign of a dog with kennel cough is a persistent cough. The dog will cough continuously with a distinctive “goose honk” sound. Many time this is the only sign in the dog, with it appearing healthy otherwise. However, this cough lingers on for weeks and some dogs will also show other signs such as:Gagging or coughing up a white foamy phlegm
Fever
Discharge from the nose
Watery eyes
Decreased appetite

, Occasionally, kennel cough can make a dog susceptible to developing pneumonia. This will make a dog experience more severe symptoms, including lethargy, difficulty breathing and, even in a few cases, death., It's important to limit the risk of spreading the disease, even if you are not sure if your dog actually has it. This is the responsible thing to do.Keep your dog away from dog parks or facilities that care for dogs, such as doggie day cares and boarding facilities, until your vet has cleared your dog's health.
Pick up your dog's feces. You should probably do this whether your dog is infected or not but infected feces cause a health hazard. An uninfected dog having contact with infected feces is one way that the infection can spread., Kennel cough generally will run its course in 1 to 3 weeks with no treatment needed. However, some owners are annoyed by the constant coughing, so drugs to suppress the cough and reduce windpipe inflammation can be given through a prescription from a veterinarian.In more severe cases, antibiotics which are effective against Bordetella can be given.
A dog which is actively coughing should not do any heavy exercise such as running, as this will aggravate the cough.
Food and water intake should be monitored and encouraged to make sure the dog keeps eating and drinking.
Collars used during leash walking may press against the dog’s windpipe causing severe irritation. Using a harness instead will help prevent this from happening.

Get your dog a vaccine.,
Use a household disinfectant.,
Pick up after your dog.,
Take caution where you exercise your dog.,
Wash your hands before handling your puppy.,
Avoid letting your dog interact with other dogs if he’s sick.",How to Prevent Canine Coronavirus1," There is an effective vaccine against canine coronavirus. Because infection is not usually life-threatening, your vet may not consider coronavirus vaccination to be a core or essential vaccination. The need will be assessed on an individual basis.The vaccine is usually given on a risk assessment basis. The factors your vet will take into consideration are how many dogs your dog mixes with on a regular basis and the prevalence of coronavirus infection in your area. Your vet will also determine if your dog is in an at risk group because of a health problem or their age.The vaccination involves two injections, three weeks apart, and a yearly booster injection. This vaccine can also be combined with other annual shots.
The vaccine is most often given to dogs that mix with lots of others, such as show dogs, or those with general poor health.
You might want to consider vaccination for puppies or elderly dogs.;
, If one of your dogs has the coronavirus, or you think a kennel, grooming, or other area has been compromised, you can kill the virus with household disinfectants. Try Lysol or diluted bleach solutions.The virus can survive in the environment for six months and act as a reservoir of infection for dogs that come into contact with contamination. However, coronavirus is not a hardy virus and is readily destroyed by most household disinfectants
Strong sunlight and lack of moisture will also help destroy the virus. To reduce the moisture in your home, use a dehumidifier. You should also make sure the area the dog is staying and the bedding remains dry. To increase sunlight, open all curtains and doors to allow the sun to shine inside. Take your dog's bedding outside and place in the sun for a few hours.

, When you take your dog into public areas, make sure to pick up after him when he goes to the bathroom. This not only helps reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus, but also any other disease that is transmitted through feces.Make sure to pick up your dog’s feces as soon as he goes to the bathroom. Diseases can be transmitted from feces to the soil and live there for months afterwards. The longer you leave feces on the ground, the more likely it will contaminate the soil, and therefore, other dogs.
Wash your hands after handling your dog's feces or cleaning up urine. The virus can be transmitted through waste, so if your dog is shedding the virus still after he's been treating, you may reinfect him.

, Since the coronavirus can be transmitted through bodily fluids, be careful where you take your dog to exercise. Don’t walk or exercise your dog in an area heavily contaminated with dog feces, especially diarrhea.Be mindful of your dog on public trails, parks, or in dog parks. Keep him away from dog feces to reduce the risk of picking up infection.

, Infected dogs can shed the virus for months after contracting and getting over coronavirus. Even if a dog is well, you can't rule out it being a health risk to your pet. If you have been handling someone else’s dog, wash your hands after touching it and before handling your puppy.If your dog has had the coronavirus in the last few months, make sure to wash your hands before and after touching your dog or touching his water or food. This helps reduce the risk of accidentally transmitting any shedding virus.

, Since coronavirus can be spread through respiratory aerosols, like coughs and sneezes, you shouldn’t take your sick dog around other dogs. Keep him at home until he is well again so you prevent spreading the infection."

Use a dental rinse or gel containing Chlorhexidine.,
Try a water additive.,
Watch what your dog eats.,
Provide appropriate chew toys and treats.,
Prevent your dog from chewing unhealthy toys and treats.",How to Keep Your Dog's Breath Fresh2," The most effective anti-plaque antiseptic is chlorhexidine. Generally, to use a rinse, you squirt a small amount inside each of the dog's cheeks. To use a gel, you typically rub a small amount on the teeth.Chlorhexidine binds to teeth and other oral tissues and is released gradually. This allows it to act for a longer period of time than other suitable antiseptics.This helps keep your dog's mouth clean and breath fresh longer than other products.Chlorhexidine is generally safe for dogs. However, it tastes bitter unless it mixed with flavorings, so you should buy a product designed for dogs. These products are available from pet pharmacies, pet stores and veterinary practices.
Make sure to follow the directions on the packaging of the product you select.

, A variety of additives with anti-plaque activity are available from veterinarians and pet pharmacies.They contain low levels of anti-plaque ingredients that contact the teeth as the dog drinks. This can help keep plaque levels down.


The effectiveness of many of these products is debatable. Some, however, are helpful and have earned Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) approval. This means tests have found that they have anti-plaque properties.Many of these products are safe for both dogs and cats. Carefully read the label of any product before giving it to your pets. Never let a cat drink anything labeled for dogs unless the instructions state it is safe for cats.
It is important to talk to your veterinarian before using one of these products to make sure it is right for your pet.
These products are not substitutes for brushing or professional dental care.

, Sometimes, dogs develop foul breath from eating garbage, feces or other stinky substances.Do your best to prevent your pet from eating inappropriate foods and non-food items.


Make sure to clean out your dog's mouth by brushing its teeth and/ or using a rinse if it eats something unpleasant. Be sure to watch your pet for any signs of illness if your dog has eaten something it shouldn't have. If it appears sick, lethargic or behaves strangely, take your dog to a veterinarian right away.
Some commercial diets are designed to help prevent dental disease.A few have earned VOHC approval. In some cases, the kibble size and hardness are designed to shear plaque from the teeth with chewing. Others contain anti-plaque ingredients.Dental diets are not a substitute for brushing or regular dental care. However, they can help keep plaque levels down. Talk to your veterinarian about the advisability of using one of these diets.

, Dental chews and treats encourage a dog to chew. This action mechanically removes plaque and debris from the teeth. Choose a toy your dog will chew often.


Consider smearing peanut butter or some other tasty substance on chew toys. This will encourage your dog to play with them.To maximize oral health benefits, choose chews, toys and treats suggested by your veterinarian or approved by the VOHC.These products meet specific standards for plaque and tartar prevention in small animals.Always keep an eye on your dog when it is playing with a chew toy. Take away broken toys and small pieces. Like children, dogs can choke on toys or swallow them. This can lead to gastrointestinal obstructions.

, Some things that dogs like to chew on are not healthy or safe for dogs. In particular:


Avoid cow hooves, dried natural bones and hard nylon products. These products are too hard to mimic the action of tearing meat off a carcass. Using them increases the risk of your dog damaging its teeth or gums.
Limit use of rawhide chews, especially in small dogs. Do not allow dogs to consume large pieces. They are a choking hazard and may interfere with digestion. Never allow dogs to chew rawhide products unsupervised. Replace the chews as soon as they become worn.Never give your dog cooked or cut bones. Consider avoiding bones altogether. Both the American Veterinary Medical Association and the FDA advise against giving bones to dogs. There is a risk of oral injuries from splintered bones. They can also cause choking, gastrointestinal obstruction, and internal damage from swallowed pieces. Bacterial infection is also a possible risk."

Schedule regular cleanings.,
Watch for signs of dental problems.,
Recognize the symptoms of systematic disease.",How to Keep Your Dog's Breath Fresh3," Home care is not enough for long-term maintenance of oral health. To keep your dog's mouth healthy and its breath fresh, you also need to provide professional dental care. Regular veterinary visits should include dental evaluations.


Your dog's age, breed, and home care regimen will determine how often it needs dental cleanings.Ask your vet for more details.
If your veterinarian notes periodontal disease or other dental issues, your dog needs a professional cleaning and examination.
Unlike people, dogs will not sit still with their mouths open for a long time. This makes it harder to clean teeth, take radiographs and perform other necessary procedures. Anesthesia is often needed for dental cleanings in dogs., Bad breath is often one of the first signs of dental issues, but there are other signs of dental disease. Dental problems can contribute to a wide variety of other health problems. Signs of potential dental disease in dogs include the following:Bad breath.
Broken, discolored or damaged teeth, or oral bleeding.
Increased or excessive drooling.
Difficulty opening or closing the mouth.
Loss of appetite or reluctance to chew food or toys.
Swelling, lumps, or sensitivity around the mouth.
Rubbing the mouth or face.
Behavior changes.
Recurrent eye infections, swelling, or discharge of pus.

, Other illnesses, including diabetes, parasite infection, liver disease, and kidney disease can also produce unpleasant or unusual breath.If you notice your dog's breath is fruity, smells like urine, or is otherwise odd or foul, make sure to take it to your veterinarian as soon as possible.

Learn how to treat the virus.,
Know that the coronavirus isn’t a fatal condition.,
Learn how the coronavirus is spread.,
Be aware of the symptoms.",How to Prevent Canine Coronavirus2," Most dogs will get over the coronavirus on their own without any medical treatment. If your dog gets the coronavirus, watch him closely. Make sure to keep him hydrated with plenty of fluids since dehydration from diarrhea or vomiting is one of the common side effects of the condition. Especially keep an eye on this condition if your dog is a puppy.If the symptoms are severe, or your dog gets dehydrated, you should take him to the vet. The vet can prescribe medication for secondary conditions that may accompany the coronavirus.

, In a dog that is in otherwise good health, coronavirus is more of an inconvenience than a life-threatening condition. Most dogs get symptoms, like being feverish and having diarrhea, for a few days, and then recover.As with most infections, if the patient has an underlying health condition which weakens her immune system, then coronavirus could be more dangerous because the dog is less able to fight off infection and complications are more likely.Younger and older dogs are more vulnerable to infection and complications because their immune systems are weaker. Speak to your vet about whether there have been coronavirus outbreaks in the area and whether a vaccination is advisable or not.

, The virus is highly infectious and easily passed between dogs. Most commonly, it is contracted through contact with infected feces from diarrhea or respiratory secretions, such as sneezing or coughing.Most dogs contract the coronavirus in places where they interact with other dogs or come into contact with dog feces, like in a kennel, groomers, dog park, breeders, or dog shows.

, There are two types of coronavirus. Type 1 causes gastrointestinal signs, and Type 2 causes respiratory signs. The incubation period is one to four days. Typically, the dog will feel bad for several days and then start to recover.


To help make sure your dog doesn’t get the virus, you should know what symptoms to look for. Symptoms of the coronavirus infection include a fever, reduced appetite, lack of energy, sickness, diarrhea, or a dry hacking cough.These are quite general signs so your vet will have you monitor the dog closely for signs of deterioration, in case the infection is actually something more serious such as parvovirus or distemper.

Get your dog flea treatment if it has associated medical issues.,
Clean your house and your dog's surroundings.",How to Identify Canine Flea Problems," Is your dog scratching itself more than usual? Is it gnawing at its coat? These are signs that your dog might have fleas.Flea bites can cause itchiness on the dog’s skin. The bites can make small red bumps on the skin and continue to itch for some time.
Some animals can actually be allergic to these bites, making the itching and redness more intense and widespread.
Hair loss and skin infection can also occur.;
, After a flea eats, it will leave dark red-brown “flea dirt,” or excrement, on the dog. Look for flea dirt on the hind quarters, head, and neck, which are the most common areas where adult fleas like to feed on a dog.By using a flea comb (very fine toothed comb) to comb the hair, flea dirt can be brought up from the skin. If you don’t find actual fleas, tap any debris caught in the comb teeth onto a white sheet of paper and wet it with a little water. If the “dirt” streaks the paper red, that is flea dirt.

, Get a flea comb from your local pet store, or online, and use it to look closely at your dog's skin. Pick the area that your dog is scratching at the most. Part the dog's fur with the comb and then pull the comb through a small area of the fur. While you are combing, look for fleas on the skin's surface, as they flee from the comb, or in the tines of the comb.


Adult fleas are red-brown which have a “flattened” appearance from side to side.They do not have wings. Instead of flying, they get around by jumping. They are only 1/8th of an inch long (2.5 mm), so they are hard to see, especially when they jump.Cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, are the type of fleas most likely to infest dogs and cats.They use their mouths to latch onto the skin of their victim to obtain blood for nourishment. They spend their time feeding, mating, and egg laying on the dog’s skin.

, Look for evidence of a flea infection. This could include flea dirt, flea eggs, or fleas themselves.They are likely to be in the creases of plush beds or imbedded in areas that are not cleaned regularly.

, If your dog is infected with fleas, then eggs will end up in places other than just the dog's bed. The adult fleas will lay smooth, glistening white eggs, which are no longer than 1/32 inch, on the affected dog’s skin. These eggs will generally fall off the animal and infest the environment. In 2 to 5 days the eggs will hatch into dirty white larva that are about 3/16 inch (3-4 mm) long. They will crawl around and feed on the dried blood and excrement the adult fleas produce when taking their blood meal on the dog.Spotting flea eggs in your home will not always be easy. They are small and can blend into the environment.
After feeding for up to two weeks, they will cocoon and develop into adults.
Larva prefer certain environmental factors in order to develop into adults. This includes 75% relative humidity and temperatures between 70° to 90°F. At these ideal conditions they will emerge as adults in around 18 days. However, in cool temperatures the larva can remain in their cocoons for up to 12 months.
The pressure from walking and/or vacuuming will make the larva emerge from cocoons.

, Sometimes it isn't until the people in your home start getting bitten that you begin to notice a problem. If you are getting small bites, that occur mostly on your lower legs, then the culprit may be fleas.Human reactions to flea bites vary from person to person. Usually, the bites are red, itchy, and hard., Once you see one flea you should assume there are more and that they have already laid eggs. Be proactive and immediately treat your dog and your house to prevent the problem from getting worse.

, There are many products available that will kill fleas on the pet and kill the eggs in the environment.This is why it's a good idea to consult with your veterinarian so they can help you choose the most appropriate product for your dog and house.


Flea medications include dusts, shampoos, topical treatments, and flea collars.Certain dogs can be allergic to flea saliva. To determine if a dog is allergic, a veterinarian can perform skin testing where a small amount of the flea saliva allergen is injected into the skin. If the area around the injection swells and turns red, then the dog is allergic to flea saliva.

, Dogs need to be treated regularly to prevent infestation. How often you give your dog flea treatment will vary depending on what type of flea prevention you are using.


Many topical flea treatments are given once a month. It is important to keep up on these medications in order to keep your dog protected., If you find that your dog has tapeworms, cat scratch fever, or typhus, it may also have fleas. This is because fleas can spread these diseases, so they may have been caused by a flea infestation that you did not know about.Fleas can also spread plague to dogs, as well as humans. This is a rare illness that is treatable with antibiotics, but is a risk associated with flea infection.

, To control fleas, you need to clean up any fleas, or eggs, in the environment. This means vacuuming and cleaning any areas that your infected dog has spent any time in, including laundering all sheets and slip covers.For a bad infection, you may need to use some insecticide in your house to eliminate the larvae living in your carpets and fabric-covered furniture.

You can usually bathe your dog once a month to keep him smelling pleasant.If you bathe him more than that, you can cause skin irritation and he may scratch a lot.Brush your dog’s coat often. This will help keep him clean in between baths, and it’s also good for his skin and coat.If your dog has a skin infection, consult with your vet to see how best to wash and treat your dog.;
, If your dog is new to your home, he may be afraid of bathtime. You can help him learn to associate baths with positive experiences with a few simple tricks.If your dog is terrified of the bath, place your dog in an empty tub (or wherever you wash your dog). Don’t run water yet. Speak to him in a soothing voice and give him a treat or toy to play with. This will help him associate bathtime with something he enjoys.Work your way up to running warm water over his body. Every time you bathe your dog, give him/her a little treat.
Get your puppy used to the bath by washing him after he is five weeks old. Getting your puppy used to bathtime as a pleasant experience will make it easier for him to accept baths when he’s older., A mild shampoo formulated for dogs is the best idea. Look for a shampoo that has a neutral pH balance, around 7. Avoid artificial fragrances and colors, as these can also irritate your dog’s skin.You should never use human shampoo to wash your dog. Dogs’ skin has a different pH balance than human skin, and human shampoo can disrupt that balance. Disrupted pH balance can foster bacteria, parasites, and viruses.Oatmeal shampoo is a good basic choice for most dogs. If you're not sure what to use, it's a safe shampoo to start with.
If your dog has a skin rash or other condition, he will often scratch, which will further irritate his skin. Tea tree shampoo can be helpful for some skin irritations.Avoid getting the shampoo into his mouth, as tea tree oil is toxic when consumed. Consult with your vet to determine what shampoo to use for a dog with skin conditions.
Some shampoos can help prevent flea infestations. Look for shampoos containing pyrethrin, pyrethrum, or citrus oil., Your dog has small sacs on his back end, at the edge of his anus. Some dog groomers offer to “express,” or squeeze, the anal sacs during cleaning. If your vet approves and you know how to do it safely, it's okay to try doing so at this point. Otherwise, leave them alone.


If your dog has inflamed or irritated anal sacs, consult your vet., If you have a very small dog, you can bathe him in a laundry or kitchen sink. You can bathe larger dogs in showers or bathtubs. If it’s not too cold outside, you can even bathe your dog outside.








If you bathe your dog in a bathtub or sink, the bottom will get slippery when it’s wet. To help calm your dog and give him traction, put a towel on the bottom of the tub or sink.You can also use a rubber bath mat or nonslip adhesive pads.Choose a confined location, if possible. Your dog may get anxious or upset during his bath and try to escape. Shut the bathroom door if you use the bathtub. If you’re washing your dog outside, make sure to do it in a fenced area so your dog can’t run away., Brush your dog’s fur thoroughly before giving him a bath. This is especially important if your dog has a thick, shaggy, or double coat. Make sure to remove any tangles or matted areas.If your dog has any ticks, you may want to see a vet to get them removed. Or you can remove it yourself.
If your dog has sticky substances (e.g., paint, tar, pine sap) stuck in his fur, rub them with petroleum jelly or vegetable oil and let it sit for 24 hours. A liquid dish soap may also do the trick., If your dog’s nails need trimming, trim them before you give him a bath. This will help keep him from accidentally scratching you if he gets agitated or fussy.


Do not cut your dog’s nails too short! You can easily cut into the dog’s quick, which can cause bleeding and infection. If you aren’t sure how to trim your dog’s nails, many groomers and veterinarians will do it for a small fee., Once you start the washing process, you’ll want to have everything you need close to hand. You will need towels, cotton balls, dog shampoo, treats, and a washcloth or sponge. If you don’t have a hose or detachable showerhead, you will need a bucket or other vessel for rinsing.


Uncap your shampoos and other bottles so that you don’t have to do that while keeping a wet dog in check.
If your dog tends to be nervous in the bath, you may want to have a helper. The helper can help keep your dog steady while you wash him.

, When dogs’ ears get wet, they can develop ear infections.Putting cotton balls in his ears will help keep the ear canals dry.Don’t push the cotton balls too far down. Just secure them enough so they don’t fall out in the bath.

, To get his neck area clean, you will need to remove the dog’s collar. If you need a collar to keep hold of your dog while bathing him, use a nylon collar. Leather collars can shrink when wet, and could choke your dog., Dogs are sensitive to hot water just like you are. Check the water temperature before you bathe your dog. It should be warm, but not hot. Water that’s too cold can give your dog a chill, which is especially dangerous for puppies.








If you’re bathing in a sink or tub, fill it to about your dog’s knees with warm water.

, It’s not recommended that you wash your dog’s head or face. This can end up getting water in his ears or stinging his eyes with shampoo. Instead, wet him from the neck back. Make sure his coat is fully saturated. This can take awhile for dogs with especially thick coats.








If you have a hose or detachable showerhead, use it to spray your dog. Make sure the water pressure isn’t too high, or it could startle him.
If you use a bucket or pitcher to wet your dog, make sure to avoid pouring water over his head.There are also snap-on sprayer attachments that attach to your showerhead or faucet. The ASPCA recommends the Rinse Ace Pet Shower Deluxe., If your dog’s coat is very thick or long, you may want to pre-mix some shampoo with water in a small cup. This will help you get an even lather throughout his coat.For dogs with short coats, just pour a strip of shampoo down the body. Massage the shampoo into his coat.









You do not need to use a washcloth or sponge to apply the shampoo. In fact, it’s a better idea to use your hands as you lather up the shampoo. This way, you can check his body for any unusual signs, such as bumps or inflammation.Do not apply shampoo to your dog’s head or face. If his face is dirty, use a damp washcloth to gently wipe away any dirt.If your dog has a very long coat, massage the shampoo in the direction of his hair growth. This will help prevent tangling., Massage the shampoo onto the whole body except for the head. Lather up his armpits, stomach, tail and groin area, and paws, too.








Keep the shampoo on your dog for as long as the bottle calls for. Some shampoos contain mild flea repellents, and they may need to stay on for a certain amount of time to be effective.

, If your dog’s face is dirty, use a damp washcloth to wipe the dirt away. Don’t clean inside his ears with a washcloth; this can get the ears too wet and promote infection.Some dogs have a skin infection on their chins called furunculosis, which looks like small pimples or red bumps. If your dog has this condition, you should consult with your vet to see how to properly clean the area. Your vet may suggest a disinfecting shampoo or ointment.
If your dog has folds in his facial skin, make sure to use the washcloth to clean in between them.

, It’s important to rinse all of the shampoo residue from your dog’s coat. This can take awhile to do thoroughly, especially when your dog’s fur is thick or double-coated.Not rinsing your dog’s coat properly can lead to skin irritation and pH imbalance.









Remember not to pour water over your dog’s head and face. If you’re using a pitcher or bucket to rinse, pour water so that it flows down his back, not toward his face. Avoid spraying your dog’s face if you’re using a hose or sprayer., If you can find a highly absorbent microfiber towel, it will make the drying process quicker; however, even a regular bath towel will work.Lay the towel over your dog's back and pat him dry. Don’t rub the towel, as this can cause matting in long-haired breeds. Remember that your dog’s natural instinct will be to shake himself dry, so be prepared for some splattering.








Some people may use hair dryers to dry their dog’s fur. Keep the heat setting on low or cool to avoid burning your dog. Never point a hair dryer at your dog’s face., If your dog has very long or shaggy fur, you will want to comb it out while it’s wet to avoid it tangling. You can use a detangling mist to help this process., To keep the positive associations with bathtime strong, give your dog a treat every time you wash him. Praise him for being a good dog. This way, your dog will learn that bathtime is not a time to dread but a fun time that involves treats and praise.If your dog is particularly nervous during baths, you may even give him a little treat during the washing process.

, Remove the cotton balls from your dog’s ears. You should clean his ears of excessive earwax to help avoid irritation or infection.You can use a specially formulated ear rinse such as Vetericyn Ear Rinse.You can also use witch hazel, hydrogen peroxide, or a mixture of equal parts organic apple cider vinegar and purified water.Apply some of the ear cleaner on a cotton ball. Do not use cotton swabs. You could damage your dog’s eardrums if you insert them too far.Rub the cotton ball around the inside of the ear. Check the cotton ball for waxy residue. Once you don’t see any more residue on the cotton ball, your dog’s ears are clean. You can also use a soaked cotton ball to clean the dog’s outer ears (the large flappy bits are called the pinna).Try not to pour or spray the solution directly into the dog’s ears. Many dogs don’t like this, and you want to avoid as many negative associations with bathtime as possible.If your dog has hairs growing from his ear canal, consult your vet. Some breeds can develop tangled ear hair, which can lead to ear infections., Some dogs have a condition called epiphora, which occurs when your dog’s tears overflow onto his face.This is very common in brachycephalic breeds such as many terriers and chihuahuas.Wash this extra tear buildup away to avoid irritation or bacterial infection.Colloidal silver is commonly recommended, as it is safe to use around the eyes. It comes in spray or liquid drops form. Apply colloidal silver to a clean cotton ball and wipe your pet’s eyes.Dabbing a bit of coconut oil beneath the eyes where the tear stain “tracks” are can help keep the skin from getting irritated.Many pet supply stores sell tear stain cleansers and even pre-saturated pads. These can be easy to use. Just make sure that the product is marked hypoallergenic and that it doesn’t contain the substance tylosin tartrate. This antibiotic is not approved for use on dogs or cats.Some breeds, such as poodles and shih-tzus, have a condition called distichiasis, where their eyelashes grow inward rather than outward. This can cause eye irritation and excessive tearing. If you notice that your dog has frequent tear buildup, consult with your vet. It may be nothing more than a result of his facial shape, but it is always better to be safe.Do not use hydrogen peroxide, apple cider vinegar, makeup remover, human eye drops, or milk of magnesia to clean your dog’s eyes., Now that he’s all clean, give your dog another treat. Praise him for being a good dog. Give him some petting and perhaps play a game."

Notice when your dog vomits.,
Examine the vomit.,
Detect pain or distress during vomiting episodes.,
Take your dog to your vet.,
Have your vet examine your dog.,
Learn about why dogs vomit bile.",How to Diagnose Yellow Foamy Vomit in Dogs," Dogs that vomit bile usually do so late in the evening or early in the morning. This is because a dog’s stomach usually empties about two hours after a meal.By late evening or early morning, your dog’s stomach will have been empty for a long time, allowing time for bile to irritate the stomach lining.


Consider keeping a written log of when you see your dog vomiting. If your dog vomits yellow and foamy fluid before its morning meal or several hours after its evening meal, then your dog likely has bilious vomiting syndrome.;
, Yellow and foamy vomit will not have any food particles in it because the stomach is empty. Vomit with partially digested food will also have bile, but the bile will not be as easy to see. If your dog initially vomits partially digested food and then continues vomiting, the stomach will eventually be empty and you will see only the yellow and foamy fluid., Vomiting is not a pleasant experience for dogs. Besides the distress of vomiting, your dog may have some abdominal pain because of bile’s irritation of the stomach lining.Below are signs of distress that your dog may have during a vomiting episode:Licking the lips
Drooling
Repeatedly swallowing

, By itself, bilious vomiting syndrome is not a serious problem in dogs. However, it can lead to other problems. Therefore, if your dog is vomiting bile, do not delay with taking your dog to your vet.The sooner your vet can diagnose this syndrome, the sooner your dog can receive treatment and not develop health problems related to vomiting bile.

, Your vet will perform a physical examination. During the physical exam, describe the vomiting episodes in as much detail as possible: when your dog vomits, what the vomit looks like, and how long the vomiting has been going on. The more information you give your vet, the better able they’ll be able to diagnose your dog.

, Although it’s well known that dogs vomit bile when they have an empty stomach, it’s not clearly known how the bile gets into the stomach in the first place.Some potential causes of bile abnormally flowing into the stomach include inflammatory bowel diseases, internal parasites (Giardia), and intestinal blockage."

Understand the phases of seizure.,
Recognize the signs of aura.,
Become aware of aura signs to ensure your dog's safety.,
Know when the seizure is occurring.,
Understand that your dog will be very confused during the seizure.,
Recognize if the fit lasts longer than 20 minutes.,
Be aware when your dog has entered the post-seizure phase.",How to Spot Dog Seizure Symptoms1," Before a seizure, abnormal electrical activity builds in the brain, and after the seizure occurs it takes a while to for brain activity normalize again. The length of each phase varies depending on the individual and the severity of the seizure episode. An average time period would be 30 minutes for the aura stage, 3 minutes for the seizure, and anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours post-seizure. These are the three stages of seizure:


Aura – this is a period of time before the seizure when the animal shows changed behavior
Seizure – the fit itself
Post-seizure – the pet is recovering from a major electrical storm in the brain and may be confused, bump into things, and appear blind.;
, Many animals that suffer from seizure show subtle signs in the time leading up to a fit. Sometimes you only realize in hindsight that your dog was behaving abnormally, but you can learn to recognize the signs in order to better prepare for an impending seizure.


Signs of aura include: restlessness, pacing, and an inability to settle.
It's as if your dog knows something is wrong, but doesn't know what to do, or how to get comfortable.
Some dogs become excessively vocal, whining, barking, or crying for no apparent reason.
Dogs that are particularly bonded to their owner may become extra clingy, as if seeking comfort, whilst other pets hide away, as if to protect themselves from an unseen threat.

, If you recognize aura signs, now is the time to give your dog preventative medications such as rectal diazepam. This helps to cancel out the erratic brain activity, and may reduce the likelihood of a seizure occurring. Also, it gives you time to put your pet in a safe environment where he cannot hurt himself during the seizure.


Take precautions such as switching off electric heaters, and placing cushions against hard objects such as table legs.

, During a seizure, your dog will collapse and lie on his side, with all four legs extended, in a rigid posture. The head will be arched back, and the eyes will roll in their sockets. After a few seconds, the legs start to paddle, or make swimming motions in the air. A seizure may contain some or all of the following:



Mouth makes champing movements. The dog loses conscious control, and random electrical activity in the brain stimulates the chewing muscles.

Tongue lolls out of the mouth. Loss of conscious control of the tongue.

Drooling and heavy salivation: The dog is unable to swallow and so his saliva spills out of his mouth.

Scrambling, paddling, swimming motions made with rigid legs: Conflicting neurological messages tell the skeletal muscles to contract in an uncoordinated way.

Loss of bladder and bowel control: This is a combination of the loss of inhibitory muscle tone that keep the bladder closed and increased pressure within the abdomen, as the dog's muscles contract in an uncoordinated way.

Generalized shaking and tremors: Muscle twitching is triggered by erratic neurological impulses from the brain.

, Your dog is not aware of his surroundings. Your dog's higher centers of consciousness are overridden during the seizure, and his brain is flooded with random electrical stimulation, stifling the conscious centers.


He will probably not respond to his name, or anything around him. Your dog cannot see or hear because his hearing and sight centers in the brain are being swamped by random electrical messages.

, If your dog has a seizure lasting longer than 20 minutes, get him immediate veterinary attention to avoid permanent brain damage. This is known as status epilepticus and needs urgent veterinary attention to reduce the risk of long term brain damage.


Know that the average length of a seizure is around 2 to 3 minutes. Seizures generally do not take too long to cease, although it can seem much longer when it happens to your pet.
Less commonly, seizures can be longer, around 5 – 10 minutes

, After a while, your dog will come out of his seizure and enter the post-seizure phase. Commonly, your pet will seem confused, disorientated, and wobbly on his legs. He may wander aimlessly, and even bump into walls as if he is blind.


This phase can be brief, a matter of 5 minutes or so, whilst for some it lasts for hours.
A normal seizure does not usually cause any permanent damage, and the disorientation and blindness are temporary.
One slightly bizarre symptom of this is that some dogs seem very hungry, and actively seek out food.

Choose the right time.,
Ease into paw handling.,
Teach your dog to lie on his side during trims if necessary.,
Inspect the paws for abnormalities.As you are massaging the paws and nails, take the opportunity to examine their health.,
Use clippers made specifically for dogs.,
Locate the quick.,
Secure the dog.,
Start with the back paws.,
Stop any bleeding if you cut into the quick.,
Praise your dog frequently.,
File the nails, if desired.",How to Trim a Dog's Nails," Most dogs do not like nail trims, so it's important to choose a time when your dog is relaxing. If he's in the mood to play, wait until he's lounging before approaching him for paw-handling training.;
, Start by touching your dog's paws gently. If he doesn’t pull away or resist, start massaging the paw and gently pressing on his nails. Depending on your dog’s age and temperament, it may take a few sessions before he's used to paw handling. Repeat this exercise a few times daily until your dog stops reacting to paw handling.

, If your dog's had a bad experience in the past, he may resist nail trims. For example, if someone accidentally cut the ""quick"" (an area of the nail with a rich blood and nerve supply), he would have experienced pain and bleeding. Older dogs may have arthritis in their toes, and nail trimming may be uncomfortable. For dogs like this, it can be helpful to have them lie down while you carefully handle their nails.


Have them lie on their side while you do your paw-handling training exercises.
Another way is to trim the nails while the dog is standing without lifting up the paw. Only do this if you are experienced with trimming nails., Bring any pain, sore or raw spots, nail breakage, swelling or redness, lameness, or odd nail color to the attention of your veterinarian before you attempt to trim the nails.Trauma, infections, tumors, and immune diseases are the most common nail disorders in dogs.


Trauma usually only occurs in one nail, and is caused by running on rough surfaces, catching a nail on an object, or improper nail trimming.
Trauma or health conditions like diabetes and low thyroid levels can lead to bacterial infection in the nail. Bacterial infections usually cause swelling, pain, and discharge around the nails.
Fungal and parasitic infections are less common than bacterial infections, but cause similar symptoms.
Tumors can take different forms: lumps, bumps, swellings, redness, or discharge.
Immune disease can also affect the nail, and may make the nail brittle and prone to sloughing.
Always bring these findings to the attention of your veterinarian as soon as possible for treatment.

, Human clippers are designed for a flat surface area, but dog nails are cupped. Using human clippers can squish the nail, causing pain or injury. There are a few different types of dog nail trimmers, the most common being either the guillotine (U shaped) or the scissors type. Which type to use is generally a matter of preference for the user.


The ""scissors"" might be easier to use, as you don't need to thread the nail through the cutting surface as with the guillotine.

, The quick is the part of the nail rich in blood supply and nerves. Cutting into it can be quite painful for the dog, and cause bleeding. Ideally, you should trim the nail back to within 2-4 millimeters of the quick.


If your dog has white nails, you should be able to see the pink-colored quick through the nail.
If your dog has dark nails you won't be able to see the quick. Carefully trim the nails back a little at a time to avoid cutting into it. You might have a groomer or vet show you how far to trim the nails.
If a dog’s nails grow too long, the quick will grow with it. Frequent trimmings will make the quick recede back to a normal length.

, If the dog's relaxed and used to having its paws and nails handled, just have your dog lie down for its nail trimming. If he gets antsy, restrain him gently in the lying position using the elbow and arm that's holding his paw.


If you have a very wriggly dog, ask a second person to help you out. Have your friend hold the dog while you're free to focus on the trimming.

, The nails on the back paws are usually shorter and easier to trim. Dogs also tend to be a bit calmer about having their back paws manipulated than their front paws, so start there, then move on to the front paws.


Locate or approximate the quick before trimming off the end of the nail.
Carefully work your way back towards the quick and stop trimming 2-3 millimeters in front of it.
Don’t forget to trim the dewclaws on dogs that have them. Dewclaws are the nails some dogs have on the inside of the leg, just above the ""wrist."", A cut quick usually bleeds a lot, and your dog may cry out in pain or nip at you if this happens. If you accidentally cause bleeding, hold a piece of tissue onto the nail for a few minutes. If that doesn't stop bleeding, apply cornstarch or a commercial stop-bleeding powder or pen. Either dip the nail into the powder or apply a large amount using your fingertip.


If bleeding doesn’t stop after 10 minutes, call your vet.

, A lot of praise, and if you wish, a little treat, is a great incentive to stand still. Praise throughout the process, and give a treat after you finish working on each paw.

, Just like human nails, dog nails can be rough and abrasive when they're freshly cut. They will wear down on their own with time. But, if you're worried about your floors or furniture, you can choose to file the nails immediately to round them off.

"
Understand that not all events that look like seizures are the same.,
Recognizing when your dog experiences a faint of cardio-vascular origin.,
Spotting a faint of neurological origin.,
Knowing when your dog is overreacting to pain.,
Take note of your dog's seizures when they occur, to better prepare for next time.",How to Spot Dog Seizure Symptoms2," Not everything that at first sight looks like a seizure, is a seizure. Some things that are commonly mistaken for a fit are:


A faint of cardio-vascular origin: This is when the heart cannot maintain circulation to the brain and is starved of oxygen, resulting in your pet losing consciousness.
A faint of neurological origin: This is when the vagus nerve is overstimulated, telling the heart rate to slow, and resulting in a blood pressure drop that causes your pet to faint.
Pain reaction: An exaggerated behavioral response that can mimic a seizure.

, A faint can be confused with a seizure, because it looks similar when your dog drops to the ground and loses consciousness. However, a faint is caused by inadequate oxygen supply to the brain, which results in your dog briefly losing consciousness. The most common cause of faint is an irregular heartbeat.


Some dogs appear perfectly well and have no other symptoms, whilst others have a history of coughing, heavy breathing, or reluctance to exercise.
The key differences between a faint and a fit are:

Before a faint the animal shows no aura signs: the loss of oxygen to the brain and drop in blood pressure happen almost instantaneously.
During a faint the animal's muscles are relaxed (in a fit, the muscles are rigid, and legs extended): The muscles are not being given any messages at all.
No loss of bladder or bowel control during a faint: The dog is in a state of relaxation, rather than heightened muscular activity.
No champing the mouth, or excessive salivation: A faint does not last long enough for enough saliva to be produced for your dog to drool.
On average, a faint lasts no longer than 30 seconds: An average seizure lasts 2 to 3 minutes.
After a faint the animal acts as if nothing has happened (no post-seizure signs): Once circulation is restored, the dog acts normal again.



, The longest nerve in the body, the vagus nerve, passes along the neck. When pressure is applied to this nerve, such as when a dog pulls on his collar, it can cause a dramatic slowing of the heart rate. If the heart slows too much, the blood supply to the brain is reduced and the dog may faint.


This same thing can happen if the dog coughs excessively, or strains abnormally hard to pass feces. The differences between this faint and a fit are the same as listed above.

, Some sensitive dogs can overreact when stung by an insect. They cry and whine, and then may throw themselves to the ground to gnaw at the spot that has been stung. This erratic behavior can sometimes be mistaken for a fit. The difference is that the dog remains conscious, and if you distract him, he knows what's happening around him and can respond to his name (although whether he chooses to do so or not is a different matter!)

, Rather than feel helpless when your dog has a fit, remember to time when it starts and stops. This is useful information for your veterinarian. Also, if you have a phone on hand, record video of the episode – again, it can prove invaluable for a clinician to witness the episode first hand.

Gather supplies.,
Remain calm.,
Staunch the bleeding.,
Apply the styptic pencil.,
Repeat.",How to Stop a Dog's Quick from Bleeding1," If you’re using a styptic pencil, you’ll need it and a bit of water to moisten it with.


Styptic pencils are relatively easy to obtain and contain an astringent that stimulates blood vessel contraction, which encourages bleeding to stop.Styptic pencils are available from most pharmacies.;
, Hopefully you’ve anticipated this scenario, and, if you happen to cut the quick, you can calmly reach the materials you gathered beforehand.


The blood loss from a bleeding quick is not dangerous to a healthy dog.The bleeding nail can, however, look a bit alarming, especially if the dog is scrambling around and spreading blood over the floor. Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort.
Remember that remaining calm is important for you but also for your dog. The quick is tender and full of nerves, so having it clipped will be painful to your dog and it will be looking to you for cues about how to react. If you get panicked or frantic, your dog likely will, too.

, The quick is located in the center of the nail, and you'll see blood seeping from this area.


Grab your styptic pencil and remove any packaging.
Expose and moisten the tip of the styptic pencil.

, Hold the bleeding toe steady and gently restrain your dog to prevent it from moving while you apply the styptic pencil.


Place the styptic pencil directly in contact with the bleeding toe and press firmly.
Keep the pencil held firmly in place for at least 2 minutes, then remove.

, If the bleeding hasn't stopped, repeat the process above but hold the styptic pencil in place for 5 minutes.


The bleeding should stop after holding the pencil in place for five minutes. If it doesn’t phone your vet and ask whether you should bring your dog in.

Secure the wrap.,
Get your dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible.",How to Wrap a Dog’s Shoulder1," If your dog has a deep, bleeding wound in the shoulder, you’ll need some basic supplies to wrap it properly. Ideally, you should keep these items on hand in a first aid kit:


sterile gauze pads
cotton roll
micropore tape (3M micropore)
elastic bandage;
, Press down on the wound with a sterile gauze pad to slow down the bleeding.

, Dab the area around the wound with cotton to ensure that it is as clean as possible.

, Place a fresh set of gauze pads over the wound. Use four to six layers of gauze, and make sure the entire wound is covered. Apply pressure again.

, Tape the gauze pads to keep them in place, using the micropore tape.


If you do not have micropore tape, you can substitute another kind. What’s most important is that the gauze stays securely in place.

, Using an elastic bandage, start your wrap. Begin by wrapping the bandage around the dog’s chest, immediately after the shoulder. This will serve to anchor the bandage.

, Take the bandage and pass it over and around the shoulder area several times, covering the gauze. Apply sufficient pressure to ensure that the bleeding stops.

, Continue to wrap the bandage around your dog, going around front legs, the chest, and the shoulder.

, Elastic bandages come with locks to keep them in place. Use that to secure the bandage.

, These instructions are only meant to help you provide immediate first aid when necessary. If your dog has a deep, bleeding wound, you need to see a veterinarian.

Get your dog rehydrated at an animal hospital.,
Know that your dog will be started on pain medications.,
Give your dog her antibiotics.,
Understand that antibiotics are only one part of treatment.",How to Treat Pyometra in Dogs1," To decrease the risks associated with getting anesthesia, your dog first needs to be stabilized. In particular, dogs with pyometras are often dehydrated because the concentrated toxins impair kidney function. Dehydration also concentrates toxins in the blood, and so poses a double risk because the heart muscle can become more easily irritated by anesthetic agents, and thus cardiac arrest becomes more likely.A dog has a ""maintenance"" requirement for fluid. This is the amount of fluid that is necessary to meet the dog's daily need. Typically a dog with a pyometra will be put on a fluid flow rate of two or three times the maintenance level, for anything from a 2 to 24 hours prior to surgery, depending on how dehydrated she is. This fluid will be given intravenously.;
, During this stabilization period your dog will be started on pain relief medications that will help to decrease the amount of anesthetic agents necessary to keep her pain-free during the surgery.

, During this period your dog should start an antibiotic course to help control the secondary bacteremia and septicemia. This reduces the toxic effects on her organs so they are better able to process the anesthetic agents, and circulation to vital organs is protected.A broad spectrum antibiotic such as amoxicillin is often prescribed. This is available as an intravenous injection, Augmentin, for rapid onset of action, and can be continued at home in tablet form. Potentiated amoxicillin sinks into the womb and is effective at killing most of the bacterial types found there. This is typically given twice a day by mouth once your dog is well enough.
Make sure to see the antibiotic course through to the end. Do not stop giving your dog her pills because she begins to look better; even if she is acting like she is better, she still needs to complete the course so that she can make a full recovery.

, Antibiotics are essential as part of the treatment, mainly to keep bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and septicemia (blood poisoning) under control. This still leaves the underlying problem of an infected womb to deal with. The main option, which is effective and a ""cure"", is surgical removal of the womb.


If for any reason this is not possible, such as if your dog is too sick to survive the anesthetic, then using drugs to expel pus from the womb may be considered as the treatment of last resort, in order to buy time. These medications are outlined in Method 3.

Collect your supplies.,
Maintain your calm.,
Hold the bleeding nail at 90 degrees to the dry soap.,
Hold the foot still in this position for 3 - 4 minutes.,
Repeat.",How to Stop a Dog's Quick from Bleeding2," If you’re using a bar of soap, the soap is the only thing you’ll need.


An ordinary bar of soap, when pressed into the claw, will form a plug that covers the quick, like putting a cork in a bottle.This plug generally dislodges itself several hours later and needs no further attention.

, Ideally you’ve prepared yourself for this situation and can calmly use the materials you have ready at hand to stop the bleeding.


A healthy dog won’t be at risk from blood loss from a bleeding quick, but the blood can be somewhat alarming, particularly if your dog seems distressed.Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort.
Remaining calm is important to both you and your dog. If you cut the dog’s quick, the dog will likely be distressed and will look to you for cues on how to react. If you show alarm or become frantic, your dog likely will, too.

, Gently restrain your dog to keep it still as you do this.


Push firmly so that the nail is embedded into the soap to a depth of approximately 3 - 4 millimeters.

, This places gentle pressure on the blood vessels and stops them from bleeding.


Remove the toe from the soap after 3 - 4 minutes with a gentle twisting action.
If your dog won’t hold still, push the claw firmly into the soap and then remove the soap with a slight twist of the wrist.

, If a plug doesn’t form, repeat the above process again, pressing the claw into the soap until you’re successful.


You’ll know a plug has successfully been formed when the soap is blocking the tip of the nail and no more blood is seeping through.
If the bleeding won’t stop, contact your vet.

Get your supplies ready.,
Stay calm.,
Moisten the tip of a cotton swab with water.,
Press the swab into the bleeding quick and hold for 30 seconds.,
Repeat.",How to Stop a Dog's Quick from Bleeding3," If you’re using potassium permanganate, you’ll need the potassium permanganate crystals, cotton swabs, and a bit of water to moisten the swabs.


Potassium permanganate is a powder made up of bright purple crystals and is the preferred method of veterinarians to stop bleeding nails.It’s highly effective and the permanganate is a natural disinfectant.Potassium permanganate crystals are widely available on internet retail sites.

, Ideally you’ve anticipated this scenario and can calmly use the materials you’ve prepared to stop the bleeding.


The blood loss from a bleeding nail is not dangerous to a healthy dog.The bleeding nail can, however, look a bit dramatic, especially if the dog scrambles around spreading blood all over the floor. Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort.
Remember that remaining calm is important for you but also for your dog. The quick is tender and full of nerves, so having it clipped will be painful to your dog and it will be looking to you for cues on how to react. If you get panicked or frantic, your dog likely will, too.

, It’s important that the swab be slightly moist so that the potassium permanganate crystals will adhere to it.You don’t need to soak the swab, just dampen it with a few drops of water.

, Gently restrain your dog while you apply the swab.


The bleeding should stop fairly quickly.

, If the bleeding hasn’t stopped, repeat the above process again, this time holding the swab in place for 5 minutes.If after 5 minutes the bleeding still hasn’t stopped, contact your vet.

"
"
Contact your vet if the bleeding continues.,
Bandage the paw.,
Have the vet or a professional groomer trim your dog’s nails.",How to Stop a Dog's Quick from Bleeding4," In the unlikely situation that none of the methods above work to stop the bleeding, phone your veterinarian for advice.If the vet recommends bringing your dog in, calmly begin preparing your dog for transport.

, Do your best to bandage the paw before transporting your dog to the vet.


Use a bandage from a first aid kit to put a temporary dressing over the paw to help stop the dog from hitting the sore nail and to keep the car a bit cleaner.
Alternatively, you can place a swab or gauze dressing over the toe and wrap a bandage around the paw to hold it in place. Put enough tension on the bandage that it grips the paw and doesn't fall off, but don't pull it too taut or the bandage may cut off circulation to the paw. If the bandage is too tight, your dog will seem distressed and chew at the bandage; if that happens, loosen the wrapping.
If you don’t have access to a first aid kit, wrap clean toilet tissue or cotton wool around the toe and apply a tight-fitting sock over the paw to hold it in place. If you have someone available to help, ask them to hold cotton wool over the nail while you’re en route to the vet.

, If you find that you have difficulty trimming your dog’s nails yourself, perhaps because you’re nervous about hurting your dog or your dog has learned to fear nail trimmings, you best option may be to try having it professionally done.


If your dog shows noticeable distress at going to the groomer’s or to the vet’s, you might consider asking the vet or groomer to show you better strategies for trimming your dog’s nails at home.
If you’re able to get more comfortable trimming the nails yourself, you may be able to avoid giving your dog the extra anxiety that may be associated with going to the groomer or vet."

Make sure the fracture is in the shoulder.,
Gather your materials.,
Place the dog in a comfortable standing position.,
Wrap with cotton.,
Flex the leg.,
Begin wrapping the shoulder.,
Repeat several times.,
Get your dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible.",How to Wrap a Dog’s Shoulder2," You should always see a veterinarian to verify the injury, but in the meantime, check the area of the shoulder. In the case of a fracture, it will be swollen and painful to the touch. Swelling and pain in another part of the leg may indicate that a fracture is located elsewhere. In addition, your dog will not use that leg for walking because it moves the shoulder, causing the fracture or dislocation to move.

, If your dog has a fracture or dislocation in the shoulder, you’ll need some basic supplies to wrap it properly. Ideally, you should keep these items on hand in a first aid kit:


large roll of cotton
adhesive bandage

, Try to calm your dog and get it into a standing position. If possible, have someone else hold and support the dog while you wrap the shoulder; this will decrease the weight on the other legs.

, Take your roll of cotton and use it to wrap the shoulder area and the foreleg. Then place a roll of cotton between the injured shoulder and the chest.


The amount of cotton padding necessary depends on the size of the dog. Your main objectives should be providing stability and ensuring that there is no contact between the shoulder and the chest.

, Flex the elbow and foreleg of the dog, so it is bent. It will make the shape of a “Z.”

, Wrap an adhesive bandage around the foreleg and up the side of the chest, then over the shoulder. Then bring the bandage down the side of the other shoulder, across the chest, and back to the original foreleg.

, Repeat these motions, keeping the elbow below the level of the paws.

, These instructions are only meant to help you provide immediate first aid when necessary. If your dog has a fracture or dislocation, you need to see a veterinarian.

Understand that surgery is a necessary part of treating your dog.,
Have your dog assessed.,
Be aware that the operation involves a laparotomy.,
Know that part of your dog’s coat will be clipped.,
Understand that an incision will be made.,
Leave your dog in the care of the hospital for 24 hours.,
Pick up your dog, as well as her antibiotic prescription.,
Bring your dog back to have her stitches removed.",How to Treat Pyometra in Dogs2," Although it seems counter-intuitive to put a sick dog through surgery, in the vast majority of cases this is the best option. Your veterinarian will stabilize your dog first, as described in Method 1. Once stable, surgery to remove both the ovaries and infected womb will give your dog her best chance at survival.Surgery is necessary to remove the source of the infection—the womb. This is the safest and most reliable means of removing the reservoir of the bacteria, toxins, and pus.

, Before getting surgery, the vet will assess your dog’s circulatory system by looking at her gums. He or she will also listen to your dog’s heart. This will confirm that your dog is ready for surgery.

, Laparotomy is when the abdomen is opened up to gain access to the womb. Your dog will be given a short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent to make her sleepy enough to banish her swallow reflex. This will allow the veterinarian to safely insert a tracheal tube down into your dog’s windpipe.

, With your dog lying on her back, the nurse will clip all the hair from your dog’s belly so that her skin can be sterilized. Once clipping is complete, your dog will be transferred to the sterile environment of the theater.


The nurse will use a surgical scrub to sterilize the skin of the abdomen while the vet readies him or herself.

, Using sterile surgical drapes to mask off everything but the incision, the veterinarian will make an incision that runs from your dog’s tummy button to the brim of her pelvis.The vet will then proceed with the surgery, removing the infected womb and sealing off the wound.

, Your dog will most likely be hospitalized for at least 24 hours after surgery. This will allow for further pain relief to keep her comfortable as the anesthetic wears off.


It also allows for continued intravenous therapy which can be of benefit to keep flushing toxins out of your dog’s system.

, Once your dog is eating and drinking without vomiting, and happy to amble out to the toilet, she will be allowed to go home with a course of new antibiotics and pain relief medications.


As with the previous course of antibiotics, make sure to give your dog her pills every day until the course is done. If you stop giving her the medication when she seems to be acting better, you run the high risk of allowing the infection to return.

, The sutures will be removed approximately 10 to 14 days after the operation, at which point your dog should be good as new.

"
"
Understand that medications are seen as a last resort if surgery is unsuccessful or too dangerous.,
Consider giving your dog Aglepristone.,
Familiarize yourself with Dinoprost.",How to Treat Pyometra in Dogs3," There are a few, rare cases, where operating on your dog is an unacceptable risk. Such cases include dogs known to have blood clotting problems. If clotting is impaired there is a great risk of fatal intraoperative hemorrhage. The veterinarian needs to weigh up the risks and benefits. If the dog is highly likely to die during surgery then treatment through medication should be discussed.


Giving drugs to your dog that cause the uterus to contract and push the pus out is a controversial treatment and not all veterinarians are prepared to offer this service. There is a chance that the dog’s uterus will rupture if the womb contracts against a closed cervix.

, Available in the UK, (but not currently in the US) Aglepristone (Alizin) is labeled for pregnancy termination in dogs. It is a progesterone blocker, thus it deprives the womb of what it needs to maintain the pregnancy. The same logic applies to a pyometra. The womb simply relaxes and releases its purulent burden.


Treatment is comprised of two injections given under the skin, 24 hours apart. Aglepristone causes the cervix to relax, so there is less risk of uterine rupture than with other medications.

, Dinoprost (Lutalyse) is a drug that causes abortion in small animals, causing the uterus to lose its contents. Lutalyse is a large animal drug and its use in dogs is off license, which adds to the reluctance of many veterinarians to use it.


It is given by injection under the skin, and experimental data says it should only be given to healthy dogs under the age of six, which limits its usefulness for pyometra. The injection also causes pain at the injection site, and a few hours after the injection your dog may vomit, trembles, salivate heavily, and show signs of restlessness consistent with abdominal pain.

Find a general health screening kit.,
Pick a test for your dog's specific health issues.,
Discuss using a screening kit with your veterinarian.,
Follow the directions.,
Collect your dog's urine.,
Put the urine on the testing strip.,
Interpret the results.,
Follow up with your veterinarian.",How to Use a Home Health Screening Kit for Dogs," There are a wide variety of home health screening kits available from online retailers. The general health screening kits basically test for the same issues, so if you are looking to assess your dog's general health, these should all work similarly.


In order to narrow down your choices, look at online reviews of home health screening kits and pick one that has good reviews.
You can also choose a kit based on the price. However, remember that in many cases you get what you pay for.;
, If you are concerned about a specific health issue, there may be a specific health test that you can give to your dog. For instance, there are home test kits for testing blood glucose levels if your dog is diabetic.This specific testing kit will probably be most helpful to people with pets that already have a diagnosed issue with diabetes.


Another specific at home kit is a DNA test to check your dog's breed and any genetic issues it may have. You can also get worm tests that can be done at home.

, If you are concerned with your dog's health due to an ongoing medical issue or a family history of health problems you should discuss this with your dog's veterinarian. They may have suggestions for specific products to use or they may suggest an alternative, such as getting veterinary testing more often.


Even if your veterinarian says that home health screening is not necessary, it is still your right to choose to do it. As long as the testing does not replace annual veterinary exams, it does not hurt your dog to test it more often at home.

, The risk of doing health screening at home is getting a false positive or negative result. To eliminate most of the risk of a false result, follow the instructions very closely. They are designed to get you the most true results possible.


Different tests may have slightly different directions. If you have done a home health test on your dog before but are now using a different brand, be sure to read the instructions on the product you are currently using.

, A general home health screening kit will analyze your dog's urine for signs of a potential health issue. In order to do this, you will need to collect its urine.If you know your dog's bathroom schedule and follow it when it goes out to go, you should be able to get a sample while it urinates.


Your testing kit may come with gloves you can wear while collecting your dog's urine. Even if the test doesn't come with them, find some gloves to wear so that your hands stay clean.
Some tests sell an optional stick adapter that will help you to collect the urine. If you are nervous about collection, this tool may be helpful.Home health screening kits do not require much urine. You will only need around a teaspoon to complete the test.

, Once you have collected your dog's urine you will need to put the urine on the test strip. Make sure the test strip is thoroughly saturated in urine in order to get the clearest results. Then wait the specified amount of time before evaluating the results.The way you cover the testing strip in urine will vary depending on your specific product. Follow the directions provided.
Results from the test will show up in colors on the test strip. These colors will need to be interpreted in order to understand what the test is telling you.

, The instructions that come with the kit will not necessarily connect test results to a specific diagnosis. This is due to the liability that may create, as well as the need for a trained veterinarian to take a variety of factors into consideration before giving a specific diagnosis. With this in mind, you may need to do some research to find out what certain results may mean for your pet.


Some of these kits have apps that can be used to help you analyze the results. Once the test strip results appear, you can take a picture of it with your smart phone and upload it to the app associated with the testing kit. The app will then give you more specific information about the results., If there are any abnormal results you should have your dog looked at by a veterinarian and discuss the results. The at home test is most useful for alerting you of a problem that you then get treated by a veterinary professional.


Following up with your veterinarian can be especially helpful if you don't know what the results indicate. For instance, a pH level that is off could indicate a variety of health issues, such as kidney disease or bladder stones, that only a veterinarian can diagnose.Do no use a home health screening kit as a replacement for your dog's annual veterinary exam. These tests do not check on everything a veterinarian does and they cannot evaluate a variety of symptoms in conjunction like a veterinarian can."

Remove the bandage.",How to Wrap a Dog's Tail," Before you wrap your dog's tail, look it over to make sure it actually needs a wrap. ""Happy tail"" will result in obvious blood loss from your dog's tail and you should be able to see where the site of the wound is.


Try to contact your veterinarian. They will be able to wrap the tail and check for any other damage.
If you are unable to contact your veterinarian, you may have to wrap your dog's tail yourself.
Wrapping a dog's tail can help it to heal faster and prevent further injury.;
, The wrap will be done in three basic stages, applying ointment and gauze, wrapping in cotton for padding, and then taping the bandage to secure everything in place.


Ointment goes directly on the wounded area. Clean the area first and then make sure you cover the entire injury with ointment.
Gauze and cotton should cover the injury as well. These layers help add protection and keep the ointment where it needs to be.
Tape will be applied in two ways. First, apply the tape lengthwise, down the dogs tail and over the gauze and cotton. Then apply rings around those first pieces of tape, starting at the tip and working down the tail.

, You will need a few key items to properly wrap your dog's tail. Getting items together before you begin will allow you to work faster when you apply the bandage and minimize discomfort for your dog.Adhesive medical tape with a width of about one inch.
Antibiotic ointment (Mycitracin/lidocaine).Cotton. Larger pieces of cotton will be easier to work with.
One non-stick gauze pad.

, You will want to pre-cut the tape in order to allow you to work quickly. The size of your dog's tail injury will vary, so you may need more or less tape to wrap the tail. However, you can cut about ten strips of the adhesive tape to the following sizes:Two long pieces (eight inches)
Six short pieces (four inches)
Two half pieces (four inches in length, one half inch in width)

, The ointment will help to prevent infection as well as promote healing. Ointment will need to be reapplied every time you change the bandage.


Put ointment on the wound. Make sure you use enough to cover the injured area.
You may also want to put some ointment on the gauze bandage as well to ensure that it will come in contact with the wound.

, Take the gauze bandage and cut out a piece that will be big enough to cover the size of the wound. Gently wrap the bandage around the wound and secure it with the narrow pieces of tape.Don't tape or wrap anything too tightly.
Try wrapping the tape down the tail in a spiral.
You can also try wrapping the adhesive tape around the tail, at each end of the bandage.
Make sure the gauze covers the wound fully.

, Take the cotton and place it around the wounded area of the tail. Make sure there is enough cotton to fully cover the area and provide enough padding to keep it from further injury.If you have a large piece of cotton, try wrapping it around the tail just like you would a bandage.
Wrap the cotton around the tail entirely at the site of the injury. The cotton should fully cover the gauze and provide padding to the injured area.
Carefully compress the cotton, making it conform to the shape of the tail. Be careful not to compress the cotton too forcefully as you may cause further injury to the tail.

, After you have the gauze bandage and cotton in place, you can start to tape them to the tail. The tape you are now adding will form the outside of the bandage as well as help to securely hold the gauze pad in place. These next pieces of tape will run lengthwise, down the dogs tail.Place an eight inch piece of tape lengthwise, parallel to the tail, over the cotton. The tape will start and end on the dog's fur.
Place a six inch piece of tape slightly askew of the first eight inch piece. It should start and end in the same places; however, it will be angled off to the right somewhat, covering the first piece only slightly.
Add another six inch piece of tape in the same way, expect this time angle it to the left.
You should have three pieces of tape now, covering the wound, lengthwise down the dog's tail. They should start and end in the fur, just past the ends of the gauze bandage.

, Now that you have the bandage anchored to the tail, it's time to add even more stability and protection. These next few pieces of tape will encircle the tail in rings, similar to the way a mummy is wrapped. Add the last few pieces of tape in the following way:Put a piece of tape around the first three pieces and your dog's tail. Start towards the tip of your dog's tail and work down.
Add the next piece of tape, just below this one. It should go all the way around the dog's tail and cover the bandages and tape already affixed.
Keep adding tape in this way until you have covered the length of the bandage.
Make the last piece of tape overlaps the bandage, sticking to the fur of your dog's tail.

, Once you have covered the bandage with tape, you are almost done. These last few actions will fully affix the bandage to the tail and keep it secure.Pull a few bunches of hair out from underneath the last tape wrap.
Place these bunches of hair flat against the surface of the bandage.
Wrap one final piece of tape around these bunches of hair and the tail.

, After you have applied the first bandage, you should visit your veterinarian as soon as you can. You will want to check to see the extent of the damage and how best to treat it.


There may be broken bones in the tail that need advanced treatment.
Your vet may prescribe certain ointments or have alternative techniques for you to follow.
The dog may need stitches if the bleeding too profuse.

, The bandage will need changing as it will either become soiled, wet, fall off, or be destroyed by the dog chewing it. Apply new bandages as you did before to keep the wound healing, protected, and safe from infection or further damage.Do not leave the bandage in place for more than a day.
Wet bandages will trap infections.
Most tail problems will heal in two weeks
Visit your veterinarian if the wound doesn't seem to be healing.

, Happy tail results from your dog either wagging his tail so hard that it bleeds or hitting his tail on a hard surface. If you are able to lower the level of excitement in your dog, you will lower the chances of continued injury to your dog's tail.If your dog gets overly excited when you return home, ignore them, until you get to a larger room that he can wag his tail in without worry of them striking a hard surface.
If your dog gets excited about going on a walk, prepare for the walk in a larger room, giving them more space and avoiding any injury to his tail.
Try to act calmly around your dog as this can result in calm behavior from them as well.
Try using the “sit” command. By having your dog sit, it will reduce the amount of force that he can wag his tail with., If the bandage needs to be on for more than a day, you will have to remove and change the bandage. Leaving a bandage on will increase the chances of infection and won't allow the tail to heal as well as it could. Remove the old bandage by using the following methods:For any areas of the bandage where the fur is stuck to the adhesive, try soaking them in vegetable or olive oil for a few minutes. These oils will help break down the adhesive and allow for easy removal.
If your dogs wound is healed, you can also try using shampoo to remove the adhesive and painlessly take the bandage off.
For small amounts of fur that are stuck to the bandage, you may simply cut the fur away with a pair of scissors. Exercise caution when cutting the bandage away as it is easy to accidentally cut the dogs tail. If you are not confident doing this, you could take your dog to the groomer.
Pulling the bandage off will also pull your dogs hair out and cause it pain. Avoid this method of removal as your dog will come to fear bandages.
Do not use any harsh chemicals such as nail polish or rubbing alcohol as these can be harmful to your dog.

Look for a limp gait.,
Check for skeletal problems.,
Notice any reluctance to do activities.,
Watch for stiffness when your dog is getting up.,
Notice a stiff neck.,
Notice any aggressive body language.",How to Watch a Dog for Stiff or Limp Movements1," A common sign of distress is a limp gait. Your dog may limp as they walk on their paws. The dog may also hold up one of their legs. The limp movement may be in multiple legs, so the dog may walk on different legs at different points during the day.Usually when a dog suffers from a limp gait they will favor placing their weight on certain legs.;
, When your dog's legs are lame, you may notice problems with their bones. If one of the back legs is lame, the dog's pelvis may drop when they step, but then rise when the leg lifts. If both back legs are affected, then the dog's weight will shift forward.You may notice that the bones or joints in the dog's legs, hips, or back are abnormal in size or shape.

, Limp and stiff body movements may result in your dog not wanting to do the same activities they used to enjoy all the time. Your dog may stop jumping around or refuse to climb stairs.If the dog does climb stairs, they may have noticeable trouble, stumble, or even have one leg that is limp when they are finished.

, You may notice that your dog is having trouble standing. They may be stiff all over or some of their legs may appear limp or lame. It may take your dog a long time to stand due to this.Often, the dog will limp or have trouble walking for a few moments after they get up.

, Stiff necks in dogs may point to an underlying medical condition. When your dog has a stiff neck, they may arch their backs or move their nose towards the ground. The dog will probably not want to move their head from side to side or turn around.The muscles around the neck may be very tense or start showing tremors.
The dog may refuse to eat because it is difficult to lower their head to eat from the bowl.

, Sometimes your dog will go completely rigid and stop moving. Their entire body may be tense. A dog’s face may also be stiff or tense, giving them a furrowed brow look. The dog’s mouth may be tense and rigid. The tail may also be stiff and held low or parallel to their body.This may not be due to any sickness or ailment, but be body language in response to something that makes them nervous or upset.

Keep from burning your pet.",How to Use a Rotary Tool to Trim Your Pet's Nails," The most helpful one is the one that has the 'wand' attachment. That is a flexible connector that allows the motor part of the tool to be prone, while you manipulate the more flexible working end of the tool.;
,, It goes without saying that a cat is going to be much harder than a dog (because they have their protective weaponry at hand!).

, You might need some help with this part.

, Assuming one person is holding the pet, the person trimming the nails starts working on them. The rotary tool is basically sanding them off. If you have waited a long time before trying to do this, it is probably a good idea to clip them off (or have them clipped off). It is more time effective.

, You don't want to apply continued pressure from whichever tool you choose to use. You want to almost 'pat' them.

Think about your dog’s age.,
Determine if there is an immediate reason for the mobility problems.,
Consider the dog’s breed.",How to Watch a Dog for Stiff or Limp Movements2," Many older dogs experience mobility problems. This includes stiffness after lying or sleeping and difficulty getting up. Older dogs may slow down when they walk, and they may not do the same activities they used to.Though these are common symptoms in senior dogs, you should still have your dog checked out by a vet. Your vet may be able to figure out a way to ease any pain.

, Sometimes, there is an immediate and obvious reason that your dog is limping. For example, maybe they cut their paw and it is healing. They may have also done vigorous exercise where that has left them bruised or sore. Even a dog having nails that are too long may lead to limping.If your dog has recently had surgery, a medical procedure, or an injury this could result in mobility problems.

, Some breeds of dogs have a higher chance of developing hip and joint problems than others. These problems, such as arthritis or dysplasia, can cause limping or stiffness of the joints or limbs. Some breeds with common joint and limb problems are:Dachshund
Labrador Retrievers
Golden Retrievers
German Shepherds
Rottweilers
Great Danes
Mastiffs

Take your dog to the vet.,
Determine the cause of the lameness.,
Get your dog tested.,
Treat the underlying cause.",How to Watch a Dog for Stiff or Limp Movements3," If you notice any problems with your dog’s legs or gait, you should take them to the vet. Your vet can do a physical exam and figure out exactly what is wrong with your dog. Limping, stiffness, and lameness are non-specific signs that may point to multiple conditions.Even if you think your dog may not have a severe condition, you should still take them to the vet. You want to make sure that your dog is okay.

, Dogs may experience limp or stiff movements for a variety of reasons. Because limp or stiff movement is a symptom of many conditions, it is difficult to figure out the reason without a physical exam by a vet. Common causes for stiff or limp movement include:


ArthritisHip or elbow dysplasia
Obesity
Vertebrae disease
Joint diseasePinched neck nerveTorn ACLSprains, bruises, or cuts on the foot padTrauma
Infection, When you take your dog to the vet, the vet will perform various tests to figure out what is causing your dog’s mobility issues. They need to figure out if it’s a muscle and skeletal problem, a problem with the brain, or an internal problem.The vet will probably order x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. They may also get samples of joint fluid, along with tissue and muscle samples.

, The treatment of your dog’s mobility problems will depend on what is causing it. It may be as simple as making your dog lose weight to take weight and pressure off joints and limbs. Your vet may also prescribe pain medication or steroids to help your dog move better.In severe cases, your dog may need to undergo surgery to fix the cause of the problem.

Monitor your dog’s water intake.,
Observe general changes in behavior.,
Take your dog to your vet.,
Discuss treatment options with your vet.,
Administer all medications as prescribed.,
Monitor your dog for drug reactions.,
Consider advanced methods of bladder stone removal.,
Feed your dog a specialized diet.,
Allow your vet to administer cancer treatment.,
Schedule follow-up visits with your vet.",How to Treat Urinary Tract Problems in Dogs," Urination problems often accompany urinary tract problems. Prolonged straining is a common urination problem: your dog will stay in a urinating position for a long time, yet produce only a little bit of urine.Straining would be painful, so you may hear whining or whimpering as he tries to urinate.


If your dog is unable to fully empty his bladder, he would feel the urge to urinate frequently.
Frequent urination can also occur with kidney disease, which causes a dog to drink more water.Weak bladder muscles can cause frequent urination, particularly in large breed female dogs. The sphincter muscle that keeps urine from entering the urethra can weaken, allowing urine to leak out.If your dog is urinating more frequently, he may start urinating in new places, increasing the likelihood of urinary accidents.;
, When your dog urinates, try to take a look at it. Several types of urinary tract problems, including lower urinary tract infections (UTI) and bladder cancer, cause blood to be present in the urine. The urine will look red or pink.Bloody urine can also be found with bladder stones.The stones rub against and damage the bladder wall, causing bleeding.Cloudy urine indicates a bacterial infection., Increased water intake is a common symptom of kidney disease in dogs. If you are filling up your dog’s water bowl more than usual, he may have kidney disease.Other health conditions, such as diabetes and Cushing’s disease, can also cause a dog to drink more water. Your vet would be able to determine the cause of increased water intake.


Cushing's disease occurs when the adrenal glands produce abnormally high amounts of the stress hormone cortisol.

, A urinary tract problem can make your dog feel very uncomfortable. Over time, you may notice his behavior changing. For example, with kidney disease, your dog may become less playful and want to sleep more. He also may become very tired.With a lower UTI, some dogs won’t show any signs of sickness or changes in behavior.Most dogs, however, will show obvious signs of urinary tract problems.

, When you notice the signs of a urinary tract problem in your dog, take him to your vet as soon as you can. Delaying treatment of a urinary tract problem can have serious consequences. For example, a bladder infection can travel up to the kidneys and spread to other organs, causing serious illness.In addition, bladder stones in male dogs can block the urethra, which can damage the kidneys and even be fatal.Your vet will first perform a physical exam and ask you questions about your dog’s history, including when the urinary problems started. Based on the physical exam and history, your vet will decide which other diagnostic tests to perform.
If your dog has large bladder stones, your vet might be able to feel them when touching your dog’s bladder. An x-ray or ultrasound would also help diagnose stones.
Examples of diagnostic tests include blood work, urine tests, and x-rays. Urine cultures, which are used to identify bacteria, are very important for diagnosing UTIs.
A surgical biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose bladder cancer. However, less invasive diagnostic methods, like ultrasound or x-rays, are also effective., Because a number of conditions can cause urinary tract problems, there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to treatment. Based on the results of the physical exam and diagnostic tests, your vet will recommend a treatment plan for your dog. Treatment may involve permanent lifestyle changes, so make sure you understand all aspects of your dog’s treatment plan.

, This is especially important for lower UTIs. Even if your dog shows early improvement, complete the full treatment course to ensure all bacteria are killed.Stopping the treatment course early could cause antibiotic-resistant bacteria to populate your dog’s lower urinary tract.


Antibiotic treatment is also important if your dog has struvite bladder stones, one of the common types of bladder stones in dogs. Struvite stones usually form when there is a bacterial bladder infection, so antibiotic treatment is important to prevent more struvite stone formation.If your dog has chronic UTIs, and the underlying cause is unknown or can’t be corrected, your vet may put your dog on low-dose, long-term antibiotic therapy.Chronic kidney disease can cause high blood pressure. If your dog’s kidney disease is advanced, your vet will probably prescribe a medication to decrease and control your dog’s blood pressure.If your dog has a weak bladder sphincter muscle, your vet will prescribe a medication to strengthen that muscle., Your dog may not respond well to the medications. For example, some dogs can develop allergic reactions to antibiotics.ACE inhibitors, which lower blood pressure, can cause digestive upset and weakness.Piroxicam, an anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat bladder tumors, can cause digestive problems and high blood pressure.If your dog has any negative reactions to his treatment, take him to your vet as soon as possible. Your vet may need to reduce the dosage or prescribe a different medication.

, Stones can form anywhere in the urinary tract system, but form in the bladder nearly 90% of the time. If the stones are too large to pass through your dog’s urethra, or there are a lot of them, your vet will need to remove them surgically. During the surgery, your vet will take a urine sample for further analysis. Following surgery, they will have also the stones analyzed. Your vet will devise another treatment plan based on the results of the urinalysis and stone analysis.
Calcium oxalate stones, the other common type of canine bladder stones, must be removed surgically.Be mindful that surgical removal of bladder stones is not necessarily curative. Further treatment would be needed to keep the stones from reforming.
Urohydropropulsion, during which a catheter is inserted into the bladder to flush out the stones, is useful when the stones are small and can pass through the urethra. This process requires either heavy sedation or general anesthesia., Dietary management plays an important role in treating and managing certain urinary tract problems. For example, specialized diets are available to dissolve bladder stones; other diets can prevent their formation. Usually, a dog will stay on the ‘dissolve stone’ diet for a few months, then switch to a maintenance diet that he will eat for the rest of his life.If your dog has kidney disease, he will need a special diet. Kidney diets are dogs are low in sodium, protein and phosphorus, and high in potassium and fatty acids.The diet is specially formulated to protect your dog’s kidneys.
Increasing your dog’s water intake important if he has a lower UTI.Drinking more water is also helpful for bladder stone treatment.
Your vet can recommend which diet to feed your dog, and for how long. Do not change your dog’s diet unless your vet tells you to do so.

, Bladder tumors in dogs are usually very difficult to remove surgically. Therefore, non-surgical treatment with chemotherapy and piroxicam is frequently the best choice for bladder tumors. Your vet would administer the chemotherapy and you would give the anti-inflammatory medication at home. If the medicine is not working, your vet may want to perform radiation therapy., Your vet will want to assess your dog’s improvement and overall health. During follow-up appointments, they will run different tests, depending on the type of urinary tract problem. For example, for a lower UTI, your vet will perform a urine culture to see if any bacteria are remaining in the urine after treatment.With kidney disease, testing your dog’s blood and taking his blood pressure would be important.


If the urine culture shows bacteria, your vet will perform an antimicrobial susceptibility test.This test measures how well bacteria grows when exposed to different antibiotics.Results will help your vet choose the antibiotic most likely to kill the bacteria in your dog’s urine.
Imaging studies (ultrasound, x-rays) would help determine if bladder stones are forming again.
Your vet will recommend a schedule for follow-up appointments.

Your dog may be anxious if they exhibit any of the following symptoms:


Frequent barking and/or whining
Extreme vigilance and hyper-alert behavior
Lack of appetite
Trembling or shaking
Pacing or restlessness
Inappropriate elimination indoorsAttempts at escaping the home
Destructive tendencies
Self-mutilation;
, Pheromones will not magically cure behavioral problems, but they may be able to help reduce them in your pet.Pheromone products are most effective at treating behavioral problems, including the following:


Separation anxiety — characterized by barking, howling, pacing, escaping, destroying the surrounding environment, and urinating or defecating whenever left alone.Noise phobia — characterized by panting, drooling, pacing, trembling, urinating or defecating, trying to escape from loud noises (like thunder or fireworks), and hiding from loud noises.Anxiety caused by a new or stressful environment — typically characterized by a fear around or avoidance of certain people or places.Aggression towards other dogs or humans — characterized by barking, growling, and biting., Your vet may want to rule out other medical or behavioral problems that may be causing your dog's anxiety symptoms or aggression. These may include medically-induced incontinence, side effects from medications, excitement urination, boredom, or incomplete training.Your vet may ask about your dog's history, including any training you may have enrolled your dog in. Your vet will also review your dog's medical history and may take blood or urine samples to run lab tests.
Tell your vet about any medications your dog is taking, including any over-the-counter medicine and/or supplements you may give your pet.

, Many companies advertise their products as pheromones without actually including any animal pheromones.These products may contain calming agents like lavender and chamomile, but true dog pheromone products will contain dog-appeasing pheromone (DAP), a synthetic chemical derived from a naturally-secreted pheromone produced by the sebaceous gland in dogs.Check the ingredients in every product before choosing one for your dog.
It's okay if the product contains herbal ingredients in addition to the synthetic pheromone, but it should not contain only herbal ingredients.If the ingredients list does not include dog-appeasing pheromone, opt for a different product.

, Once you've chosen a pheromone product, you'll need to decide on an application method. They are all effective at treating behavioral problems, and which one you choose will depend largely on your preferences.Common application methods for dog pheromones include the following:


Sprays
Diffusers
Wipes
Collars

, Dog pheromone products can be purchased without a prescription; however, you should always consult your veterinarian before administering any pharmacological treatment to your dog to rule out any possible health problems or other behavioral issues.You can purchase dog pheromone products from your local pet store or through an online retailer.

, Like many other medications, pheromone therapy will not yield immediate results. It can take some time for the pheromones to have a noticeable effect on your dog. Some experts report that it takes an average of 14 days for the pheromones to really calm anxious or aggressive dogs, so it's important to plan ahead.If you have a potentially stressful event coming up that you want to prepare your dog for, start pheromone treatment at least two weeks in advance. You may want to allow for even more time, just in case it takes longer.
Make accommodations for your dog while you wait for the pheromones to begin working. For example, if you usually leave your dog with a sitter, plan to keep doing so for at least the first 14 days until the pheromones begin to work.

, Regardless of which application method you choose, you will need to periodically reapply the pheromones to your dog or your dog's environment. How frequently this happens will depend on the application method and the specific brand you choose.Sprays generally last up to four hours and can be applied directly to an article in the dog's environment (like a bandana it wears or the dog's bed) or sprayed throughout a room.
Some sprays last up to 24 hours when dispersed in a room. This will vary considerably by product and application method.
Collars and diffusers typically last up to one month.
You can set an alarm on your phone to remind you to respray the dog's bandana, bed, or the room.
For collars and diffusers, you can mark your calendar so you remember to reapply the pheromones each month.
The collars need to sit against the skin, so be sure to part the hair in long coated breeds, and make sure the collar fits snuggly (but not too tight).

, Your vet may prescribe an anti-anxiety medicine for your dog.This can be used in combination with pheromone products to calm your dog without sedating it.Ask your vet if an anti-anxiety medication like Alprazolam (Xanax) could be used with pheromone products to calm your dog.
Different dogs may react to medication in different ways. If your vet recommends an anti-anxiety medication for your dog, ask for specific instructions on how to administer it and how often.

, Exercise may not completely solve your dog's emotional or behavioral problems, but it can help. Exercise reduces your dog's anxiety levels, burns off extra energy, and leaves your dog tuckered out afterward.Your dog should get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity each day. This can include running, a fast-paced walk, swimming, or just playing catch in the yard.
Try to time your dog's exercise so that it coincides with your departure. Giving your dog a good workout right before you leave will keep them tired throughout the day.

, One way to help ease your dog's separation anxiety is to make it less stressful when you leave the house. If your dog sees you leaving as a big deal, it will only increase your dog's behavioral problems (and the subsequent destruction that may follow).Make your daily departures and arrivals less dramatic by resisting the urge to rush to your dog when you come home or fawn over them every time you leave.
Leave food-based puzzle toys for your dog. These may include a hollow ball or cone stuffed with tasty treats like peanut butter or cheese.Try hiding pieces of scattered kibble or treats around the house before you leave. This hunt for food will keep your dog busy and reduce the chances of them feeling anxious.

, Your dog probably feels comfortably ""at home"" already in your dwelling, but your dog may not feel safe from harm or abandonment. You can help reduce your dog's separation anxiety by making your pet feel comfortable, safe, and secure, even when you're not there.Leave dirty laundry that smells like you lying on the floor so your dog can still smell your scent.
Give your dog a designated area where they can feel safe. This may be a room with windows, or a crate (if and only if your dog responds well to crate training).
Crates may not work for all dogs, but if your pet feels that their crate is a safe space, it may reduce your dog's anxiety to be in the crate when you're not home.
Be aware that a dog that does not feel safe in a crate will still exhibit anxiety symptoms, though it will occur in the crate. This can lead to injury if the dog attempts to escape, and it may cause discomfort if the dog goes to the bathroom inside the crate.

, If your dog's separation anxiety is severe, you may want to consider leaving your dog under someone else's watch. Some dogs experience less anxiety if they're left with another person, even if their owner isn't around.You can try having a friend dog sit for you, either at your home or at theirs. You can also take your dog to a doggie daycare facility where your pet can socialize with other animals.
You can find dog sitting and day care services near you by searching online or checking your local phone book. Ask your vet for recommendations.

, If you decide to work with a trainer or behaviorist, you will have many options. You can choose between group classes or one-on-one sessions. You will also need to decide what type of certification you want your dog's professional to have.This decision will largely depend on your dog's needs. For anxiety or aggression issues, you'll probably want a specialist with both academic and hands-on experience. Knowing about the various certifications and titles can help you make a more informed decision.


Trainers sometimes use titles like behavior counselor, pet psychologist, or pet therapist, but the education and experience within this group vary considerably and may not be consistent.
Certified Professional Dog Trainers (CPDTs) are certified only after working a minimum number of hours as a trainer and passing a test. CPDTs must also engage in continuing education classes to maintain their title.
Applied Animal Behaviorists (AABs) may have a master's degree or Ph.D., while Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (CAABs) have a doctoral degree.
Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (ACAABs) have a master's degree and received supervised training in animal behavior and biology.

Get a medical diagnosis.",How to Treat Mastitis in Dogs," Since mastitis is a bacterial infection of the mammary glands, the vet will prescribe antibiotics for your dog to take. This will treat the cause of the mastitis and the signs of mastitis should soon disappear. If she's still nursing the puppies, the vet will choose an antibiotic that is safe for the pups to ingest through her milk.


Be sure to give the full course of antibiotics, even if your dog's mastitis improves. Stopping antibiotics too early could cause the infection to return even stronger than before.;
, Talk to the vet about pain medication you can give your dog, especially if she has a case of advanced mastitis. Depending on the pain medication, it may have anti-inflammatory properties which can help to reduce swelling while making your dog feel more comfortable.If the vet recommends more than one type of pain medication to be taken together, consider writing down dosing information. For example, make a note of what type of pain med you gave, when you gave it, and the dosage you gave.

, Another way you can help your dog manage pain is to lay a warm water compress over the mammary glands. You can soak a clean cloth in warm water, wring it out, and place it gently on the tissue. Remove the cloth when it's no longer warm.If your dog seems to like the warm compress, you can continue using it. Simply run the clean cloth under warm water and wring it out. Continue using the cloth as long as it's clean.

, Ask the vet to show you how to properly drain your dog's mammary glands by hand. Even if your dog is still nursing her puppies, you'll probably need to encourage lactation by expressing the milk. Keeping the mammary glands drained will prevent the breast tissue from becoming hard and painful.


You can also gently massage around the teat using your index finger and thumb to help your dog lactate. The tissue should always feel soft. As soon as it starts feeling hard, that signals there is a buildup of milk that needs to be removed.

, You'll need to keep the breast tissue and teats clean and dry. After cleaning and drying the area with a gentle solution, you may need to rub a soothing ointment from the vet on the tissue. This can soothe the sensitive skin and prevent irritation.Remember to clean your dog's bedding frequently. Never let your dog rest on bedding that's dirty or soaked with urine. Dirty bedding conditions can cause infection or make your dog's mastitis worse.

, If the puppies are still relying primarily on your dog for most of their nutrition, discuss if you should give them a nutritional supplement. You should also talk with the vet about whether or not your dog should keep nursing her puppies while healing from mastitis.The vet may recommend that your dog continue to nurse since it's important for her mammary glands to be emptied frequently.

, Make a point of checking your dog every day for signs of mastitis after she begins lactating. If your dog is lactating normally, her mammary glands (breast tissue) will be warm and will look larger than usual. She shouldn't seem uncomfortable or in pain if you touch the breast tissue.


The breast tissue enlargement is simply caused by the presence of milk.

, Your dog could be showing signs of mastitis if she runs a fever, has red breast tissue, has discharge from the mammary glands or the tissue is hot, hard or streaked. Take your dog to the vet for an exam and diagnosis of mastitis.Although mastitis is rare in dogs, it usually happens a few weeks after the birth of the puppies.

, Mastitis can quickly become painful for your dog. If your dog appears to be in pain when you touch her or she seems snappy when her dogs nurse, she may have mastitis. Some dogs with mastitis might not let their pups nurse at all and their energy levels might drop.Monitor how much your dog eats while she's nursing. If she stops eating, she may have mastitis.

, If your dog has an advanced case of mastitis, you'll most likely realize that something is wrong. Your dog's mammary glands (breast tissue) may be almost black. Your dog will be in a lot of pain when you touch the glands and they'll feel hard and hot.If your dog has advanced mastitis, she'll need immediate medical attention since she could go into septic shock.

, The veterinarian will do a physical exam and check for many of the things you've already been monitoring your dog for (hard, hot, red mammary glands). The vet will also test your dog's blood and milk to confirm a mastitis diagnosis.Usually, the vet will be able to diagnose mastitis just by looking at the physical signs your dog presents.

Check the mammary glands in your female dog.,
Remove the tumor.,
Get the dog spayed.,
Provide follow up care for your dog.",How to Treat Mammary Disease in Intact Female Dogs1," Mammary gland tumors can occur in any of the mammary glands in your dog. It can also occur at any time, before or after they have given birth or while they are lactating. Check your female dog often for any irregularities.Most often, mammary tumors occur in the back glands, nearest the hind legs.
Half of the time, more than one tumor is found.;
, One way you can treat a mammary tumor is to remove the tumor surgically. This can be done by removing just the tumor or removing the gland. If the tumor has started to spread, the vet may choose to remove the gland and surrounding lymph nodes. In extreme cases, the vet may remove all of the mammary glands.The type of tumor and the location will influence what your vet decides to do.

, After the tumors are removed, the vet will more than likely spay your dog. This helps reduce the risk of ovarian and uterine tumors, and increase the likelihood of discovering any new tumors in the mammary glands., After the surgery, you will need to continue taking your dog to the vet for follow up care. Your vet will perform physical exams and x-rays to check for any changes in the mammary glands or signs of additional tumors.You will probably have to take your dog to the vet one month after the surgery, and then once every three months after that.

Discuss treatment options with your vet.,
Have your vet neuter your dog.,
Consider giving your dog finasteride.,
Decide whether to give your dog progesterone.,
Follow up with your vet.",How to Treat Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs1," Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a fancy term for an enlarged prostate. It is the most common prostate disease in male dogs. BPH occurs because of continuous testosterone exposure.Treatment options are neutering (removing the testicles) and anti-testosterone medications.


Anti-testosterone medications can be used if neutering isn’t an option (breeding dog or show dog). However, these medications are not as effective as neutering to reduce testosterone levels.If your dog is not showing clinical signs of BPH, such as bloody fluid dripping from the penis or difficult defecation, your vet may recommend not treating your dog.It’s up to you whether you want to treat your dog.;
, Neutering is the most effective treatment for BPH. It will drastically reduce the amount of testosterone in your dog’s body.Within about one month of neutering, an enlarged prostate gland will go back down to its normal size., Finasteride, which is an oral drug, is the recommended medical treatment for canine BPH. It reduces the prostate’s size and improves clinical signs of BPH. Be aware, though, that finasteride is effective only during treatment—BPH comes back when finasteride treatment stops.Discuss with your vet whether you want to treat your dog with finasteride until you’re ready to have your dog neutered.

, Progesterone is an important sex hormone in female dogs. It's also been shown to shrink prostate size and improve clinical signs of BPH in male dogs. Progesterone is available as an injection or pill.Consider asking your vet these questions about finasteride and hormone therapy:


How long can I safely keep my dog on BPH medications?
What are the side effects of these medications?
How much will the medications cost, compared to the cost of a neuter?
Can I give the progesterone injections at home?

, Whichever treatment option you choose, it would be a good idea to follow up with your vet after treatment. Your vet can perform a prostate exam to check the size of your dog’s prostate.

Be aware of how the liver helps to store energy.",How to Treat Liver Failure in Dogs," When the liver repairs itself, it lays down scar tissue to replace damaged areas. But as more and more scar tissue is deposited within the liver, the less and less functional the liver becomes. Once there is no longer enough functional tissue left to perform essential tasks, the dog enters liver failure.


In human medicine the optimal treatment is a liver transplant, but this is not currently an option in veterinary medicine.;
, Therapy for liver failure in dogs is focused on controlling the complications of poor liver function, and creating a good quality of life for your ill dog for as long as possible.

, Liver failure is a terminal condition, so it’s important as an owner to always put your dog’s best interests first. Think about factors such as whether your dog’s dignity is still intact (can he go to the bathroom without soiling himself?), he is comfortable and not suffering from constant nausea or vomiting, he is able to be active and enjoy walks, and his weight is reasonable, as he should have enough of an appetite to not become skeletal or malnourished.


If your dog has difficulty with any of these factors, it may be time to consider if it is fair to continue his life with a terminal illness, or if it is time to let him go.

, This test will confirm whether or not your dog’s blood is clotting. A dog with liver failure may potentially hemorrhage and bleed to death so its important to be aware of any coagulation problems and address them.


If your dog is about to undergo a biopsy, it is especially important to look for any coagulation problems prior to surgery., This can be corrected with injections of Vitamin K, given at the dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day, into the muscle or under the skin.


If your dog is going to have surgery on his liver soon, then approximately 2 or 3 days of injections are needed prior to surgery., Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains all the clotting factors, including vital factors such as V and VIII. An intravenous infusion of fresh frozen plasma, obtained from a pet blood bank, is the swiftest way to raise clotting factors in the short term, such as prior to surgery.The effects of FFP will dwindle over the following days and maintaining adequate clotting might be too difficult or impractical.

, An innocuous activity such as clipping his toenails too short or a minor cut from playing in the yard can lead to bleeding, which is a serious problem if your dog does not have the ability to clot blood. He could exsanguinate, and there will be no means of stopping the bleeding.If your dog regularly bleeds, or has uncontrolled bleeding and is known to have liver failure, euthanasia may be the kindest option.

, High blood ammonia levels will affect the brain, causing stupor and seizures. Reducing the level of blood toxins, like ammonia, can decrease the risk of seizures and reduce stupor inducing chemicals in your dog's body.

, Lactulose is a sugar laxative that also absorbs ammonia from the bloodstream. It soaks up ammonia and keeps it in the gut, rather than the blood stream, where it is then passed out when your dog goes to the bathroom.The dose used is a low one - approximately 0.2-0.4ml/kg body weight, given twice a day.
Lactulose is given either with the food or straight afterwards, so that is has maximum exposure to the bugs generating the ammonia.
Lactulose will help to detoxify your dog’s liver, but it also has side effects like diarrhea and loss of bowel control.

, Metronidazole is a prescription antibiotic that kills the bacteria that produce ammonia. While it is perfectly normal for ammonia-producing bacteria to harmlessly populate a healthy dog’s bowels, it is not possible for a dog with liver failure to get rid of a waste product like ammonia.A dog with long term liver failure may stay on a low dose of metronidazole on a permanent basis to reduce ammonia synthesis.
A typical dose in 15-25 mg /kg given twice daily by mouth. So, for example, a 20 kg dog receives a 200 mg metronidazole tablet twice a day. It does not matter what time of day you give your dog the antibiotic, as long as it is twice a day.
This antibiotic can make some dogs feel nauseous, so counteract this by giving your dog food with the medication.
Metronidazole is also a bitter antibiotic, so it is better not to crush it in order to get your dog to eat it. Most tablets are coated to hide the bitter taste., Carbohydrates like rice or pasta, and protein like eggs, cottage cheese, or white meats (chicken, turkey, rabbit) will help to counteract the protein deficiency usually found in dogs with liver failure.


Special prescription diets suitable for dogs with liver failure are also available, such as Hills L/D, which contain easily digestible protein plus other supplements (vitamins and antioxidants).
There can be complications with giving your dog a protein rich diet as your dog’s appetite will likely be poor and the food may not be attractive to him. As well, loading his food bowl with protein will promote the fermentation that produces ammonia.

, This is an intravenous drip of plasma, supplied by a pet blood bank. However, multiple units of plasma may be needed to raise the overall blood protein levels by even a small percent, and plasma is expensive, so this is a costly option.Euthanasia may be the best option if your dog is suffering from a lack of protein or low protein.

, There are many excellent multivitamin tablets for dogs on the market that are suitable as a daily supplement and can be bought from your local pet store. When vitamin levels fall due to liver disease, a number of vital functions in your dog’s body are affected so maintain their vitamin levels with supplements.Speak to your vet about setting up a weekly injection of cobalamin for you dog, a B-vitamin, that is essential for the absorption of nutrients across the gut wall and aids in stimulating appetite. This vitamin is damaged by stomach acid, so it is best given by injection.

, This prescription medication acts by decreasing production of the building blocks of bile. It also encourages the liver to get rid of bile, and has a protective effect on liver cells.


Another symptom of liver failure is that bile acid builds up in the blood, which can irritate internal tissue and cause nausea. If your dog is jaundiced, this medication can protect the liver from the harmful effects of bile acids.The dose is 10-15 mg/kg given once a day by mouth. Ursodiol is available as 250 mg and 500mg tablets. So, for example, a 25 kg dog would take a single 250 mg tablet once a day.
Because each dose acts for 24 hours, it does not matter what time of day you give your dog a dosage.

, This drug decreases scar tissue formation by decreasing production of collagen fibers within liver tissue and by inhibiting cell division in fiber cells. Scar tissue is inactive tissue that replaces liver cells as they age and die. A liver under stress has an increased tendency to produce scar tissue, leading to a breakdown in function and eventually, liver failure.The dose is 0.03mg/kg once daily by mouth. So, for example a 20 kg dog takes a single tablet once a day.
Again, because of its long duration of action, this is not a medication that needs to be given at a precise time and it does not matter if it is given before, with, or after food.

, This is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory properties. It can reduce liver inflammation, which in turn lessens scar tissue formation in your dog’s liver.A useful side effect of this steroid is that it will stimulate your dog’s appetite.
The prescribed dose is 1-2 mg/kg total daily. So, for example, a 25 kg dog receives a 25 mg tablet once a day.
The timing of the medication is not important, but it is best given with food in order to provide a buffer for the stomach lining and to reduce the risk of a gastric ulcer.

, Rather than prescribe lots of tablets, your vet will decide which are most the vital for your pet's continued well-being and prioritize those medications. She will assess your dog’s current symptoms and determine which element or elements of his liver failure pose the biggest threat to his health.


If your dog is not eating, for example, your vet may prescribe Prednisolone as it helps to stimulate appetite and vitamin production. Once your dog’s appetite picks up, she may broadening the treatment to include other drugs.

, The liver filters your dog's blood and has an important role in removing toxins that are the natural waste products of digestion.Some of these toxins, such as ammonia, can damage the central nervous system and cause seizures, stupor, and altered mental states.

, Protein production is vital to healthy muscles, skin, and tissue, for blood clotting and to maintain the circulatory system.A lack of these proteins in your dog’s body can cause edema (fluid buildup in tissue), diarrhea, a tendency to bleed, and generally poor physical health.
The liver is also an important storage space for both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins. If vitamins levels become depleted, your dog's body cannot function properly.

, The liver helps produce bile which is secreted into the gut and aids in digestion.There is a risk that if the liver is inflamed and the bile cannot drain away, the bile will build up in the bloodstream and cause jaundice, which is a yellowing of the gums and mucous membranes.

, The liver plays a crucial role in producing factors necessary to clot blood.A damaged liver does not produce Vitamin K, which is essential to clotting, so a dog with liver failure will bruises easily and may suffer prolonged bleeding from small injuries.

, The liver stores and releases energy within the body. Many of the reserves of carbohydrates and lipids are stored in the liver, and released in response to need.A dog with a poorly functioning liver does not have the reserves of energy he should have and will be lethargic.

Anything from a sudden halting brake during a car ride to jerking his head around playing catch or running with other dogs could have caused your pet to experience some neck pain., Your vet will want to run tests and may require X-rays, CT scans, or an MRI to rule out any more serious conditions. It's important to rule out those conditions, as many debilitating illnesses and infections that cause neck pain require quick medical treatment. Even a severe spinal trauma may require corrective surgery., If your dog is suffering from a sprained neck, your vet may prescribe muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication to treat the pain and facilitate movement. Allow your dog plenty of time to rest and recover.Do not be tempted to give human pain relief medication to your dog unless instructed to do so under veterinary supervision.

Get your dog antibiotics.,
Place a warm compress on the affected glands.,
Have the gland lanced.",How to Treat Mammary Disease in Intact Female Dogs2," If the dog is suffering from mastitis, the vet will probably prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. The antibiotics given to your dog will depend on whether or not the puppies have been weaned.To choose an antibiotic, the vet will need to collect milk for a culture. This will help them know exactly which antibiotic is appropriate for your dog.

, When your dog has mastitis, you can place a warm compress on the glands multiple times each day. This helps to relieve any pain or discomfort in the glands.This will also help the glands to drain the infection.

, In severe cases, the mammary gland abscesses. If this happens, the gland will have to be surgically lanced by a vet. The vet will drain the infection from it. Then, the site of the lancing will be treated as an open wound."

Notice any lumps in the mammary glands.,
Look for red or swollen glands.,
Look for any irregularities to the skin around the mammary glands.,
Check the dog’s nipples while lactating.,
Notice any abnormalities in the milk.,
Check for any sickly behavior.,
Recognize risk factors for mammary tumors.",How to Treat Mammary Disease in Intact Female Dogs3," Lumps or swelling in the mammary glands is a symptom of mammary tumors. They can be felt just under the skin in the mammary glands area. To check for them, just gently press along the area.You may feel a small, hard, or smooth lump under the skin that moves around when you press it. The other type may be irregular in shape and feel like it’s fixed in the skin so it doesn’t move.

, If your female dog has mammary gland tumors or mastitis, then the area around the mammary glands will be red or pink. The area may be swollen, and often, it is warm or hot when you touch it.Because of this, the dog may experience pain or discomfort when you touch the area.

, Another symptom of mammary gland tumors is tissue loss on the skin of the mammary glands. This generally occurs with swollen or reddened skin.With mastitis, puppies may scratch the mammary glands, leading to infection of the glands.

, Mastitis is an infection that can occur when a female dog is lactating. The nipples may be swollen and sore, which causes the dog to avoid nursing. This can lead to delayed development or poor nutrition for the puppies.The nipple gets infected during mastitis, so the redness, swelling, or pain may be more apparent in the nipple than surrounding glands.

, If the dog has mastitis, the nipples get infected, which affects the milk. The milk from the nipples may be a different consistency and thicker than normal milk. It may also be full of pus.In some cases, the milk is bloody or has a pink-tinge.

, If a dog has mastitis, then the dog may act normal and healthy. However, mastitis can cause the dog appear sick. She may have a fever, refuse to eat, or overall seem lethargic or listless.In some cases, the female dog may neglect the young due to feeling sick or the glands being too painful to touch.

, Mammary tumors can occur in a female dog over one year. However, it is not common until after age five. Certain breeds are more prone to mammary cancer than others. These include:Toy and miniature poodles
English springer spaniels
Cocker spaniels
German shepherds
Yorkshire terriers
Maltese
English setters

Decide which antibiotic to use.,
Treat your dog for three to four weeks.,
Let your vet neuter your dog.,
Take your dog for follow-up appointments.",How to Treat Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs2," Prostatitis is a bacterial infection of the prostate gland. It is usually due to underlying prostate problem, like BPH. After diagnosing prostatitis, your vet will perform what’s called a culture and sensitivity test to determine which antibiotic will be most effective against the bacteria in your dog's prostate.Prostatitis can either be acute (makes dogs sick) or chronic (doesn’t make dogs feel sick). Antibiotic treatment for chronic prostatitis may not be very rewarding., The prostate gland is surrounded by a thick capsule that makes it hard for antibiotics to get inside the gland and kill the bacteria.Because of this, prostatitis treatment usually takes at least several weeks, if not longer. If your dog has chronic prostatitis, antibiotic treatment may last for more than four weeks.Your vet will prescribe antibiotic pills for your dog. If your dog doesn’t like taking pills, consider hiding the pills in a pill pocket or your dog’s favorite treat.
Give your dog the full treatment course, even if its symptoms start to improve. If you stop the treatment too early, not all of the bacteria in the prostate gland will be killed. These bacteria could multiply and become resistant to other antibiotics.
If your dog also BPH, you will also need to treat your dog for that disease.

, Unfortunately, antibiotics are usually not enough to treat prostatitis in male dogs. The symptoms often come back after antibiotic treatment is finished. Neutering is frequently recommended along with antibiotics for effective prostatitis treatment.Prostatitis can also cause abscesses (pockets of infection) and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to form in the prostate. If your dog has prostatic abscesses and/or cysts, your vet will need to drain and remove those surgically.Removing prostatic cysts and abscesses requires major abdominal surgery., Your vet will want to check your dog’s progress after prostatitis treatment. One week and one month after treatment, your vet will test your dog’s semen for bacteria. If you didn’t have your dog neutered during prostatitis treatment, your vet will check your dog’s semen every six months until your dog is neutered."

Decide whether to treat your dog with surgery.,
Discuss radiation therapy as a treatment option.,
Talk with your vet about chemotherapy.",How to Treat Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs3," Prostate cancer in dogs is very aggressive. It invades nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Although surgery is the best chance to cure the cancer, it is often not practical because the cancer has likely spread by the time of diagnosis.Surgical treatment for prostate cancer can also cause urinary incontinence, making this treatment option less ideal., Other treatment options are available. Radiation therapy uses a beam of radiation to damage the DNA in cancer cells, causing cell death.If you and your vet decide on radiation therapy for your dog, your vet will prescribe it in small doses over several weeks.Your vet may refer you to a specialized veterinary cancer treatment center for the radiation therapy.
Unfortunately, radiation therapy can cause scar tissue to develop on the urinary bladder, causing urinary incontinence., Chemotherapy is another treatment option for dogs with prostate cancer. However, several chemotherapy drugs that have been used for prostate cancer treatment have not been very effective.Also, chemotherapy is expensive."

Identify the symptoms of Lyme disease.,
Administer antibiotics.,
Check your dog often for ticks.,
Remove ticks whenever you find one.",How to Treat Neck Pain in Dogs2," Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to a host (in this case, a dog) through a tick's bite. Ticks can thrive in many different environments in North America and Europe.If your dog has been through a grassy field or a forested area, he may have picked up a tick. While the trademark ""bulls eye"" rash is an easy indicator in humans, it does not show up on animals, which may make this disease more difficult to diagnose in dogs.Common symptoms include:


Neck painMuscle spasmsPain and sensitivity to touchLethargySigns of fever, Lyme disease cannot be treated without proper veterinary care. Your veterinarian will be able to give you the antibiotics your pet needs to fight the disease and start feeling better. Some of the more commonly prescribed antibiotics are doxycycline, tetracycline and amoxicillin.Your dog will most likely need to take antibiotics every day for around one month. Your vet may recommend extending or shortening the treatment length. Follow your veterinarian's advice and ask questions if you're unsure of how or when to administer antibiotics., Dogs who frequent wooded or grassy areas should be checked for ticks often. To check a dog for ticks, run through the following list:


Run your fingers over the entire length of your dog's body. Check hard-to-see places like armpits, between toes, and behind ears.Look for bumps or raised spots. Any time you find a raised spot, pull the fur apart to inspect the bump. Use a magnifying glass if you need to. If you see a tiny spot with eight legs, it is most likely a tick., It's important to act fast, as ticks can transmit disease to their hosts within 24 hours of contact.To safely remove a tick from your dog:


Use a clean pair of tweezers to grasp the tick's head, as close to your dog's skin as possible. You may wish to wear disposable gloves to reduce the likelihood of infection to yourself.Pull the tick straight out of the skin. If the tick breaks apart, be sure to remove any pieces left behind, as these may also transmit Lyme disease."

Consult with your vet.,
Schedule an appointment for prolotherapy.,
Allow your vet to sedate your dog.,
Have your vet perform prolotherapy.,
Wait for your vet to call you.,
Administer pain medication as prescribed.,
Place ice on the affected area.,
Limit your dog’s physical activity.,
Perform rehabilitation exercises.",How to Treat Joint or Spinal Issues in Dogs with Prolotherapy," Prolotherapy helps dogs with a range of joint and spinal issues, including arthritis and back pain.Your vet will want to have a consultation with you to decide if prolotherapy is right for your dog. During this appointment, ask your vet some questions:


Is prolotherapy a cure?
Is prolotherapy better than surgery?
How long does prolotherapy take?
When will my dog start feeling better?
How much does prolotherapy cost?;
, Prolotherapy is performed as a series of treatments. Most dogs need four treatments, spaced about three to four weeks apart.You can either schedule just the first appointment, or schedule multiple appointments at one time.


Your vet will determine how many treatments your dog will need.

, To perform prolotherapy, your vet will inject a sterile combination of medications directly into the affected area. This injection can be painful, so your dog will need to be sedated or anesthetized for the procedure.Because the injection location must be precise, having your dog sedated or anesthetized will help your vet perform prolotherapy more accurately., The sterile mixture of medications will contain dextrose (sugar), a numbing agent, and a vitamin, such as vitamin B12. Injecting this mixture will trigger a localized inflammatory reaction, which will stimulate collagen growth and a strengthening of the ligaments and tendons in the affected area.The entire procedure should take about 20 to 45 minutes.Because your dog will need time to become fully alert again after the procedure, your vet will recommend that your dog stay at the clinic for half a day., After your dog has ‘come to’ again, your vet or one of your vet’s staff members will call you. They will let you know how the treatment session went and when you can pick up your dog.

, Because the prolotherapy injection can be painful, your vet will prescribe a few days’ worth of pain medication after each treatment session. They will prescribe a pain medication that is not a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)—these can make prolotherapy less effective.Your vet will prescribe another type of pain medication that will not interfere with the healing process.

, Ice can also reduce pain and discomfort at the injection site. Make an ice pack by filling a sturdy quart-size plastic bag with crushed ice and wrapping this bag in a towel. Keep the ice pack on the affected area for about 15 to 20 minutes, or as long as you were instructed by your vet.Squeeze the air out of the plastic bag after placing the ice in it.Wrapping the bag in a towel will keep the ice from being too cold against your dog’s skin.

, Because prolotherapy provides significant pain relief, your dog may want to run and jump around after a treatment session. However, doing so could keep your dog’s ligaments and tendons from healing properly.Restrict your dog’s activity for at least one to two days after prolotherapy:Take your dog only on leash walks.
Do not allow any running, jumping, or intense playing.

, Your vet may recommend some physical therapy exercises to help the healing process. For example, your vet may have you perform passive range-of-motion (PROM) exercises, which involve gently moving joints through their natural ranges of motion (straightening, bending, rotating).PROM exercises reduce pain, improve blood flow, and improve strength.Your vet may also recommend different stretching exercises.Have your vet demonstrate each type of exercise so you know how to perform them properly at home.

Identify the symptoms of meningitis.,
Administer medication.,
Watch for signs of relapse.",How to Treat Neck Pain in Dogs3," Meningitis is an infection (usually viral) that causes an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can affect any breed of dog, but some dog breeds inherit breed-specific forms of meningitis, and it is not known how or why this happens. Some breeds known to inherit this disease are beagles, Bernese mountain dogs, pugs, and Maltese terriers.Common symptoms of canine meningitis include:


FeverNeck pain""Stiff"" neck and rigidity (difficulty moving the head and neck)Weakness in the legsLoss of balance/equilibriumSeizures, Meningitis cannot be treated without proper veterinary care. The most common course of action is to suppress the immune response, typically through high doses of steroid treatment. Prednisone is commonly prescribed for dogs with meningitis, though your vet may prescribe other medications, either with or without prednisone., Canine meningitis is rarely curable, and while treatment options can reduce the symptoms and improve a dog's quality of life in the short term, relapses are quite common, and may be fatal. Alert your veterinarian of any signs of relapse in your pet."

Identify the symptoms of cervical disc disease.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Give your dog supportive care.",How to Treat Neck Pain in Dogs4," Cervical disc disease, also known as a slipped disc, tends to happen as dogs age. Typically discs ""slip"" in one of two ways: disc extrusion, in which the nucleus pulposus slips out from the center of a vertebra and causes damage to the spinal cord, or disc protrusion, in which the fibrous ring around vertebrae grow thicker, causing the spinal cord to painfully contract.Typical symptoms include:


Neck pain/sensitivityYelping or cryingRigidity of the neckDifficulty or inability to lower the head during feedingDifficulty walkingArched backDown-turned headIncontinenceParalysis, A veterinarian is the only person who can diagnose cervical disc disease. He will probably take X-rays of the neck and spine to determine whether a disc extrusion or protrusion is the cause of your dog's pain., Unless your vet recommends surgery to correct the slipped disc, the best way to treat cervical disc disease is through supportive care.Keep walks relatively short. Use a harness on walks instead of locking the leash to your dog's collar, as a collar may put additional strain on your dog's neck.Administer any pain medication or muscle relaxants your vet prescribes for your dog."

Identify the symptoms of Wobbler's syndrome.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Give your dog supportive care.,
Consider physical therapy.",How to Treat Neck Pain in Dogs5," Wobbler's disease is a painful ailment found in many large dog breeds, such as Dobermans, Great Danes, and mastiffs, and is caused by either a slipped or herniated disc, or by a bony deformity around the spinal cord.The name Wobbler comes from the short, ""wobbly"" stride of dogs afflicted with this disease.Typical symptoms of Wobbler's syndrome include:


Weakness in the limbsDifficulty standing or rising after recliningTendency to drag one or more paws (usually the back legs; look for worn or chipped nails as telltale signs)Muscle loss extending through the shouldersPartial or full paralysis of one or more limbs, Your veterinarian will most likely order X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI in order to diagnose whether or not your dog has Wobbler's syndrome. Depending on the severity of your dog's condition, your vet may recommend surgery., Unless your vet orders surgery to correct the problem, the best thing you can do is make your dog comfortable. Administer any medications your vet prescribes to treat inflammation and swelling in the neck and spine. You will also need to reduce your dog's activity. Some vets recommend keeping dogs with Wobbler's syndrome confined to a crate in order to let the dog rest and restrict his movement.If your vet diagnoses your dog with Wobbler's syndrome, you will need to use a harness for walking him instead of a leash. Do not keep a collar on your dog's neck if he is diagnosed with Wobbler's disease., Some veterinary clinics offer water therapy and acupuncture as part of a holistic rehabilitation therapy. Talk to your vet about what may work best for your dog."

Use a harness to walk your dog.,
Use a heating pad.,
Make food and water more easily accessible.,
Monitor any deterioration in your dog’s mobility.",How to Treat Neck Pain in Dogs6," If your dog is suffering from any kind of neck pain, a collar may cause too much strain and discomfort on his neck and spine. A harness can be a useful alternative, as it spreads pressure over his chest and does not put any strain on your dog's neck. Avoid using a collar, and opt for unleashed, fenced-in yard time whenever possible instead of walking your dog on a leash., Heat therapy is a useful tool in relieving mild neck discomfort, especially in dogs with arthritis.Follow the directions bag's packaging and heat for the appropriate time. Then speak calmly to the dog, encourage him to lie down, and place the bag over his neck for a period of five to ten minutes at a time.

, If your dog is suffering from neck pain, he may have a hard time lowering his head to eat and drink out of his bowl if you keep it on the floor. Keep your dog's bowl elevated to a height that allows him to eat and drink without having to bend and stoop., It is important when managing neck pain to be alert for any deterioration in the dog's mobility. Neck pain is often a warning sign of other impending health problems, so it's important to determine and treat the cause of the pain, rather than just the pain itself.


Any dog with neck pain should be rested as movement is likely to make the pain worse. If the dog has other symptoms, such as if he goes off his food, then a vet check is essential.

Look for signs your dog has a fungal infection on its skin.,
Watch injuries to the skin for fungal infections.,
Consult with a veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Treat Fungal Infections in Dogs1," Yeast and other fungi are normally all other a dog's skin, however, when the populations of this fungi expand, usually due to a lack of immune response from the dog, then an infection can take hold. If your dog is itching a lot or has spots of discoloration, crusty or flaky skin, or redness, it may be caused by a yeast infection on its skin.One reason dogs often get yeast infections is because they are on immunosuppressive drugs for other health conditions. If your dog's immune system is being suppressed for other health reasons, then a yeast infection can more easily take hold.;
, There are types of skin fungal infections other than yeast infections, including Candidiasis, which are rare in dogs but can take hold if your dog has a preexisting injury. If your dog is being treated for an injury, be on the lookout for infection and discuss any infection with your veterinarian.Treatment for this type of infection is similar to that of a yeast infection but the originating injury just needs to be taken into consideration as well.

, Discuss the symptoms your dog is experiencing with a veterinarian in order to decide whether your dog needs to be seen. If your dog's symptoms are very serious, such as open sores due to itching and scratching, then is probably should be seen quickly, before the infection advances further. If the symptoms seem less serious, then you can probably wait to see if they clear up or discuss the issue with your veterinarian during your dog's next appointment.When the dog is assessed by a veterinarian he or she will ask you about the symptoms, will look at any areas of irritation, and may take a culture in order to give a specific diagnosis and treatment.

, Your veterinarian may prescribe a variety of treatments, depending on the seriousness, location, and type of infection. These treatments could include a medicated shampoo, a topical medication, or a variety of anti-fungal medications that are taken orally.For some yeast infections, your dog will be prescribed an anti-fungal shampoo. This will be especially effective for dogs that have yeast infections associated with an overproduction of oil on the skin.
Yeast infections in the ears or in just a few areas on the body will typically be treated with a topical medicine that kills the fungus. Your dog may need to wear a cone during this type of treatment, as it should not be allowed to like off the medicine.
Oral treatments are prescribed for more serious and chronic infections that will need long-term treatment. Many oral treatments for fungal infections require months of taking the medicine to clear up the infection.

Observe tremors in your Maltese.,
Look at your Maltese’s eyes.,
Watch your Maltese walk.,
Take your Maltese to your vet.,
Hospitalize your Maltese, if necessary.,
Give your Maltese medications.,
Monitor your Maltese for improvement.,
Schedule follow-up appointments with your vet.",How to Treat Little White Shaker Syndrome in Maltese," Tremors are the telltale sign of little white shaker syndrome. They can start suddenly, get worse for 1 to 3 days, then remain about the same until treatment begins. Tremors that get worse with certain activities (e.g., excitement, eating) are called intention tremors.Tremors are usually generalized, meaning the whole body shakes.The tremors may be mild or so severe that your Maltese cannot walk. They may lessen when he sleeps.;
, In addition to body tremors, your Maltese’s eyes may be affected by little white shaker syndrome. His eyes may move rapidly from side to side (‘nystagmus’).Your Maltese would not be able to control this movement.

, Little white shaker syndrome can affect your Maltese’s ability to walk normally. For example, he may have exaggerated leg movements when he walks; this is called hypermetria.In general, he may be uncoordinated when he walks, which is called ataxia.Little white shaker syndrome affects the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and posture., Little white shaker syndrome can be difficult to diagnose. It is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other common causes are ruled out first. To diagnose your Maltese’s tremors, your vet will analyze blood and urine samples. They will also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lower part of your Maltese’s spine.Your vet would need to sedate your Maltese to take the CSF sample.
Give your vet a thorough history of your Maltese, including his health before the tremors started and what you have noticed since the tremors started.
Results of the diagnostic testing may be normal.

, If your Maltese is really ill, or his tremors are severe, your vet may want to hospitalize him until he is stable and strong enough for at-home care. For example, if your Maltese’s tremors are caused by an infectious disease that has made him very sick, he may need intensive veterinary treatment for that disease before going home.Be aware that in-hospital treatment may get expensive.

, Little white shaker syndrome is usually treated with corticosteroids (also called steroids), which reduce inflammation. Initially, your vet will prescribe a high steroid dose.As the tremors improve, your vet will lessen the dosage, then stop the medication completely when the tremors have stopped.The initial steroid dose is immunosuppressive, meaning that immune system function is reduced.Drugs called benzodiazepines, which reduce anxiety, are also used to treat little white shaker syndrome.Valium is a benzodiazepine used to treat this condition.Your vet will let you know how long your Maltese will need to be treated.

, Most dogs treated for little white shaker syndrome recover completely within the first week or two of treatment. Even if your Maltese’s tremors have stopped, give him the full treatment course. If you stop treatment too early, the tremors could come back. If the tremors return, your vet will prescribe the original steroid dosage again.Some dogs do not fully recover with treatment. These dogs may need lifelong steroid treatment., For the first month after initial treatment, your vet will want to see your Maltese each week to assess his improvement. After that, they will likely recommend monthly appointments.During these appointments, your vet will reduce the steroid dose, provided that your Maltese is improving.

Look for symptoms of a respiratory fungal infection.,
Get your dog veterinary care.,
Follow treatment recommendations.",How to Treat Fungal Infections in Dogs2," With infections such as aspergillosis or nasal aspergillosis, common fungal infections of the respiratory system, the dog will experience coughing, a hard time breathing, nasal discharge, pain in the nose, sneezing, and sometimes a bleeding nose. If your dog has these symptoms, it may have a fungal infection in its respiratory system.Many of these symptoms can indicate other infections as well. A veterinarian can help you figure out what specific illness your dog has, as well as how it can best be treated.

, If your dog's symptoms persist, and it is uncomfortable or in pain, contact your veterinarian. Discuss whether your dog needs to be seen by the veterinarian or if the condition is not that serious and you can wait to see if your dog's immune system eliminates the infection.In general, if your dog just has clear nasal discharge or a light cough, then the infection is usually not that bad. However, if your dog's nasal discharge is thick and yellow or green, the dog is bleeding from its nose, coughing deeply, or coughing up blood, then the infection could be more serious.

, Aspergillosis and nasal aspergillosis can both be treated with an anti-fungal drug. This will be given to the dog either in the mouth or in the nose. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for how and how long to give your dog the medication.As with many medications, be sure to give your dog the medication for as long as the veterinarian tells you to, even if the symptoms have gone away. This will help to assure that the infection is totally eliminated, not just that is has been suppressed but is still in the nasal cavity.

Look for symptoms.,
Contact your veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Treat Fungal Infections in Dogs3," If you live in a dry, desert region, such as the American Southwest, then your dog could get a fungal infection call Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever. This infection is dirt borne and it when it enters the lungs it can cause dogs to cough, lose their appetite, lose energy, have diarrhea, and get a fever.Dogs that dig in the dirt can be especially prone to this illness, as they have more chance of contact with the fungus.Not all dogs that are exposed to this fungus develop symptoms or the illness. Dogs with strong immune systems can oftentimes fight off the infection before it takes hold.

, If you suspect that your dog has Valley Fever, then you should contact your veterinarian and describe the symptoms and when they started. Your veterinarian will then suggest whether or not they think the dog should be brought in to be assessed.


If your dog is brought in for assessment, the veterinarian will test the dog's blood for antibodies to Valley Fever, which is called a ""titer test."", If your dog is found to have Valley Fever, then it will need to undergo treatment with antifungal medications. This treatment takes a long time, up to a year if the infection has taken hold in the lungs, and perhaps for its lifetime if the infection is in the dog's nervous system.This treatment can have adverse side effects, including vomiting and damage to the liver. Because of this, the dog will need to be monitored regularly by its veterinarian.

Make sure your dog is hydrated.,
Give your dog a broad spectrum antibiotic if this is his first bladder infection.,
Investigate the cause if your dog has had repeated bladder infections.,
Give your dog an antibiotic to treat repeated bladder infections.",How to Treat a Dog's Bladder Infection1," Lack of water can be the cause of UTI; make sure fresh, clean water is always available. Putting ice cubes in their water bowl can attract them and make them more interested in it. Some people say changing their water to cranberry juice can also help and prevent UTI from happening to a dog- it is safe to give your dog cranberry juice. Bacteria produce toxins which irritate the bladder lining and cause inflammation and tenderness. When your dog drinks plenty of fresh water, the urine can be diluted, which helps to reduce the concentration of toxins. Means of encouraging your dog to drink more water include changing his food from a dry kibble to a tinned food (tinned food contains water). You should also place a large water bowl in every room that the dog is likely to visit. Sometimes the sound of running water entices a dog to drink, so consider purchasing a pet drinking fountain. Likewise some dogs prefer the taste of mineral water, because tap water often has fluoride or chloride, which can make some dogs refuse to drink the water.
, You will have to give your dog his prescription antibiotic for 10 to 14 days, unless otherwise prescribed by urine sample for culture and sensitivity. This test checks if the bacteria have been killed. If the bacteria are still alive, the culture will be able to determine which antibiotic the dog your vet. Seven days into the treatment, if symptoms still persist then the vet may send a should be put on next.This second antibiotic is usually a two week course. Your dog’s urine will be assessed after another seven days have passed to make sure this second antibiotic is working.

, Bring your dog to the vet so that some tests can be done to determine why these infections keep happening. These tests include:


Urine Sediment: A sample of urine is centrifuged so that the debris settles to the bottom. A sample of this debris is put on a slide and examined under the microscope. This can identify any unusual bacteria (rods rather than cocci – if rods are present then urine culture is essential), and urinary crystals which could chaff the lining of the bladder.
Urine Culture: This involves growing the bacteria in the urine to check its sensitivity to different antibiotics. This helps to give a definitive answer as to whether infection is present or not.
X-rays: Radiographs of the dog's tummy can help identify bladder stones, however not all stones show up on x-ray, depending on their mineral composition. Thus, ultrasound is a better test.
Ultrasound: Ultrasounds can detect bladder stones no matter what their mineral composition. Bladder stones often create similar symptoms to bladder infections.

, Broad spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, (trade names Synulox or Clavamox) are often prescribed. This antibiotic works by destroying the bacterial cell membrane and causing it to implode.


The dose is generally 12.5 mg/kg twice a day by mouth. A 20kg dog needs a 250 mg tablet twice a day. Try to give the evening pill as late as possible, as this allows the antibiotic to sit in the bladder overnight."
"
Consider putting your dog on a prescription diet.,
Acidify your dog’s urine through supplements.,
Give your dog cranberry supplements.",How to Treat a Dog's Bladder Infection2," Foods are available that promote the optimum urinary pH to discourage bacterial growth, and are also low in the minerals which promote crystals to form in the urine.


Examples of such diets include Hills Canine CD diet and Purina UR (canine). While your dog is recovering, only feed your dog these foods, or else the benefits of these foods will be diminished.

, If your dog refuses to eat a prescription diet, then you can add Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) to his diet. The dose of the latter is not exact and is in the range of 250 mg twice a day for a dog less than 10kg, and 500mg twice a day for dogs over 10kg.Stick within the recommended dose because if the urine becomes too acidic, this can irritate the bladder lining and mimic the symptoms of cystitis.

, The theory behind this is that cranberries contain proanthocyanidins or ""PACs"", which decrease bacterial attachment to the lining of the bladder. With the bacteria less able to ""stick"" to the bladder, they are more easily washed away when the pet urinates.A 30kg dog requires two Crananidin tablets a day.

Be aware of the common causes of bladder infections.,
Treat bladder crystals.,
Remove bladder polyps.,
Understand that surgery may not work for bladder cancer.",How to Treat a Dog's Bladder Infection3," In recurrent cases of cystitis, it is often possible to identify an inciting cause of infection, such as urinary crystals, a bladder stone, a bladder polyp or cancer. Because of this, it is important to take your dog to the vet if you think he has a bladder infection.

, If bladder crystals are present, often changing the urine pH and putting the dog onto a urinary diet will resolve the problem.


If bladder stones, a pile up of bladder crystals, are present then surgical removal is essential.

, Bladder polyps can be removed, or sometimes resolved, of their own accord if the dog is put onto an anti-inflammatory medication such as meloxicam. This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help to reduce inflammation.


The dose of metacam is 0.05 mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. The oral suspension contains 1.5mg/ml and so a typical 30k g Lab requires 1 ml daily with his food., Unfortunately, bladder cancer tends to grow in an area of the bladder called the trigone. This is a vital area where the ureters are plumbed in, which makes bladder cancers poor candidates for excisional surgery.

Understand how Phenobarbital works.,
Talk to your vet about the proper dose for your dog.,
Monitor your dog for signs of side effects caused by the medication.,
Help your dog overcome side effects brought on by Phenobarbital.,
Do not give Phenobarbital to your dog if he has liver disease.",How to Treat Focal Seizures in Dogs1," Phenobarbital is an anti-convulsant medications that works by decreasing neural excitability and raising the motor cortex's threshold for stimulation. This means that the focal seizures are not triggered as easily. Phenobarbital is a very effective treatment, as it is rapidly absorbed across the stomach lining and quickly gets into the blood stream.;
, It takes repeated doses for the levels of phenobarbital in the blood to stabilize. However, the levels should stabilize after 1 to 2 weeks of the treatment. The starting dose is 2-3mg/kg every 12 hours (or twice per day).


For example, an average starting dose for a 30kg Labrador is one 60mg tablet by mouth, every 12 hours.
Each dose needs to be given as close to the twelve hour mark as possible because some dogs are sensitive to even a slight fall in the levels of phenobarbital in the blood. This means that they become far more likely to experience a seizure after the 12 hour mark.

, A dog who has been given phenobarbital for the first time will show symptoms including drowsiness, wobbliness, and increased thirst and appetite.


The sedation and unsteady gait will usually resolve themselves within 7 days, but the thirst and appetite are permanent whilst on treatment.
The phenobarbital can also cause prolonged hind-end weakness and so it can be difficult for him to keep his balance whilst going to the toilet.

, To help your dog in the early stages of treatment when he feels drowsy, it helps to leave his water bowl within easy reach. This allows him to stay hydrated if he feels too wobbly to get up and drink.


A sling made out of a bath towel and passed under his tummy will allow you to easily support the dog's weight, so you can help him to manoeuvre around the place without losing his footing.
Be prepared to let the dog rest, and do not expect him to be able to keep up on long walks in the early days of therapy.
In the first few days, phenobarbital will make him clumsy and he is more likely to stumble and fall. With this in mind, put a barrier across the stairs so that he can't risk a fall.

, Phenobarbital needs to be broken down by the liver, so it should not be given to dogs with liver disease. If the liver is not functioning normally, it is more vulnerable to toxic damage from phenobarbital.


The liver produces enzymes necessary to break the phenobarbital into harmless metabolites. If the liver cannot do this, the levels of phenobarbital can become toxic.

Discuss treatment options with your vet.,
Hospitalize your dog.,
Allow your vet to perform surgery.",How to Treat Liver Disease in Older Dogs1," Older dogs are prone to certain liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver cancer, and cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease).These diseases are not curable, but can be managed. When you talk with your vet about treatments for your older dog’s liver disease, consider asking these questions:


Will my dog need a lot of medications?
Will my dog need to stay on the medications for the rest of its life?
When will my dog start getting better?
Will I need to change my dog’s diet?
Will surgery help my dog?;
, Because liver disease can be difficult to diagnose in dogs, your older dog’s liver disease may be advanced by the time your vet makes the diagnosis. Advanced liver disease can make dogs very sick. If your dog is really sick, your vet will want to hospitalize your dog to begin treatment. Examples of in-hospital treatment are:Intravenous fluids to rehydrate your dog
Vitamin supplementation in the fluids to correct nutrient deficiencies
Assisted feeding, in case your dog is not strong enough to eat on its own
Lactulose to prevent ammonia production and absorption

, Surgery is a possible treatment option for a few liver diseases. If your older dog has cancer in one liver lobe (the liver has multiple lobes), your vet could surgically remove the affected lobe. If your dog has a liver shunt, which prevents blood from circulating through the liver, your vet could surgically close the shunt.Realize that, if your dog is extremely sick from its liver disease, surgery may not be a good choice.
Not all forms of liver cancer in older dogs can be treated with surgery.
Chemotherapy is a treatment option for liver cancer if your dog cannot undergo surgery.Closing off liver shunts can be a complicated surgery. Your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon if you want your dog to undergo the procedure.

Understand how potassium bromide works.,
Use potassium bromide in combination with phenobarbital.,
Talk to your vet about the correct dose for your dog.",How to Treat Focal Seizures in Dogs2," Potassium bromide (KBr) is often used as an additional therapy in dogs whose symptoms are not controlled by one drug alone.


Potassium bromide acts differently to phenobarbital, and the two drugs work synergistically. This means that each drug amplifies the effect of the other, and the two combined have a greater effect than either by themselves.
Potassium bromide works by replacing chloride molecules with bromide, thus making it more difficult for nerves to fire off.

, Unlike phenobarbital which rises to therapeutic levels in a week or two, it takes potassium bromide months to reach a steady, effective state.


Hence, sodium bromide is rarely used as a solo therapy because if anti-convulsants are needed, it is usually impossible to wait months for them to take effect.
However, in combination with phenobarbital, potassium bromide seems to have a therapeutic effect before it reaches a steady level in the blood stream, hence it can be helpful in combination.

, If focal seizures are not controlled by phenobarbital alone then potassium bromide is added at a dose rate of 20-40mg/kg a day. Thus a 30 kg Labrador is supplemented with 600mg of potassium bromide a day.


The dog should be placed on a low salt diet during this treatment, because the chloride from salt will displace the bromide molecule from the nerves and decrease its effectiveness.

Try to continue to feed your dog the same amount of food, even if he seems to have an increased appetite.,
Switch to a low-calorie diet if your dog appears to be uncomfortable from hunger.,
Consider removing gluten from your dog’s diet.",How to Treat Focal Seizures in Dogs3," The increased appetite is a purely psychological effect whereby the phenobarbital tricks the brain into telling the dog he is hungry. The dog does not actually need to eat more, so if he does he will gain weight.


Therefore you should weigh out your dog's daily food allowance (as per his pre-seizure allowance) and ration that out during the day.

, If the dog seems unsettled because of hunger, then switch to a low calorie diet, such as those prescribed by veterinarians for overweight animals.


There are also many prescription obesity control diets available and these have of the bonus of being formulated to give the dog a feeling of satiety.

, There is no proven link between diet and seizures in dogs, however in people it is suggested the wheat allergy plays a role.


The theory is that anti-gluten antibodies attach themselves to the brain and trigger excess electrical activity.
If your dog is otherwise well, it would do no harm to cut gluten out of his diet, although whether this makes a material difference is open to debate."

Understand what pelvic bladder syndrome is.,
Watch for urinary incontinence in older or overweight dogs.,
Use an x-ray to diagnose pelvic bladder syndrome.,
Treatment the syndrome by managing the dog's weight.,
Understand that surgery may be necessary.",How to Treat Canine Incontinence1," The normal position for the bladder is sitting completely within the belly. If, as part of development, the bladder remains partially within the pelvis, this is known as pelvic bladder syndrome. This syndrome can lead to urinary incontinence.


This is most common in large breeds of dogs such as Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Labradors, and Great Danes.;
, Urinary incontinence may not be evident in a young animal, but can develop over the years, especially if the dog becomes overweight.


When an overweight dog lies down, the pressure in her abdomen is greater than in a slim dog, and pushes harder on the bladder. If the pressure generated on the bladder exceeds the ability of the valve guarding the exit of the bladder to stay closed, urinary leakage results.
You can think of this in terms of a balloon in a bucket of water. It is easier to hold the neck of a balloon closed when it is fully submerged in a bucket of water, than it is to try to force that balloon beneath the surface.
If the water represents the abdominal contents, when the bladder (the balloon) is surrounded the forces are equal. When only the tip of the balloon has pressure on it (trying to submerge it in water) the pressure is greater at the neck.

, This condition is diagnosed by introducing a radiographic contrast agent into the bladder and taking x-rays. The position of the bladder is then clearly outlined and the anatomy clear to see.

, Dieting an overweight dog may make a significant difference to the dog and even remove the need for surgery. By reducing abdominal fat, the pressure on the bladder when the animal lies down is reduced.

, To surgically treat pelvic bladder syndrome, a procedure called colposuspension is performed. This involves repositioning the bladder within the abdomen and suturing it into this new position.


This is done via a laparotomy. The surgical assistant places a finger into the dog's vagina and applies gentle pressure to push the bladder further back and into the abdomen.
The surgeon then places non-absorbable sutures through the bladder neck (which is in its new position) to anchor it to the pre-pubic tendon. The abdomen is then closed.

Decide which medications your dog will need.,
Give your dog antibiotics.,
Administer a diuretic.,
Use an anti-inflammatory medication.,
Treat your dog’s digestive upset.,
Give your dog zinc.",How to Treat Liver Disease in Older Dogs2," Several medications, such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, are available to treat liver disease in older dogs. After diagnosing which type of liver disease your dog has, your vet will talk with you about which medications will work best in your dog.

, Certain liver cells are responsible for breaking down and eliminating substances like bacteria and toxins. With liver disease, these cells stop working properly, causing bacteria to eventually buildup in the blood stream. This can lead to a serious bacterial infection called septicemia.Your vet will prescribe an antibiotic to treat this infection.

, Liver disease can cause a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, a condition called ascites. If your dog has ascites, your vet will prescribe a diuretic. The diuretic will cause your dog to urinate more frequently, removing the excess fluid.Severe ascites can enlarge a dog’s abdomen so much that breathing becomes difficult.If your dog has ascites, do not leave it untreated.
To prevent accidents in the house, be ready to take your dog outside more frequently so it can urinate.

, If your older dog has chronic hepatitis, your vet will prescribe a medication, such as a steroid, that will decrease inflammation and help protect the liver.Steroids can have several negative side effects, such as GI ulcers, intestinal bleeding, and fluid retention.Your vet will need to carefully monitor your dog if it is on steroids.

, Liver disease can upset a dog’s digestive system. Sometimes, the disease can cause stomach ulcers. If your older dog has a stomach ulcer, your vet will prescribe an anti-ulcer medication. This medication will help your dog feel better and want to eat.Because steroids can also cause GI ulcers, your vet will recommend an anti-ulcer medication if your dog is on steroids.Liver disease can cause nausea or vomiting.If your dog has either of these symptoms, your vet will prescribe anti-nausea or anti-vomiting medications., Liver disease can cause copper to build up in the liver’s cells. This extra copper causes liver inflammation and scarring. If your older dog has chronic hepatitis, your vet will prescribe zinc for your dog. Zinc will help prevent copper from building up in your dog’s liver."
"
Feed your dog a new diet.,
Add vitamin K to your dog’s diet.,
Give your dog an antioxidant.,
Consider giving your dog a daily multivitamin.",How to Treat Liver Disease in Older Dogs3," Dietary changes are also needed to treat liver disease in older dogs. Different liver diseases will require different diets. Your vet will recommend the diet that will best meet your dog’s nutritional needs. These diets are available through your vet.Examples of these diets are:


Low-copper diet to prevent copper buildup in the liverLow-protein diet if your dog has a shunt in its liverLow-sodium diet if your dog has ascitesHigh-fiber diet to prevent nitrogen buildup, Vitamin K and certain liver proteins play important roles in blood clotting. Your dog gets Vitamin K through its diet. Because liver disease can prevent these blood-clotting proteins from working properly, your dog will need vitamin K to prevent bleeding problems.Check the vitamin K levels in your dog's new diet. If the vitamin K levels are too low, your vet may recommend a vitamin K supplement.

, Antioxidants neutralize free radicals, which are chemicals produced in the body that can damage organs. To prevent your older dog’s liver from getting damaged by free radicals, give your dog an antioxidant like vitamin E or SAMe.Your dog may receive enough vitamin E in the food it eats. Ask your vet if your dog will need a vitamin E supplement.
SAMe is given as a supplement.

, In addition to vitamins E and K deficiency, liver disease can also cause a vitamin A deficiency in older dogs. Your dog may need a multivitamin to prevent other nutrient deficiencies.Ask your vet for recommendations on which daily multivitamin would be best for your dog.

Be aware that infection is just one possible cause of blood in the urine.",How to Spot Bladder Infection Symptoms in a Dog," Pollakiuria is the technical term for the feeling of constantly needing to empty the bladder. This sensation is is caused by inflammation of the bladder lining and the nerves in the bladder wall. These inflamed nerves fire off inappropriately and send the misleading signal that the bladder is full and needs to be emptied.


In all likelihood the bladder will be empty (because of the constant attempts to urinate) but the dog still has the urge to urinate.Unfortunately, the muscular contractions trying to ring out an already empty bladder cause further inflammation.
When a dog is suffering from pollakiuria, she may experience a sudden urgency to empty her bladder and may repeatedly ask to be let outside. Once there, she may take a few steps and squat down, only to sit there for a minute, then get up, walk a few steps and squat down again.
At night, this might cause the dog to squat in the house, and you might come down in the morning to spots of blood-stained urine scattered over the floor.;
, A normal bladder is lined by a protective layer of mucus which helps shield the delicate tissue of the bladder from urine. The inflammation associated with bacterial toxins strips away this protective layer, exposing the mucous membrane lining to more bacteria and toxins.


As the bacteria breed they also change the pH of the urine from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline. This change in pH is a further irritant to the bladder lining.
The stinging sensation that causes stranguria (the technical name for discomfort during urination) is caused by the contraction of the inflamed bladder, and the bladder lining being exposed to the flow of urine.Signs of stranguria include discomfort and pain, and your dog may whine or yelp while trying to urinate. Another sign might be the dog jumping up and running away from the spot as she tries to urinate. Other dogs may shuffle along in a squatting position as if trying to walk away from the discomfort.

, Bladder inflammation may cause blood to seep from the fine blood vessels in the bladder wall. This blood then collects in the urine. Sometimes the blood cannot be seen with the naked eye, but can be detected on a dipstick test (hence the importance of taking a urine sample to the veterinary clinic).


Small amounts of blood make the urine appear a deeper yellow than normal. Larger amounts of blood tint the urine red, the depth of the shade of red depending on how much blood is present.
Sometimes blood-stained urine can look alarming if it is a deep red color or contains blood clots. If this happens, don't panic; the dog is extremely unlikely to hemorrhage from the bladder, and this type of bleeding is rarely life-threatening in the short term.However, this does not mean you should ignore blood in the urine. It is a warning that the pet needs treatment, and it is possible for a dog that loses blood in the urine over several weeks or months to become anemic as a result.

, Some bacteria change the composition of the urine and give it an unpleasant odor. The odor is hard to describe, but is most commonly described as a ""fishy"" smell.


If the dog's urine smells different from usual it is likely to be significant, especially when combined with other symptoms.

, For some dogs, the feeling of needing to urinate overrides their house training. This can result in such urgency to urinate that the dog squats in the house, or urinates in forbidden places.


Do not punish the dog for this. This is not a true loss of house training but is simply a behavior provoked by discomfort. Once the infection is treated, the inappropriate urination will stop.

, The scalding, burning sensation the dog experiences when passing urine may extend along the urethra to the external genitalia. This can result in the dog licking themselves excessively as a means of numbing the discomfort.


Like a child sucking their thumb, some dogs also find the repetitive nature of licking soothing, and will do this to comfort themselves.

, Some dogs will instinctively drink more in order to try to dilute the toxins in their urine. You may notice the water bowl needs filling up more often, or the dog starts seeking out puddles to drink from.


However, a dog with a sore bladder is not able to hold onto a large volume of urine in the same way a healthy bladder can, and is more likely than ever to need to urinate frequently.

, It should be noted that the bladder has a limited number of ways of responding to problems, be that an infection, a polyp, a bladder stone, or a bladder tumor. If your dog has blood in the urine, or experiences discomfort while urinating, this is not normal and you should seek veterinary advice.


Where possible, take a sample of the dog's urine with you to the consultation. The vet may decide to run a dipstick test, look at the urinary sediment under the microscope, or send the sample for culture.
Either way, if the vet has a sample easily at hand it speeds up the investigation process.

, A Dipstick is a stick of plastic with a glued pad that changes color in the presence of substances such as blood, protein, glucose, ketones, and white cells.


The dipstick is dipped into the urine and the excess liquid is tapped off. The clinician then waits 30-60 seconds (according to the directions on the dipstick packaging) and compares the different reagent pads to the reference color chart.
This gives a quick reliable answer as to whether blood is present (healthy urine does not contain blood).

, Other reasons include bladder stones, urinary crystals, bladder polyps, and neoplasia. Differentiating between these requires further tests such as urine cultures, urine sediment exams, ultrasound imaging and/or radiography.


However, if the pet is otherwise well and this is the first time he or she has presented with haematuria, many clinicians opt to start the pet on treatment (antibiotics and pain relief) whilst waiting for culture results to come back.

Understand what an ectopic ureter is.,
Know how an ectopic ureter is diagnosed.,
Understand that surgery will usually be required.",How to Treat Canine Incontinence2," To understand why ectopic ureters cause incontinence it is necessary to know a little anatomy:


Kidneys filter blood and get rid of waste products by producing urine. Urine leaves each kidney via a fine tube called a ureter. Each ureter should be implanted into bladder wall such that it empties into the bladder.
An ectopic ureter misses the bladder and instead is implanted downstream in the urethra (the tube through which urine is voided from the bladder.) By-passing the bladder means the valves controlling urine flow are also by-passed, which means as the ureter drips urine into the urethra, when the dog changes position it is likely she will leak urine., Ectopic ureters are diagnosed by giving the patient an intravenous injection of a radio-opaque contrast agent that is excreted by the kidney. A series of radiographs are taken to follow the course of the contrast agent and watch where each ureter deposits urine.

, Treatment is by surgically re-implanting the ectopic ureter into the bladder wall. This is very delicate surgery, again done via laparotomy.


The errant ureter is identified and cut away from the inappropriate site. A small incision is made in the bladder wall and the ureter repositioned over that hole, and carefully sutured in place.
The abdomen is then closed.

Restrict the amount of protein that your dog gets.,
Feed your dog these restricted diets exclusively.,
Reduce the amount of phosphate your dog consumes.,
Add Renalzin to your dog’s food.",How to Treat Canine Kidney Disease1," Most of the toxins found in the kidneys are natural waste products of digestion, and by feeding a food that breaks down more ""cleanly"" the need for detoxification of the kidney is lessened. A number of prescription diets are available that are protein restricted, and hence when digested produce less toxic waste.Examples include Hills Canine K/D diet and Purina Canine NF.;
, Unfortunately, to be effective these diets need to be fed exclusively, since the beneficial effect is lost if less than 90% of the diet is renal food.


It is worth noting that it is an urban myth that chicken is suitable for pets with kidney disease. Chicken is almost purely protein and once digested presents just as many problems to the ailing kidney as other protein sources.

, Phosphate can be found in many foods, as it is included as a preservative and a flavoring agent. However, phosphate is particularly hard for the kidney to excrete and it can cause scar tissue in the process. Another issue is that high phosphate levels may irritate the stomach lining and can make your dog feel nauseous.Prescription renal diets, such as those listed in the first step of this section, are phosphate restricted.

, If your dog refuses to eat a special diet, you can try adding Renalzin your dog’s food. This is a product designed for cats (because of the high prevalence of renal disease in felines) but it is equally effective for dogs.


Renalzin is added to food (approximately 1-2 pumps per 5 kg body weight, twice a day) and binds to the phosphate in the food so that the phosphate stays in the bowel and does not get absorbed into the bloodstream.

Be aware of the risk factors for this kind of urinary incompetence.,
Understand the cause of USMI.,
Treat USMI with a hormone supplement called diethylstilbestrol.,
Give your dog phenylpropanolamine.,
Combine these two drugs in cases of stubborn incontinence.",How to Treat Canine Incontinence3," This kind of urinary incontinence tends to cause problems later in life, and medical (rather than surgical) treatment is most appropriate.


This problem also goes by the name of USMI (urethral sphincter mechanical incompetence) and has a higher incidence of occurrence in neutered animals.

, The urethra is the muscular tube connecting the bladder to the outside world. It's ""passive"" state is flattened so that urine cannot flow (like putting your foot on a hosepipe).


However, this passivity is deceptive because it is the result of active contraction of the muscle that makes up the urethra. To maintain this muscular contraction requires the presence of receptors in the urethral wall.
With USMI there is a decrease in both the numbers of receptors and their sensitivity. Neutering a dog plays a part because the reduction in hormones also decreases the sensitivity of the receptors which means the urethra is less toned, and it takes less pressure to cause the urethra to dilate and allow the passage of urine.

, This is a synthetic estrogen hormone supplement. It works by increasing the sensitivity of the sphincter (which controls urine exit from the bladder) to the presence of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine causes the sphincter to become more toned and tightly shut.


This medication is widely available as Incurin Tablet (MSD Animal health) with the active ingredient estriol. It comes as 1 mg tablets and a dose of 1 tablet per dog is trialed for 7 days. If no improvement is seen during this time then a maximum dose of 2 tablets per dog is given for a further week.
Once urinary control is achieved and the sphincter is toned up, it may be possible to gradually reduce the dose, say to half a tablet every day, until the lowest effective dose is found. The dog is then maintained on that.

, This medication is thought to act by stimulating alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in the urethral wall, which increases urethral tone. It is readily available in a liquid formulation, Propalin, designed for use in dogs.


This syrup contains 40mg/ml of phenylpropanolamine. The dose is 0.1ml/5kg body weight, given three times daily with food.

, Some cases of urinary incontinence fail to resolve on either Incurin or Propalin syrup alone. However, the two medications are suitable for use together, and since they have subtly different sites of action, often their combined action succeeds where one medication alone failed.

Feed the dog food recommended by or prescribed by the vet.,
Be wary when your dog starts getting a lot of infections.,
Understand that you will be faced with having to get the stones removed when the abrasiveness of the stones final draws blood from the bladder wall; this will come out in the urine.

,
If your dog has repeated infections, start taking a urine sample each week on your own (you can order labstix (Chemstrips) from your local pharmacy).,
Heed changes.,
Keep your dog's urine acidic, as bacteria thrives in alkali solutions.",How to Manage Your Dog's Bladder Stones," This isn't a complete answer but it is a good start.;
, These may be a sign that the bacteria causing the infections has become a substrate for the calcium and oxalate crystals. These tend to stick to and snowball into sizable stones.

,, Clean a ceramic dish with regular water, then let distilled water stand in the clean dish for an hour. Discard the water, put the small dish upside down on a paper towel, so as not to collect anything from the air, until the next use. Make a chart with blank date columns and items that the chemical strips test for in the rows. Here you can indicate the readings on the respective dates. Note that doing this should be started long before your dog gets sick. It would be helpful once-a-month, to record a normal history for comparison. As changing levels of glucose (diabetes), ketones (diabetes), pH change (infection), white blood cells (infection), red blood cells (serious infection)all mean something is not right.

, A change from one month to the next is an alert, that should be followed up by another test in a few days, or a week to see if it is an aberration. Heed these alerts to gather information on the web as to what might be happening to your dogs health and get to the vet early and tell him/her that you want to participate in maintaining your dog's health.

, When you see the dog's urine go basic above 7, add foods, and supplements to influence an acidic urine. Take urine weekly, and daily if something has changed. Keep doing it bi-weekly when things are fine.

Keep your dog well-groomed.,
Encourage regular urination.,
Provide plenty of clean drinking water.,
Don't feed your dog orange juice or other ""acidifiers."",
Feed your dog a specialized diet.,
Watch for increased urgency of urination.This might mean that your dog asks to be let out more frequently.,
Look for blood in the urine.This might be hard, as dogs usually urinate onto grass.,
Have older dogs tested regularly.,
Take the dog to the vet if you suspect a UTI.,
Have a veterinarian address repeated infections.",How to Prevent UTI in Dogs," You need to keep your pet's rear end as clean as possible. UTIs are more common in females than males because of the vulva's shape and proximity to the anus.Because it's so wide, it's a good entry point for fecal contamination from the anus.


Whether your pet's male or female, clip the hair around your rear end and genitals. This decreases the chance of feces or bacteria from mud sticking to the dog's private parts.
If the dog gets mucky, give him a good bath, making sure to clean the fur by the genitals.;
, The longer urine sits in the bladder, the more chance bacteria have to multiply. Regular urination flushes bacteria out of the bladder, decreasing the chances for an infection.Ideally, your dog should empty his bladder at least every four hours.


An adult dog can hold his urine for 8 - 10 hours, but that doesn't make it a good idea. Give your dog plenty of opportunities for comfort breaks.
Let the dog out last thing at night and first thing in the morning to minimize how long he has to hold his urine at night.

, Bacteria make toxins that inflame the bladder lining and let the bacteria attach and invade. If your dog drinks a lot, the water dilutes those toxins, decreasing the chances of getting an infection.Make sure all drinking bowls are large, deep, and clean.
Make sure there's always water in drinking bowls — never let them go dry!
Clean the bowl daily and completely replace the water.
If your dog is elderly or stiff on his legs, provide a water bowl in every room.

, You may have heard that these are good home remedies for UTIs. In theory, they improve the pH balance in the urine and kill the infection. There is a risk, though, that you'll raise the acid level too high, causing bladder stones instead of a UTI.


Stick to a prescription diet instead of home remedies. See a veterinarian for advice on how to proceed.

, If your dog is susceptible to UTIs, you might consider asking the vet to prescribe special food. The ideal pH for dog urine is 6.2-6.4. A prescription diet is designed specifically to produce this pH level.


If you get prescription kibble, encourage the dog to drink water by leaving bowls in multiple locations, freely available.
Wet prescription food will have more moisture than kibble, and help hydrate your dog even more. Wet food containers take up a lot of space, though, and wet food usually results in smellier feces.

, He may also be more insistent, as though every time is an emergency. Increased urgency is a tell-tale sign of UTI.


You might also notice repeated urinating behavior (squatting or leg-cocking) without urination. The dog might feel like he or she needs to urinate, but be unable to urinate when let outside.

, If you suspect your dog might have a UTI, though, watch the urine stream mid-air, before it hits the ground. If it looks like it has blood in it, take the dog to the veterinarian immediately.

, Older dogs with heath issues like kidney disease or diabetes tend to drink more water to deal with their condition. This can lead to ""subclinical infections"" due to increased urination. There's bacteria present, but not enough to cause observable signs of discomfort.


The only way to test for a subclinical infection is having a vet test a urine sample. Some vets recommend doing this as part of older dogs' regular medical routines.
If your dog has a history of subclinical infections, have its urine tested every three to six months.

, The ""infection"" part of UTI signals the presence of an infectious agent like bacteria. This needs medical treatment, so you need to take your pet to the vet as soon as possible. If you can, collect a sample of the dog's urine to take with you, as this may speed up the diagnosis.

, If you're taking steps to keep UTIs at bay, but your dog keeps getting them, they might be an underlying health problem. This problem may be weakening your dog's immune system or bladder tissue, resulting in increased UTIs. Identifying and treating the problem will reduce the chance of UTI. Ask your vet to run tests to identify potential causes for your dog's problems. This might include:


Blood tests: The vet can check for conditions that may make the dog drink more and have weaker urine (kidney, liver disease, diabetes)
Imaging: An ultrasound can check for the presence of polyps, bladder cancer, bladder stones, and other issues which can affect the bladder lining.
Urine sediment exam: The veterinarian urine sediment under a microscope for crystals that might explain the dog's issues.

Check to see if your dog is dehydrated.,
Make sure your dog gets plenty of water.,
Understand what a uremic ulcer is and know how to recognize its symptoms.,
Get a prescription for the vet to treat uremic ulcers.,
Talk to your vet about giving your dog an H2 antagonist with the antepsin.,
Have your dog checked for high blood pressure.,
Get your dog an ACE inhibitor.,
Treat any urinary infections that occur.",How to Treat Canine Kidney Disease2," You can detect dehydration by using the finger and thumb of one hand to grasp the scruff on your dog’s shoulders. Lift the skin vertically away from the backbone. When you let go the skin of a well hydrated animal springs back into place immediately.


In a dehydrated animal the skin lacks elasticity and may take a few seconds to fall back into place.

, A diseased kidney is less able to retain water, which causes water to be lost because it gets excreted out through your dog’s urine. If the loss of water exceeds the intake then your dog will become dehydrated.


To encourage your dog to drink, place large drinking bowls in every room the dog has access to.
Some dogs prefer to drink from flowing water so consider investing in a pet water fountain. Also, the chlorine in tap water makes some dogs sick, so try offering mineral water instead.
However, if your dog is severely dehydrated then your dog may need to be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Not only does this rehydrate the dog but it also helps to dilute the toxins present in the bloodstream, which can help your dog to feel better. Unfortunately, intravenous fluids necessitate a 2 to 3 day stay at the vet clinic.

, Because the kidney cannot filter toxins as it should be able to, urea and phosphate remain in the bloodstream. Both of these substances can irritate the lining of the stomach, and the mucous membranes on your dog’s gums.


These high levels of urea and phosphate may result in ulceration, which can be seen as inflamed, ulcerated tissue on the gums or tongue, or will present as stomach ulcers. The latter is a serious problem because not only are they painful but they may bleed or completely ulcerate, which can lead to much more serious medical emergencies. Urea and phosphate are also associated with nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss.

, If your dog is vomiting regularly, or if the vomitus is blood-tinged, talk to your vet so that a treatment plan can be formed. Your vet will most likely prescribe Antepsin. This medication binds to exposed mucosa and forms a protective layer, allowing the area to heal.


The dose is 2.5 to 5 ml (half to one teaspoon) given by mouth two or three times a day., Antepsin is most effective when used with an H2 antagonist (a drug which reduces gastric acid secretion), such as cimetidine. However, the two drugs should not be given at the same time because the Antepsin stops any other drugs from being absorbed). Cimetidine reduces the amount of stomach acid produced, which gives the inflamed stomach lining a chance to settle down.


The dose for a dog is 5 to 10 mg/kg (thus a 30kg dog requires 150 to 300 mg) by mouth or injection, three to four times a day. This is given until the vomiting stops and the dog regains his appetite., Many dogs with kidney disease also suffer from high blood pressure (hypertension). This is because the decreased renal blood flow leads to an increase in distress hormones (renin and angiotensin). These hormones cause sodium retention and blood vessel constriction, which makes it physically harder to pump blood around the body and blood pressure rises as a result.


Untreated hypertension can result in blindness, a stroke, or even sudden death. Hypertension is measured by inflating a cuff around the arm, just as in humans, and a sensor placed on a vein under the tail or on the back of the paw. Three or more readings are taken, and an average value determined.

, If your dog’s blood pressure is between 160 and 180 mmHg then giving your dog an ACE inhibitor should be sufficient to protect the dog from the effects of hypertension. However, if the blood pressure is over 180 mmHg then a human anti-hypertensive medication—amlodipine—is prescribed.


The normal dose is 0.1 to 0.5mg/kg once daily. Thus a 30kg dog requires 3 to 15mg a day. The tablets are 5 mg each and, given the wide dose range, therapy is often started at 1 tablet a day (for a 30kg dog). The blood pressure will then be rechecked after 7 days and the dosage will be adjusted up or down accordingly., Concentrated urine is a natural antiseptic and produces a hostile environment for bacteria. However, dogs with kidney disease have diluted urine and so infections are more common. There is also a risk that bacteria will ascend from the bladder up to the kidney and cause infection there. This kidney infection then causes further damage. Many cases are ""subclinical"", which means they are lurking and sufficient to be a nuisance but not severe enough to cause obvious symptoms.


It is important that the subclinical infections are detected and treated with antibiotics, before they cause further kidney damage. The easiest way to do this is with routine 3-monthly urine culture, which gives a definitive answer as to whether an infection is present or not, and what antibiotics will work best for killing that infection.

Consider giving your dog Benazepril.,
Understand that benazepril is generally only given to dogs in the earlier stages of kidney disease.,
Be aware that some vets will not prescribe this medication.",How to Treat Canine Kidney Disease3," Kidney disease leads to a vicious circle whereby there is less functional tissue doing more work, placing it under greater strain, which hastens its deterioration. Drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as benazepril (Benefortin), reduce the blood pressure gradient across the kidney, which reduces one of the risk factors for deterioration.


The dose is generally 0.25 to 0.5mg/kg once daily by mouth., ACE inhibitors are long term treatments with long term benefits. In severe kidney failure, the fail in local blood pressure can lead to a failure of filtration and a worsening of your dog's condition. Thus use of ACE inhibitors is reserved for dogs in the earlier stages.

, This medication was developed for cats and is not licensed for this function in dogs. However, some veterinarians will still prescribe it.

Get tested for leptospirosis.",How to Treat Canine Leptospirosis," Leptospirosis can cause such digestive signs as vomiting, diarrhea and a loss of appetite. These issues occur on a spectrum — some dogs will have mild symptoms while others will experience such serious hemorrhagic diarrhea and vomiting (bloody diarrhea and vomiting) that they collapse and can die within 24 hours.If your dog is not eating much anymore, he will start losing weight.Vomiting and diarrhea could cause rapid dehydration in your dog.To test for dehydration, create a tent of your dog’s skin by gently pinching with your thumb and index finger. Let go of the skin tent—if it stays up for more than a few seconds, then he is dehydrated. This should not be dismissed as a minor concern, especially if your dog is not interested in eating or drinking.
The vomit and diarrhea may contain blood, due to bleeding problems associated with leptospirosis.;
, Fever is a common symptom of leptospirosis. One way to quickly assess if your dog has a fever is to check her nose — if it's wet and cold, she's probably fine; if it's hot and dry, she may have a fever.To be sure, you may need to take her temperature rectally. A dog's normal temperature range is 99.5 — 102.5°F (37.5 — 39.2°C).


To take your dog's temperature, lubricate a rectal thermometer with Vaseline or baby oil. Insert it about an inch into your dog's anus and remove it a soon as you have a reading (usually after about one minute)., If your dog’s kidneys are infected with Leptospira, he may become very thirsty, causing him to drink more water and start to urinate more.Even if he urinates more frequently, he may urinate only in small amounts.His urine may be dark, indicating urinary tract problems., Since liver disease occurs commonly with leptospirosis, your dog may show signs of liver disease. With liver disease, your dog’s gums and the whites of her eyes would turn yellow due to a condition called jaundice., If Leptospira has invaded your dog’s respiratory system, he may have trouble breathing and start breathing more quickly. He may also start coughing spontaneously or have a runny nose., If your dog has leptospirosis, she may develop very stiff muscles and legs and be unwilling to move around. She may also develop muscle weakness.Your dog’s muscles may start trembling., Leptospirosis can make a dog very sick within just a few days of infection.Take your dog to your vet as soon as you notice signs of the disease. In addition to a physical exam, your vet will test samples of your dog’s blood and urine to confirm the disease. For example, your vet will measure the level of antibodies in the blood. Your vet will also analyze the blood and urine to identify the specific type of Leptospira causing the disease.Antibodies are substances produced by the immune system to fight infection.
Several species of Leptospira can cause canine leptospirosis.Your vet may want to take x-rays or perform an ultrasound to look for signs of kidney or liver disease, such as an enlarged liver; however, these signs are not specific to leptospirosis and wouldn’t confirm the disease., Your dog’s chances of recovery are much better if you start treating him early and aggressively.The earlier you begin treating him, the better the chances of preventing permanent liver and kidney damage. Leptospirosis treatment consists of general supportive care (e.g., rehydration, controlling vomiting, treatment of liver and kidney disease) and antibiotics.Pain control is another aspect of general supportive care.Because of the vomiting, the lining of your dog’s stomach may be irritated. Your vet may prescribe a medication, called a protectant, that would coat and protect the stomach lining.Treatment usually takes place in two phases. The first phase is short term and treats the initial signs of leptospirosis. Second-phase treatment kills any residual bacteria that would cause a long-term infection.Your vet will explain all of the treatments your dog will need. Realize that treatment for leptospirosis can be expensive., If your dog has severe leptospirosis that has progressed quickly, your vet will want to hospitalize her for aggressive treatment. In-hospital treatments include fluid therapy and antiemetics (medications to prevent vomiting). If your dog has lost a lot of blood, your vet would need to do a blood transfusion.Your vet would also start your dog on antibiotics, even if the blood and urine results are not ready.A reasonable suspicion of leptospirosis is often enough to begin antibiotic treatment.
If your dog needs to be hospitalized, your vet may be concerned about her chances for recovery. With severe leptospirosis, even the most aggressive treatment may not be enough overcome serious organ damage., If hospitalization is not necessary, then you will care for your dog at home. He will likely need several medications, so make sure you understand how to administer each one. It is particularly important to give the antibiotics as directed.Many dogs with leptospirosis respond quickly to antibiotic treatment.Even if your dog gets better soon after you start him on antibiotics, continue the full treatment course.
If you stop the antibiotic treatment early, or miss a dose, a portion of bacteria may remain in your dog’s system and make him sick again.

, While being treated for leptospirosis, your dog should not be very physically active.If your dog is crate trained, consider keeping her in her crate more often. If she is not crate trained, keep a close eye on her to make sure she doesn’t engage in any rough or active play.


Your dog may not feel up to being very active anyway, so cage rest probably won’t be a problem for her.

, Leptospirosis spreads between animals and can infect humans. If you have children or other pets, keep your infected dog away from them to prevent the spread of disease.If possible, keep your dog in another room until he has completed treatment.


Set up a separate area for your dog to eliminate. If you have a backyard, you may want to create a gated off area in the yard where he could eliminate; this area should not be accessible to your other pets.If you have a little dog, you could have him use pee pads in his isolated area indoors.

, Whenever you pet your dog, or touch her for any reason, wash your hands afterwards.You should also wash your hands after handling her food and water bowls.

, Gloves will be very effective in preventing disease transmission from your dog to you. If he vomits or has an accident in the house, put on your gloves to clean up the area.If he's using pee pads, pick up the pee pads with gloves on.


Throw the gloves away after use, being careful not to touch the outside of either glove with your bare hands. Wash your hands thoroughly after throwing away the gloves.

, When you have finished removing the fluids or waste, you will need to disinfect the area. Make a bleach solution that is one part bleach to nine parts water.Putting the solution in a large spray bottle would be helpful.


Follow the instructions on the bleach container to disinfect properly.
Wash your dog’s bedding with bleach, since it will likely be contaminated.Clean and disinfect your dog’s food and water bowls.

, Since leptospirosis can spread from your dog to you or your children, consider getting everyone in the household tested for the disease. Even if no one is sick, one of you could have been infected.If your doctor detects the disease, she will prescribe the appropriate treatment.

Understand what Encephalitozoonosis is.,
Know how Encephalitozoonosis affects dogs.,
Test for the disease.,
Know how dogs contract the disease.",How to Treat Encephalitozoonosis in Dogs1," Encephalitozoonosis is a parasitic disease. The disease is rare in dogs because the disease most commonly affects rabbits. This disease causes lesions on various organs in your dog’s body.Humans with weak immune systems, such as the young, old, or ill, can also contract the disease. However, this is rare.;
, Encephalitozoonosis can affect different areas of the body. This can cause disease in the following organs:


Lungs, causing coughing and difficulty breathing
Heart, which can cause heart failure
Kidney, which can cause kidney failure
Brain, causing behavior abnormalities, such as aggression,seizures, tremors, and blindness, Since these symptoms can be common causes of other diseases, a veterinarian would unlikely diagnose Encephalitozoonosis in the infected dog. Further testing would be needed to diagnose it. The testing includes checking the blood and urine for abnormalities.If you suspect this disease in your dog, mention it to your veterinarian and any possible contact the dog could have had with rabbits or rabbit urine.

, Encephalitozoonosis is thought to be contracted through the mouth and nose. A dog can contract the disease by sniffing or licking infected urine.Kennelled dogs are at a higher risk of contracting the disease.
Mothers can also pass this disease to their offspring through placenta."

Know the signs.,
Let the dog pass the bacteria.,
Treat the dog with antibiotics.,
Give your dog fluids.,
Use probiotics.,
Wash your dog carefully.,
Clean the infected areas.,
Prevent further infection.",How to Treat Campylobacteriosis in Dogs1," Recognizing the signs of campylobacteriosis is important. As soon as you see symptoms, you need to take your pet to the vet. This helps prevent them from becoming anorexic or dehydrated.The symptoms are:


Watery diarrhea containing mucus
Stomach cramps or pain
Fever
LethargyVomiting
Straining to defecate
Loss of appetite;
, The bacteria shouldn’t stay in your dog’s system. It needs to get it out. Because of this, don’t give your dog anti-diarrhea medicine because it will cause the dog to not pass the bacteria., If the vet has diagnosed your dog with campylobacter, he may prescribe antibiotics. Make sure to give your dog the medicine for at least 21 days. This helps clear the campylobacteriosis so the dog doesn’t become a carrier., If your dog has bad diarrhea, you should give him fluids to help with the dehydration. Make sure the dog has fresh drinking water. You can include electrolytes in the fluids to help combat the dehydration. In extreme cases, your dog can become so dehydrated he has to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.Feed the dog a bland diet that is easily digested. Try chicken and rice. Your vet may prescribe a specific for your dog to help him recover and heal.

, Some evidence has shown that probiotics can help with diarrhea in dogs.Probiotics have been successful in preventing and treating campylobacteriosis, stopping the symptoms, and promoting healing., It is important to wash the dog while treating him for the bacteria. Pay special attention to the area round his rear end. This makes sure his coat is clean and your dog does not reinfect himself when grooming his coat.

, Clear up all dog mess promptly, in a safe and hygienic manner. Wash your hands after contact with your dog to avoid accidental infection. Campylobacter is destroyed by most disinfectants, and is destroyed by prolonged raised temperatures., To prevent any further infection to your or others’ dogs, make sure to keep your dog and his area clean. Clean the living and eating area, including disinfecting the bowls and bedding.Don’t let your infected dog lick people’s faces, and make sure to wash your hands frequently.Don’t feed animals raw meat.
Keep infected animals away from other animals.Pick up your dog’s feces from the ground, both in your yard and in public.

Begin treating the underlying cause of the stroke.,
Decrease any brain swelling and ensure the dog stays hydrated.,
Allow your dog to be hospitalized for the first 72 hours.,
Make sure your dog is monitored at all times during recovery.,
Give your dog any medications prescribed by the vet.,
Understand the prognosis.",How to Treat Canine Stroke1," Bring your dog to the vet for diagnosis (Method 2 will discuss the means of diagnosis further). If tests reveal canine stroke, your doctor will discuss with you the causes that led to the condition. There are no specific treatments for a stroke except for targeting the underlying cause of the condition.An Ischemic stroke is associated with such conditions as diabetes, improper functioning thyroid glands, heart or kidney disease and hypertension. A Hemorrhagic stroke is often due to a blood clot, hypertension, rat poisoning and compromised blood vessels.
It is not uncommon for a dog to suffer a stroke due to a tumor on the brain and head trauma. Once diagnosed as a canine stroke and the underlying cause is identified, a treatment plan can be implemented.;
, When admitted for canine stroke treatment, the first step will be to decrease any swelling within the brain and to keep re-hydrating your dog. Your dog will be given an IV of fluids so that he can get hydrated.


Medications such as Amlodipine may be administered to protect your dog's neurologic tissues. Other medications may also be given, including an anti-inflammatory such as an NSAID if swelling is evident, antibiotics for a diagnosis of infection, a sedative for ataxia and disorientation, an antiemetic for vomiting and stomach distress, and anticonvulsants to control seizures .
Your dog will be placed in a soft, comfortable position during treatment so that his head is not laying below the rest of his body; this position will help to promote proper blood flow.

, In order to prevent lung congestion, pressure sores and urine burns, your dog needs to be monitored and turned over daily. Hospital care may require at least 72 hours of constant treatment, most often with positive results.


With further at-home care as prescribed by your veterinarian, your dog should return to normal within three to four weeks.

, At-home care involves constant monitoring of your pet while he heals. You may need to employ the assistance of others, such as having your neighbor look in on your dog if you have to leave the house. You could also hire a pet sitter to keep an eye on your dog when you are away.


Consider taking long lunch breaks to go and check on your dog, or work from home if you are able to. You could also ask if you can bring your dog to work.

, Medications may also be prescribed to help your dog fully recover from a stroke and possibly prevent further attacks. Dogs with symptoms of ataxia and disorientation may be given a sedative. Other medications may include being prescribed:


Antiemetic for vomiting issues.
An anti-inflammatory for swelling symptoms.
Antibiotics for infections.
Anticonvulsants to control and further prevent the stroke.
Antiplatelet drugs similar to Plavix, an anticoagulant for long-term therapy for the prevention of blood clots.

, How quickly your dog recovers depends on how quickly a treatment plan was put in place to treat the underlying cause of the stroke.


Depending on the severity of the canine stroke, any permanent physical damage from the stroke cannot be reversed, possibly leaving your dog with a disability. However, your dog can still lead a normal life if you give him his medications.
You can also give your dog a daily massage to increase his ability to move around. Use the palm of your hand to rub his entire body.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Follow the veterinarian’s treatment.,
Keep the dog separate.,
Sanitize the area.,
Wear gloves.",How to Treat Encephalitozoonosis in Dogs2," In puppies, symptoms appear when they are around three weeks old. The symptoms include stunted growth, poor coat, inability to thrive, kidney failure, and neurological complications. In adults, infected dogs have brain abnormalities, aggressive behavior, seizures, blindness, and kidney failure., If your dog has Encephalitozoonosis, then the doctor will prescribe various supportive treatments. An example of a supportive treatment the doctor may prescribe is IV fluids or electrolytes to help the kidneys.


The dog will probably also be given fungicidal medicine.Most dogs will recover with treatment. In severe cases where dogs don’t respond to treatment, the dog may have to be put down. This is most common in puppies., The disease is spread through urine, so you need to keep your dog separate from other dogs and from vulnerable humans. You can keep them at the vet or separated in your home.Keep the dog in an area that is easily clean, like a tiled floor instead of carpet.
Use disposable bedding and cloth. This can help you avoid further contamination., Since this disease can be contracted by dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans, you need to sanitize the area. Use a 1:10 bleach solution to clean the area.If you can’t bleach the area, like carpets, rugs, or upholstery, steam clean the area.To make the bleach solution, place ¼ cup of bleach in 2 ¼ cups of water. It will take less than a minute for the bleach to kill the organisms.
You can also use a 70 percent ethanol solution to disinfect., When you are cleaning or interacting with your sick dog, you need to wear disposable gloves. This helps reduce the chance that you will contract the disease. Make sure to dispose of the gloves and wash your hands with soap and water after you have touched the dog or any infected area."
"
Understand who is affected by the disease.,
Know how dogs can contract the disease.,
Know how campylobacteriosis is diagnosed.,
Understand how antibiotics affect campylobacteriosis.",How to Treat Campylobacteriosis in Dogs2," Campylobacteriosis is found in the gut and common in puppies six months and younger. Nearly half of dogs carry the disease. People can get the disease if they have unhygienic contact with an infected animal., The bacteria is found in the gastrointestinal tract. Any dog who carries the bacteria can spread it through his feces. Kennels are the most common place dogs can contract this disease.Dogs can contract the disease by ingesting feces, or through contaminated food and water.


Dogs can also contact the disease by walking across ground covered in feces and then licking their paws.This is why it is important to pick up your dog’s feces from the ground, since coming into contact with the infected feces can spread it.
There is a small risk that campylobacter can be contracted through raw meats, such as chicken. You can spread it to the dog by touching water or food after handling raw meat., When you take the dog to the vet, your vet will take a stool sample. Then, the vet will send a stool sample to the lab to be analyzed.She can also do blood and urine tests. The vet will also consider the dog’s individual case and decide if he has campylobacter.

, Only a few antibiotics can kill campylobacter. If you use these antibiotics when they aren’t needed, you can create antibiotic resistance.


This might mean that the treatment for people can be less effective because the strains of campylobacter can become resistant in dogs if they are given antibiotics when they don’t need it.Make sure your vet is absolutely sure that the dog has campylobacter before giving it antibiotics to avoid resistance.

"
Recognize the symptoms of canine stroke.,
Bring your dog to the vet’s office for testing.,
Understand how strokes occur.",How to Treat Canine Stroke2," Symptoms and signs of canine stroke will vary from those noted in humans. People suffering from a stroke may have signs of total paralysis on one side of the body that is affected or seen with a drooping face.In dogs, rather than the drooping face, you may notice a tilting or turning head, imbalance that leads to falling or circling, an inability to walk or keep his balance and often times, a loss of vision.
Your veterinarian will perform some specific tests to determine if the symptoms indeed signify a stroke.

, Your veterinarian will first determine your dog's condition by the signs you have related to him or her, along with physically watching your pet's behavior and walk. Tests for a definitive diagnosis involve such tests as an MRI, CT scan and standard X-rays in order to see specific images within the brain.


Your dog may need to be anaesthetized for these and other tests such as a spinal tap that takes a sample of spinal fluid in an effort to check for other issues, concerns and diseases with similar symptoms.
The doctor will be looking for any type of tumor on the brain, bleeding and its source or inflammation and infection.

, Canine strokes occur when the blood supply to the dog's brain is blocked or lessened so that proper function is inhibited. If a blood vessel bursts within the brain, it leads to a hemorrhagic stroke, while an Ischemic stroke is due to a reduced blood supply to the brain.The brain cannot function properly without a constant healthy supply of blood that provides necessary nutrients and ample oxygen throughout the body. When proper blood supply and circulation is compromised, altered bodily function can be evident.

Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Agree to pay for additional testing.,
Discuss the treatment options with your veterinarian.",How to Treat Canine Cancer1," Before deciding on a course of treatment, the vet needs to diagnose the precise type of cancer and how far advanced it is. This is so you can make an informed decision about what is in your dog's best interest.For example, if your dog had a bone cancer affecting a leg but the cancer has already spread to the liver and lungs, then it would be unfair to put the dog through major surgery to amputate the affected leg.
On the other hand, if it's proven the cancer is localized to that one limb, then surgery becomes a good option to prevent spread and alleviate the pain.;
, This will cost you more but it is important. The vet needs to run a number of tests to reach a diagnosis and assess how advanced the cancer is. This involves biopsying the cancer and imaging, such as chest radiographs, abdominal ultrasounds, or an MRI or CT scan.This gives a visual picture of if there are any suspicious lumps that need to be further biopsied to see if they are cancerous.

, Different cancers respond to different therapies, so once your vet has assessed the cancer fully, they can decide which option is going to be most effective. The options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cryosurgery, or heat therapy.


Some of these procedures require special safety equipment or specialist knowledge, and so referral to a veterinary oncologist may be necessary.

Notice fever and other early symptoms.,
Watch for discharge.,
Check for swelling and liver failure.,
Diagnose ICH.,
Keep your dog separate.,
Give your dog plenty of fluids.,
Ask if medication can help with symptoms.,
Increase your dog's immune system.,
Provide care for serious cases.,
Help your dog recover.,
Isolate your dog from infected dogs.,
Vaccinate your dog.,
See your veterinarian.",How to Treat Canine Infectious Hepatitis," There are a set of symptoms that are the first to appear in your dog if she has ICH. The first sign is usually a high fever, which is typically greater than 104 F. This will causes your dog to lack overall energy and not want to eat her food. Your dog's gums will also appear very red and inflamed.


At this point, your dog may have abdominal pain and start vomiting.
The symptoms do not take too long to develop once your dog is exposed. The incubation period of this disease from the point of contact with the virus to the first symptoms is four to nine days, so look for these symptoms within the first week.;
, Once these other symptoms show up, your dog may begin to see other symptoms. Some dogs develop a clear, runny discharge from the nose and eyes.In some cases, the discharge may be accompanied by a cloudy membrane over one or both eyes, which is called Blue Eye., If your dog develops a severe case of ICH, there are some additional symptoms she may develop. She may develop swelling of the head and neck, meaning her lymph glands and tonsils are swollen. Your dog's liver function was also be compromised, which would mean the liver is not able to complete proper clotting. Your dog's abnormal clotting will cause her to bleed easily, which may cause hemorrhaging from the gums or from injection sites.


Any blood loss from these areas can be life threatening.
This can also lead to micro-clots in her blood stream during circulation, which may cause these clots to get stuck in the tiny blood vessels in the organs. This can lead to organ failure., Once your see any of the symptoms of ICH, take your dog to the vet. The vet will check these symptoms to ensure that they are not being caused by a condition with similar symptoms, such as distemper. A physical exam of your dog will generally determine the cause of the symptoms, which is when your vet will suggest treatment options.


An absolute diagnosis is not necessary to start care and can cost a lot of money. Typically a physical exam is enough to be sure, but in order to be 100% positive, your vet can run advanced blood tests, such as the ELISA and PCR., If your dog does have ICH, you need to make sure that she is kept separate from other dogs. If you have other dogs, keep them away from your infected dog. You should also keep her away from dog parks or other public areas where other dogs go.


Even once she gets better, be cautious with other dogs because a recovering dog who had ICH can shed the virus for around six months afterwards., The virus causes dehydration, so ensuring that your dog gets plenty of fluids into her system. If she is not keeping food or water down, you may have to seek vet care to get her intravenous fluids to keep her hydrated.


This will keep your dog healthy to help your dog's immune system combat and fight off the virus., There is no medical treatment for ICH because there is nothing that can kill the virus that causes it. However, your dog may be given medications to help bring down her fever. Your dog may also be given anti-emetics, which will help control vomiting, and pain relief medications, which will help abdominal discomfort.


If your dog's case is severe, this may not be possible because of blood clotting problems. Drugs that help reduce fevers can also be associated with blood clotting complications in rare cases., Your veterinarian may give your dog antibiotics to help her boost her immune system. This will help her combat any secondary bacterial infections that may attack her.


This will ensure that your dog's immune system is healthy enough to fully fight the virus., In more serious cases of ICH, your dog may need a blood or plasma transfusion if she is loosing too much blood. She may also need medication that helps with clotting. Your dog may also be severely ill and in a collapsed state, which means you will need to make her comfortable as she heals.


It is important that your dog is comfortable by lying on a bed that keeps moisture away, such as a Vetbed, to reduce bedsores. You should also turn your dog over regularly to ensure they don't develop as well., As your dog recovers, you will have to help her get better. You may need to hand feed her to ensure she eats her food. This can be hard at first because she may not want to eat, but try to tempt her with her favorite foods. She will need to eat to ensure your dog regains her strength.


Over time, she will regain her strength and get better., The ICH virus is spread through contact between dogs. It gets transmitted from one dog to another through contact with infected urine, feces, or saliva of dogs already infected with the virus.


If you are aware of a dog that is infected with this virus, keep your dog away from that dog., If you are worried about your dog getting ICH, there are some measures you can take to ensure that your dog doesn't get it. There are several highly effective vaccines that can protect your dog from ICH. If you don't vaccinate your dog, she will be at risk for ICH.


Ask your veterinarian which of these vaccines would be the best for your dog to make sure she is safe., If you notice any symptoms or signs of ICH in your dog, take her to your veterinarian immediately, especially if she hasn't been vaccinated. If you catch it early, your dog is more likely to pull through the illness.


If you aren't sure what your dog's symptoms mean, make sure to ask your vet. It is better to be overly cautious than let your dog suffer.

Talk to your vet about using a needle to remove the blood.,
Bring your dog back to the vet’s office a week after the blood is drained.,
Continue to bring your dog back every week until the blood stops refilling the ear.",How to Treat Aural Hematomas in Dogs1," Medical correction involves removing the blood from the hematoma pocket by sucking it out using a needle and syringe. The syringe is disconnected from the needle which is left in place in the ear. A small volume of injectable steroid (5 ml of dexamethasone) is then instilled into the dead space via the needle.The needle is then removed from the ear and gentle pressure is applied with a finger and thumb over the pinprick, for 30 seconds or so, to encourage the hole to seal over.;
, Your dog will not have to wear a buster collar (the large cones that look keep your dog from pulling out stitches). This is because there are no stitches to pull out.


When you bring your dog back in, the vet will check to see if the ear has refilled with blood. If it has, the procedure will need to be repeated. Approximately 50% of cases need a repeat procedure., If the ear has refilled again, the procedure will need to be repeated again.


If it continues on like this for many weeks, surgery may be considered as an alternative, and more permanent, treatment.

"
"
Talk to your veterinarian about the option of surgery.,
Be prepared to provide aftercare.,
Assess whether surgery is worth the possible benefits.",How to Treat Canine Cancer2," In many cases, surgical removal of the lump or mass has the potential to be curative or reduce the risk of the cancer spreading. This is especially true if the cancer is caught early and no malignant cells have spread to other parts of the body.Screening before surgery is important so that a dog doesn't go through surgery unnecessarily. If the cancer has moved all around the dog's body, then surgery is not that useful.

, The surgeon will plan the removal carefully and take wide margins from around the edges of the lesion. This means your dog may go home with a much longer incision and line of sutures than you were anticipating. In addition, in the case of skin lumps, the surgeon will remove an entire layer of soft tissue from beneath the mass, so as to eliminate the possibility of leaving cancer cells that have invaded downwards instead of sideways.You will need to make sure that the incisions are kept clean while they are healing. This means keeping your dog from chewing at its incisions and making sure that it doesn't rub the incision and open it up.

, Sometimes surgery may be undertaken in the full knowledge that it won't be curative, but removing the mass will give the dog more time and a better quality of life. You need to decide whether you want to put your dog through the pain of surgery in order to give it a bit more time. It truly can be worth it, especially for slow growing cancers, but that is not always the case.


Sometimes in these cases, if the cancer cells are sensitive to medical treatment, then surgery is followed up by chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, you also need to take the cost into account. Since veterinary care for cancer can cost a lot, the cost of the surgery versus how much it will potentially help your pet needs to be weighed."
"
Agree to chemotherapy treatment.,
Understand the aims of chemotherapy treatment in pets.,
Give your dog treatment or take it to get treatment.,
Take your dog in for continued monitoring.",How to Treat Canine Cancer3," Chemotherapy involves using chemicals or drugs to induce remission or cure cancer. It works by killing fast growing cancer cells.It may be used as a solo therapy, especially in conditions, such as lymphoma, that are sensitive to certain drugs.
It can also be used as one part of multiple therapeutic treatments, to reduce the size of a cancer of kill metastatic cells that have spread distant to the original cancer site.

, The aim of chemotherapy is pets is different to that in people. It is generally ethically agreed that quality of life, rather than length of life, is most important for pets.This means the aim of chemo is not to cure the patient but to reduce their symptoms and buy them more good quality time.


The doses of drugs used are usually much reduced to the human equivalent, and therefore the side effects are less severe. While some drugs do cause a temporary feeling of sickness, this is usually easy to control with a preemptive anti-nausea injection. Also, the lower doses mean the dog does not lose its hair, as people do., Chemotherapy takes different forms. Some regimes involves pills you give regularly at home. This is usually daily, on alternate days, or weekly, depending on the drug and the size of your dog). Other forms involve intravenous injections that are given under tightly controlled conditions at the vet clinic.No chemotherapy drug should be handled with bare hands, so if you have drugs dispensed to administer at home be sure to wear latex gloves.
Also, if you are pregnant or have a health problem yourself, make sure the prescribing vet is aware of this so they can decide if it's safe for you to handle that specific drug.

, Some monitoring of the patient is necessary, usually blood tests to measure the amount of white blood cells in the dog's circulation. If the chemo drugs suppress the immune system too much, then therapy may need to be halted and antibiotics started, to give the body a chance to produce more white cells."

Discuss the option of radiotherapy with your veterinarian.,
Have your dog get cryosurgery or heat surgery.,
Consider alternative medicine.",How to Treat Canine Cancer4," Radiotherapy involves using x-rays or radioactive emissions to treat cancer. Radiotherapy is indicated for cancers on the outside of the body, such as a tumor affecting the face or a limb extremity.


These are specialist treatments and are undertaken at specialist centers, therefore it is likely you'll need to travel with your pet to access radiotherapy. A typical radiotherapy protocol involves four to six weekly treatments, with the obvious implication that the dog needs a weekly anesthetic. On the plus side, radiotherapy can produce a dramatic reduction in size of some aggressive tumors, and either buy the dog more time or reduce the lump to a size that it can be surgically removed.
The animal has to lie exceedingly still and so radiotherapy is always done under general anesthesia.

, These therapies involve the application of extreme cold or extreme heat in order to destroy cancerous tissue. Neither therapy is in wide usage, as the type of tumor that is treated with cryosurgery or heat surgery is often just surgically removed.Healing after cryosurgery or heat surgery involves the lump dying and being sloughed off over time.

, There are a wide variety of alternative treatments that can potentially be used on dog cancer. While the success rates and effectiveness of many of these treatments is up to debate, it is worth a try if other treatments are not working or you are not able to pay for them.


For example, one successful alternative treatment that utilizes a mushroom used in Chinese medicine has been used to treat a specific blood cancer."

Talk to your vet about the surgery that will be performed.,
Get your dog a buster collar after surgery.,
Have your dog’s stitches taken out after two to three weeks.,
Wash the wound with salt water once a day.",How to Treat Aural Hematomas in Dogs2," Surgical correction involves your dog having a general anesthetic so that he can sleep through the procedure. Once the dog is asleep, the ear flap is clipped and prepared with a surgical scrub. An incision is made on the underside of the ear flap and all the blood is drained out of the pocket.Multiple stitches are then placed through the ear flap to hold the skin against the cartilage and encourage it to bond back down.

, Again, a buster collar is a large plastic cone that is placed on your dog’s head to keep him from biting or scratching at the stitches. Your dog will have to wear this collar until his stitches are removed.

, They will be removed by a vet or a vet tech. The removal process is a simple matter of snipping the stitch and pulling it out of the skin.


This process should not be painful and can generally be done in the pet clinic.

, You could also wash it twice a day if you prefer. Washing the wound with salt water helps to keep it clean and bacteria-free, as salt water is a mild disinfectant.


You can make a salt water solution by adding a teaspoon of salt to a pint of boiled water. Let it cool before you use it to wash your dog’s ear.
Soak a cotton pad in the salt water and then wipe the wound down.

Think about some of the drawbacks of surgery.,
Consider the drawbacks to medical treatment without surgery.,
Consider the fact that medical intervention is cheaper than surgical intervention.",How to Treat Aural Hematomas in Dogs3," Surgical correction carries the highest probability of a successful outcome, but does have drawbacks. These are that the pet needs a general anesthetic since the procedure is painful, and the dog would be distressed to have it done conscious.


Another disadvantage is the need to wear a buster collar for two to three weeks, which can cause considerable inconvenience if the dog is large and goes blundering into furniture at home.

, Medical treatment has the advantage that many good-natured dogs allow the ear to be drained while they are still conscious.


However, the main disadvantage is the variable outcome, with around half of cases needing a repeat procedure, and even then a successful result is not guaranteed.
On one hand, if medical treatment works well it is less expensive, less painful, and less invasive than surgery, but on the other hand it carries a lower success rate. It is entirely possible for a pet to have two medical treatments and still be left with a hematoma that then needs surgical drainage.

, Another consideration is cost. Because an anesthetic is involved the cost is often much greater than if the hematoma can be corrected medically.

Know when to get medical attention.,
Consider less common causes of heavy panting.",How to Treat a Panting Dog," If you're sure your dog is healthy, he may be panting because he's thirsty and overheated. Offer your dog cool, not ice cold, water. If the water is too cold, your dog may find it uncomfortable and stop drinking.


If you're exercising with your dog, periodically give him water breaks.To prevent your dog from gulping too much water, try to give him water from a water bottle. Drinking slowly can prevent stomach cramps.;
, If your dog is overheating, you should put him in a cool place that has air conditioning or a room that has a fan running. If you have the option, let your dog go for a dip in the pool or lake. Once your dog seems to have cooled off and isn't panting as much, offer him water again.Consider dipping a towel in water, wringing it out, and draping it over your dog. This will cool him off, especially after exercising in a warm environment., If your dog is overexcited or anxious, take charge and calm him down. If you’re worried or panicked, your dog will feed off your emotions so don't appear nervous. Instead, comfort your dog by talking to him in a soothing voice while petting him.You may be able to distract your dog from what's worrying him. Try giving him a small treat or his favorite toy to play with.

, If your dog has been in a hot environment and is panting heavily, he may be overheated. Check to see if his gums are beet red or pale. If so, get your dog to a cool place with a fan on him and offer cool water.If your dog doesn't stop panting or acts weak, take him to the veterinarian.

, Your dog may pant heavily to flush his body of toxic substances if he has chronic health problems, like heart or lung disease. If your dog is obese, he's more likely to pant heavily because of heat exhaustion. This is because the extra fat and energy required to carry the weight makes your dog work harder.


If you have an older dog who suddenly pants more when he does average physical activities or when he's laying down, make an appointment to have him examined., Your dog may pant heavily if his body temperature rises externally (in hot weather) or internally (by fever due to illness or infection). In these cases, he'll pant to rid his body of this heat. If your dog has heat exhaustion or a fever over 102.5 degrees, immediately call the veterinarian. Your veterinarian should tell you what steps you'll need to take before bringing your dog in for medical treatment.To take your dog's temperature use a rectal thermometer, or an ear thermometer if your dog will tolerate it. Never take an oral (mouth) temperature since it won't be accurate.

, Take your dog to the veterinarian if you notice heavy panting and:Pain from arthritis
Pain from abdominal problems like bloat or pancreatitis
Pain from an injury
Fever over 102.5 degrees
Panting that lasts more than 10 minutes
A bluish purple or very pale mouth or tongue

See the vet immediately if your dog has bloat, pancreatitis, colored or pale mouth or tongue, and heavy breathing.



, Occasionally, some medical conditions or medications may cause your dog to pant heavily. Consult with your veterinarian if you suspect one of the following is causing the heavy panting:


Cushing’s disease: This hormonal disease causes your dog to produce too much cortisol.Panting is one of the minor signs of this disease, while a pot belly and increased eating, drinking, and urination are more common symptoms.
Medication: Some medications such as steroids (like prednisone) can cause your dog to pant.Pregnancy and related conditions: If your dog is pregnant, the added weight can cause her to pant heavily, especially by the end of pregnancy. Milk fever (eclampsia) in nursing mothers can also lead cause heavy panting. Calcium levels in the blood stream plummet when the milk demand for calcium becomes too high."

Look for the signs of allergies in your dog.,
Investigate possible causes.,
Pay attention to when the allergic reaction gets bad.,

Use topical products.,
Ask your vet to do allergy testing.,
Give your dog allergy medication.,
Treat additional connected health issues.",How to Treat Canine Allergies," Allergies are caused by substances that, when inhaled or absorbed by the body, cause the body to produce a chemical called histamine that results in inflammation.Most dog allergies appear as a skin problem and produce inflammation, itching, and redness of the skin. Symptoms include:Itching. Yearlong itching may mean your dog has food allergies. Seasonal itching may mean your dog has atopy.
Brown staining of paws. Dogs will frequently lick itchy paws leaving a brown discoloration.
Frequent ear or skin infections due to breakdown of the skin barrier.
Red skin
Hair loss
Bad odor due to secondary bacterial or yeast infections;
, There are many things which can cause an allergy in a dog. Dogs can be allergic to so many things that it can be hard to pinpoint the cause. Some causes of allergies in dogs include: pollen from trees, grass or weeds, dust and house dust mites, dander, food ingredients, fleas and flea medications, mold, and feathers.Some can cause immediate life threatening reactions. This is an anaphylaxis type of a reaction and it is generally rare. The body over-reacts to an allergen (such as a bee sting, medications or a vaccination) by producing chemicals which can put the body into shock.This type of allergy is different from others, which are the sensitivities which can make a dog miserable and decrease its quality of life.

, Some allergies are seasonal (such as from pollen), while others are year round problems, such as food or dust mite allergies. Try to determine when they are happening to help determine what type of allergies your dog might be having. We can group allergies into three general categories:Food reactions (allergies and intolerance)
Flea bite sensitivity
Airborne allergens

, There are different approaches to treating canine allergies. For food allergies, this can mean a trial-and-error approach to find out which food ingredient is triggering your dog’s allergies. Sometimes a simple food change can mean a world of difference for your dog. This elimination does take some time, as it will take the body up to six weeks to eliminate the allergen from the body. Common food allergens for dogs include:Beef
Chicken
Pork
Soy
Corn
Wheat

, If you suspect your dog has a food allergy you need to feed it a new diet that consists of food ingredients your dog hasn’t likely eaten in the past. Some types of diets will include:


Novel carbohydrates- such as potato, rice, yams
Novel proteins- such as salmon, venison, bison, duck or even kangaroo

, This is especially true if you are doing an elimination or totally new diet. If possible, always chose a diet formulated by professionals.


Don’t try to make your own dog food diet unless you consult a pet food nutritional specialist, as a dog’s dietary needs are very different from humans.

, If food isn’t the culprit, you will need to employ different tactics to control the allergy symptoms. These can include topical treatments, such as frequent bathing of the dog to remove pollen using a hypoallergenic shampoo.Even a simple wiping off of the feet and non-haired regions of your dog with a damp washcloth can help to remove allergens.
Putting socks, a baby onesie, or an old T-shirt on a dog during allergy season can also help keep allergens off of your dog when it is outside.

, There are also topical skin products, such as cortisone, which can be used to reduce inflammation on the dog’s skin. These products can help strengthen the skin., Blood or skin testing can be performed to help determine the cause of your dog’s allergies. Based upon these results, an immunotherapy vaccine may potentially be developed to be given to desensitize your dog against its allergens.


In some cases, immunotherapy vaccines can cost about the same as conventional allergy treatments (medications, blood testing).
Allergy shots such as these will be administered at home by you, the dog owner, and have been proven to be very effective at alleviating the signs of allergies when combined with other allergy treatments, such as shampooing, use of fatty acids in the food, and antihistamines., Medications are available to help combat the symptoms of allergies. Most will have to be obtained from your veterinarian after an examination to make sure they are safe for your dog. Medications used include:Antihistamines- such as Benadryl
Steroids- such as prednisone or Depo-Medrol
Essential fatty acids- enhance the effectiveness of antihistamines and steroids
Apoquel- a Janus kinase inhibitor
Cyclosporine- an immunosuppressant

, If your dog has a secondary bacterial or yeast infection, topical or oral antibiotics and/or anti-fungal medications will need to be taken to control or eliminate these infections. This will help your dog's immune system to recover and its overall health to improve.

Commit to helping your dog go to the bathroom.,
Select a towel that can be used as a sling for your dog.,
Place the sling on the dog.,
Support the dog's weight at she urinates.",How to Help a Female Dog Who Is Injured Urinate1," Helping her go to the bathroom will take some commitment on your part. However, just remember that squatting places a strain on bones and muscles, and if one of those bones or muscles is not able to support the dog's weight she is liable to collapse. This will discourage her from trying to urinate again, and she may lie in her bed and soil herself.;
, A hand towel is fine for a small dog, a bath towel for a medium dog, and a bath sheet for a large dog. Alternatively, improvise with anything that is long and narrow, but if using a belt or similar, just be careful it doesn't dig into her skin or chaff in any way.A simple sling can be made from a cotton shopper bag. Slit the side seams so that the bag lies out completely flat. The body of the bag forms the sling which you locate under the belly, then bring the handles together, one on either side, to hold them above her back to form a hoist.

, Hold one end above her back, pass the other end under her belly and up the other side, and grasp the two ends together above her back. This forms a loop with the dog supported in the 'U' of the loop. Slide the sling back so that it rests as far back towards her hips and knees as is comfortable for her. By holding the ends of the towel you can take the weight off her back legs if she's struggling to walk to a toilet spot.

, As she squats, allow her to assume the squat position but take some of her weight so that she is supported and doesn't tumble if her legs give way. Simply supporting her in a squatting position so that she doesn't collapse can make a big difference to her."

Look for common nasal aspergillosis symptoms.,
Look for common signs of disseminated aspergillosis symptoms.,
Get the dog diagnosed as soon as possible.,
Try oral medications as a first measure to treat aspergillosis.,
Try using ketoconazole to cause the breakdown of fungal cells.,
Try using amphotericin B to fight the infection.,
Investigate curettage of the nose.,
Look into 1% clotrimazole to use in conjunction with curettage.",How to Treat Aspergillosis in Dogs," Nasal aspergillosis may present with symptoms like sneezing, nasal pain, blood coming from the nose, a diminished appetite, a swollen nose, and mucus, blood, or pus-ridden discharge from the dog's nose. There may also be discoloration of the skin on the nose., Disseminated aspergillosis is a form of the infection that is not limited to the nasal area. A dog with a disseminated form of the infection may have spinal pain or tenderness of the feet, a fever, loss of body weight, vomiting, or even anorexia., If you recognize any of the above symptoms and suspect your dog may have an aspergillosis infection, it is important that you get him or her diagnosed as soon as possible. A veterinarian can perform a radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan to diagnose a nasal infection. They may also try rhinoscopy, which uses a camera to look inside the nasal cavity. Alternatively, the vet may perform a biopsy of tissue or look at discharge to try and see aspergillus organisms or perform a blood test to look for aspergillus antibodies.

, Oral anti-fungal medications to treat aspergillosis are available, and have some degree of success against aspergillosis. These medications absorb through the stomach and spread throughout the body via the bloodstream to treat the infection. One such medication is itraconazole.Anti-fungals are not highly effective against aspergillosis, because they fail to get enough active drug into the fungal plaques to kill them. This is because the fungus grows in the skull chambers and the only way for the drug to contact the fungus is via the blood supply to the nose.
In some dogs, itraconazole causes vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. In rare cases, it can cause reactions including severe skin ulceration and liver failure.
Itraconazole should not be given to pregnant dogs because it can cause fetal abnormalities and unintended abortion.
The dose of itraconazole is 10mg/kg by mouth for several months, or indefinitely. It is available as an oral suspension or as 100mg capsules.
A typical 30kg Labrador requires three 100mg capsules once a day with food.
Some dogs need treatment for 3 years before therapy is finished.
Make sure you have a clear idea of the potential costs before starting treatment. Itraconazole is an expensive medication. Your vet can give you an estimate o.
The capsules are best given with food since this increases the drug's absorption into the blood stream; however, the oral suspension should be given on an empty stomach., Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal that works by disrupting the fungal cell membranes so they leak and the cell contents seep out. However, the results of ketoconazole used alone as a treatment for aspergillosis has been disappointing.Ketoconazole is broken down by the liver and can cause liver damage in some cases.
Luckily, this damage is reversible if treatment is stopped, so it is important to monitor your dog's liver function regularly.
Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, and coat color change.
Ketoconazole should not be given to pregnant dogs because it can cause fetal abnormalities.
Ketoconazole is best given with food because this increases absorption and decreases side effects.
It is available as 200mg tablets and a 100mg/5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) oral suspension.
The dose against aspergillosis is up to 40mg/kg/day, and should be used in conjunction with amphotericin B.
A 30 kg Labrador requires a dose of 2 by 200mg tablets, 3 times a day.

, Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication. This medication is very effective in treating fungal infections of all kinds, even those that have become systemic in nature. However, Amphotericin B can cause kidney damage and, as a result, it has been largely replaced by newer anti-fungal drugs.Nevertheless, it may prove effective in treating your dog's aspergillosis, particularly by using its newer formulations.


The powder is reconstituted and dissolved in 5 – 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of 5% dextrose solution and given intravenously 3 times a week.
The dose of amphotericin B is 0.25-1mg/kg.
The reconstituted powder contains 5mg/ml of amphotericin B and so a 30 kg Labrador requires between 1.5 milliliters (0.05  fl oz) and 6 milliliters (0.20  fl oz) to be added to the 5% dextrose solution.
It is recommended to start at this dose rate to see if your dog tolerates the drug.
Because Amphotericin B can cause renal failure, renal function should be checked prior to each treatment.
The dose should be gradually increased to a total dose per treatment of 4-8mg/kg. This may be required for several months, and in combination with another antifungal such as ketoconazole.

, A veterinary surgeon can use a curette to scrape tissue from the nose to achieve a more promising outcome. At the same time, the doctor will likely use liquid and/or cream clotrimazole to fight the infection.Curettage requires a general anesthetic to place drains into the dog's skull.
The infected skull chamber is then flooded with antifungal, ensuring direct contact with the fungal plaques.
The antifungal is allowed to soak in for at least an hour, before being drained. During this time, the dog is kept anesthetized, so there is an additional cost associated with a prolonged anesthetic.

, The drug of choice to use during the curettage process is 1% clotrimazole.


Your dog will be put under anesthetic, and his nose will be plugged with Foley catheters (soft rubber tubes with an inflatable balloon at the tip).

This makes sure that the clotrimazole does not dribble out through the nostrils during the procedure. Then, small catheters are surgically placed into the nasal cavity by drilling small holes in the bone of the nose.
50-60ml of clotrimazole is infused into the nose.
Your dog's position is changed every 15 minutes so that each part of the nose comes into contact with the treatment. After an hour, the Foley catheters are deflated, removed, and the clotrimazole is drained from the nose.
This therapy has an 85-95% success rate with a single treatment.


The nasal discharge usually resolves within 7 – 14 days and rhinoscopy (inserting a camera up the nose) can confirm the absence of fungal plaques.
If plaques are still present then a second treatment 1 month after the first usually ensures success."

Signs of this type of cancer aren't always obvious, but you may notice your dog is limping or that it has swelling in one of its legs. You may also notice signs of pain, such as an unwillingness to walk very far., Your vet is likely to perform a rectal exam on your dog. The point of this exam is to make sure the tumor or cancer isn't originating elsewhere and to check if it has spread to a regional lymph node. The vet will basically be feeling and visually checking for another tumor., Your vet will likely need to take x-rays of your dog before moving ahead with treatment. X-rays will give your vet an idea of how big the tumor is, as well as how far the cancer has spread. That way, the vet can devise the best form of treatment for your dog.Mostly, your vet will be looking at your dog's back and legs plus x-ray his chest to see if there is any spread and to see exactly where the cancer is.
If your vet finds something, they may order a CAT scan to view the area better., A biopsy is where they draw part of the tumor up with a needle. A biopsy just means they are taking a tissue sample of some sort so they can take a better look. The vet can then send it for testing to help determine what type of cancer your dog has., Your vet may order other tests if they're needed. For instance, they may take a blood sample before doing an x-ray. The blood test tells your vet if cancer is likely. They'll look at the blood cell counts, for example., Surgery is one of the main options for treating osteosarcoma. It's a good option because it provides pain relief, while at the same time, letting your dog still have a good quality of life.The first choice is always a limb-sparing surgery. However, that's often not an option. The tumor is usually not small enough, for one, plus there are risks of infection and the tumor coming back.Limb-sparing surgeries are more likely to have complications than amputation., While it's hard to think about, amputation of the limb may be the best option for giving your dog a good life. Most dogs do just fine with only three legs, and the surgery removes some of the cancer, as well as reduces pain., After surgery, your dog will need to have chemotherapy to keep the cancer from spreading, if that's what you decide to do. The main forms of chemotherapy that are used for this cancer are carboplatin and cisplatin. However, doxorubicin may also be an option.Of the two options, cisplatin is cheaper. However, carboplatin is generally safer for the dog.
One reason chemotherapy is important is the cancer will spread to the lungs if it's not treated.Chemotherapy alone without surgery will not provide any benefits to your dog. Also, alternative therapies are not likely to help., If you can't afford surgery and chemotherapy or it's not a good option for you dog, you should try to reduce the pain your dog is in. One option is radiation therapy. It won't treat the cancer itself. However, it will make your dog much more comfortable.However, with this treatment, dogs can also develop fractured bones from the cancer., Physical therapy can help after surgery to make your dog's quality of life better. You would use physical therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy. Massage therapy is also an option., About half the dogs who develop this disease only survive a year after treatment. Others may live as long as 5 to 6 years, though older dogs are actually more likely to live longer than younger dogs., One final option, as your dog gets sicker, is euthanasia. Of course, you don't want to say goodbye to your beloved family pet. However, even with treatment, you will likely need to euthanize your dog eventually because of this disease. It tends to spread over time. That doesn't mean you need to euthanize your dog as soon as it's diagnosed. Rather, you just need to be watching for signs that it's getting worse, such as being lethargic, not wanting to eat, whining because of pain, or not wanting to move."

Take your dog to the vet.",How to Clip Dog Nails," You have a couple of options. One type looks like a pair of scissors and works in the same way. You place the nail between the blades and squeeze the handles together. The other kind is a guillotine-style that has a hole where the nail is placed. A blade slides up and cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles.Both types work well, but it may be hard to trim the very thick nails of some large dogs using the guillotine-style clippers.;
, Have a styptic powder ready to stop the bleeding if you accidentally cut the nail too short and into the quick. Have treats ready to offer and give extra attention to reward your dog for cooperating both during and after the trimming. This can help to make this and future sessions a success.Though you should always try your best to avoid cutting the nails too short, even the most experienced professionals will sometimes cut a nail too close.

, Try to start the trimming sessions when your dog is relaxed and in a comfortable place. A good time might be after a meal or after he's tired from exercising or playing. Your dog will probably be too worn out to wiggle or struggle.

, Talk in a calm and quiet voice to help him keep calm. If he's never had his nails trimmed, gradually get him used to having his feet handled. Sit with him a few times a day, for a few minutes, and gently rub his legs and feet. Once he seems comfortable with you touching and handling his feet you can begin touching the clippers to his nails.


Use treats as rewards during these sessions to help your dog get comfortable with clipping., Identify the quick of the nail. It contains a blood vessel and a nerve, so avoid cutting it. If your dog has white, clear, or light colored nails then it may be easy to see the quick. It will look like a small, pink tube that runs inside the nail center and ends before the tip. With black or dark colored nails you will not be able to see the quick and will have to rely on other methods. Even if you can see the quick, it may extend further than it appears.Always start by cutting less of the nail than you think you can. You can always cut more later, but cutting too much is painful, can cause bleeding, and will make your dog reluctant to have the rest of his nails trimmed.

, Do this in a position that lets your hand face the same direction as the paw, toward the front of the dog. Gently wrap your fingers under the pads and use your thumb to stabilize along the top of the digit that you're working on.This position works best for front paws.


Try not to hold the foot between the pads since many dogs find this ticklish and involuntarily jerk.

, You'll have an easier time if you lay your dog on his side. Place him on a table so that you don't have to bend and restrain the dog. Place your arms across his body so you can grasp the back foot and clip.You may not need to do much more to restrain a small dog. But, you may want to use your body to help secure a larger dog. If your bigger dog tries to stand, lean your torso over the dog's body and keep one of your arms over his neck., You will see that the bottom of the nail is relatively straight until it curves closer to the tip. Using the clippers, cut off the tip of the nail by continuing that straight line, avoiding the quick. Be sure where the actual blade will be cutting the nail. Some clippers may slightly hide the blade and make it seem like you are trimming less than you actually are.Always cut from top to bottom and not side to side to avoid splitting the nail. Also, try to cut perpendicular to the nail, avoiding extreme angles.

, Hold the digit being trimmed and cut only a very thin shaving off the nail at the tip. Keep removing small slices of the nail until the nail is the desired length or until you start to see an oval shape on the cut surface. This is the sign to stop cutting because you are getting close to the quick.If your dog has dewclaws, be sure to cut them as well. These are the nails that are located higher up and on the inside of the leg. They may need to be trimmed more frequently than the other nails because they don't get any wear from contact when the dog walks.

, Accidents happen and you may cut the quick of the nail. If you do, stay calm and gently talk to your dog. Give him a treat right away to distract and pacify him.It will be easier to calm your pet if you already have him in a good position when starting out. Keep your dog in place by standing over him and draping your arms over his body. This may keep him from squirming away if you accidentally cut the quick.If your dog acts angry or aggressive when getting his nails clipped, you may just want to take him to the veterinarian for professional clipping.

, Once trimmed, the nails will be rough along the edges. You can use a nail file to smooth these after clipping.Some dogs may not need any or all of their nails trimmed because they will keep them worn down from their normal activity.

, Your dog may instinctively pull away as you cut the nail. Quickly and calmly reassure him that this is what he should expect to happen. Using a treat can help with this. Dogs learn by our lead and if you reassure them and proceed to the next nail as matter-of-factly as possible, they will take their cue from you.Depending on your dog, you may only be able to trim a few nails before needing to give him a break. Each session, try trimming more nails than the last and eventually you will be able to trim them all in one sitting.

, Remain calm and confident, but ready to treat any problems when trimming your dog's nails. If you happen to hit the quick of a nail and the nail starts to bleed, don't let your dog to wrench away from you and run around. This will help limit the pain and further damage to the nail. You can also calm your dog and control the bleeding.

, Apply styptic powder to the area as quickly as possible. Keep hold of the paw and press the powder onto the end of the nail until the bleeding stops. You may have to keep packing the powder onto the nail for several minutes, but the longer you are able to apply steady pressure the more effectively you will stop the bleeding.If you don’t have styptic powder you can use cornstarch, flour, or even a bar of soap.

, Try to keep him quiet and calm. Give treats to distract and calm him. Prevent him from walking around or running for the next 15 minutes. This will help keep the nail from bleeding again and will also help to prevent further damage and mess.Comfort your dog so that he continues to trust you and won't have negative associations with nail clipping.

, In the future,use a grinder, an electric tool that files the nail down instead of cutting it. This avoids the sharp edges and split nails that can occur when trimming. Some dogs prefer this, while others are resistant to the vibrations and noise made by these types of devices.When using a grinder you have to be careful not to come in contact with pads. This can cause cuts or irritations, be very painful, and make your dog reluctant to allow this procedure in the future. Injuries to the pads can also be very slow in healing.

, If you do not have any styptic powder on hand or you are worried that you cannot properly cut the nail, let a vet or a groomer take care of the clipping. Dogs with darker nails will be very hard to clip and it's best left to someone confident and able to treat the dog if there is a problem.If you still want to try to clip your dog's nails, many vets, vet techs, and groomers will be glad to show you the proper way to trim nails.

Manage your dog's pain.",How to Help a Female Dog Who Is Injured Urinate2," If the dog is unable to get up, then she may accidentally soil herself. To keep her as clean and comfortable as possible, make sure she is lying on a well-padded bed. VetBed is ideal, as it wicks moisture away from the dog, so if she has an accident the urine is absorbed away from her body.Another alternative is to lie her on puppy training pads, as these absorb the urine and there is less of it to irritate her skin.

, Try not to leave your dog lying in urine for more than a few minutes. She will also appreciate a blanket bath, where you wash her back end with water to remove urine from her coat and skin. Not only will this keep her smelling sweet but it reduces the chances of infected skin because of urine scald and secondary infections., This may be necessary either to encourage a bed-bound dog to toilet at a convenient time so that you can clean up after, or if she has nerve damage that makes it difficult for her to pee. Never try to express a dog's bladder until you have been shown how to do this by a vet. This is because squeezing in the wrong place or applying too much pressure could cause serious damage such as rupturing an organ or bursting her bladder., The idea behind the technique is to apply gentle pressure to the bladder so that the resistance from the valve that stops the bladder leaking urine is overcome. The first skill to learn is locating the bladder. This is located at the back of her belly lying along the body wall. In small dogs feel for it with one hand, forming a 'C' shape with your thumb and fingers and placing them either side of the belly. With large dogs it takes two hands, one of either side of the body wall. Press gently inwards until you feel something that feels like a grapefruit.Now squeeze evenly across the bladder, Avoid using your fingertips, as this puts a lot of pressure in localized spots. Instead use the flats of your fingers (small dogs) or your palms (large dogs).
Apply ever increasing pressure until you see a stream of urine passing from the dog's vulva.Never apply more than moderate pressure or the level of pressure as demonstrated by the vet. If you have to exert severe pressure the dog either doesn't need to go, you are in the wrong place, or the dog has a problem which renders her unable to pee. Immediately stop, and contact your vet for advice., It is important to express the bladder regularly, typically two to four times a day. Follow your vet's advise about the frequency this should be done.

, A female dog with a back, pelvic or limb injury will be in pain. This pain will discourage her from wanting to move around and may inhibit her from being able to squat to go to the bathroom. No animal should be knowing left in pain, so alongside the mobility issue it is important she has adequate pain relief administered. Your veterinarian should prescribe pain relief. If the level of pain relief is appropriate the female dog will be better able to move around, and either squat to urinate by herself or accept assistance to urinate.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used, such as Metacam (meloxicam), Rimadyl (carprofen), Onsior (robenacoxib). There drugs have a high safety margin when given with food, but should never be given on an empty stomach, as they can cause gastric ulceration.Always follow the instructions and dose given by your veterinarian closely. If the dog does not eat, or has sickness or diarrhea, then do not give the medication. NSAIDs are most effective against mild to moderate pain.
Broken bones are often extremely painful and so the dog may need a stronger painkiller. If the dog is already on a NSAID then another drug in combination often gives sufficient pain relief to help the dog be more mobile. A common addition is tramadol, as this is safe alongside an NSAID and give opioid strength pain relief.If the dog is in severe pain then she may be prescribed a fentanyl patch. Fentanyl patches are stuck onto the skin for slow release pain relief. They are most commonly used in veterinary hospitals, rather than in private homes. However, some vets will allow a pet home wearing one, under close supervision from clients they know and trust. Vigilance is crucial when using fentanyl patches, as the dog could potentially overdose if they chew and swallow a patch."

Start your dog on an ‘induction’ dose.,
Have your vet perform a blood test.,
Begin long term mitotane treatment.,
Monitor your dog for side effects.,
Wait for symptoms to improve.,
Take your dog to your vet regularly.",How to Treat a Dog with Cushing's Disease1," Mitotane is an oral drug used to treat pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease (caused by a pituitary tumor). Initially, your vet will prescribe an induction mitotane dose. This is a high dose that will cause enough adrenal gland damage to bring cortisol levels back to normal and start improving disease symptoms.You will give the induction dose once or twice daily for one to two weeks.Dogs with Cushing’s disease drink a lot of water and eat a lot. During the induction treatment with mitotane, your dog’s appetite and water intake will likely start going back to normal.Mitotane is more effectively absorbed by the body with food, so feed your dog when you give each dose.;
, After the induction period, your vet will perform a blood test called an ACTH stimulation test. This test, which measures blood cortisol levels, is a way to determine whether the medication to treat Cushing’s disease is working. On the test, your vet will look for decreased blood cortisol levels, indicating the adrenals are working normally again.ACTH is a hormone released by the pituitary gland that stimulates adrenal cortisol release., Mitotane treatment is lifelong. Long term mitotane treatment is usually once or twice weekly.Unfortunately, for some dogs, Cushing’s disease symptoms come back during long term mitotane treatment. If this happens to your dog, it will need to go back to daily mitotane.To keep the symptoms under control, your vet may need to increase the mitotane dose over time.Mitotane is fairly inexpensive, compared with other Cushing’s disease treatments., A major disadvantage of mitotane is the serious side effects, including GI problems (vomiting, anorexia) and neurologic problems (weakness, seizures, uncoordinated walking). These side effects are usually due to excessive adrenal gland damage, causing cortisol levels to drop too low.If you see these side effects, contact your vet immediately. Your vet may need to stop mitotane treatment and start your dog on prednisone., With mitotane treatment, your dog will start eating and drinking normally again fairly quickly (possibly during the induction period). Hair loss, which is another common sign of Cushing’s disease, will take longer to improve. Overall, it will take about four to six months before your dog’s symptoms completely improve with mitotane treatment., Mitotane treatment requires very close monitoring by you and your vet. You will need to watch for side effects at home and your vet will need to monitor your dog’s blood cortisol levels. Your vet will recommend bringing your dog in about every three to four months for an ACTH stimulation test.At these visits, your vet may decide to adjust the mitotane dosage.

Add another layer of nail polish.",How to Put Nail Polish on Your Dog's Nails," He won't need to know any fancy commands, but he will need to know how to sit and stay for several minutes.;
, You should never paint your dog's nails if he isn't accustomed to being groomed, particularly to having his nails trimmed. You need to get him comfortable with the idea of you handling his paws before you start painting his nails.Always try to make grooming a good experience for your dog. Give him lots of treats to encourage good behavior. This will also help him associate getting groomed and having his nails painted with delicious treats, so he might even look forward to it!
If you have never cut your dog's nails before, start by simply handling each paw and looking at it for a minute. When he's comfortable with that, you can progress to clipping, and then to painting.
Start with just a few minutes of grooming. When your dog starts looking very uncomfortable, let him go. The next grooming session should last a few minutes longer. Don't start painting the dog's nails until you're confident that the dog can sit still for long enough.

, You should use nail polish specifically designed for dogs because it is less toxic than nail polish designed for humans. Dogs sometimes chew their paws, so you want to make sure your dog will not ingest anything that is potentially harmful.Find out how long the dry time is for the nail polish you will be using, and understand that you will need to get your dog to be calm for at least that long. Some dry extremely quickly and others can be used with topcoats that speed drying time. Choose carefully.
When it comes time to remove the nail polish, be sure to use nail polish remover that is designed for dogs as well.

, Make sure you paint your dog's nails in a room where he can do minimal damage if he starts to run around. You will want to avoid areas with carpets and upholstered furniture because it will be very hard, if not impossible, to get nail polish off of these surfaces.


A small space is probably best so your dog won't be able to go far if he gets away.
Consider laying an old towel or blanket on the floor for your dog to stand on, but make sure that you don't mind if it gets nail polish on it.

, Plan out what colors and patterns you want to do before you start painting.


If your dog has dark nails, you might need to use a white base coat, depending on the color you want the nails to be.If you want to do patterns, try to find dog-friendly nail polish pens, which will give you much more control than a brush. You can purchase these online, or you may be able to find them at a specialty pet store.If this is the first time you are painting your dog's nails, you might want to stick to a simple design.

, Make sure you have everything you need to paint your dog's nails in the room before you bring your dog in. You do not want to realize half way through that you forgot something in another room and have to leave your dog alone. Make sure you have the following items on hand:


All of the nail polish you plan on using
Nail polish remover, along with cotton balls, just in case you get some polish in your dog's hair
Nail clippers
Styptic powder, which will stop the bleeding if you accidentally cut your dog's nails too short
A small pair of scissors to trim excess hair
A towel to cover the floor
Lots of treats

, Try putting one arm around your dog's back and using the other hand to apply the polish.


Having a helper hold the dog for you is a good idea. Ask a sibling, friend, or someone else to help you.

, Before you start polishing, you should make sure that your dog's nails are trimmed to the appropriate length. If your dog has long hair, trim it back around the nails so you don't get nail polish in his hair.

, Dip the brush into the polish and gently stroke the nail brush over the dog's nails. Work as quickly as possible.


You may want to apply gentle pressure to the top and bottom of your dog's paw as you are painting.
For front paws, you can simply ask the dog to sit and you can hold the paw you are working on. For back paws, you may need to work with your dog standing up, or you may need to have someone hold the dog off the ground.

, Try not do anything to excite or scare your pooch as you apply the polish.

, While the nail polish is drying, you will need to keep your dog calm and prevent him from touching or licking his nails.


Try giving treats to keep your dog happy and encourage him to enjoy getting his nails painted.
If your dog is very small, you can hold him while his nails are drying.

, If necessary, apply a second coat of the same color, or use a nail polish marker to apply a design.


Your dog will need to be still once again after you apply the second coat. If you are using a topcoat, he will need to be still three times.
If your dog seems too hyper, consider giving him a break after the first coat is dry.

Watch for the warning signs.,
Go to the vet.,
Give your dog any prescribed medications.,
Start your dog on hormone therapy.",How to Help a Dog with Sleep Incontinence1," When a dog is incontinent they will often respond to their bladder leaking by licking around their genital area. The dog’s skin might appear irritated and red. You may also detect the strong odor of urine on their fur or in their bedding area. These are all indications that your dog is suffering from incontinence and needs medical attention., It is good idea to take your dog to the vet when you first notice any signs of incontinence. Your vet will perform a general inspection of your dog to determine if there are other health issues that need to be addressed as well. The vet will also ask you about your dog’s habits, such as their drinking, eating, and sleeping patterns.Especially with senior dogs, incontinence can appear alongside other conditions, like urinary tract infections or spinal injuries., Your vet might suggest a medical approach to your dog’s bowel issues. Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is one medication often used to treat incontinence directly. Other medications might focus on treating the underlying causes of bladder injuries or urine infections. If your vet suggests a drug treatment, make sure to follow their dosing directions precisely.Some vets are even using collagen injections to treat incontinent dogs., With your vet’s guidance, you may want to put your dog on a hormone regimen. This will help to balance out a deficiency that may be contributing to your dog’s loss of bowel control. After a starting period, these medications are usually given weekly.However, be aware that if your dog starts on hormone therapy then they will need to continue it throughout the rest of their life. Hormone therapy can also be quite expensive, depending on the types of medications used.
Hormone therapy is often suggested for dogs whose hormones have reduced as a result of spaying or neutering. Older pets also can see a reduction in the production of hormones to regulate the bladder."
"
Give your dog trilostane as prescribed.,
Watch your dog for trilostane’s side effects.,
Have your vet perform regular blood tests.",How to Treat a Dog with Cushing's Disease2," Trilostane is the treatment of choice for pituitary-dependent canine Cushing’s disease. It is given by mouth either once or twice daily to block adrenal cortisol production.If your vet prescribes twice-daily trilostane, you will give the drug once every 8 to 12 hours with food.Although trilostane is more expensive than mitotane, it has fewer side effects and is easier to manage.As with mitotane, your dog’s symptoms will improve with trilostane treatment.

, Trilostane commonly causes vomiting and diarrhea.Other side effects are weakness and loss of appetite. Contact your vet if you notice these symptoms in your dog. Fortunately, these side effects become more mild, or go away completely, with time or dose adjustment., Close monitoring is also required for trilostane. Your vet will perform periodic ACTH stimulation tests to determine how well trilostane is working.As your dog continues to improve, your vet will gradually decrease the trilostane dose."
"
Discuss surgical options with your vet.,
Administer medication before surgery, if needed.,
Allow your vet to perform surgery.,
Wait for symptoms to improve.",How to Treat a Dog with Cushing's Disease3," Oral medications are not very effective at treating adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease. In fact, adrenal tumors are strongly resistant to mitotane.Surgery is the only way to cure adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, as long as the adrenal tumor has not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).Surgical removal of a pituitary tumor is possible, but not commonly performed in pets, partly because it’s difficult to access the pituitary gland in pets.Adrenal tumors in dogs can metastasize.If your vet noticed metastasis on an abdominal ultrasound when diagnosing your dog, surgical treatment will not be a good treatment option.

, If your dog’s adrenal tumor has not metastasized, your vet may prescribe pre-surgical medication (trilostane or ketoconazole) to improve Cushing’s disease symptoms. You will need to give this medication for 8 to 16 weeks before surgery., To treat adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, the entire affected adrenal gland needs to be removed (‘adrenalectomy’), not just the adrenal tumor.Because an adrenalectomy can be very challenging, your vet may refer you to a board-certified veterinary surgeon for the procedure.Adrenalectomies are high-risk surgeries. Because most dogs diagnosed with Cushing’s disease are older dogs, the surgical risk may be too high for these dogs., If your vet can remove all of the adrenal tumor, your dog’s symptoms will improve completely. In fact, a successful adrenalectomy for Cushing’s disease is considered to be curative."
"
Discuss radiation therapy with your vet.,
Treat ‘iatrogenic’ Cushing’s disease.,
Consider other medication options.",How to Treat a Dog with Cushing's Disease4," Radiation therapy uses radiation (usually x-rays) to damage the DNA in cancer cells.Radiation therapy is recommended for pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, when the tumor has become so large that it’s pressing on the brain and causing neurologic signs (seizures). Fortunately, radiation therapy is very effective at treating pituitary tumors.If your dog has radiation therapy, its symptoms likely won’t disappear with treatment. However, because the radiation shrinks the tumor, your dog’s neurologic symptoms will improve.Your vet may recommend treatment with trilostane or mitotane for several months after radiation therapy., Iatrogenic Cushing’s disease develops when a dog is given corticosteroids for too long. If your dog has this type of Cushing’s disease, it will need to stop taking that steroid. However, stopping steroid treatment has to be gradual. Over time, your vet will decrease the steroid dosage until your dog is no longer on the drug.Your vet may want to perform monthly ACTH stimulation tests to determine when to stop the steroid treatment.Eventually, your dog’s pituitary and adrenal glands will start working normally again., Although trilostane and mitotane are the top two medications to treat canine Cushing’s disease, other medications are available. For example, ketoconazole, which is an antifungal medication, blocks cortisol production. It is recommended for dogs that either can’t tolerate or don’t respond to trilostane or mitotane. Ketoconazole is very expensive.Anipryl controls dopamine levels in the brain. When dopamine levels are high, the pituitary gland will stop sending ACTH to the adrenals. The overall effect will be decreased cortisol levels.These medications may be effective for your dog. Talk with your vet about using them to treat your dog’s Cushing’s disease.

Create a peaceful sleeping environment.,
Place clean blankets in the bedding area.,
Place waterproof pads under the bedding.,
Set up your dog’s bedding on a cleanable floor.,
Take your dog for an end-of-evening walk.,
Express your dog’s bowel before bedtime.,
Put diapers on your dog.",How to Help a Dog with Sleep Incontinence2," Some dogs lose control of their bladders or bowels as a result of extreme emotions, such as excitement or agitation. Place your dog’s bedding in an area that is quiet and dark. It is best if the bed space is out of the way, so that the dog will feel safe sleeping without worrying about being bumped into or jostled.If your dog is showing signs of submission while in bed, such as rolling over, then you may need to rethink the bed’s location. The same goes if your dog is acting agitated while lying in their bed.

, Use bedding materials that you are comfortable washing many times, as that is what you will need to do. Every time the blankets are soiled, remove them and wash them with an enzymatic cleaner. This is a cleaner designed to remove odors and waste. Then, replace the soiled linens with fresh ones.You can find pet-specific enzymatic detergents and sprays at most pet stores.

, You can either place a washable crib mattress cover over all of your dog’s blankets or place a layer of disposable dog pee pads, or adult incontinence pads, under a thin layer of blankets. The mattress cover and pads will absorb some of the urine, keeping at least some of the blankets clean.If your dog tends to sleep walk and urinate near the door, it may be a good idea to place some pee pads in that location as well. There are non-slip ones available for this type of situation.

, Try to place your dog’s bed on a tile or hardwood floor. This will make it easier to clean up day after day. Avoid carpet as much as you can as it tends to soak up odors and can quickly become rather smelly and stained.If you must use a carpeted space for your dog’s sleeping area, consider adding a rug underneath the pallet. You can then wash the rug as needed and hopefully save your carpet.

, Some dogs need to be reminded to use the restroom and taking quick trips outside is one of the best ways of doing so. Keep a routine where you and your dog hit the pavement early in the morning, in the middle of the day, and right before bedtime, at least., It is very important that you talk with your vet about how to do this both safely and comfortably for your pet. Expressing your dog’s bowels essentially involves stimulating the urge to use the restroom on demand. You will then need to clean up the mess left behind, but it can often prevent overnight accidents., Pet stores carry doggy diapers that can fit animals in a variety of weight ranges. These diapers are often cloth with a liner or pad insert. You can also buy human disposable diapers and then modify them to fit your dog by folding the sides and cutting a tail hole. Boys’ or girls underwear can work as a make-shift diaper as well, just make sure to insert a pad and account for your dog’s tail.Make sure to change your dog’s diaper every two hours or so, or whenever you know it is soiled. Failing to regularly change their diaper could lead to your dog developing a rash or urine scalding.
Be aware that not all dogs like to wear diapers and many will try to claw them off. You might want to test the waters with a cheap disposable pair.

Follow a weight management plan for your dog.,
Clean your dog’s groin area regularly.,
Trim your dog’s fur short around the crotch area.,
Be patient.",How to Help a Dog with Sleep Incontinence3," Talk with your vet about customizing a diet for your dog that will aid in digestion. This, in turn, will make it easier for your dog to eliminate waste on a schedule. You may need to add ingredients, such as fish oil and soy, to your dog’s diet. Supplements, like psyllium, are also known to reduce diarrhea in canines., You can also investigate homeopathic options for your dog, including boiling 1 tablespoon of corn silk herb into 2 cups of boiling water, thus making corn silk tea. You then spoon-feed your dog 1 teaspoon of tea per 20 pounds of body weight. You do this twice a day.Corn silk is believed to help the bladder by reducing inflammation.
Make sure to check with your vet before making any alterations to your dog’s diet.

, Some dogs are incontinent as a complication connected with obesity. Work with your vet to determine a nutritional plan that will gradually reduce the calories ingested by your dog. Combine this with additional exercise, if you can., Use a baby wipe or a warm wash cloth to wipe down your dog’s upper thigh and genital areas after each accident. This is especially important to do with an older dog who may not be able to clean itself. You can also apply an anti-inflammatory cream to irritated areas.This extra care will help to prevent urine scalding, where a dog’s urine literally burns its skin. Regular cleanings can also make it less likely that your dog will suffer from a secondary bladder infection., Get a pair of pet safety trimmers or take your dog to the groomer and ask them to remove the fur around your dog’s upper thighs and genitals. This will need to be done very carefully in order to avoid nicking the skin. Repeat this process regularly and it will keep your dog cleaner and reduce the odds of infection., The endless cycle of cleaning and caring for your dog can wear on you over time. However, remember those reasons why you love your dog and practice patience. If you get frustrated, leave the room and count to five. Ask others in your family to help pitch in as well. Remember that your dog wants to get well too."

To make the process a little easier for the both of you, get the urine sample when you know your dog’s bladder is going to be full, such as first thing in the morning or when you get home from work.A urine sample collected first thing in the morning is usually the most accurate.You can also try collecting a sample after a meal, or on your normal walk when there are interesting smells to sniff and your dog wants to mark its territory.;
, Your vet may give you a small plastic container to collect your male dog’s urine.If not, choose a plastic, leak-proof container that you have at home. Container options include:


Shallow bowlDisposable food storage container, like Tupperware®Empty margarine tubEmpty cream cheese container, To prevent dust or leftover food from contaminating your male dog’s urine, wash the container with hot, soapy water. Allow the container to dry completely before using it to get the urine sample., Once you’re outside, your male dog may become suspicious and try to get away if it sees the container in your hand. To prevent your dog from getting away, put it on a leash when going outside.Preferably, use a non-retractable leash.If you have a backyard, walk your dog to where it usually urinates.Your dog’s scent will already be there, so it will know that’s where it should urinate.

, Depending on how full your dog’s bladder is, your dog may want to urinate almost as soon as it gets outside. Pay close attention to your dog so you can be ready to collect the urine when your dog lifts its leg.


If it looks like your dog is going to lift its right back leg, stand on your dog’s right. If you think your dog will lift its left back leg, stand on the left side.
Stand slightly to the back of your dog.

, When your dog lifts its leg, gently and swiftly place the container in the urine stream.Do not make sudden movements, or you may alarm your dog. Move the container away once your dog finishes urinating.


You may get a little urine on your hand that’s holding the container. If you don’t want to get urine on your hand, consider wearing a rubber glove.
To keep your hand from getting urine on it, you could also make a handle by taping a ruler to the outside of the container., When you have collected the urine, you will need to cover the container so the urine doesn’t spill out or get contaminated.The best seal will be the lid that goes with the container. If you do not have the matching lid, tightly cover the container with a few layers of plastic wrap.


If you use plastic wrap to cover the container, keep the plastic wrap in place with a rubber band.
If any urine got on the side of the container, wipe it off with a dry paper towel.
Wash your hands with warm, soapy water before and after sealing the container.

, A urinalysis will be most accurate when the urine sample is fresh (collected no more than a few hours beforehand).After the container with the urine sample is securely sealed, place it in a bag and put your dog’s name on the bag. Then, take the container to your vet’s office.

, If you can’t drop off the urine sample soon after collecting it, you will need to keep it cool until you have time to drive to your vet’s office. Options for cool storage of urine are a refrigerator or a cooler with ice.If you choose to store the urine sample in your fridge, place the container with the sample in a plastic bag to prevent any urine from contaminating the fridge.Storing your dog’s urine in your fridge may make you uncomfortable. If so, store the sample in a cooler.
Do not store the urine for more than 12 hours. After 12 hours, the urine sample will no longer be fresh enough to use for a urinalysis., You might have an easier time getting the urine sample from your male dog if you have some help.Ask a friend or family member to either walk your dog or position the container in the urine stream.

, If you’re not able to get a urine sample, don’t worry. Simply contact your vet and let them know.They can give you extra guidance or suggest having their staff collect the sample for you.

, If you choose to have the urine sample collected at the vet's office, one of the staff members will take your male dog outside to get a sample when you arrive. If that’s unsuccessful, the staff may use another method, called cystocentesis, to collect some urine.


To perform a cystocentesis, several staff members will place your dog on its back while another staff member carefully inserts a clean needle directly into your dog’s bladder and draws up the urine."

Know the complications that can happen when a dog can't urinate properly.,
Consider the commitment involved.,
Understand your dog's urinary system.,
Get instruction from your veterinarian.Have your vet give you a demo first, so that you know the correct pressure to apply.",How to Express a Paralyzed Dog's Bladder1," Possible medical issues that can arise in a dog that can't urinate include urinary tract infections and urine scalding, in which the shin is burned by long term contact with urine.An overflowing or leaking bladder is an invitation to urinary infections, which, if not treated, can lead to lethal complications.
It is also important not to allow bladders to overflow because this can lead to loss of bladder tone. Then, when a dog might recover its bladder control, the bladder will not function correctly.;
, Deciding to help your dog urinate is a major commitment. You will have to do it about 4-6 times a day.


Luckily it only takes about 10 - 20 seconds each time. Still, many vets do not encourage people to try expressing their dog's bladder because it takes such an intense commitment. Unfortunately, the main option other than manually emptying a dog's bladder is to euthanize the dog.

, With the bladder, you have to empty it often or the dog will become poisoned by its urine. Urine will not come out by itself; it will only overflow what the bladder CANNOT contain as more urine flows into the bladder from the kidneys. The rest stays put. That's one reason why disabled dogs are so prone to urinary tract infections.


What about the poop? The poop is really different from the pee. The poop will come out on its own, without your helping, eventually. There's no risk of it staying inside and causing infection.

, If necessary, the next day go back and express under supervision of the vet or his vet tech to make sure you have gotten all the urine out of your dog's bladder.

Make sure that your dog always has access to fresh, clean water.,
Give your dog the right amount of water every day.,
Add water to your dog's food if he is not drinking enough water.,
Allow your dog to go potty often.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones in Dogs1," Water helps to dilute your dog’s urine, which keeps the minerals in the urine suspended in fluid. Drinking enough water also makes your dog urinate on a regular schedule, which helps to flush the minerals in the urine from your dog’s body.Change your dog’s water every day and clean his bowl a few times a week to minimize bacteria.;
, The amount of water a dog needs every day is related to its body weight. A dog needs about an ounce of water per pound of body weight per day.For example, an 8 pound dog will need a cup of water per day and an eighty pound dog will need 10 cups of water a day.


Keep in mind that if your dog is physically active, pregnant, or nursing, then he will need more water.
Provide extra water in hot weather. Provide your dog with a reliable source of clean, fresh water at all times, especially during hot weather.
Provide unfrozen water in cold weather. Dogs cannot obtain the amount of water they need from eating snow or ice. In fact, eating snow and ice requires more body energy to melt the snow/ice which makes the dog’s body require even more water.

, If your dog is a fussy drinker or you don’t think he is consuming enough water during the day, you can try adding warm water to your dog’s food until it reaches a stew-like consistency. You can also add wet canned foods to your dog to get more water in his system.Just make sure that you provide fresh, clean water for your dog, even if you are feeding your dog a wetter food.

, A healthy adult dog must have the opportunity to relieve itself of urine every 6-8 hours.Smaller dogs, puppies, or dogs with medical problems of the urinary tract will need to urinate more often, at least every 4 hours.


If you are cannot take your dog out as often as he needs to be, you may want to consider installing a doggy door so that your dog can access an enclosed back yard, training your dog to use potty training pads in the house, or hiring a dog walker to walk your dog a few times a day.
About once per week, observe your dog as it urinates. If the urine is a dilute yellow color, then his urine is normal. If your dog’s urine is brown or red and/or if your dog has trouble urinating, then you should contact your dog’s veterinarian right away.

Squat in front of the toilet, holding the dog with its backside over the bowl, and its body resting on your left leg or knee.,
Stabilize the dog with your left hand.,
Cup your fingers as though you were going to pick up a lemon, under her abdomen.,
Squeeze gently, pushing slightly toward the back of the dog.,
Ensure that you have emptied the bladder completely.",How to Express a Paralyzed Dog's Bladder2," In this position the dog's head will be looking behind you.


You can also do this outside over grass, but it will probably be more convenient for you to simply take your pup into the bathroom.

, Then reach under her body with your right.

, Feel around for something that has the dimensions of a lemon and the consistency of a water balloon., It takes some practice, but the hardest part is learning the ""feel"" of the bladder.


This is the part that you veterinarian will be most helpful at explaining or demonstrating.
Your dog may lift their tail when you have found the right spot., When the urine stream goes from a stream to a trickle, the bladder is fully expressed.The bladder will feel ""flat"" once it is totally empty. It should take less than a minute for the whole bladder to empty.

Take your dog outside.,
Hold the dog in your left arm, in horizontal position, with its hindquarters resting on your left leg.,
Reach under the dog with you right hand.,
Squeeze gently.",How to Express a Paralyzed Dog's Bladder3," With a male dog, the aim is harder, so emptying his bladder into the toilet would be more difficult. You can stand or squat with the dog.

, Your left hand should be supporting the dog around his rib cage.

, You should feel above the base of his genitals for the bladder. Sometimes it is quite high up in the body.

, The urine must make a right angle turn through the urethra, so don't worry about squeezing toward any direction. Again, continue squeezing until the bladder is flat.

Choose a high-quality commercial dog food.,
Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for food.,
Talk to a pet nutrition expert if you make your dog’s food from scratch.,
Consider urinary tract health supplements.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones in Dogs2," Look for brands that list meat (not meat by-products) as the top ingredients on the labels or ask your veterinarian for advice. While it is not necessary to put your dog on a special diet to prevent kidney stones, you should still feed your dog a food that meets all of his nutritional needs. These needs will depend on your dog’s breed, age, and other factors.Talk to your veterinarian if you are not sure how to choose a food for your dog.

, If your dog is prone to urinary tract infections or has been diagnosed with kidney stones in the past, then you will need to follow your veterinarian’s food recommendations for your dog. Your veterinarian will recommend a special diet (including special treats) to help prevent a reoccurrence of kidney stones.Foods that are high in calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and protein can cause kidney stones due to high mineral and protein content in the urine. In dogs susceptible to kidney stone formation, foods that are lower in these nutrients (while still providing adequate amounts) can help to prevent the formation of kidney stones and may even help to dissolve very small stones.
There are many types of kidney stones. The most common ones are struvites (made up of magnesium-ammonium-phosphorus); calcium oxalate (made up of calcium) and uric acid stones (the type Dalmatians are prone to get.) There can also be mixed types. By analyzing your dog’s urine, your veterinarian can determine which type of kidney stone your dog has and which food would be most appropriate for your dog to eat.

, If you feed a home-made diet to your dog, speak with a pet nutrition expert to make sure the vitamin and mineral levels in the diet are balanced. A mineral imbalance (especially calcium and phosphorus) can cause kidney problems for your dog.Your veterinarian may also be able to advise you on how to meet all of your dog’s nutritional needs with a home-made diet.

, There are supplements that you can give your dog to help with urinary tract health. These include cranberry extracts, which are known to be beneficial for urinary tract health. Cranberries help prevent bacteria in the urine from latching onto the urinary tract lining.These supplements are available in pill, capsule, or a chewable form to supplement your dog’s regular diet. If your dog has a medical condition, ask your veterinarian before giving any supplement to your dog.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of kidney stones.,
Understand how kidney stones form.,
Learn about the effects of kidney stones.,
Keep in mind that some breeds are more likely to get kidney stones.,
Understand the common treatments for kidney stones.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones in Dogs3," In some cases, there are no obvious signs that a dog has a kidney stone. Kidney stones might be found during an x-ray or ultrasound for another condition in the affected dog. In other cases, there are certain clues or signs that might make a veterinarian suspicious that a dog has a kidney stone. These include:Blood in the urine
Frequent urination and increased drinking
Recurring urinary tract infections
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Weight loss
Difficulty urinating
Lack of energy
Painful belly

, Kidney stones are the result of minerals found in the urine. The kidney is the urine formation organ in the body. In some cases, as the urine forms the minerals which should dissolve in the urine do not dissolve. Instead, they start forming into stones.


These stones can be microscopic or large enough to fill cavities in the kidney. Regardless of size these are not normal and can potentially damage the kidneys., Kidney stones can block your dog's urine flow and cause his kidneys to swell if the stone is too large. A blockage may result in serious illness and even death, so it is crucial to contact your veterinarian right away if you suspect that your dog has a kidney stone.Kidney stones may also lodge in the bladder or start to form in the bladder itself. This process is more common and some dogs’ bladders may fill completely with stones. No matter where a stone forms, it will cause infection and on-going damage to the kidney or bladder.

, Certain dog breeds are more susceptible to kidney stones than others. It is good to know if your dog is one of these breeds so that you can check for symptoms more often.Lhasa Apsos, Yorkshire Terriers, and Miniature Poodles are more susceptible to kidney stones made of calcium and oxalic acid
Dalmatians, Yorkshire Terriers, and English Bulldogs. are more susceptible to kidney stones made of uric acid.

, If you think that your dog has a kidney stone, you will need to take him to the veterinarian as soon as possible. Do not wait or the stones may become much worse. Treatments for kidney stones vary depending on the severity of the stones. Treatments may include medication, dietary changes, and even surgery.Keep in mind that if your dog requires surgery, then he may need to be hospitalized until he recovers from the surgery.

When the bladder lining becomes inflamed it is prone to bleeding. This blood collects in the bladder and is passed out when the dog urinates.Stones that are smaller than the diameter of the urethra should pass out with no problems. Likewise, stones that are larger than the urethral diameter are too big to enter and hence cannot become stuck.;
, An inflamed bladder has a weakened lining that is more vulnerable to infection. Many dogs with bladder stones get repeated urinary infections.


Although antibiotics clear the infection, if the underlying cause - the trauma to the bladder lining - is still present, then the infection is likely to recur.

, Inflammation affects not only the mucus membrane lining the bladder, but the nerves in the bladder wall. The inflamed nerves send an incorrect message to the brain that the bladder is full and needs emptying. This may result in the dog repeatedly trying to pass water even though their bladder is empty., A dog with a sore bladder as a result of bladder stones will have discomfort when urinating. This may manifest itself as the dog looking wary as they pass water, or fidgeting, stopping mid-stream and seeking a new spot to lift their leg, as if the location is causing the problem.Unfortunately, there is a critical size when the stone fits into the urethra. It may then get trapped at anatomical narrowing where the urethra takes a U-turn around the brim of the pelvis, or at the penile tip. Both locations have a slightly reduced diameter and are a classic place for blockages to occur., Look for non-productive urination and repeated urinary straining. Like putting a plug in a sink, a trapped bladder stone stops the bladder from emptying out. The dog, knowing their bladder is full, tries to urinate but nothing comes out. As the bladder gets fuller, their determination to urinate increases, but to no effect..


The equivalent with the dog is the kidneys keep producing urine which fills the bladder. However, the bladder cannot overflow and so gets bigger and bigger.
They are desperate to urinate and either squats, or lifts their leg, but when you examine the ground it is dry.
The dog becomes obsessed by trying to urinate, repeatedly moving from spot to spot and lifting their leg.

, Inflammation from the bladder lining can spread all the way down the urinary tract and some dogs lick their external genitalia in an attempt to alleviate their discomfort.


If the bladder is hard and full, this is very uncomfortable and the dog will sometimes lick their abdomen over the bladder in an attempt to find relief.

, A large, hard bladder causes the dog's belly to distend. The bladder of a German Shepherd-sized dog can become football sized before it bursts, enough to visibly make their belly swell.

, If the dog cannot void urine, the waste products of metabolism build up in the bladder and reflux back into the kidneys. Many of these waste products are toxins - potassium can be especially dangerous.


In blocked bladders, potassium reflexes into the bloodstream and high potassium levels can irritate the heart muscle and cause heart attacks, often with fatal consequences.
Therefore if your dog collapses or you suspect its bladder has burst, it's essential that you rush him to the vets as quickly as possible.

, If you notice any of the above signs then contact your veterinarian. In order to decide what the problem is they may request a urine sample for analysis.The common tests done on urine are to measure specific gravity (how weak or strong the urine is), a dipstick test (which indicates if blood is present, checks for glucose, and protein content), and a sediment exam.
The most helpful exam in determining the presence of bladder stones is the sediment exam.

, To prepare the sample, approximately 1ml of urine is put into a mini-test tube and spun down in a centrifuge. The heavy cells and sediment sink to the bottom under gravity.The liquid above the sediment is removed and the debris at the bottom of the tube tapped out onto a microscope slide. A drop of saline is added to the sediment to re-suspend it and help it to spread in a layer one cell thick over the slide. This is examined at under the microscope.
The urine is examined for the presence of bacteria, red blood cells, renal casts, or crystals. Crystals are the precursors of bladder stones. It is unusual (but not impossible) for a bladder stone to form without crystals being evident in urine, and so their presence can be a warning sign of stones.
If sediment exam reveals the presence of crystals, and the dog has a corresponding history suggestive of bladder stones, (see signs above) then further imaging is required in order to check for stones.

, The two options used to detect bladder stones are radiography and/or ultrasonography. However, not all types of stone show up on x-ray as some stones appear to have the same density as urine. Thus, ultrasound is arguably the more reliable diagnostic test.


An ultrasound is a non-painful procedure which can be performed while the dog is conscious (in good-natured dogs). An area of fur is clipped from the area of the belly above where the bladder is located.
The skin is cleaned and then a gel applied to the skin. The ultrasound probe is placed against the skin, the abdomen is scanned and the bladder identified.
Fluid provides an a clear view for ultrasounds, so when bladder stones block the passage of ultrasound waves, they create an ""acoustic shadow.” In real terms, this means there is a dark shadow on the far side of the stone, which can be seen regardless of the composition of the stone.

, The drawback to radiography is that not all stones show up. If the mineral composition is of similar density to urine, then the stone will be invisible on a plain x-ray (one where no contrast agent is injected into the bladder). This can give false negative results.


To avoid this, a double-contrast study may be done. This is where another agent, such as air, or a form of liquid barium, is introduced into the bladder. The aim is to provide material of a different radio density to urine, with the hope of showing up a stone.
Unfortunately, even with double contrast studies occasionally stones can hide and evade detection, so more and more ultrasound is replacing radiography to detect stones.

, Once a stone is found, the clinician needs to assess whether urgent action needs to be taken to avoid the risk of a urethral blockage. If this is likely, then surgery to remove the stone by colostomy (entering the abdomen and cutting the bladder open) is indicated, in order to get physical access to the stone and remove it., Once removed, the stone is sent to a laboratory for analysis. This gives the exact chemical composition of the stone, which helps in selecting a diet that is low in the constituent parts, and thus reduces the risk of the dog growing more stones in the future."

Adjust the sling height using the nails on the bar.,
Let the back of the dog go and let the sling hold it.,
Use both my hands to express your dog's bladder, squeezing gently from both sides.",How to Express a Paralyzed Dog's Bladder4," It will consist of a small ladder, a bar, and a sling.In order to adjust the height of the sling handles that hold the dog's abdomen, put some nails along the bar. Securely fasten the nails (or screws) along the areas where the handles hang off the bar. You will want to be able to move the handles further apart to raise your dog's rear end up, so each nail should be a few inches apart, so that the height can be adjusted gradually.

, If your dog can't walk on its front legs, then you will need to carry your dog to put it in position.

, You will want to hook the handles on the nails on the bar, beginning at the positions that are closest together.

, Put the handles at different positions on the bar, moving one side at a time, one nail at a time, until the dog's rear end is supported by the sling. When positioned correctly, the dog's rear end should be supported but not so high that their back feet are more than a few inches off the ground.


You should be supporting the back weight of your dog while you adjust the sling. Use one arm to hold the dog up while you use the other to move the sling handles.

, Your potty station should hold the dog up securely.

, The dog will learn to fall back and let the sling will hold it at the right position. The sling should be positioned so that the bladder is right behind the sling area and hence easy to locate and express.


The whole process takes only 5 minutes to accomplish, and if necessary, one person can do it by himself (for a 70 pound dog!).

Shallow containers, such as aluminum pie plates, work really well for collecting urine from female dogs.Here are other container options:


Empty cream cheese containerShallow food storage container;
, A dirty container could contaminate your dog’s urine, making a urinalysis difficult to interpret. Once you’ve chosen a container, wash it with warm, soapy water. Make sure it’s completely dry before using it to collect the urine., With the container ready for use, put a leash on your dog and take your dog outside.Having your dog on a leash will make sure your dog can't get away when you try to collect a urine sample.


If you have a backyard, take your dog out to where she usually urinates.Consider timing the collection for when you know your dog will need to urinate, such as first thing in the morning or after a meal.

, Pay close attention to your female dog as she gets ready to urinate.You may not have a lot of time to collect the urine once your dog starts to urinate, so make sure you’re ready to act quickly.


You will slide the container between your dog’s back legs, so try to stand beside or slightly behind your dog.

, Collecting the urine should be a gentle but swift process. When your female dog squats and begins to urinate, approach her slowly. With one hand, gently slide the container between her back legs. Consider setting the container on the ground instead of holding it.If you hold the container, you may get some urine on your hand.Have some disinfectant wipes or hand sanitizer nearby in case your hand gets urine on it.
Make sure the urine gets in the container. You may need to reposition the container if the urine is hitting the ground.
Let your female dog finish urinating before you move the container away.

, If you were able to get the urine sample, congratulations! To prevent the urine from spilling out or getting contaminated, cover the container as soon as you can.If you’re using a container that has a matching lid, use that lid to cover the container.


If you used a pie plate, cover it tightly with a layer or two of plastic wrap.
Wash your hands before and after covering the container.

, A fresh urine sample will provide the most accurate urinalysis results. Ideally, the urine should be examined either immediately or within a few hours of collection.After collecting the urine sample, take it to your vet’s office as soon as you can., If you can’t drop off the urine sample right away, you’ll need to store it at your home until your appointment. Because the urine will need to stay cool, place the urine sample in your fridge or on ice in a small cooler.If you choose to store the urine sample in the fridge, wrap the container in a plastic bag first.If you’re not comfortable having the urine sample close to your food, a cooler would probably the better storage choice.
A urine sample more than 12 hours old is no longer fresh and may not give accurate results.If more than 12 hours pass between collecting your female dog’s urine sample and the appointment with your vet, let the vet know how old the sample is, so they can decide if it will affect the results and if a new sample is necessary.

, If this is your first time getting urine from your female dog, it may be a little challenging to do by yourself. Ask a friend or one of your family members to help you.They can be the one to either hold the leash or collect the sample.

, Your first attempt at getting a urine sample from your dog may not be successful. If you have time before your appointment, try to collect a sample again later, after your dog has had some water or eaten another meal. You may have to be patient with your dog and try multiple times before you get a sample.

, You may not have any luck getting the urine sample. Your dog may stop urinating when she figures out what you’re doing, or the urine may not have gotten in the container. If you cannot get the sample, contact your vet to let them know.When you take your dog to the vet’s office, one of the vet’s staff can take your dog outside to get the urine sample.

Choose your container.,
Understand why sterilizing the container is important.,
Use a commercial sterilizing liquid meant to sterilize babies' bottles and teats.,
Use a steam sterilizer to prepare the container.,
Clean the container with boiling water.,
Clean and dry a container if it does not need to be sterilized.,
Use a leak-proof bottle to transport the urine.",How to Collect a Urine Sample from a Female Dog1," The ideal container is wide, flat and shallow, such as a baking tray, takeaway food container, or foil pie dish. It needs to be shallow enough to slide under a small dog, and yet wide enough to catch the urine if your aim is a bit off target.;
, If the vet wants to check the urine for the presence of infection, he or she may want to culture the sample. For the results to be accurate, the urine needs to be collected in a clean container and transferred to a clean jar or bottle to transport to the vet. This is done to avoid contamination from environmental bacteria, as the lab tests will highlight any bacteria present (including bacteria from the environment).


Using a sterile jar allows precise identification of the bugs present and an accurate selection of the antibiotic to which the bacteria are most sensitive.
There are three ways to sterilize a container at home, all of which will be detailed in the following steps.

, There are many brands readily available from chemists or supermarkets. Simply follow the directions on the packaging, which usually involve:


Diluting the sterilizing liquid with a set volume of water.
Immersing the object into the diluted fluid for a set period of time.

, If you have access to a steam sterilizer, (of the sort used for babies bottles) use it to sterilize foil containers. You can also use it to sterilize plastic containers that withstand high temperatures.Again, follow the manufacturer's instructions, which usually involve adding a set amount of water to the sterilizers and setting it running on a steam cycle.

, If you do not want to purchase sterilizing fluid, or do not have access to a steam sterilizer, you can use boiling water to sterilize the container. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place the container in the boiling water. Make sure that the container you use can withstand high temperatures.


Let the container sit in the boiling water for several minutes. Use extreme caution when removing the container from the water, as it will burn you. Place it on a clean surface to cool.

, If the vet does not want to send the sample for culture, then it is sufficient for the container to be clean and dry, rather than fully sterile. It is vital the container is not contaminated with food, or a sugary residue, since this could give false results on a dipstick test.


To clean the containers, wash them in hot, soapy water, rinse well under running water and then towel or air dry.

, Once you have caught the urine in your flat container, you will have to transfer it to a sterile bottle so that you can bring it to the vet without spilling it everywhere. Your vet may supply you with a container for this purpose, but there are also several household items you can use.


A glass jar, such as a jam or coffee jar, with a screw top, will do just fine. Give it a thorough wash with detergent to get rid of any sugary residue. Again, where possible, sterilize the container either with a chemical sterilizing agent, or if the material will take it, with a kettle full of boiling water. This last step is only essential if the sample is being sent for culture.

Discuss imaging tests with your vet.",How to Diagnose Spay Incontinence in Female Dogs," Spay incontinence occurs when a female dog is lying down to rest or sleep. The urine may leak in small spurts, rather than continuously.When your dog is resting or sleeping, look for a urine puddle or damp spot start near your dog's back end.


Lying down puts pressure on your dog's bladder.
The urine leakage may become more frequent over time. Also, the urine puddles may start to get bigger with each leakage episode.Other than leaking urine when lying down, your dog will be able to urinate normally.The sphincter muscle is part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. That muscle is what normally keeps urine from continuously dripping out of the bladder.;
, Because your dog will be leaking urine when it’s lying down, the urine will dampen and stain its back legs.Examine your dog’s back legs when it’s still lying down or after it gets up from its resting spot. The hair on the back legs will be wet. If your dog has white fur, the urine will stain the fur yellow.

, If your dog has spay incontinence, it will begin to smell like urine.Urine has a very strong scent, so it won’t be hard to detect a urine smell coming from your dog. If your dog frequently lies on a blanket or bed, those items will also develop a urine smell.

, Some dog owners get so frustrated with their female dog’s spay incontinence that they end up euthanizing their dog.Do not let your frustration get to this point! If your spayed female dog is leaking urine, do not delay in taking it to your vet. The sooner your vet can diagnose the spay incontinence, the sooner your dog (and you!) can get some relief from this problem.


Other problems, such as a urinary tract infection or health conditions causing excessive water intake (diabetes, Cushing’s disease), can cause urine leakage.Your vet will need to rule these out in order to confirm a spay incontinence diagnosis.

, Female dogs with spay incontinence usually have a fairly normal physical exam. The main abnormal exam findings will be urine staining on the back legs and urine leakage. As your vet examines your dog, they will ask you when your dog was spayed, as well as specific questions about the incontinence. Examples of questions are below:Does the incontinence occur when your dog is sleeping or relaxed?
Does your dog dribble when it is walking?
Does your dog drink a lot of water?
How old is your dog?

, Analyzing blood and urine samples will help your vet rule out other conditions causing urine leakage. For example, in the urine, your vet will look for signs of a urinary tract infection (inflammatory cells, blood) and diabetes (glucose). Your vet may also perform a urine culture to see if there’s any bacteria in the urine.Your dog’s blood and urine will probably be normal., Abdominal x-rays and ultrasounds are very helpful for seeing urinary tract problems. However, to diagnose spay incontinence, imaging tests may not be necessary.Talk with your vet about whether imaging tests would be worth the cost to make a spay incontinence diagnosis in your dog.

Plan ahead to collect your dog’s urine.,
Wait until the dog has a full bladder and put her on a collar and lead.,
Approach quietly from behind as your dog squats.,
Collect as much urine as you can.,
Pour the urine from the container into the screw-top jar.,
Take the sample into the vet’s office right away.",How to Collect a Urine Sample from a Female Dog2," Many owners find their dog becomes suspicious when you trail behind to collect the sample. The dog will then either hold on and not urinate, or else run off, leaving behind. To minimize the chances of this, try collecting the sample when your dog has a full bladder, such as first thing in the morning. This way she will be so keen to relieve herself that she won't take as much notice of what you are doing.


Other times to try collecting urine are immediately after she has had a meal, or on your normal walk when there are interesting smells to sniff and tempt your dog to scent mark as a distraction.
Another option is to enlist the help of a second person. Keep the dog on a lead held by the accomplice who walks ahead with the dog and distracts her. If you loiter a little way behind, when the dog squats down to urinate, approach quietly and slide the collecting container underneath her rear end to catch the sample.

, Put on a pair of rubber gloves if you have them. Take your collecting container in your hand, and the secure bottle in your pocket, and go outside. Let the dog sniff around at the end of the lead.


Most dogs have a sniff around to find a choice spot in which to void their bladder. She will sniff first and then shuffle around and prepare to squat.

, Don't make sudden movements or you may alarm her and she'll stop. As she urinates, slide the container under her back end such that you catch some of the stream of urine.

, Around 25 ml of urine is ideal, so you don't need to fill the container entirely.Once you have a sufficient sample, place the container on a flat surface where it won't get knocked over and return the dog to the house.

, This takes a steady hand, but if you do it outside over grass, spillage doesn't matter. When the jar is full, or you think you have gather 25 mL, securely fasten the lid.


Remove your gloves and throw them away along with the collection container.

, When it comes to analysis, the fresher the sample, the better. Where possible, collect the urine at a time when you can get the sample straight to the vet’s office for analysis. Try to take the sample to your vet within the hour.


Put the specimen jar into a waterproof bag labelled with your pet's name, and take it to the vet without delay.

Use sulphur.,
Repeat this once a month for about three months.,
Note that MSM (dietary sulfur) has absolutely NO effects in reducing the Valley Fever Titer.,
Try other vitamins and herbs.,
If your dog is limping, then try either of the following:


Glyco-flex, glucosamine, or shark cartilage.,
This is a lot of pills, but just grab a hot dog or a wad of cream cheese and then: feed a few pills, and go again.,
Remember, everything here (sizes and amounts) are for an adult dog approximately 60 to 85 lbs.

",How to Treat a Dog Naturally for Valley Fever," Sulphur is bought as a powder form for about 4 dollars at a pharmacy. You must use Sublimed Sulfur - medicinal grade (NOT MSM, that you get at the health food store), seems to work with most dogs in reducing Valley Fever (and the titers). You can order it through your pharmacy.


For a 60 to 80 Lb dog - use one ounce divided into eight (8) portions (then capsuled), one portion is then given every 12 hours for four days.
For example, if your dogs weigh roughly half of this, cut everything in half.;
, Sometimes the pharmacy will capsule the sulfur for you (...and then sometimes they give you a hard time about using sulfur on a dog). Your Vet will also say ""Absolutely NOT."" You may want to listen to their opinion however.

, As a matter of fact, the dog's titer could go back up. USE SUBLIMED SULPHUR.

, It has also been found out that if you give a combination of vitamins and herbs that build the immune system and are known for combating fungal infections, you may have greater results with the sulfur. Here's the list:


Vitamin C (Ester-C): Try to slowly build your dog up to 3000 IU a day (if tolerated, at least 500 to 1000 IU a day) Use the Ester-C, I use the powdered form. This is an immune builder. Try something like Powdered ESTER-C.... one teaspoon yields a whopping 3000 IU, so be careful how you measure it out.
Acidophilus: Get a good brand, keep it in the refrigerator. Nature's Way Primadophilus,. is a good one and it's really potent.

One in the morning and evening for the first week, then just one a day after that.


Garlic: you might want to try the 'odorless' kind. Get a potent one. NOTE: Between the garlic and the sulfur, get ready for enormous smelly gas. A small price to pay for a cure.

Two in the morning, two in the evening. An effective anti-fungal as well as immune builder. (reduce this amount based on dogs weight compared to these amounts being suggested for a 60 pound dog).


Pau d'Arco: This is an herb, is well known for it's anti-fungal properties (also anti-cancer properties).

Two in the morning, two in the evening.


Echinacea & Astragalus: these are herbs. Known for immune building.

One to two in the morning, one to two in the evening for two weeks, then stop for two weeks. Keep doing this rotation.


Pycnogenol & Grape Seed Extract: These are herbal extractions. They are extremely potent anti-oxidants.

One in the morning, one in the evening.



, Any of these will help the limping that the lesions from the Valley Fever causes.

, You will need to keep the dog's immune system in it's prime for at least six months. Take a break on weekends. I don't give vitamins and herbs on weekends. It is suggested that breaks are good so that the immune systems doesn't become ""dependent"" on these substances.

Advanced age.
Certain breeds, such as Cocker spaniels, bull terriers, and German shepherds.
Exposure to chemicals that damage kidneys, such as antifreeze, lead paint, or certain medications.;
, A dog with kidney disease is likely to drink more water than normal. If your dog is drinking water constantly, as if it can never get enough, then it may be having some kidney troubles.Of course, desire for water can vary depending on your dog's activity and the environmental conditions it is in. For example, if your dog has been running around on a hot day, it may want to drink more water than normal. Take these factors into consideration when assessing whether your dog is drinking more water than it should need.

, If your dog is drinking more water then it will likely be urinating more. However, kidney disease can also cause your dog to urinate less if the fluid builds up in the body instead of being expelled.So, either excessive urination or lack of urination can both occur with kidney disease.

, A lack of proper kidney function can cause your dog a variety of forms of digestive distress. These can include diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation.Digestive distress can signal a variety of health problems. However, if your dog is having repeated episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, no matter what the cause, it should be seen by a veterinarian.

, Lack of kidney function allows for waste to build up in the body. This buildup can inhibit your dog's appetite, leading to weight loss.If you know what your dog normally weighs it will be easier to assess whether it has lost weight or not. Thus, it's a good idea to keep track of your dog's weight on a regular basis.

, If you suspect that your dog has kidney disease then you should get it checked out by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office and tell them about your dog's problem. They will then give you an appointment for when to bring the dog in.It is a good idea to keep a record of your dog's symptoms. Write them down so that you can give the veterinarian an accurate account of your dog's issues.

, In addition to getting your account of the dog's symptoms, your veterinarian will do a physical examination of your dog. The vet will be looking for additional symptoms that may signal a problem with the dog's kidneys. These include:Pale gums.
Enlarged and painful kidneys.
Ulcers in the mouth.
Fluid accumulation in the body.
Dehydration.
High blood pressure.

, Your veterinarian may need to do additional testing to verify that your dog has kidney disease. These tests could include blood testing, urine testing, radiography, and ultrasonography exams.Each of these tests can tell your veterinarian something different about your dog's condition.


This testing can also help verify the extent of the problem so that your veterinarian can figure out the best treatment options for your dog's specific condition.

, If your dog has kidney disease then your veterinarian is likely to suggest a change to its diet. Kidney disease can be caused, or enhanced, by foods that are high in phosphorus and protein.There are special diets made for dogs with kidney disease that have reduced levels of phosphorus and protein.
Feeding your dog a diet that is made for dogs with renal failure can improve your dog's health and extend its life expectancy.

, If your dog has kidney disease it can get dehydrated more easily. Be sure to supply water to your pet at all times so that it can avoid dehydration.If your dog is refusing to drink enough water then you can encourage your dog to drink by adding low-sodium broth to the dog's water.

, Kidney failure can impact a variety of your dog's body systems. For example, kidney failure can cause your dog to become anemic and to have high blood pressure. Both of these conditions can be treated effectively in most cases with medication and lifestyle changes.Unfortunately, treatments used for kidney disease in humans, such as dialysis, are not available for dogs. Instead, treatment is usually focused on just treating the additional conditions caused by the kidney disease."

Disinfect the bite as soon as it occurs.,
Make sure to avoid coming into contact with your dog’s saliva.,
Take your dog to the vet immediately after cleaning the wound.,
Bring your dog’s vaccination papers to the vet’s office.,
Have your dog re-vaccinated.,
Understand that your dog may need to be quarantined.",How to Treat a Dog for Rabies1," If you witnessed your dog get bitten by another animal, be it a dog or a wild animal, it is important that you wash out the cut. Doing this can help to kill the virus on your dog’s skin or in the surface of the wound.To do this:


Take protective measures and wear gloves so that you don’t come into contact with the saliva of the infected animal. Humans can also be infected by rabies, so it is very important that you take every measure to ensure that you do not become infected.
Disinfect the wound using soap and hot water. If you have antibacterial soap or gel, you may also consider applying that to the wound in an attempt to reduce the chance of infection.;
, As stated above, rabies is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal. The saliva could potentially get into your system if it comes into contact with a mucus membrane like your eyes or nose.


If you think your dog has been bitten by an infected animal, make sure to avoid your dog’s saliva, even going so far as to wear a face mask and protective goggles.

, If your dog has been vaccinated against rabies in the past, the risk of him contracting the virus after getting bitten is lower. However, it is still very important that you get a booster shot for your dog because if the vaccine does not work and he contracts the virus, he may die without a booster shot.A booster shot is a single dose of rabies virus that works along with the vaccine to rid your dog of the virus., When you take your dog to the vet, the vet will need to see proof that your dog has been vaccinated for rabies. In many countries, it is a law that you must get your dog vaccinated as a puppy. When he is vaccinated, the vet will put a rabies tag on his collar, and give you papers stating that he was vaccinated.


Bring both the collar and the papers with you, as well as any papers documenting your dog’s medical health when you bring your dog to the vet for a booster shot.

, In most cases, your dog will also need to be re-vaccinated against rabies, along with getting the booster shot. The reason your vet will give your dog a vaccine after he has already been bitten is that the vaccine will cause an immune response in your dog where his immune system will attack the vaccine virus. That way, by the time the real virus reaches the nerves closest to the brain or spinal nerves, your dog will already have antibodies directed towards the virus.Post exposure vaccines are generally given directly into the wound site.

, Information about quarantining your dog will be covered in detail in Method 3. Regardless of whether or not your dog has been vaccinated previously, you will have to quarantine—keep him away from other animals and humans—for a period of time to make sure that he does not develop any rabies symptoms.

Notice if your dog has trouble urinating.,
Pay attention to your dog’s weight, appetite, and water consumption.,
Check if your dog is lethargic and appears ill. Another symptom of urinary tract disease is a lack of energy and general signs of illness like vomiting and nausea.,
Note if your dog's breed is prone to urinary tract disease.,
Provide your dog’s medical history.,
Allow your vet to do a physical exam.,
Let your vet run tests on your dog.,
Get medication from your veterinarian.,
Adjust your dog’s diet.,
Discuss surgery with your vet.",How to Diagnose Urinary Tract Disease in Senior Dogs," One of the most common symptoms of urinary tract disease is an inability to urinate. Signs of urinary tract disease also include straining to urinate, urinating frequently or only urinating in small amounts, as well as crying when urinating.If your dog does urinate, check their urinate for any blood. You should also note if their urine appears cloudy, as this could be a sign of an infection. If the urine has a foul smell, this may be another sign of a serious medical issue like urinary tract disease.
Another symptom of urinary tract disease is when your dog is unable to control their bladder. They may urinate in places they know they are not supposed to and urine may dribble out of their urinary opening without their control.
Some dogs with urinary tract issues also develop bladder stones or crystals which may be passed through their urine.;
, Your dog may start to lose weight due to urinary tract disease and have little to no appetite. They may not appear excited or eager to eat their food and lose weight as a result of their lack of appetite.You may also notice your dog drinks large amounts of water even though they are not eating. They may appear thirsty on a constant basis and continue to drink large amounts of water without urinating. Or they may drink lots of water and urinate too often.

, You may notice your dog appears lethargic and less energetic than they usually are. They may show no interest in going for walks or playing with you. They may also be very inactive and prefer laying down to getting up and walking around.Urinary tract disease can also lead to lower back pain for your pup. Your dog may be lethargic and disinterested in getting up on their feet due to lower back pain caused by urinary tract disease.

, Certain dog breeds are more prone to a birth defect that can cause urinary tract issues. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Miniature Poodle, Labrador Retriever, Collie, Welsh Corgi, Wire-haired Fox Terrier, and West Highland White Terrier can have a higher occurrence of this birth defect. If you have a dog that is any of these breeds and you notice they have urinary tract issues, you should bring them to your vet right away.Across most breeds, female dogs also tend to be more prone to urinary tract issues than male dogs.

, If your dog display the symptoms of urinary tract disease, you should bring them to the vet right away. Your vet will ask you questions about your dog’s medical history and their symptoms. Try to answer their questions with as much detail as possible so your vet can assess your dog’s condition.Your vet may ask you, “Has your dog had any urinary tract issues before? What are your dog’s symptoms and when did they begin? Has your dog experienced any recent trauma or injuries that could have affected their urinary tract or bladder?”
Your vet will also want to know about your dog’s vaccination history, specifically if your dog has been vaccinated against Lyme disease and leptospirosis.

, Your vet should then do a full physical exam of your dog. They will check your dog’s lower back area for any sensitivity and they will also look for any swelling of your dog’s limbs. These are all possible signs of a urinary tract issue., Your vet will also need to run several tests on your dog to get a clear diagnosis. They will request a urinalysis, where a sample of your dog’s urine is tested for any pus, blood, proteins, or crystal formation. They may also need a blood sample from your dog to determine their complete blood count and blood chemistry to check your dog’s kidney function.In some cases, your vet will also need x-rays or an ultrasound done on your dog’s kidney area. This will help them look for any obstructions in your dog’s urinary tract or bladder, such as kidney stones, bladder crystals, or any other issues in your dog’s kidneys.

, Depending on the severity of your dog’s condition, your vet may recommend giving your dog antibiotics for a bacterial infection, or medicine for pain relief, incontinence, or bladder crystals. Follow your vet’s instructions on dosage and do not give your dog more than the recommended dose.You may need to learn how to give your dog medication so they can consume them properly.
Your vet should also tell you if your dog will experience any side effects due to the antibiotics.
Urinary acidifiers, like Methionine, are sometimes used to treat your dog for urinary crystals.Medications such as Proin can be described for incontinence.Pain medications specific for dogs may be prescribed, such as carprofen, deracoxib, etodolac, and meloxicam., Changes in your dog’s diet, such as higher water intake, may help your dog feel better and keep their health up while they recover from urinary tract disease. As their condition improves, your dog may get their appetite back. Give them a high quality diet that is low in protein to help their urinary tract and kidneys recover.Depending your dog’s diagnosis, your vet may recommend specific dietary adjustments for your dog.
Possible changes include switching your pet to canned food, which has a higher water content; adding water or broth to food; reducing the fiber in your dog’s diet so fluids are not lost from the intestines; or feeding your dog fresh food rather than kibble., If your dog does not recover effectively with medication and dietary changes, or if your dog’s condition is severe, your vet may recommend surgery. Regular veterinarians can perform a procedure to remove stones or crystals. Your vet should outline the procedures, the recovery time, and the possible side effects of the surgery before they are performed on your dog.A specialty veterinarian can provide a surgical option for urinary incontinence: colposuspension and cystourethropexy.
Colposuspension repositions the bladder neck of female dogs to help reduce pressure on the bladder and the urethra.
Cystourethropexy is the same as colposuspension but for male dogs. This surgery can help to keep urine in your dog’s urethra and strengthen your dog’s urethral muscles.
These surgeries have a cure rate of 45-50%, and your dog may still need to take medication for the remainder of their life after the surgery.

Exercise your dog as usual.,
Learn how verbal cues work.,
Incorporate touch into your training sessions.,
Use the “corner” cue to help your dog brace himself in the car.,
Say “watch” when something is in your dog’s way.,
Tell your dog to “step” for a step or curb.,
Consider getting help from a dog trainer.",How to Train a Blind Dog1," You should continue to take your dog on walks to keep him healthy and maintain your bond. When you walk your dog, watch for obstacles that may cause your dog to trip and gently redirect your dog as needed.


Using a back or front clip harness rather than a leash may give you a little more control over your dog and make it easier for you to guide him around obstacles.Also, keep in mind that your dog will need reassurance if something noisy startles him. Pay attention to your surroundings and talk to your dog to let him know everything is okay.
When you are out walking with your dog, do not let your blind dog get near strange dogs or people, especially children. Blind dogs may nip in defense if they become startled.;
, To train a dog to respond to verbal cues, you need to be consistent and always offer a reward when your dog responds to the cue. For example, to teach your dog to sit with the “sit” command, you would need to practice telling your dog to sit a few times every day. After each time that your dog responds to the cue by sitting, you would give your dog a treat and some praise.Make sure that you offer the treat and praise right away. For example, you would need to give your dog his treat right after your dog’s bottom hits the floor so that he will make the connection that this is a good thing to do.
Keep training sessions short to help your dog stay focused. Dogs have short attention spans, so it is best to keep training sessions under 10 minutes.
End on a positive note. If your dog starts to get impatient, give him a command that he has already mastered, such as “sit,” then reward him with a treat and some praise and end the session.

, Your dog can still feel and he will likely use his sense of touch to figure out how to get around the house.You can use your dog's sense of touch to help train him as well.. To use touch in training sessions, you can do things like using the leash to steer your dog in the direction that you want him to go or applying gentle pressure to his body to get him to complete a command.


For example, if you are teaching your dog the ""sit"" command, you might place one hand on his behind and apply gentle pressure to help him understand what you are asking him to do.

, Most dogs will see an upcoming corner while riding in a car and brace themselves so they don’t fall over. A blind dog cannot use that visual clue, so saying “corner” before a turn will help the dog associate the word with turning a corner. After repeating this cue several times, your dog will learn to brace himself.

, A blind dog cannot see objects or obstacles that may cause him to fall or bump his head. To help your dog navigate the world around him, say “watch” whenever something is in his way and redirect him by applying gentle pressure to his leash.After a while he will associate the command with a need to turn or change course.

, Blind dogs cannot see when there is a step or curb that they need to go up or down, which may cause them to fall. Whenever you encounter a step or curb, say “step” just before your dog reaches it.Then, try stopping him and place one of his paws on the edge of the step to help guide him up or down the step. Repeat the command as you do this.


Doing this will help your dog to understand what he needs to do when he hears one of these commands.

, If you have just gotten a blind dog or if your dog has just been diagnosed with blindness, then you may find it helpful to meet with a dog trainer and get some specialized help. A dog trainer can help you to find what motivates your dog and teach him commands that will make life easier for your dog.

Understand that most vets recommend euthanization if an unvaccinated dog gets bitten.,
Isolate your dog for six months if you do not want to euthanize your dog.,
Talk to your veterinarian about treating your dog with a vaccination and post-exposure booster shot.",How to Treat a Dog for Rabies2," When an unvaccinated dog comes into contact with rabies virus, it is more likely than not that he will contract the disease. The Center for Disease Control recommends euthanization or putting your dog down, as he is a threat to those around him if he does develop the disease


However, there are other options if you refuse to put your dog down. It is important though to keep in mind that if he begins to show symptoms of rabies, there will be no other option but to put him down, as hard as that may be.

, Rabies generally takes less than six months to incubate (or become apparent in your dog) so most vets will require that you quarantine your unvaccinated dog for six months to make sure that he is safe to interact with.More information about quarantining your dog is covered in Method 3.

, If you choose to put your dog into quarantine rather than euthanizing your dog, he will have to have to receive a booster shot and vaccination during that time. Both of these shots will attempt to stop the spread of the virus if the dog has indeed contracted it. However, if the booster and post-exposure vaccines do not work, your dog will have to be euthanized, as once the symptoms of rabies appear, there is nothing that can be done to stop the virus.


This combination is explained more thoroughly in Steps 3 and 5 of the previous Method.

Understand that your dog will have to be quarantined after being bitten, whether he is vaccinated or not.,
Talk to your vet about quarantining your dog at home.,
Set up your at-home quarantine area.,
Look for symptoms of rabies while your dog is quarantined.",How to Treat a Dog for Rabies3," As stated above, if your dog is vaccinated, or you have an unvaccinated dog that you refuse to euthanize, then the dog will have to be quarantined. Many animal hospitals have designated areas for quarantine dogs. The length of the quarantine will depend on your dog’s vaccination records and the animal that bit the dog.


If your dog is vaccinated and was bitten by another cat or dog, he will have to be quarantined for 10 days.If your vaccinated dog was bitten by a wild animal, he will have to be quarantined for 45 days.However, some states in the United States may require different lengths of time.
If your dog was unvaccinated, he will have to be quarantined for six months,although newer guidelines recommend reducing the quarantine period from six to four months.Check the current laws in your state.

, In some cases, you may be able to quarantine your dog at home if it seems that there is a low risk that he contracted rabies. However, the vet will have to make that call. If you would feel more comfortable having your dog at home and have the means to quarantine him, talk to your vet.


The extent to which you must quarantine your dog is listed in the following step.

, You will have to keep your dog in an isolated area where no other animals or people can accidentally interact with him. This could be a room that you designate for his quarantine. He will have to be kept in a cage inside the quarantine room, however, you can get a large cage to make him more comfortable. Requirements for the room and cage include:


Cage: The cage must be large enough so that the dog can move around easily. It should also have a sturdy lock with small openings where you can put food and water bowls in. These openings are meant to prevent you from getting bitten.
Room: In the room, you must have a bright light that you can turn off at night. The light will be a help to govern your dog’s sleep patterns because when the light is turned off, the dog will be able to sleep more easily. If you have children, make sure that you can lock the room so that your children cannot get in.

, The quarantine period used to make sure that your dog does not develop any symptoms of rabies. If you spot several of these symptoms, call your vet immediately. If you are able to quarantine your dog at home, you should look for symptoms that include:


Aggressive behavior where the dog suddenly tries to bite or attack you.
Irritability.
Anxious and alert posture, hair standing up, drawn back ears, and dilated pupils.
Unexplained paralysis where the dog can’t seem to move parts of his body.
Howling or noises that do not sound like your dog’s regular voice.
A lack of interest in food (however, this can also be a sign that your dog does not like being in the cage).
A fear of water, bright lights, or breezes.
Foaming at the mouth or excess salivation.
Inability to swallow and the dog’s jaw seems to drop or become ‘unhinged’.
A sharp change in behavior where a passive dog suddenly becomes aggressive, or vice versa.
Begins to attack inanimate objects.
Restlessness (again, this could be due to being kept in a cage).

"
"
Keep your dog indoors most of the time.,
Block off steps and stairwells.,
Leave your furniture in place.,
Cut down on clutter.,
Watch other animals in your household around your blind dog.,
Place food and water dishes on each floor of your house.,
Remove obstacles from the yard.",How to Train a Blind Dog2," It is cruel to keep a dog tied up outside or in an outdoor kennel. Dogs kept outside all of the time are subject to extreme temperatures, rain, and predators. Blind dogs will be even more vulnerable to attacks by predators, such as other dogs or coyotes. Keeping dogs outside also reduces their opportunities to interact with people, which can lead to aggression and other behavioral problems.If you are unable to provide an inside home for your dog, then you need to make other arrangements, such as finding a new home for your dog.

, It is possible for a blind dog to trip on stairs even if he is used to them. Try blocking your dog’s access to these potential hazards with baby gates.If you need to bring your dog up or down stairs, then help him by holding his collar and talking to him as he goes down the stairs.

, To help your blind dog navigate his surroundings, keep the furniture in its place.Blind dogs will memorize their environments from the layout of furniture, to doors, walls, steps, and appliances. Moving the furniture will confuse your dog and make it harder for him to navigate the house.

, Leaving clutter laying around will confuse your dog and it may also cause him to trip and even injure himself. Keep the ground clear of clutter such as baskets of laundry, toys, sports equipment, and garbage., Other animals in your household may respond to your dog’s condition in different ways. Some animals may take advantage of your dog or pick on him, while others may be more protective of your blind dog and try to help him. Sometimes other household dogs will even act as guides for a blind dog., If you live in a two story house, then keeping food and water dishes on each floor is a good idea. It is also a good idea to keep food and water dishes in the same spots. Do not move them around or your dog may not be able to find them and may not drink enough water to stay hydrated.


Make sure that you show your dog where his bowls are after you first place them and check them now and then to make sure that he is eating and drinking.
When teaching the blind dog where his food dish is located, try adding a bit of canned food to some dry food to attract your dog to his food bowl.

, If you have a fenced in back yard, then your dog will learn the layout much like your house. You can make this easier for him by removing any potential obstacles, such as toys, branches, and lawn furniture. If you do not have a fenced in yard, keep your dog on a leash to make sure he does not wander into any danger.


To help your dog find the door when he is done, try hanging a wind chime near the door."

Select a monitoring device for your dog to wear.,
Provide the app with your dog’s basic information.,
Monitor your dog’s vital statistics.,
Determine your dog’s activity level.,
Use the app to set reminders.",How to Track Your Dog's Patterns1," There are several companies that offer devices for tracking your dog’s activity patterns and otherwise monitoring their health. These devices usually come with their own collar system, or attach to the collar your dog already uses.Options include Nuzzle, Voyce, FitBark, and Whistle. Expect to pay anywhere from under $100 dollars to over $200 for the system, in addition to a monthly fee for some models.
Factors to consider include battery life of the device and usability of the corresponding app that will upload and package data for your review.;
, The device your dog wears simply gathers data. It is the computer application - usually accessed on your phone - that stores the data and provides you with additional information regarding your dog’s health and activity. In order for the app to work as well as possible, give it as much information as possible about your dog.For example, you will likely be required to input your dog’s age, weight, and breed during setup. All of these criteria affect what will be considered “healthy” in terms of activity, heart rate, etc.
Companies like FitBark may even make it possible for your vet to access your dogs’ information through a separate app.

, Whatever the specific model, these systems usually work by tracking your dog’s heart rate and respiratory rate. In turn, this data can be used to keep an eye on your dog’s cardiac and pulmonary patterns.Most models will provide an estimate of the number of calories your dog burns in a certain time period as well. These stats can help aid specific health management plans.

, In addition to vital stats, wearable dog tech will also record the amount of activity your dog gets. It will also monitor how much your dog rests. Tracking the dog’s vitals at night can also provide you with information about your dog’s specific sleep patterns and even the quality of sleep they're getting., In addition to tracking statistics about your dog’s health and activity levels, the app can also serve as your dog’s private electronic calendar. For example, you can set up reminders through the app to make sure you keep up with regular preventative care measures.Set specific reminders to schedule things likes dental appointments, or to administer treatments to help protect you dog from parasites or fleas.

Watch for fever.,
Pay attention to vomiting.,
Pay attention to your dog’s stools.,
Check for signs of anemia.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian immediately.,
Consider for an ELISA-Antigen test.,
Do additional tests.,
Follow your veterinarian’s suggestions for treatment.",How to Tell if Your Dog Has Parvo," Parvo typically occurs in puppies between six and twenty weeks of age, and 85% of all infections occur in dogs under one year old. Puppies are most susceptible because they have a very high number of rapidly dividing cells in their stomachs and intestines; these cells are the primary target of the parvo virus. If your dog is older, parvo is unlikely (though certainly not impossible).


If your puppy’s mother was not vaccinated against parvo, it’s possible for the virus to appear even earlier, in the first few weeks of life.;
, Parvo is more likely in certain breeds, including Rottweilers, American Pitbull Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, and German Shepherds. If your dog belongs to one of these groups, be particularly vigilant in watching for parvo.

, In general, the first sign of a parvo infection is lethargy. Your puppy may become less active, eventually retreating to a corner and staying put. This lethargy is typically followed by weakness and loss of appetite.


The signs are rapidly progressive with a quiet dog quickly becoming critically ill with foul, bloody diarrhea.

, Dogs with parvo usually develop a fever between 104 and 106 degrees Fahrenheit (40–41ºC).

, Parvo destroys the stomach, which is full of the rapidly dividing cells that the virus targets. The stomach lining becomes irritated and ulcerated, causing your dog to vomit.

, Typically the diarrhea associated with parvo is particularly severe. It is as if the dog is passing blood, a very liquid and foul-smelling diarrhea. This may lead to dehydration as well.

, Parvo causes gastro-intestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia. To see if your dog might be anemic, press down on the gums. A healthy dog’s gums will quickly return to their normal color, usually within two seconds; if it takes longer, your dog may be anemic. Anemia may also lead to a noticeable paleness of the gums.

, The earlier you get your dog to the vet, the greater the odds of survival. Unfortunately, many dog owners fail to recognize the symptoms or wait too long to see a vet; when they finally take action, their dogs are in the late stages of the disease and tend to die from dehydration.

, To diagnose parvo, your veterinarian may perform the Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) test. This test checks your dog’s stool for evidence of parvo. It can be done in your veterinarian’s office.


The ELISA test gives rapid results, but it may not be completely accurate. Be aware that false negative results do occur.
On the other hand, a test to confirm parvo may not really be necessary. The parvo virus causes severe illness. Since the condition is managed with supportive care rather than cured, it is not always necessary to run diagnostic tests. The treatment will likely be the same with or without a definite diagnosis. Proving it beyond doubt would not change the treatment given and could divert limited financial resources away from vital treatment.

, The ELISA test alone can sometimes fail to diagnose parvo. Your veterinarian may also perform a Hemagglutination Test, a blood count, and/or a direct fecal smear. The results of these tests, together with the ELISA test, will reveal the presence of parvo in your dog.

, There is no cure for the parvo virus; however, your veterinarian can recommend supportive therapies and practical measures that will increase your dog’s odds of survival. These might include:


Hospitalization
Anti-vomiting medication
Intravenous fluids
Probiotics
Vitamin therapy

Understand the basic reproductive cycle of your dog.,
Know when to check for signs of heat.,
Understand the signs of heat.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is in Heat1," When wondering if your dog is in heat, it first helps to understand her normal hormonal cycle. When a female dog reaches maturity, and is physically ready to reproduce, her estrogen levels increase, initiating the release of eggs from her ovaries. If mating occurs during this period, the eggs can then be fertilized and an embryo can be produced.Female dogs, will generally go into heat during puberty, at around 6 to 24 months of age depending on breed. Smaller breeds generally come into heat earlier than larger breeds.;
, In a year, a dog will usually go into heat twice with an average interval of six months in between each heat, depending on the breed.This can help you decide if it's likely she's in heat. For example, if she was in heat one month ago, it's unlikely she's in heat again so soon and something might be wrong.
While most dogs come into heat twice a year, is every six months, as with any hormonal event some dogs are more regular than others. Some dogs come into heat as regular as clockwork every six months, whilst others are highly variable. A window of 4 - 8 months is considered normal.
Dogs are usually in heat for three to four weeks.

, The heat itself follows a pattern, with the vulva swelling and a bloody discharge in the first week. However, nature has a trick up her sleeve, because around days 7 - 14 the discharge may stop or become much lighter. This can trick the unwary owner into thinking season is over and their bitch is no longer at risk of pregnancy. However, nothing could be further from the truth. This middle week is actually when the dog ovulates, and is at the peak risk of falling pregnant.


This is also the week when she is most interested in finding a boyfriend, and so far from relaxing your vigilance, if you do not want the dog to have puppies you should tighten up on security.
Around days 14 - 21 into the heat, the bloody discharge returns, but gradually lightens and dries up completely. However, the vulva often remains larger than normal for another couple of weeks (although she cannot get pregnant now her heat is over).

Pay attention to your dog's potty habits.",How to Tell if a Dog Is in Pain," One of the most obvious signs of pain is limping. Limping occurs when it hurts to put weight on a leg.If a leg is causing pain, they are less likely to use it, and sometimes may rely on the other three legs.
Dogs in pain will also typically move around less.;
, Aside from limping, you may see other mobility changes. For example your dog may have trouble getting up or down. It might also move around more slowly than usual, or show a reluctance to do certain activities.Hesitance to go up or down stairs, run, or jump can be a sign of pain.

, Note the position that your dog holds its head or tail. Any change from normal posture, such as a hanging or tucked tail in a dog that normally has an active tail, can be evidence of pain.If your dog is holding a leg differently than it normally does, it could be a sign that it is in pain.
Pain may also cause your dog to stand with its back arched or to be very stiff when standing or moving.

, If your dog is in pain, you may see an increase in their respiratory rate or heavy panting.A dog that pants persistently, especially in cool weather, may be in pain.

, Your dog's eyes can tell you a lot about any pain it might be experiencing. If there is pain in the eye area, you may see squinting, redness, cloudiness, or a discharge.Your dog also may be rubbing at the area that hurts. If your dog rubs around its eyes frequently, this could be a sign of discomfort in this area.
The eyes can also give you a clue about pain in other areas. Squinting can be a sign of pain in the eye area, but some dogs will also squint when they are experiencing pain elsewhere.
Dilated pupils can also be a sign that your dog is in pain., Pain can change a dog's behavior. Even a friendly dog in great pain will be more likely to bite.Even a dog that has never bitten before may bite when approached if it is experiencing significant pain.
A dog in pain may also bite if you touch or move a painful area.The natural response, when a painful area is touched, is to turn toward that area. The dog may try to bite out of instinct.
You may first see warning signs such as growling. A dog on the verge of biting may pin its ears back or show its teeth. This is a natural protection mechanism that a dog may use to try to prevent further pain., A dog in pain may decrease its food consumption. If your dog suddenly has a decreased appetite, this may be a sign of pain.A dog with mouth pain may also drop food when it eats., A dog in pain may experience restlessness or an inability to get comfortable. Your dog may show this by pacing, repeatedly readjusting its position, or getting up and down frequently., A dog in pain may experience changes in its normal sleep schedule. A dog in pain may either sleep more than usual,or have difficulty sleeping., Unusual vocalizations including moaning, groaning, whimpering, yipping, and even growling can all be signs of pain.These sounds may be associated with particular movements, such as when first getting up. That can help to give you a clue about the nature of the pain.A dog that is normally vocal may also suddenly become quiet., Avoidance behaviors, such as hiding or shying away from contact with people or other animals are common when a dog is in pain.These behaviors are efforts to avoid potentially painful situations.


If your dog moves its head away when you try to pet it or makes other moves to avoid touch, this can be a sign it is in pain. Take note of such behaviors if your dog normally likes being touched.
These behaviors can go along with a dog being more withdrawn and less interactive than normal.
You may also notice an attitude of depression or mental dullness if your dog is experiencing pain.Note that some dogs may seek more attention, rather than avoiding it, if they are in pain.You should take note of either avoidance or unusually high levels of attention-seeking behaviors.

, Being aware of your dog's normal bathroom habits can help you recognize many different problems.


When a dog is in pain you may notice that it exhibits a different posture when it urinates or defecates. For example, a male dog that normally lifts his leg to urinate might not.
You may also see a change in how often your dog needs to do its business. Or, your dog may have accidents if it is painful for them to get to the area where they usually go.
Pain can also change the consistency of a dog's stool, due to the related stress. It can also lead to constipation."
"
Take note of the dog’s general appearance.,
Examine the quality of a dog’s fur.,
Pay attention to any fur loss.,
Notice if the dog’s nails are overgrown.,
Watch for untreated skin conditions.,
Be on the lookout for infestations.,
Know what kind of behavior to expect.,
Observe how the dog moves.,
Watch for aggressive behavior.,
Look for signs of anxiety.,
Know which breeds are likely to have been abused.,
Contact the dog’s previous owner or caretaker.,
Ask your vet to analyze your dog.,
Take action if necessary.",How to Tell if Your Dog Has Been Abused in the Past," A dog’s physique will vary widely depending on its breed. However, no dog should appear too thin.For example, if you can clearly see where a dog’s bones are below its skin, it may be emaciated.Since neglected or mistreated dogs are sometimes not adequately fed or are even starved, emaciation can be a sign of prior abuse.;
, Some dogs have short, stiff hair, others have long, soft hair, while still others fall somewhere in between. Whatever breed a dog is, however, its fur should be clean and free from unexplained clumps or tangles. If your dog has overgrown or matted hair, it may indicate that it has been neglected in the past, not cared for or groomed, or perhaps made to live in substandard conditions., If your dog has patchy fur, or if its fur seems to be falling out in clumps, this may be a sign of prior abuse.Possible causes include inadequate grooming or an untreated disease.

, While it may seem like a relatively minor thing, overgrown nails can be a sign that a dog has been abused in the past.This condition can indicate that the dog’s previous owner neglected to care for the animal, or that the dog was kept in conditions in which it could not naturally wear down its nails.

, You should observe a dog’s skin very closely. If you see certain unexplained skin conditions (that is, you don’t know how they came about), these may indicate that the dog was abused physically or did not receive adequate veterinary care in the past. These signs include: Scabs
Wounds
Bumpy skin
Scaly skin
Burns

, Dogs that have been abused or neglected may be infested by fleas, ticks, or other parasites.While there are other reasons a dog (even one that is well-cared for) can become a host to one or more of these parasites, a serious, unexplained infestation might indicate mistreatment, especially if there are other signs of possible abuse.

, Be careful not to assume that all unusual behavior is a sign of abuse. For instance, dogs that are adjusting to new homes may express certain behaviors (anxiety, excessive chewing, whining, etc.) because they are excited or nervous. Likewise, a dog at a shelter that seems nervous, frightened, or aggressive might not necessarily have been abused.Instead, the dog might not be used to being around so many dogs, or to being confined.


All dogs need a period of time to be socialized and to adjust to new settings.
If you are thinking about adopting a dog, try to observe it in a quiet place first. This can give you a better idea of its normal behavior, and help you decide if it is likely to have been abused in the past.

, Sometimes, past abuse can leave no obvious signs on a dog’s skin or fur. However, if you notice lameness or difficulty moving, this can indicate that the dog was injured in the past due to physical abuse.Signs of such a problem can include:


Unusual gait
Moving slowly (lethargy)
Not liking to be touched in certain areas
Difficulty getting up, laying down, or sitting
One or more legs moving differently than the others (slower, stiffly, etc.)

, Some dogs that have been abused react by becoming aggressive. However, aggressive behavior in dogs can have many other causes, so it is important to talk about your dog’s symptoms with your veterinarian, trainer, or animal behaviorist.Signs of aggressive behavior in dogs include:


Growling
Barking
Snarling
Baring teeth
Biting

, Dogs that have been abused may also react by becoming withdrawn, shy, or fearful. As with aggression, there are many potential causes of anxiety in dogs, so it is important to talk with your veterinarian or another expert to narrow things down.Signs of anxiety in a dog can include:Excessive whining
Excessive panting
Drooling
Chewing
Digging
Pacing
Dislike of being left alone or separated
Urination or defecation when separated from its owners

, A dog of any type or gender can be abused. However, breeds that are used for dog fighting and security are more likely to have suffered abuse or neglect. This includes breeds such as pit bulls and RottweilersThose that abuse these dogs may isolate, starve, and drug them, train them to be extremely aggressive, and cause them to be injured or even die in dogfights., If you ever have any questions about your dog’s past (such as an unexplained injury or defect), you should feel free to get in touch whoever had the dog before you. Reputable breeders, kennels, animal shelters, and pet stores will all be happy to openly share any information they have.If the previous owner or caretaker does not want to respond to your questions, or provides answers that don’t make sense, it could be a sign of a problem.


The Humane Society offers helpful tips for finding a reputable dog breeder., Whenever you adopt a dog, you should take it to a veterinarian as soon as possible in order to check its overall health.If you suspect that your dog has been abused in the past, it is imperative to contact your veterinarian right away. He or she can give the dog a full examination to assess any problems, including behavioral ones, and develop a treatment plan if needed.

, In most developed areas, animal abuse is a serious offense and punishable according to a number of laws.If you know or suspect that a dog is being or has been abused, contact your local law enforcement agency and/or animal protection agency.Try to document the abuse if possible, using photographs or other evidence.
However, do not put yourself in danger. Stay off of private land, and away from any individuals or animals that seem dangerous.

Watch out for changes in data.,
Set daily goals for your dog.,
Give the app additional information to work with.,
Prolong the battery life by syncing manually.,
Talk to your veterinarian about what you should do with your device.",How to Track Your Dog's Patterns2," One of the most important things to look out for is a sudden change in any of the data reported by your dog’s device. It’s possible that a change may indicate that your dog has a potential health condition. Fortunately, the app that reports the data makes it easy to look at your data in different ways that will help you spot a change.Most of the apps will organize the data into charts or other info-graphics that will allow you to see how short-term compares to trends over time. For instance, you’ll likely see activity levels change over time if your dog loses or gains weight.
Set your device to warn you about sudden changes in you dog’s stats. For instance, if your dog is suddenly much less active, it may indicate they are suffering from some sort of health malady. Changes in the data may even precede other symptoms that may be harder to notice.

, Some off the apps associated with wearable dog tech will recommend benchmarks to shoot for in terms of criteria like play time, active time, and rest time. These recommended benchmarks are worth paying attention to, as they are based on your dog’s age and breed. Set your own goals as well, and the app will remind you to meet them based on the data the device gathers.For instance, have the app remind you to take your dog for a 15 minute walk twice a day. If you tend to walk your dog in the morning but miss a day, the app can remind you later in the day that you need to make up the missed walk.
Think of the device as a way to change your own behavior, as well as your dog’s. It’s easy to forget about your dog’s need - especially their need for physical activity - if you spend a good amount of time away from your dog every day.

, Aside from things like your dog’s age and breed, it can also be helpful to add other information to your app that the device can’t monitor. For instance, you can log food and medication intake, and notes about any symptoms you observe.Not only will this information potentially help you or another person take care of your dog, it may help a veterinarian diagnose any issues that may arise.

, Try to ensure that the wearable device doesn’t ever run out of battery. Unfortunately, many of these devices require you to take them off your dog to be recharged, which requires down time at home. However, the batteries will last longer if you set the app not to upload data constantly.Instead, update the app with data from the device whenever it is convenient. In short, turning off any “auto sync” features means the battery will last longer in between charges.
Note that most of these devices can employ either Bluetooth technology or wifi to upload information.

, Since your veterinarian is familiar with the specific health concerns that are most relevant to your dog, they can provide advice about certain signs in the data to watch out for. Say something like, “Given Sir Woofsalot’s specific health conditions, what are the vital statistics I should monitor most closely?”"
"
Use a GPS tracker.,
Keep an eye on the air temperature.,
Set location-specific alerts.",How to Track Your Dog's Patterns3," You may wish to simply monitor your dog’s physical location, for which you don’t need a health monitor. GPS trackers, on the other hand, use a network of global positioning satellites to monitor and store your dog’s literal movements and location.You can get devices that do it all - both health monitoring and GPS tracking - or devices that simply track your dog’s location. Note that the latter can still help you keep track of your dog’s physical activity by noting the distances they travel, etc.

, Many GPS trackers monitor another helpful environmental factor: the ambient air temperature wherever your dog might be. This is important to several reasons. Primarily, you can make sure your dog is never at risk of freezing or overheating.Further, when you simply run to the store and leave your dog in the crate, you can make sure the heat doesn’t cut out at home and put them in danger. You can change the setting on most models to alert you if a certain temperature threshold is broken.

, Another important feature that GPS collars offer is the ability to set “home boundaries” for your dog. If these boundaries are crossed, the corresponding app can alert you on your phone. If you’re taking them out, there’s no issue - but if you let them home with your little brother, you might want to call and make sure Jabba the Mutt didn’t escape again."

Consider your dog's breed.,
Notice if your puppy bites harder than his litter mates.,
Switch from auditory commands to visual or physical commands to test your pup’s hearing.,
Check to see if your puppy moves his ears when you call him or if there is a loud noise.,
Notice if the habits and tendencies of your grown dog start to change.,
Bang two pan lids together, clap your hands, and blow a whistle.,
Always make noises a sufficient distance away from your dog.,
Take your dog to the park and call his name as he runs around.,
Get your dog checked out by your vet.,
Have your vet refer your dog for a BAER test.,
Allow the specialist to administer a BAER test.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is Deaf," Certain breeds have a higher risk of congenital deafness (being born deaf) than other breeds. These includes Dalmatians, Australian cattle dogs, Cocker spaniels, English setters, Beagles, Border terriers, Boston terriers, English bulldogs, poodles, Papillons, Pointers, Rhodesian ridgebacks, and Shetland sheepdogs.Keep in mind that regardless of breed, all puppies are deaf until around 10-14 days of age. After this point, their ear canals open up and they should have full hearing.;
, He may not be able to hear their squeals that will indicate to him that he is being too rough.If your puppy is deaf, he may also be the last in the litter to feed because he will not hear the food bowls being put down. While his litter mates may quickly respond to the rustle of the food bag, a deaf puppy will likely be oblivious to the sound or stay asleep.

, In general, deaf puppies are harder to train because they don't hear your commands. But, you need to distinguish between downright disobedience and deafness in your pup by using visual commands.For example, if during play your puppy bites too hard - instead of squealing or yelling, try blowing hard on his face while at the same time holding up a hand in the ""stop"" position. If the puppy is obedient, but deaf, he will quickly learn that a palm facing towards him means an unpleasant puff on his face, and ease off on the biting.

, A deaf puppy's ears aren't as mobile as a hearing dog. Whereas a hearing dog moves his ears to localize a sound, making them prick up or twitch to one side, a deaf puppy does not do this., As part of the ageing process, dogs can lose their hearing and go deaf.Your dog may be going deaf if he does not wake up like he usually does when you get home from work, or if he is no longer afraid of loud sounds like the vacuum cleaner, thunderstorms, or fireworks.
An older dog going deaf also may not as obedient as he once was, falling to come when called, or not responding to commands when he cannot see you or understand you by looking, rather than hearing.

, If your dog does not respond to any of these noises, he may be deaf. You can also turn on the vacuum or shake a tin of biscuits out of the dog’s line of sight., Do not do a home noise test too close to your dog as his other senses will be very sensitive if he is going deaf.


If, for example, he feels a breeze on his whiskers when you bang a pot or feel vibrations on the ground when the vacuum is on, he may give the impression that he can sense the noises.
Keep in mind your dog may only be deaf in one ear and have hearing in the other ear, so he may still respond to these tests. The only difference is that he may look around as if puzzled, as he tries to localize the sound.

, Of course, some dogs may just be naughty or distracted, rather than deaf, so use your common sense as to whether his habits at the park have changed or not.A well-behaved dog that fails to hear a recall may appear confused or distressed. His head may flick from side to side, and he may trot in circles as if lost.
When he is some distance away you might notice him stop, and look around as if trying to locate you by sight, even though you are shouting at him.
If you call his name, his ears should tip and move towards the source of the sound, so look to see if the ears are moving in seemingly random directions or if they quickly focus in on the right direction.

, While the veterinarian will use many of the same noise tests as you did, she will also check the dog's ear canals for signs of infection, discharge, or swelling that might be acting like ear plugs and impeding your dog's hearing., The Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER) test is a sophisticated laboratory test that can be used in two ways. It can give a you a yes/no answer as to whether your dog is deaf. Or, it can complete a more complex reading to determine the precise degree of deafness in your dog. The latter type of testing requires your dog to be sedated or anesthetized, and is rarely used.The equipment for a BAER test is expensive, around $25,000, and only a few specialist centers have access to one.

, This test can be done on while your dog is conscious.During the test, a series of clicks are delivered into your dog’s ear canals via headphones. Three small electrodes are attached the skin on your dog's head. These electrodes measure brain activity in response to the clicks.
The electrical response is recorded and interpreted by a computer program to give a pass/fail result. The specialist will then let you know if, based on the BAER test, your dog is deaf.

Feel your dog’s ears and paws.,
Feel your dog's nose.,
Feel your dog’s armpits and groin area.,
Examine his gums.,
Check for signs of low temperature.,
Look for the other signs of fever.,
Observe your dog's appearance and behavior.,
Stroke, pet, and engage your dog in play.,
If he seems well, assess him again in an hour.,
Know that fever is a normal immune response.,
Call the vet.,
Consider other related physical ailments.",How to Take a Dog's Temperature Without Using a Thermometer," A dog with fever usually has very hot ears and paws. You can gauge his temperature by using sensitive body parts like your cheeks and the back of your hands over his ears and paws. Are his warmer than yours? Healthy dogs only run slightly higher in temperature than humans.


A dog's ears and paws have a lot of blood vessels. When he has a fever, these areas get hot because of the migration of immune cells from the blood into the areas of the body where an infection is taking place. The increase in the circulating immune cells in the blood can manifest as heat in the blood vessels.
It is unusual for the left and right ear to be different temperatures. If one ear is warmer than the other, this is usually a sign of a localized ear infection, rather than a generalized fever.;
, If your dog has a hot nose lined with greenish or yellowish nasal discharge, it's likely he has a fever and an infection.This could mean that your dog is fighting off a respiratory infection, though this may be evident only in more serious cases. Certain diseases like distemper and kennel cough have these clinical signs, too. Therefore it is incredibly important that you quickly bring your dog to the vet if you see greenish or yellowish nasal discharges.


A normal dog can have a fluctuating temperature and level of wetness – it's a myth that dog noses are always cold and wet. In fact, the nose often becomes dry from common situations, such as lying in the sun, sleeping near the radiator, exercising, or when the dog is dehydrated. What does your dog's nose normally feel like? Has he done any of these things recently to account for a dry, hot nose?

, These areas are usually swollen and hot when your dog has an infection and fever. You can use the back of your hands to feel for heat in the lymph nodes in the armpits and groin area. However, make sure your own hands are at room temperature, not chilled or hot, as they provide your reference point.


Lymph nodes contain immune cells that fight bacteria and viruses. They filter the blood against these infectious organisms, and when there is an infection, the lymph nodes serve as a defense area. This area then becomes filled with immune cells that secrete different substances that trigger the brain to cause fever. These areas become swollen and hot because they become inflamed as a result of the different immune reactions going on simultaneously.
Because the armpit and groin areas of the dog have a lot of exposed skin with very little fur, feeling for heat in these areas can be done easily.

, Your dog's gums may feel warm and dry if he has a fever. Another important sign to watch for here is his gums appearing redder than usual, especially a bright brick red. This can be a sign of high fever, or even septicemia.


In a dog without dental disease, the gums should be moist, shiny, and a similar pink color to our own gums. Lift up the dog’s lip behind the upper canine tooth, and place the tip of your forefinger against the gum to assess temperature and moistness. Is the color, heat, and moistness similar to yours? If not, infection may be present.

, An unwell dog, or one in shock, may have a low body temperature. In addition to having cold extremities, the dog may show physiological temperature adaptations such as shaking or getting goosebumps. A dog with a dangerously low temperature will also be very subdued, and possibly collapsed. In this case, seek out your vet immediately.


Be aware that not all shaking dogs are cold; this can also be a response to stress, anxiety or pain. If you know of no reason for your dog to be acting like this, contact your vet as soon as possible.

, Apart from physical temperature, one of the first things you can do is to observe your dog for other physical signs of fever. It's important to be alert for changes in normal behavior from having difficulty defecating, to coughing or sneezing, since this may provide vital information as to the seat of infection.Possible symptoms include:Poor appetite
Lethargy, sluggishness or inactivity
Weakness
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Sleeping all day
Withdrawing away from other dogs

, When a dog runs a significant fever, from a few feet away and without touching him, you can feel heat radiating from his body. There will be a handful of other visible symptoms you can look for, too:


He is likely to be panting heavily for prolonged periods of time, and his breath will feel hot against your cheek.
He may be thirsty and drink more water than usual, because he loses fluid as he pants.
A fever can make joints feel achy and sore. In the dog this manifests itself as a reluctance to exercise, stiffness on rising and a stilted gait or even lameness.
A dog with a fever will be withdrawn, quiet and lethargic. He may become uncharacteristically aggressive when touched, because he feels uncomfortable and irritable.
He is less likely to groom and his coat will appear unkempt and ""starry,"" or dull and dry.

, Try to remember the feel of your dog’s body when he is not sick. Are his eyes dull? His coat less silky? Is he less rambunctious and eager than usual? Changes in these physical and behavioral characteristics may be a sign of illness.

, If the dog is behaving naturally, is hot but seems otherwise well, let him rest in a cool place for an hour and then re-check his temperature again to see if the signs you did detect have normalized. Since a fever is a normal immune response, it may just be something you have to wait out if it's not serious.


Remember, if the temperature of the dog’s extremities is raised and he is behaving abnormally, this is more likely to be significant than for a warm dog that appears otherwise well. It's infection you need to be worried about, not fever.

, In most situations, fever is nothing to worry about. It's a good indicator that the body is fighting back an infection or is undergoing repairs. In some situations, however, fever can be the sign of a bacterial infection. If your dog is displaying any abnormal symptoms, contact your vet immediately.


When bacterial infections with gram negative bacteria are present, they release toxins from their cell walls that act as signals to the brain to cause fever. In these cases severe bacterial infection can lead to even more severe fever with a very high temperature.This extreme temperature, instead of helping the animal can lead to damages to sensitive organs, like the testicles and the brain. When this happens, convulsions and coma, and sometimes sterility, can result. Thus it is very important that a fever be detected earlier, and a prompt veterinary therapy be given to prevent these unwanted effects.

, When in doubt, contact your vet for a professional opinion. In addition to seeking medical treatment if abnormal symptoms are present, it's a good idea to take this fever seriously if it lasts for more than 24 hours, too. Your vet can prescribe an anti-pyretic (anti-fever) medication to bring his temperature down almost immediately., If your dog's fever is related to another, often more serious, condition, you'll notice another set of symptoms entirely. It could be a more serious respiratory or gastro-intestinal infection. Be on the lookout for the following:


If he has a respiratory infection he may cough, sneeze, and have a runny nose or streaming eyes. This will likely impede his normally rambunctious behavior and sleep patterns, too.
If he has gastro-intestinal infection or inflammation, then he may be anorexic, vomit or have diarrhea. If you suspect he has a gastro-intestinal disturbance, follow him outside when he toilets so that you can see what he passes. Does he have diarrhea? Is there blood in his urine?
If you notice anything abnormal related to either condition, consult your vet immediately. There is likely an infection present; fever is just one of many symptoms present that need to be addressed.

Learn the signs of injury.,
Protect yourself.,
Muzzle the dog if necessary.,
Examine the dog slowly and carefully.,
Call a vet immediately if emergency care is needed.",How to Take Care of an Injured Dog1," Sometimes, when a dog has been injured, you'll be able to see it right away. Other times, the injury will be harder to detect. Make sure to take note of the following signs of injury:Limping or other changes in walking or movement
Swelling
Avoidance of touch in certain areas, or barking or whining when touched in a certain spot
Unexplained and unusual warmth in a certain area;
, Even a dog which is normally kind and docile is more likely to behave in a hostile way if injured. If you suspect a dog is injured, always take care not to be bitten or otherwise injured.To the extent that you are able, avoid the dog's face and mouth.
While your first impulse may be to comfort the animal, do not hug or squeeze it.
Approach the dog slowly and calmly, to avoid frightening it any more than it may be already.
Covering the dog's head gently with a towel or other piece of fabric can sometimes lessen its anxiety during examination., If an injured dog attempts to bite you or shows signs of hostility, you may need to cover its mouth to avoid bites.If you already have a muzzle for your dog, carefully put it on him or her.
If not, you can wrap the dog's mouth using a towel, stockings, a roll of gauze, or any similar strip of fabric. Wrap it over the dog's snout and under its chin, being careful not to cover its nose or obstruct its breathing.
Never muzzle a dog that is vomiting. This can cause it to choke. Never muzzle a dog with chest injuries or a short-snouted dog such as a pug or bulldog., Look the dog over to determine where and how it is injured, being as careful as you can not to startle or further hurt it.Speak gently and calmly to the dog as you examine to help it stay calm.Stop the examination if the dog becomes obviously agitated.
If the dog has a cut or similar wound, you may need to clip away some of the dog's fur to get a clear look at how bad it is. Spreading a little petroleum jelly over the wound can prevent hair clippings from getting stuck in it. , Some injuries are minor and can, if necessary, wait to be treated by your regular vet. Life threatening injuries, however, require immediate care, and if your vet isn't available, you'll need to contact an emergency veterinary clinic. Get emergency care for the following:Profuse or unstoppable bleeding
Loss of consciousness
Inability to stand
Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
Paralysis
Note that if the injured dog is not yours, and you bring it to a vet, you may be responsible for any costs related to its care."
"
Look for swelling of the vulva.,
Notice any vaginal bleeding.,
Notice whether your dog continuously licks herself.,
Take note if your dog starts acting strangely.,
Pay attention to increased mating behaviors.,
Watch for changes in the way your dog positions her tail.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is in Heat2," Your dog’s vulva is located directly below her anus. Before your dog goes into heat, her vulva will start to swell slightly. When she is in full heat, her vulva will swell to three times its normal size and will take on a reddish color., Vaginal bleeding is a sign that your dog will soon be going into heat. When your dog goes into heat, the amount of blood will decrease quite a bit and the blood will become brownish in color.


If a dog is scrupulously clean and licks away the discharge, it can be tricky to know if a discharge is present or not. A useful tip is to cover her bed with a white sheet or pillowcase. That way when she is asleep you will see blood spots on the white cover.
If you plan on breeding your dog, write down the day that the bleeding begins. Breeding is best done on the 10th or 11th day after the first day of bleeding and then every other day after that for three days.

, Another sign that your dog is entering heat, or in its early stages, is if she constantly licks her vagina. While some female dogs won’t do this, most dogs will develop this behavior right around the time that they go into heat.

, dogs who are in the early stages of heat tend to develop behaviors that they do not typically display. In particular, female dogs who are about to go into heat are usually nervous, agitated, or easily irritated.Some dogs will also bark more or become more aggressive with people and dogs around them.

, If your female dog begins mounting male dogs or other dogs, she is more than likely in heat. Mounting is a common sign that a dog is in the full swing of heat. She may even try to mount your legs.


However, dogs can mount legs or each other for behavioral reasons, such as masturbating, dominance, or bizarrely from submissive behavior, so this does not automatically mean a dog in heat.

, When a female dog enters heat, she will curl her tail to one side, making it easier for mating to occur. This action is called ‘flagging’ and is a common behavior of dog in heat.You may also elicit this behavior by giving her a vigorous scratch on her rump. If she stiffens her back legs and diverts her tail to one side she is flagging.
Never insert anything into the dog's vulva or vagina to test out if she is ready. You can inadvertently cause harm to the delicate, inflamed tissues and cause huge distress to her.

"
"
Know that some female dogs are ‘silent heaters’.,
Pay attention to the levels of aggressiveness in male dogs.,
Notice an increase in verbal communication and agitation.,
Observe the interactions between your male dog and your female dog.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is in Heat3," These dogs do not display any noticeable signs of being in heat. They produce reproductive hormones but don't develop the more usual external signs such as a swollen vulva.


The only way you can really confirm if a silent heater is in heat is by observing the interactions between male dogs and the female dog in question. Male dogs will detect even low levels of female reproductive hormones, which will arouse their intense interest and attention.
Be aware that some dogs do ""skip"" a heat. If they are unwell or their health is below par, or if they have lost weight recently, their body may save its energy and she won't come into heat when expected. This is nature's way of saying her body needs all its reserves to look after number one, rather than being in a state of flourishing good health where she could care for puppies.

, If you have a couple of male dogs, as well as your female dog who you think may be in heat, pay attention to how aggressive your male dogs are to one another. When more than one male dog is around a female in heat, they will begin to act very aggressively towards one another to prove who is dominant and should mate with the female dog.

, If you own one male dog and a female dog that you think may be in heat, pay attention to how the male dog reacts to being kept apart from the female dog. If he seems more agitated than normal and whines frequently, he is most likely verbalizing his irritation and not being allowed near the female dog. This is a good indicator that your dog is in heat.


Although this is not foolproof and you need to interpret this in the context of the dog's physical changes and the male dog's usual behavior when kept apart from his female pal. Some dogs experience anxiety when separated from a close playmate and this is difficult to differentiate from sexual frustration.

, If you let your dogs run around together all the time, then observe what happens when your male dog gets near your female dog. If your dog allows her vagina to be licked and sniffed for an extended period of time, she is most likely in heat. In particular, if she lets herself be mounted it is a sign that she is in heat.However, allowing another dog to mount her, can also be a sign of submissive behavior, so once again, you need to interpret the whole picture and ask questions such as is her heat due and how does she normally behave around dogs. Remember, sniffing bottoms is something dogs like to do a lot, at the best of times, just to work out who is who!
If your male and female dogs don't normally interact, keep your male dog on a leash when you bring him near your female dog. One or both dogs may become aggressive if they are not familiar with each other.

Have your veterinarian do a blood test to determine if your dog is in heat.A test can be used that measures blood progesterone levels, which rise when the dog is in heat.,
Have your veterinarian do a Vaginal Cytology test.,
Ask yourself whether the symptoms you are seeing could be heat or if they suggest a health problem.,
Have your veterinarian take a look at your dog if she should not be in heat but is exhibiting similar symptoms.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is in Heat4," This is simply done via a sample drawn from the bitch and sent to the lab. Low levels indicate she is not cycling, medium levels show she is in heat, and high levels indicate she is pregnant.


The alternative is a test used in research establishments. It measures the level of Luteinizing hormone (LH) in the bloodstream, which rises prior to ovulation. However, this is not commercially available as a test kit.

, It is quick and easy to do.The veterinarian rolls a clean cotton tip over the moist lining of the vulva and then rolls the cotton tip over a glass microscope slide. Once the smear is dry, it is stained and examined under the microscope.


A dog in heat has a typical pattern of large, cornified cells plus red blood cells that are typical of being in heat. This along with physical signs is enough to decide if the dog is in heat.

, This means it's important to use your common sense when wondering if the dog is in heat. If you are in any doubt, then take her to see your veterinarian. Is the dog due to be in heat? If yes, then heat is more likely than a health problem.
Was she recently in heat? If yes, then another heat is unlikely and there may be a health problem.
Is she in good spirits, eating and drinking normally, and normally active? If yes, heat is more likely.
Is she not quite herself, is her appetite is reduced, is she more thirsty than usual, or does she keep vomiting? If yes, a health problem is likely and urgent veterinary attention sought.

, There is a health condition, pyometra, that affects older dogs which, to the untrained eye, could mimic being in heat. The overlapping symptoms include a swollen vulva, with or without a vaginal discharge. A pyometra refers to a womb infection. In severe cases the womb fills with pus and the dog becomes toxic when toxins from the bacteria are absorbed into the bloodstream.


If you have an older dog, who has recently been in heat (4 - 8 weeks before) and she develops a discharge, seek veterinary attention because this is the peak risk period for a pyometra developing.
In the early stages the dog may be more thirsty or lack a good appetite. As the condition becomes more serious, the toxins causes kidney damage, and left untreated, can be fatal.
Each time the dog has a heat it weakens the lining of the womb slightly and makes a pyometra more likely. This condition mainly affects aging dogs (the more cycles she has, the more likely it is to happen) and no breed is exempt from being at risk.

Perform CPR if needed.,
Move the dog carefully.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Apply a tourniquet if necessary.,
Clean and treat lacerations.,
Use a cold compress.,
Seek veterinary care.",How to Take Care of an Injured Dog2," If a dog is not breathing, you may need to perform CPR. Close the dog's mouth and place your lips over its nose. Give three to four strong breaths.If the dog does not start breathing on its own, continue to give it 10 to 12 breaths per minute.
If you can't detect a heart beat, lay the dog on its side and compress its chest with your hands. Give five compressions per breath.
Once a dog starts breathing on its own, stop CPR.

, There is a good chance you will need to move the injured dog, whether you are bringing it home, taking it to a vet, or just trying to get it out of a busy street. An injured dog must be moved gently and with great care.


If you are able to, splint, bandage or otherwise stabilize wounded areas before moving the dog to reduce the risk of further harm.Confine the dog while moving it so it can't hurt itself more. If possible, use a pet carrier, but if you don't have one, punch some holes in a box.
Larger dogs can be moved using a makeshift stretcher. You can use a board, a door, a rug, or a large blanket, carried by at least two people.

, If the dog is bleeding from its injury, press down firmly on the injured area with your fingers and palm and apply a firm but not tight bandage. Gauze or a washcloth or towel will often do the trick.If the bandage becomes soaked through with blood, don't remove it. Place additional materials on top.

, If a dog has an injury on it's leg or tail that will not stop bleeding, and is gushing blood in a rhythmic way, it may have a damaged artery. You may need to apply a tourniquet to save its life.Wrap the limb in a bandana or other strip of cloth, between the wound and the heart, tightly enough that no blood can pass through.
Every 15 minutes, loosen the tourniquet so blood can pass through for about 10 seconds. If you don't, the dog may lose the limb.
Always seek immediate emergency care for a wound of this nature..

, If the dog has any lacerations that aren't bleeding, clean them with an antiseptic solution, such as hydrogen peroxide, and dry them. If you don't have an antiseptic solution, warm water with a little salt will do.
Pat the area dry with some sterile gauze. You can apply some ointment if its not an area the dog can lick.
Keep an eye on the injury in case of infection and make sure to keep it clean for several days.

, For bruising or tenderness, you can give your dog some immediate relief using a cold compress. Gently place something frozen, such as a bag of frozen peas, on the injured area.Cool the affected area for 10 to 15 minutes, then remove the compress. You can reapply as often as every two hours if it seems to be helping.

, Even for what seems like a minor injury, it is a good idea to seek professional care. You may not be able to detect some injuries, such as those that are internal.For non-emergencies, call your vet and explain the situation. The vet's office will either make an appointment for you soon or refer you to emergency care if they deem it necessary.
For serious bleeding or other major injuries, search online for an emergency vet clinic near you and take your dog immediately.

Give the dog medications.,
Make dietary changes.,
Use splints and braces as appropriate.,
Try gentle massage.,
Keep exercise moderate.,
Try herbal remedies.",How to Take Care of an Injured Dog3," Some injuries last a long time, sometimes even for the rest of the dog's life. Treating these injuries requires patience and consistency. To begin with, give your dog any medicine your vet prescribes, following all instructions precisely.There are variety of medications available for treating the pain that may result from an injury, from anti-inflammatory medications to opioids and more.Talk to your vet about the benefits and possible side effects of any medications he or she recommends.

, Changing what your dog eats can also be helpful in treating injuries. For injuries that have resulted from weakened tissue, a high-quality, meat-based diet is best.There are also a number of supplements, foods, and dog treats formulated especially for helping dogs with joint injuries., If your dog has sustained an injury that makes it difficult to walk or stand, it may benefit from a splint, brace, or cart. There are number of such products available for both short and long-term use.Your vet will be able to help you select the most appropriate option for your dog.

, Some dogs will benefit from a gentle massage of the injured area, once it is no longer too sensitive. Lightly rub affected areas.If the dog exhibits any sign of discomfort, discontinue this immediately. This should be a pleasant experience for your dog, not a painful one.

, An injured dog should not overly exert itself, as this may result in further injury/re-injury of the damaged area. Make sure the dog doesn't, for example, walk or run for too long on an injured leg.


Total lack of exercise isn't a good idea either. This can result in a dog becoming overweight, which can produce its own problems, especially for dogs that have joint injuries., There are a number of herbal remedies that some people have found helpful in soothing the pain of an injured dog. Although these are not medically proven, you may wish to try the following:Boswellia, bupleurum, cayenne, ginger, turmeric, and yucca have all been used to relieve joint pain in both people and animals. They can be applied in compresses.
Hot compresses with these herbs, applied for 10 to15 minute intervals every two to four hours may help relieve your dog's pain.
A cool compress with peppermint can have an immediate soothing effect.

"
"
Adjust the dog's position.,
Clean the bedding.,
Add moisture to the air.,
Minimize allergens.,
Be cautious about other treatments.",How to Stop a Dog from Snoring1," Move your sleeping dog so it is lying on its belly with its head and paws straight. If your dog insists on sleeping on its side, put a pillow under its head so its neck is straight. This may increase air flow.


A round bed may encourage a curled position, which should also help.;
, Wash the bedding once or twice a week to clear away dust and other allergens. Vacuum carpet and curtains regularly., Dry air can irritate the nose and throat and increase the amount or severity of snoring.If you live in an arid climate, run a humidifier in the room where your dog sleeps. Alternatively, increase the humidity by hanging damp laundry to dry, or leaving open containers of water in the room, with plenty of surface area.

, Keep your dog and your dog's bedding away from sources of smoke and dust. If the dog frequently sneezes or has a stuffy nose, try walking it on routes away from heavy traffic. Track pollen count in your area online or in the newspaper, and avoid morning walks on days when the pollen count is high.


Pollen count is usually highest from 5am to 10am, and at its lowest in the early afternoon., Veterinary, scientist, and government organizations discourage the use of homeopathic treatments instead of vet-recommended treatments.More concentrated, herbal treatments should not be used on your dog without a vet's advice, especially if the treatment is designed for humans. Dogs can react badly to substances that are harmless to humans.

Treat any wounds caused by potentially rabid animals.",How to Spot Rabies in a Dog," This early stage can last anywhere from two to ten days. During this time, your dog will seem sick with general symptoms. If you notice these symptoms, search your dog for any bite marks or signs of a recent fight (scabs, scratches, ruffled fur with dried saliva). If you find a bite mark or wound of any kind, take your dog to the vet immediately for evaluation. These early non-specific symptoms include:Muscle pain
Restlessness
Irritability
Chills
Fever
Malaise, a general feeling of sickness and discomfort
Photophobia, a fear of bright lights
Anorexia, or disinterest in food
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Inability or unwillingness to swallow
Cough;
, This milder form, known as dumb or paralytic form, is the most common and lasts from 3 to 7 days. It's known as dumb or paralytic rabies, because your dog may foam around the mouth or become paralyzed. He'll also seem confused, sick, or lethargic (tired).Take your dog to the vet immediately if you notice any other dumb form symptoms, including:Paralysis (inability to move) of the legs, facial muscles, or other parts of the body. This normally starts in the hind legs and moves forward through the body.
Dropping of the lower jaw, leading to a 'dumb' look.
Making a strange barking sound that does not sound like a normal bark.
Excess salivation that creates foam around the mouth.
Difficulty swallowing.

Note that in this form of rabies, dogs are not vicious and rarely try to bite.



, This furious or aggressive form also lasts from 3 to 7 days and your dog will appear aggressive or easily excitable.Your dog may behave abnormally and foam around the mouth. This form is what people generally think of when they think of rabies, though it is less common in dogs than the dumb or paralytic form. Furious form creates excessive aggression that must be handled with extreme caution to prevent being bitten. Call animal control to assist you if you think a dog has this form of rabies. Signs include:Profuse salivation that will look like foam around the dog’s mouth.
Hydrophobia, fear of water. The dog will not go near water and will seem uneasy or panicked at the sound or touch of water.
Aggressiveness. The dog may look like he's trying to bite and will viciously show all his teeth.
Restlessness or discomfort. He may also be disinterested in food.
Irritability. The slightest provocation may cause the dog to attack and bite. The dog might even do this without any provocation or cause.
Abnormal behaviour like chewing on rocks, rubbish or his own legs. The dog may also follow your hand around if you wave it in front of him while he is in a cage. He may try to bite it.
Overly playful puppies that suddenly bite when petted, and become vicious after a few hours.

, When an infected animal bites another animal, rabies is spread through the infected animal’s saliva. When the saliva comes into contact with the uninfected animal’s blood and mucus membranes (mouth, eyes, and nasal cavities) the disease passes from the infected animal to the uninfected animal. Locating any bite marks or open wounds can help you determine if your dog might have been exposed to rabies.


Once the disease enters the body, it travels by the nerves until it reaches the central nervous system (the spinal cord and the brain).From there, it spreads to the salivary glands where it prepares to spread to another victim.

, If your dog has been bitten, bring him to a veterinarian as soon as possible.The rabies virus can live on the dog’s skin or hair for up to 2 hours, so wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt and pants before handling the dog. The vet will ask you about possible rabies exposure (like if you've smelled skunks in your yard or your dog has been exposed to any raccoons or bats in the area). Your dog will also be examined.


If you see signs that a dog that is not yours might be infected, call animal control. This way, the dog can be taken to a veterinarian without putting you at risk for a bite.
There aren't any tests to determine if live animals have rabies or not. The only test is one in which the brain is removed from the body and small sections of the brain are examined under a microscope for specific signs called Negri bodies., Your dog will get a booster shot of the rabies vaccine if he's previously been vaccinated. This will help his immune system fight off the virus. The dog will also be carefully monitored for 45 days, which can usually be done at home. Your dog will have to avoid contact with other animals and humans outside of the household during this time.If the dog hasn't been vaccinated and is bit by a confirmed rabid animal, euthanasia is typically recommended.


Euthanizing the dog prevents serious health risks to humans and keeps the dog from becoming fully rabid.
If you refuse to euthanize the dog, it will be quarantined and observed for 6 months, at a willing veterinary clinic. You'll be responsible for the costs and if your dog doesn't become rabid, he'll be vaccinated one month before being released.

, If your dog does not have any bite marks, but you are concerned about the signs he's showing, be aware that some other conditions can appear like rabies. Take your dog to the vet immediately if he seems sick or is displaying odd symptoms. Diseases and other conditions that could be confused with rabies include:Infectious canine hepatitis
Meningitis
Tetanus
Toxoplasmosis
Brain tumors
Maternal aggression in females who have recently whelped a litter of puppies
Poisoning from chemicals such as diminazene or organophosphate

, This is the best and cheapest way to prevent your dog from getting rabies. Set up a regular vaccination schedule with your veterinarian to keep your dog’s rabies vaccine up-to-date. Your dog might be on a yearly, every two years or every three years vaccination schedule based on the vaccine manufacturer’s guidelines or state or local laws.Many countries have laws requiring dogs to be vaccinated against rabies.

, The best way to keep your dog safe, aside from getting him vaccinated, is to keep him from interacting with wild animals. You might try keeping him fenced in a yard, limiting his time outside when wild animals are more likely to be active (like early morning, evening, or nighttime), and keeping him on a leash when out for walks.Pay particular attention to your dog when you take him for hikes or walks through areas where wild animals are common.

, If you're in high risk area or occupation, you should get a pre-exposure vaccine to protect against rabies. The Centers for Disease Control also recommends pre-exposure vaccination for travelers who stay more than one month in an area of the world where rabies is widespread or if the travelers will work with any kind of animal in these areas.High risk occupations include:


Veterinarians
Veterinary technicians
Rabies laboratory personnel
People who work with wildlife either at wildlife sanctuaries, rehab centers, or parks

, If you are bit by an animal you think might have rabies, wash the wound with soap and water for 10 minutes. Then, call your doctor's office, who will contact the proper authorities to investigate. They'll also try to capture the animal that bit you for rabies testing.


If they can't find the animal or it is found and tests positive for rabies, you will be put on a post-exposure vaccine course which varies depending on if you’ve had a previous rabies vaccine or if you haven’t.

Identify essential vaccinations.,
Decide what additional vaccinations your dog should get.,
Discuss your dog's vaccination schedule with your veterinarian.,
Bring your dog in for vaccinations.,
Make an annual veterinary appointment ahead of time.,
Ask for an appointment reminder.,
Put your dog's vaccination schedule into your calendar.,
Set a reminder in your electronic calendar.",How to Stay Updated on Dog Vaccinations," There are some vaccinations that all dogs need to receive. These vaccinations prevent highly contagious diseases that are a health risk to all dogs. For example, all dogs must get both a distemper and rabies vaccination.The distemper vaccination is called DHPP because it is a combination shot that protects your dog from distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus.


Distemper is a serious viral disease that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. It is often fatal.Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) can lead to illness or death, especially in puppies. It can cause fever, congestion, depression, organ damage, and blood coagulation disorders.Parainfluenza is one of the causes of kennel cough. It can cause flu-like symptoms in your dog for days or weeks and may develop into pneumonia. It is highly contagious.Parvovirus is a serious, highly contagious viral disease that can be fatal, especially to puppies. Symptoms may include lethargy; loss of appetite; abdominal pain and bloating; fever or low body temperature (hypothermia); vomiting; and severe, bloody, diarrhea. Most deaths occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of symptoms. There is no cure and treatment is only to support the dog's system while it fights the virus.Rabies is a dangerous and deadly disease for humans and animals, and it is essential that you protect your dog and everyone who might come into contact with your dog. Rabies is usually spread through the saliva of an infected animal, and attacks the central nervous system.There is no cure or treatment for rabies. If your dog contracts rabies, they must be euthanized.
The rabies vaccination is mandatory in a lot of areas. It may be required every year or every three years. If your dog gets out of date with that vaccination your veterinarian may be required to report the lapse in vaccination to local authorities.;
, This decision is usually done by discussing the options with your veterinarian. They should make recommendations for what vaccinations your dog should get and why they should get them. Vaccinations that are given depending on where you live include, but are not limited to:Leptospirosis: Vaccination against a bacterial infection that is prevalent in dogs that live in moist climates, but can also be spread through contaminated water sources like puddles, streams, ponds, and contaminated soil. This disease can be spread from dog to person, putting you and others at risk. It may cause permanent kidney or liver damage.Bordetella: This contagious respiratory infection is another cause of kennel cough. If your dog interacts with other dogs (at the park, at a kennel, etc.), then your veterinarian may suggest this vaccination. It is highly contagious and leads to a persistent dry cough and flu-like symptoms.Lyme Disease: If your dog frequents areas that are prone to ticks (tall grasses, thick brush, marshes, and woods), your veterinarian may suggest a Lyme disease vaccination. Lyme is spread by a tick bite and may cause fever, reduced energy, stiffness, joint swelling, and may lead to kidney failure, which can be fatal., Your veterinarian will tell you when your dog needs its vaccinations and when it should get boosters, which are infections that revive your dog's vaccination immunities. In most cases, vaccination boosters are done at annual checkups. However, not all vaccinations are done annually.This means that you will need to set a schedule that takes into account when a variety of vaccinations need to be administered.
Your veterinarian will be able to keep track of when vaccinations should be done in their computer system. However, in order to stay updated on when dog vaccinations should occur, you should keep track of these dates as well.

, Take your dog to its veterinarian every year for an annual exam that also includes updating its vaccinations. From year to year the vaccinations your dog receives may vary, as certain vaccinations are only given every few years.If you switch veterinarians, your new vet should request your dog's veterinary records from its old vet before the appointment. This will allow your new vet to have all the information they need to keep your dog's vaccinations up to date.
If you are late on getting your dog vaccinated you should still do it when you remember. Tell your veterinarian that your dog is behind in its vaccinations but that you would like to get it up to date.

, When your dog gets its vaccinations you should make an appointment for the next round, even though it is a year or more away. Making the appointment will help to assure that you don't forget to get your dog re-vaccinated.


Some veterinary offices will not want to make appointments too far in advance. If this is the case with your veterinarian, then you will need to keep track of when to call and make an appointment. Put a reminder in your calendar that you need to call and make the appointment.

, Once you make an appointment for your dog's vaccination you can ask for a reminder. Most veterinary practices will gladly call or email you before the appointment to remind you of the appointment.


In order to actually get the reminder, be sure that your veterinary office has your current phone number and email address.

, In order to keep up to date with your dog's vaccinations, you should put the dates for updates in your calendar. While many veterinary practices will remind you when vaccinations need to be administered, it's also a good idea for you to keep track of it as well.


If you cannot make an appointment ahead of time, for instance if you are moving and don't know what veterinary practice you will take your dog to next year, you should be particularly good at writing down the dates when your dog needs its vaccinations. You will only have the reminder in your calendar to remind you.

, If you have an electronic calendar, you can put a recurring item in the calendar that reminds you to get your dog vaccinated. This recurring event will remind you every year that the vaccination or booster needs to occur.


For example, if your dog gets a rabies booster every year, then you can set an event in your electronic calendar to occur every year in order to remind you.
If you have a smartphone, there are also apps that you can use to set a reminder for your dog's vaccinations.

Exercise overweight dogs.,
Take short-nosed dogs to a vet.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Check the dog's teeth.,
Visit a veterinarian.",How to Stop a Dog from Snoring2," Fat buildup around the throat area can constrict airflow and cause snoring. This is one of the most common causes of snoring, especially if it increased as the dog aged, or if the dog stops breathing for a few seconds, then gasps.Make sure your dog gets enough exercise for its age and breed:Young or young adult dogs of active breeds (such as retrievers or Jack Russell terriers) need at least 30–60 minutes of active exercise every day.
Even ""indoor"" breeds and toy breeds need regular exercise beyond a short walk. Play an indoor game long enough to tire them out.
Even old dogs should be walked daily, but not to the point of limping or exhaustion.
Playing at the dog park is usually better for the dog than sustained jogging or running. For best results, look up recommendations for your dog's breed.

, Dog breeds with short noses often have breathing problems that can cause snoring. Even if your dog has been this way its whole life, this can still be a serious health problem.If your dog has any of these breeds in its ancestry, take it to a vet.


Common short-nosed dog breeds include bulldogs, Boston terriers, pugs, boxers, chihuahuas, Pekingese, Shar Pei, and shih tzus. If you're not sure about your dog's breed, search for the breed name and ""brachycephalic syndrome.""
The vet may recommend surgery to fix more serious problems, such as gagging or choking.In one study, 74% of dogs who underwent surgery still snored, but more serious symptoms typically improved., If your dog recently started snoring, it may have a cold, or allergies to spring pollen. This is especially true if the dog is sneezing, or dribbling liquid from its nose. Visit a vet if the symptoms don't go away within a few days, or if the nasal discharge becomes bloody or full of mucus., An untreated tooth infection can lead to an abscess that limits air flow.Check the dog's mouth for loose teeth, inflamed gums, blood, or lumps on gums or under the tongue.Take the dog to a vet if you notice any of these problems.


Even if you don't see these problems, keep the dog's teeth clean with a doggie toothbrush and chew toys.

, If you still aren't sure what's causing the snoring, visit the vet. Fungal infections, tumors, or other health problems take a professional to detect. The snoring may not be a sign of anything serious, but you don't want to take that risk.

Attempt to remove the foxtail if a vet is unavailable.","How to Remove a ""Foxtail"" from a Dog's Nose"," The dog may sneeze in a manner that seems uncontrollable. This sneezing may even be accompanied by a bloody discharge. Bloody discharge accompanying sneezing is a fairly good indicator that a foxtail is lodged in the nose., A reverse sneeze is what some may refer to as ""snorting."" It is a method the dog may use to try and clear something from its nose,which could include a foxtail. If the dog is reverse sneezing, this could be a symptom of a foxtail lodged in the nose.

, Nasal irritation may be apparent if the dog paws or scratches his or her snout, rubs the snout, head, or face, or shakes the head.If a foxtail is not visible, but the dog exhibits symptoms of nasal irritation, a foxtail may be lodged in the nose.

, Checking your pet after every walk and thoroughly search between toes, in armpits, and ears for foxtails. Remove them or see a vet if it looks lodged. Seeing a foxtail on one part of the body might indicate foxtails in the nose or elsewhere.

, A dog with a foxtail seed in its ear might rub its head on the ground or shake its head violently from side to side. It might paw at its ear or hold its head at a strange angle with the infected ear angled down. The ear could become infected, and the eye on the same side may look abnormal as well., If a dog gets a foxtail seed in its eye, it will probably appear to be in a great deal of pain. The eye and the area around it may swell, and a discharge may appear. The dog will probably keep its eye shut tightly as well., Foxtails commonly get caught in dogs' skin. The area around the site where the foxtail is stuck may be swollen and red and there may be a bloody or clear fluid draining from the area. The dog may lick the area a lot and may appear to be in pain.


Affected sites often included the webbed area between the dog's toes as well as the chest and/or shoulders., First, try to keep the dog calm. He or she may be stressed out and/or in pain, so it is best to try and calm the dog before a trip to the vet. This may require you to restrain the dog for its comfort and safety as well as your safety.


Sit on the ground with the dog and speak in soothing tones.
If the dog is restless, you can try to use basic commands to get him to calm down.
If commands don't work, you may need to use a leash or even a muzzle.
Restraining the dog may be easier if you have someone to help you., Not all veterinarians may have experience removing nasal foxtails, so it would be a good idea to seek out a veterinarian who has experience with them.You may be able to see the foxtail in the dog's nose, but only a trained professional can ensure the foxtail is properly removed. Call the veterinarian or check his or her website to see if you can verify whether he or she has foxtail experience.
A foxtail in the nose could lead to a sinus infection or worse.
The dog's nose is very sensitive, so anesthesia may very likely be required to safely remove the foxtail.

, Bring the dog to his or her office. Explain the symptoms that your dog has been exhibiting and that you suspect a nasal foxtail. If the veterinarian agrees with you after an examination, they can remove out the foxtail a number of ways.The vet will most likely use an anesthetic.
The vet might use an endoscope, which is a fine tube with a fiberoptic camera, passing it up the nose to check that it is a foxtail that is causing the problem.
The vet can remove the foxtail using forceps or a grasper on the endoscope. A vet's forceps will have much longer and narrower arms than tweezers at home.
The vet might flush the nasal cavity to remove all nasal debris.
Do not poke up your dog's nose where you cannot see without a vet.

, If you can see the foxtail clearly on your dog's nose and cannot get your dog to a vet, you can try to remove the foxtail yourself. Use tweezers to get a firm grip on the foxtail. Pull gently but firmly along the long axis of the nose.


Do not poke up your dogs nose where you cannot see.
If the foxtail snaps off mid-pull, then it likely doesn't make a difference but see a vet to remove the rest.
If you see no more foxtails and your dog seems less irritated, it is possible you removed the whole foxtail. Check with a vet to make sure.

, When a dog loses muscle mass, the muscles will look visibly thinner. You may also notice a difference in how they feel; your hand may suddenly reach all the way around your dog's leg, when it didn't before, for instance. Sometimes, this type of muscle loss will only affect certain parts of the body. For example, if your dog has arthritis or an injury in it's back legs, you may notice the back legs getting thinner while the front legs get larger to compensate., Dogs who lose muscle mass are likely to lose weight, too, though not always. You may notice your dog feels lighter when you pick it up, or you may notice that it looks thinner overall. Try weighing your dog to see if it has lost any weight., If your dog has lost muscle mass, you'll likely notice some weakness, particularly if your dog has just lost muscle mass in one area. For instance, if your dog has lost muscle mass in the back legs, you may notice that your dog is favoring the front legs instead., When dogs lose muscle mass, they don't want to move around as much. That's because muscle loss makes it more difficult to move about, as it leads to weakness. Therefore, if your dog seems like it just can't move around as much, that could be a sign of muscle loss.Compare one limb with another. If you suspect your dog is losing muscle mass on one leg, compare it with the other side.

, Muscles attach to the bones, helping you stay upright. Therefore, when you have loss of muscle, your posture often changes.The same can happen in dogs, including a sagging back, so pay attention to changes in posture.

, Not every older dog will have muscle loss, but many dogs will. Just like humans, dogs may become less active as they get older, due to a number of reasons, including having less energy and having more aches and pains. Not being as active can lead to muscle loss.To help with muscle loss, try to encourage your dog to be more active.

, If your dog experiences trauma, such as being hit by a car, it may develop lameness in part of its body. In turn, that can lead to muscle loss, as the dog is not as active or isn't using that particular muscle as much.Dogs can develop lameness from other sources, including infection, dislocation of the shoulder, and muscle or bone degeneration.

, Large breeds, such as German Shepherds and Labradors, are more likely to have joint problems, meaning they are more likely to develop arthritis. Arthritis can lead to muscle loss, since it can make your dog reluctant to move as much., For instance, Labrador retrievers are prone to type II muscle fiber deficiency, which they'll generally show before a year of age in muscle loss. German Shepherds, on the other hand, are more likely to develop fibrotic myopathy, which generally shows up the most in the dog's thigh muscles. Certain dogs, such as greyhounds, will develop exertional myopathy if they are forced to use their muscles too much., Before going to your vet, make note of any symptoms you've noticed, no matter how small. Those symptoms will help your vet diagnose what's wrong with your dog, and writing them down as they happen will help you remember them when the time comes to talk to your vet.

, Muscle loss is often a sign of an underlying condition, though it can also just mean your dog is getting older. Either way, it's important to have your dog checked out if you notice a change in its body and behavior.


Diseases that affect muscles can range from fibrotic myopathy and external myopathy to trauma to your dog's muscles.The underlying condition could also be something as simple as arthritis.
You could say, ""I've noticed that my dog is more reluctant to get up lately. His posture has changed; his back is drooping more. Also, I've noticed that he's getting thinner. All of these symptoms together have me worried.""

, Your vet will first perform a physical examination. If they think your dog's condition warrants it, they will move on to other tests, such as blood samples, urine samples, x-rays, an MRI, and/or a CT scan, depending on what the vet thinks may be causing the problem."

Assess your dog's risk.,
Check your dog's gums.,
Identify the different types of epulis.,
Recognize the symptoms of an epulis.,
Visit your veterinarian.,
Have medical testing performed.,
Remove the tumor.,
Use a restrictive collar (cone).,
Make feeding accommodations.,
Limit or restrict your dog's activity.,
Bring your dog in for a follow-up exam.",How to Spot an Epulis in Dogs," Any dog may be susceptible to an epulis tumor; however, some dogs are more prone to this tumor than others, based on their breed and age. By learning your dog's risk of an epulis, you can be more proactive in monitoring your dog's health and looking for any signs of malignant growth in your dog's mouth.


Brachycephalic (short faced) breeds of dog are more likely to develop epulis tumors. This breed category includes dogs that have very short muzzles and noses, including boxers and bulldogs.
Both sexes are equally susceptible to epulis tumors. The main factors are age and breed.
Dogs typically develop epulis tumors in their middle-aged years, usually around the age of seven.;
, An epulis is an oral tumor, meaning it only afflicts a dog's mouth; however, there are a number of places within the mouth where it may appear. The most common areas are on the edges of the gums or between the dog's teeth.Because an epulis can form in multiple places, it may be difficult to diagnose at home if you don't know what you're looking for.
You should typically see some type of firm growth attached to the gum, usually by a stem or stalk-like body.
An epulis is almost always the same color as the dog's gum tissue and may have a smooth or rough appearance, depending on the type of epulis.

, There are three main types of epulis tumors that afflict dogs. They are differentiated based on their composition, appearance, and location in your dog's mouth.Peripheral odontogenic fibroma (POF). Formerly called a fibromatous epulis, this type of tumor is situated on the marginal edges of the gums, usually with a smooth, pink appearance.It consists of tough and fibrous gum tissue.Ossifying epulis. This kind of tumor has a smooth, polished appearance due to the presence of bone cells mixed with fibrous tissue.
Acanthomatous ameloblastoma. These tumors, which may appear smooth or raw, are typically located on the front portion of the dog's lower jaw. It usually has its origins in the ligament that holds a given tooth's roots into the jawbone.

, The physical presence of a growth between the teeth is usually what clues in most dog owners to their pet's affliction. There are several other symptoms that are commonly seen in dogs with an epulis.These symptoms may include:


Frequent drooling
Difficulty eating
Reduced appetite
Bad breath
Bleeding from the tumor
Misaligned teeth surrounding the tumor
Difficulty breathing

, If you think you've spotted an epulis, it's imperative that you get your dog to a vet appointment as soon as possible. Only a veterinarian can definitively diagnose a growth as an epulis, and even your vet will need to conduct tests to determine whether it is benign (a harmless cancer) or malignant (a cancer liable to be aggressive or spread to other parts of the body).

, As part of your visit, your vet will perform a general physical examination in addition to a range of medical tests on the tumor itself. Your vet will also run blood tests to assess the overall health of your dog. This is usually done to identify any other underlying medical problems which may complicate the treatment plan your vet recommends.Your vet will need to either perform a biopsy of the tumor or perform an aspiration to determine whether the tissue is malignant. An aspiration involves a needle puncture to draw cells out of the lymph node and the tumor.
During the procedure, your vet may take a radiograph of your dog's mouth. This is a type of X-ray imaging used to determine how deep the tumor is situated in your dog's gums.
Your vet may also take a radiograph of your dog's chest to see if the tumor has spread to the lungs. The chest radiograph can also be used to assess your dog's ability to undergo anesthesia, should it be necessary for the treatment.
In lieu of a radiograph or in addition to it, your vet may perform a CT scan to check whether the cancer has spread to the lungs and, if it has, how extensively.

, With treatment, there is a good chance (around 95%) that your dog will make a full recovery; however, if any part of the tumor is left behind, or if the tumor is malignant and the cancer has spread, your dog may have a different prognosis for recovery. Only your vet can assess the best treatment option and perform the actual removal.


Depending on the size of the tumor, your vet may be able to treat your dog using radiation therapy alone.For most epulis tumors, surgery will be required.
When the tumor is surgically removed, the vet performing the surgery will need to remove all of the tissues up to and including the periodontal ligament where the tumor originated.
Some surgeries will require the removal of the affected teeth, usually including one or more surrounding teeth as well.Your vet may also need to remove some bone to ensure the tumor does not regrow.Extensive tumors may require the removal of part of the affected jaw on your dog. This is a decision that your vet will have to make on a case-by-case basis.

, The purpose of the restrictive collar is to prevent your dog from scratching the wound with its paws. This can delay the healing process and may even cause an infection. You will need to use the restrictive collar for around 10 to 14 days, or whatever duration your vet recommends.Your vet will most likely provide you with the restrictive collar and any instructions you'll need to maintain your dog's health during the recovery period.
If your vet does not specify, ask how long your dog will need the collar.

, After surgery, your dog may have some limited ability to use their mouth. This usually improves over time, but you'll need to use soft food for at least two to three weeks after the surgery.Use soft canned food to make it easier for your dog to chew. If canned food is not an option, you can soak dry kibble in water until it is softened and almost mushy.
Depending on the extent of the surgery and whether any portion of the jaw was removed, your dog may need a feeding tube during this time.

, After your dog's surgery, you will need to ensure your pet receives plenty of rest. Activity restrictions should last approximately two to four weeks, depending on your vet's recommendations. During this time, your dog will need to have limited activity to allow the incision and any other surgical wounds to heal. Your dog should not be allowed to use chew toys, rawhides, or balls until the wounds are completely healed. In some dogs, this may take up to four weeks.

, You may need to bring your dog in for a follow-up, postoperative exam before your vet can determine that it's safe to stop using the restrictive collar. Your vet will also want to assess the wound to see how well it has healed. Some dogs experience minor complications that may require further procedures, though these would be significantly less serious than the actual surgery.


Incision breakdown is common. This involves a deterioration at the site of the surgery.
Some dogs have increased salivation after this type of surgery. It is usually temporary, but it may persist in some dogs.

Learn about dog massage.,
Know when massage should not be done.,
Get your dog on his side with the bad hip exposed.,
Massage your dog's hip with the flat of your palm.,
Work upwards from the extremity.",How to Relieve Hip Pain in Dogs1," Giving your dog a massage may help to provide stress relief, better circulation, and pain relief. It is also a great way to bond with your dog and it may even help you to detect injuries or other health conditions that may require treatment.Massage is a recognized therapy with beneficial effects that is advocated and practiced by veterinary physiotherapists.;
, A massage is not always the answer to your dog’s pain. In some cases, a massage may make your dog feel worse. You should not massage your dog if he has:


a broken or dislocated hip
an infection in the joint
a skin infection

If you suspect any of these conditions, take your dog to visit your veterinarian right away. These are ailments that need immediate medical treatment by a professional.



, This shouldn't be too hard as he'll likely lay on this side anyway in an effort to keep weight off the affected hip. When you touch the area, you may notice that it's stiff and tense even when it's not being used. This is a good sign that massage can be effective.As long as the skin or bone isn't broken, massage can help alleviate your pup's pain. However, if you notice any skin issues or if your dog is audibly in pain, skip the massage and go straight to your vet for a physical assessment.

, In a rocking motion, apply pressure with the heel of your hand, working upwards towards the heart. Slow and gentle movements are soothing; hard and fast movement stimulates. For pain relief, one motion every five seconds is ideal. Massage the affected limb for 10-20 minutes, two to three times a day.An animal with hip pain will have tense, stiff muscles. The tension in the muscles compresses the joint, making inflamed surfaces rub together, causing further pain. Massage not only helps the muscles to relax, but it also stimulates the release of endorphins – a natural painkiller with a similar chemical composition to morphine.

, To make sure you're massaging the hip correctly, imagine massaging fluid back towards the heart. Working the opposite direction forces blood to pool which can lead to swelling and reduced mobility. It also feels better for your dog to stretch the muscles up instead of forcing them down."
"
Consider using passive mobilization.,
Decide how to position your dog.,
Lay your dog on his good side.,
Begin pushing the thigh backwards.,
Hold this extended position for around 40 seconds and then release.",How to Relieve Hip Pain in Dogs2," Passive mobilization is similar to stretching. Passive mobilization of a hip joint involves gently stretching the affected hind leg backwards, away from the head. Passive mobilization uses gentle limb extensions with the aim of keeping muscles conditioned and joints mobile.The theory behind passive mobilization is that pain restricts the movement of the leg, but then the hip joint becomes stiff, and this leads to a further loss of movement, and the vicious cycle continues until the joint becomes chronically painful and stiff.

, You can use passive mobilization with the dog in a standing or lying down position. If both hips are sore it is better to have the dog lie down since he will be uncomfortable taking extra weight on the opposite hip when one leg is raised.


Try placing a small pillow between your dog’s legs to make him even more comfortable., To use passive mobilization to stretch the left hip, lay the dog on his right side, with the left leg uppermost. For the right hip, lay the dog on his left side, with his right leg uppermost.


This will likely be the position he's most comfortable in anyway. Laying on the opposite side takes the weight and pressure off the bad hip.

, Slide your left hand in front of the thigh halfway down the thigh bone, and cup the cranial muscles in your left palm. Apply gentle but firm pressure so as to push the thigh backwards so that the dog's paws moves backwards, too.Do not force the movement, and stop if the dog gets uncomfortable. You're not trying to improve his flexibility, you're trying to stretch the already taut, stiff muscle.

, Try to do this for two ten minute sessions a day. This helps keep the joint supple and relieves pain.Mobilization is the action of passively extending a limb with the aim of keeping the muscle conditioned and the joint mobile. The theory behind mobilization is that pain restricts the movement of the leg, but then the hip joint becomes stiff, and this leads to a further loss of movement, and a downward cycle of under-use established.

Consider the incubation period.,
Spot general signs of ill health.,
Check your dog for lameness.,
Monitor the lameness for three to four days.,
Check to see if your dog has enlarged lymph nodes.",How to Recognize Lyme's Disease in Dogs1," The incubation period for Lyme's disease is 2 to 5 months. This means that it could take your dog several months to develop symptoms after he has been bit.If you find a tick on your dog, remove it and then monitor your dog for symptoms over the next several months.;
, Dogs with Lyme's disease develop several non-specific signs of ill health. These signs include:


Fever: A dog's temperature is normally 37.9 to 39.0 Celsius. A dog is considered feverish if his temperature is above 39.5 Celsius. The dog may radiate an unusual amount of heat from his body. His paws and nose may feel hot to the touch. He may pant, even in a cool room, and his coat may look dull.
Anorexia: This includes a loss of appetite. A dog that does not eat for several days is in no immediate danger, other than losing weight, but it is a significant general sign of ill health, especially in a normally hungry dog.
Depression: This means the dog loses interest in things he would normally find exciting. This means he chooses to lay in his bed, rather than go for a walk or come running to greet you when you come in from work.

, Lyme's disease has a strong link to lameness. The Borrelia may grow in your dog’s joints or muscles. When this happens, your dog’s body will begin to fight the invasion, which will cause the area to become inflamed. This inflammation can lead to soreness, pain, and lameness. While lameness can occur for reasons other than Lyme's disease (such as arthritis, infection, sprains, and cancer), the symptoms commonly associated with Lyme's disease-induced lameness include:


Acute lameness: This is another way of saying a sudden-onset lameness. Your dog may have been fine the previous day, but wakes up the next feeling dull, feverish, and with marked lameness in one or more legs.
Joint Pain: The affected joint(s) become swollen and warm. They are also tender or painful when touched. If in doubt, compare your dog’s lame leg to his other corresponding leg. The lame leg may look larger or feel hotter than the other.
Walking Stiffly: If the joints in the spine are affected, your dog may walk stiffly with his back hunched and arched. When you stroke his back, he may flinch as if in pain.

, The lameness caused by Lyme’s disease often lasts for only 3 to 4 days, and responds readily to antibiotic therapy with oxytetracycline antibiotics. If left untreated the lameness may resolve but the dog is at risk of going on to develop later clinical signs of the disease (this is discussed in the next section).

, When the body mounts an immune response, the lymph nodes may become flooded with cells ready to fight infection, which causes them to physically enlarge. It is difficult for untrained people to feel these lymph nodes in their dogs, but if they are swollen you may be able to see quail's eggs sized bumps under the skin. When you run fingers over the bumps you will feel a smooth, round swelling.


Common sites of lymph node enlargement are the prescapular (in front of the left and right shoulders) and popliteal (at the back of the left and right knees).

"
"
Start your dog on NSAIDs.,
Give your dog aspirin.,
Consider acetaminophen.",How to Relieve Hip Pain in Dogs3," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescription painkillers that reduce inflammation. They work by inhibiting the ""bad"" COX-2 enzymes that mediate joint inflammation, whilst they have smaller effects on the ""good"" COX-1 enzymes that maintain blood flow to the kidney and stomach lining. In short, they can reduce your dog's pain and inflammation.


These drugs have a high safety margin when used correctly and are less likely to cause unpleasant side effects such as gastric ulceration and bleeding disorders when compared to other painkillers. NSAIDs that are often prescribed by veterinarians are meloxicam (Metacam), carprofen (Rimadyl), and robenacoxib (Onsior).The maintenance dose of metacam is 0.05mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. The oral suspension contains 1.5mg/ml; a typical 30kg Labrador requires 1ml daily on his food.

, Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) can provide mild to moderate pain relief. If no other pain relief is available, a healthy dog may take aspirin at the dose of 10mg/kg twice a day, with or after food. Aspirin commonly comes in 300mg tablets, so a typical dose for a 66lb Labrador would be one tablet twice a day with food.However, long term use is associated with gastric ulceration, especially when given on an empty stomach. This happens because aspirin reduces blood flow to the gut lining, stomach, and kidney. Buffered aspirin may help with this problem, but aspirin should still be used sparingly in a dog.
If your dog requires frequent doses to control its pain, ask your veterinarian to examine your dog and prescribe one of the safer NSAID’s.
Aspirin should never be given in addition to an NSAID medication. When combined, both drugs are even more likely to cause gastric ulceration with serious consequences, including sudden death.

, Acetaminophen, or Tylenol can be given to dogs. However, take care when dosing because exceeding the recommended dose overloads the liver with a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-aminobenzoquinonimine, which can cause liver damage, and ultimately liver failure.The dose is 10mg/kg by mouth, twice a day, with or after food. Most tablets are 500mg and so a 66 pound Labrador can take a maximum of three-fifths of a tablet twice daily. If in doubt, always give a lower dose.
For small dogs, only use the children’s suspension to avoid overdosing the dog.

"
"
Use heat.,
Ask your veterinarian about Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation (TNS).,
Find a veterinarian trained to provide laser acupuncture.",How to Relieve Hip Pain in Dogs4," The application of heat helps dilate blood vessels and stimulates circulation to the hip. In turn, this helps remove noxious toxins that irritate pain receptor nerves. Just be careful you don't burn your dog – always test it on your skin first to make sure it's a safe temperature.A simple method is to use a wheat bag – the sort you heat up in a microwave. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to heat the bag, and with the dog lying down so that the sore hip is accessible, rest the warmed wheat bag over the hip. Leave it there for 10-15 minutes, and then follow with some passive movement exercises.

, This treatment involves the application of a small electrical current to the skin in order to numb sensory nerves and block pain transmission. It does this by stimulating delta fibers that release enkephalin in the spinal cord, which in turn reduces sensitivity to pain.Veterinarians often administer this type of treatment after surgery to help with the pain, but the effects only last for about an hour.

, Veterinarians who are trained in traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) can provide laser acupuncture treatments to your dog to help relieve hip pain. The laser stimulates the release of your dog’s body’s own pain relieving chemicals. Ask your veterinarian for a referral if you are interested in this treatment option."

Understand that your dog may develop critical signs if not treated.,
Check your dog’s renal health.,
Spot neurological symptoms.,
Watch for cardiac signs.",How to Recognize Lyme's Disease in Dogs2," The initial fever, lameness, and lymph node enlargement may pass without treatment, but this does not mean the dog is in the clear. At any stage (days, weeks, months later) the borrelia may cause damage in the heart, kidney, or even brain.

, Although rare, the kidney can be seriously damaged by large quantities of immune-related proteins flooding the kidney and overwhelming its ability to filter and get rid of them in the urine. This damages the kidney and can lead to kidney failure. Signs of this include:


Excessive thirst and urination
Poor appetite
Dehydration
Appetite loss
Vomiting
Stupor

, The Borrelia can localize in the brain and cause altered mood (an increased tendency to aggression is typical) and seizures.


Once these latter symptoms have developed treatment is ineffective because the signs are the result of damage to tissue that cannot repair itself.

, These include a complete heart block which manifests itself as no heartbeat and sudden death

"
"
Get a blood test done for your dog.,
Work with the vet to rule out other conditions.,
Get antibiotics for your dog.",How to Recognize Lyme's Disease in Dogs3," There is a blood test that can show if a dog has been exposed to Borrelia or not. However, this is of limited use because a positive result shows a low tie-up with those that go on to develop clinical disease. Perhaps the test is most useful when it comes back negative, because a dog with a negative titre (reading) cannot have Lyme's disease.

, One diagnostic avenue to pursue is to rule out other conditions which may cause similar symptoms. Thus central nervous system (CNS) fluid may be analyzed to check for meningitis, and joint fluid to rule out joint infections.

, Once your dog has gotten a prescription for oxytetracycline antibiotics, you should be a massive improvement within 2 4 to 48 hours. Because of this, many vets choose to treat the dog for Lyme’s disease, even if they are positive that this is the condition the dog has.


If your sick dog with relevant signs is a lot better the day after starting antibiotics then it is highly likely the condition was Lyme's disease.

Talk with your vet.,
Apply cold therapy to the injured area.,
Use heat therapy.,
Perform range-of-motion (PROM) exercises.,
Massage the injured area.,
Administer pain medication as prescribed.,
Follow up with your vet.",How to Rehabilitate Orthopedic Injuries in Dogs1," Within 24 hours of an orthopedic injury, a dog starts losing muscle mass in the injured area.Even though it will be important to start the rehabilitation process as soon as possible, talk with your vet first. They will recommend a rehabilitation program for your dog. Ask questions when discussing rehabilitation:


How long will rehabilitation take?
What rehabilitation exercises can I perform at home?
Will I need to purchase rehabilitation equipment?
How will I know the rehabilitation is working?
When will my dog need to come back and see you?;
, Cold therapy is most effective within three days of an orthopedic injury. Its benefits include reduction of pain and inflammation.There are several ways you can use cold therapy at home:Prepare a cold pack by placing crushed ice in a plastic bag and wrapping the bag in a thin material, like a pillowcase. Place the cold pack on the injured area for 15–20 minutes.
Apply a cold compress, which you can purchase at your local pharmacy. Cold compresses sometimes contain gel.
Use the cold therapy several times a day, or as directed by your vet.

, Heat therapy is effective starting three days after the orthopedic injury. In addition to reducing pain, heat decreases muscle spasms and improves blood circulation.Hot packs, which contain gel and can be warmed up in the microwave, are a popular choice for heat therapy. Wrap the hot pack in a cloth to prevent burning your dog’s skin.Your vet will prescribe how often to apply the hot pack to the injured area.
Stay with your dog during hot or cold therapy sessions. Remove the hot or cold pack if your dog becomes uncomfortable (whining, trying to move away from the heat or cold).

, When a dog has an orthopedic injury, the joint in the affected area probably won’t be able to move very well. PROM exercises improve joint function, relieve pain, and prevent the affected joints and muscles from contracting (getting smaller).However, make sure that your dog's veterinarian approves of ROM exercises first. Moving a joint with a broken bone or damaged cartilage could cause further harm.


The specific PROM exercises you perform will depend on which joint (elbow, hip, shoulder, knee) is affected by the orthopedic injury.
In general, PROM exercises involve slowly and gently moving a joint through its natural range of motion of flexing (bending), extending (straightening out), or rotating.
PROM exercises are passive, meaning your dog is resting while you do the work. Position a pillow between your dog’s legs to ensure your dog’s body is properly aligned., A massage for your dog may sound luxurious, but it actually has real therapeutic benefit after an injury. Not only will a massage help your dog feel better overall, but it will also improve its blood circulation and flexibility.Follow a few tips to make the massage positive experience:Massage your dog after it’s gone to the bathroom and eaten.
Create a quiet, comfortable massage area. Have your dog rest on a few layers of thick blankets and play soft, soothing background music.
Speak to your dog softly to help it feel at ease.

, Your dog will probably be in pain after its orthopedic injury. Therefore, controlling pain with medication is an important aspect of rehabilitation.Your vet will prescribe an oral pain medication, such as carprofen, for your dog.


Do not give human medication to dogs unless you have been instructed to do so by the vet.
Not all dogs like taking pills. If that describes your dog, consider putting the pill in a tasty pill pocket. You can purchase packs of pill pockets at your local pet store.

, After you have rehabilitated your dog at home for a few weeks, your vet will want to see your dog again. They will examine the injured area, assess your dog's pain, and determine how well your dog can move. During this appointment, your vet may recommend more extensive rehabilitation at a veterinary rehabilitation center.


Your vet can refer you to veterinary rehabilitation centers in your area.

"
"
Have a physical therapist examine your dog.,
Discuss rehabilitation options.,
Ask questions about the rehabilitation.,
Schedule appointments with the physical therapist.",How to Rehabilitate Orthopedic Injuries in Dogs2," If at-home rehabilitation is not enough for your dog, then additional rehabilitation services would be needed. When you visit a veterinary rehabilitation center, a veterinary physical therapist will perform a thorough physical examination to assess the orthopedic injury and design a treatment plan., A veterinary rehabilitation center has many therapeutic options for helping a dog recover from injury. The physical therapist will decide which options will help your dog. Examples of these options are:Heated, underwater treadmill
Fitness balls (strengthens muscles, increases flexibility)
Ultrasound therapy (helps break up scar tissue, improves blood circulation, speeds up healing)
Electrical nerve stimulation (reduces pain, prevents muscle loss)
Laser therapy (reduces pain and inflammation)

, You’ll probably have a lot of questions about what your dog will be doing at the rehabilitation center. During your appointment, don’t hesitate to ask questions:


How long will my dog need to receive the extra rehabilitation? When will you know that my dog is fully recovered?
Can I stay with my dog during its rehabilitation sessions?
Should I continue doing rehabilitation at home?
How much will these rehabilitation services cost? Are they covered by pet insurance?
What if my dog isn’t comfortable with certain exercises, like the underwater treadmill?

, Once you are comfortable with what rehabilitation services your dog will receive, schedule the appointments.You can either schedule the appointments one a time or schedule a series of appointments at once.


Choose a schedule that will allow you to conveniently drop off and pick up your dog.

Have your dog vaccinated.,
Get your dog regular booster shots.To maintain protection, the first booster is given when the dog is one-year old and then every three-years thereafter for the remainder of the dog's life.,
Keep young, unvaccinated puppies away from wildlife.,
Remember that vaccination is required by law in most cases.,
Keep your dog away from wild animals.,
Discourage wild animals from visiting your yard.Many people simply let their dogs out into their yards to go to the bathroom or to exercise.,
Make sure your dog will come when called.,
Contact your veterinarian if your unvaccinated dog is bitten by an unknown aggressor.,
Notify your veterinarian if your unvaccinated dog is bitten by an unvaccinated dog you know or a wild animal that you caught.,
Report it to your veterinarian if your unvaccinated dog bites another dog or a person.,
Learn about the rabies virus.,
Understand the incubation period for rabies.,
Be aware of the symptoms of rabies.",How to Prevent Rabies in Dogs," The first vaccine is given to puppies from 12 weeks of age.Check with your veterinarian about when your puppy is ready to be vaccinated.


If you have found a dog or adopted a dog whose history you don't know, be sure to get it vaccinated.
Once your dog is vaccinated, you should get a certificate that it has been done for your records.
Stray dogs are especially at risk of getting rabies, as they have not been vaccinated. That is why limiting the stray pet population by spaying and neutering is an important part of preventing rabies in general.;
, This helps protect the dog from infection should it be bitten by an animal, such as infected wildlife or another dog.


It also makes it unlikely that the dog could transfer infection to a person should the dog bite someone.

, Young puppies that are not old enough to be vaccinated can be susceptible to rabies infection.While those puppies that are birthed from mothers that are vaccinated should have some immunities passed on from the mother, if the mother's immunity status is unknown, the puppy could be infected by contact with infected wildlife.

, Most states have their own law about whether rabies vaccination is a legal requirement for pet cats and dogs.It is best to check your state law to confirm the rules as they apply in your region.

, Wild animals can carry rabies, so be cautious about letting your dog near them. Supervise your pets outdoors and don't let them roam too far away from your eyesight.


Discourage your dog from interacting with unknown animals, domestic and wild., This is a time when your dog can come into contact with wild animals, if the wild animals have wandered into your yard.


To deter wild animals, make sure trashcans are secure. This will assure that food does not attract them in. Clear rubbish and fallen leaves that could act as cover for wildlife. You can also plant plants that wild animals don't like the smell of or use commercial products that keep wild animals away.In addition, don't feed your pets outdoors. Leftover food could attract wild animals.

, If you insist on letting your dog off leash at times, you should at least be sure that it will come immediately when called. This will allow you to stop it from interacting with any wild animals it comes across. Train your dog to have a strong recall so that you can call it out of trouble.


Be wary of approaching animals you do not know or wildlife that is unusually docile, as this can be a sign of rabies infection. If your dog won't leave the animal alone, don't put yourself in danger as well by trying to physically intervene.

, If your dog is not vaccinated and is bitten by wildlife or a dog of unknown status who then runs off, then you must tell your veterinarian. It may be necessary to put the dog into quarantine for six months.This is to separate your dog in case it caught infection off the stray and is incubating infection. In this case, it would therefore be a risk to other animals.
Sadly, there is no blood test that can be done on a live animal that will confirm if it has an active infection or not. This means the only option is to wait and see if symptoms develop within a six month period. If the dog is still well at the end of this time, the infection is unlikely.
This quarantine period may either be in a special state approved facility or within your own home, depending on individual state law.

, Catching the aggressor, whether wild or not, will allow your dog to go through a shorter quarantine period, usually 10 days. This is because the other animal can also be quarantined to check that it does not have rabies.The virus is only infectious when the animal starts to show signs of the disease. Since death occurs with five days of showing signs, if the biting animal is still healthy five days after the bite, then the animal it bit is not at risk.

, If your dog is the aggressor and it is unvaccinated, or its vaccination status is unknown, then it needs to be quarantined. It may be put into a 10-day period of quarantine.The 10 day quarantine guarantees that your dog has not infected the other dog. If your dog does not show signs of infection in 5 days, it means that it could not have infected the other dog or human. The infected animal is only contagious within 5 days of showing the first signs of infection.

, The rabies virus can infect any warm-blooded animal, including humans. It is invariably fatal once symptoms begin to appear.It is transmitted in the saliva of infected animals and attacks the central nervous system., Rabies has a long incubation period before the animal shows signs, however once symptoms develop it is usually fatal within 5 days.How long the incubation period is depends on how far away from the brain the bite was.


The virus travels from the bite to the brain via nerves, so the greater the distance, the longer it takes for signs to show up. The strength of the host's immune system can also determine how long the incubation period is.Those animals in poor health with weak immune systems will succumb more quickly that fit animals.
An average incubation period is on average three to eight weeks. However, in exceptional cases it can be as short as nine days and as long as several years.

, During the incubation period the animal shows no signs. Once the virus reaches the brain, the first symptom is often behavioral changes. This could be a change in the dog's character from loving to aggressive, or the other way around. Many dogs appear extremely anxious or, conversely, can be much more friendly than usual.The next stage is the dog becomes over sensitive to light and sound. It may have seizures and it may also become dangerously aggressive.Then in the final stages of the disease, the dog develops paralysis of the head and neck muscles and is unable to swallow. This leads to drooling saliva that it has produced but cannot swallow.
Death is from paralysis of the respiratory muscles.

"
Look for respiratory tract signs.,
Inspect the dog’s eyes.,
Check for a fever.,
Look for a lack of appetite.,
Check the dog’s pads.,
Look at your puppy’s teeth.,
Be mindful of more severe symptoms.,
Know that some symptoms may overlap with other conditions.",How to Recognize Distemper Symptoms in Dogs1," The first symptoms usually affect the respiratory tract. Your dog may sneeze, cough, or have thick mucus in his nose.Your dog may have labored breathing if the infection is in his chest. Oftentimes, the dog will develop inflamed and infected nasal passages, which causes snotty nasal discharge.Dogs with poor immune systems may develop pneumonia.;
, When a dog has distemper, her eyes usually have a thick mucus around them. This could look like a gummy, sticky discharge. Eyes with mucus and a snotty nose in a dog not vaccinated more than likely points to distemper., Distemper can be accompanied by a fever. The fever is usually extremely high (over 103.5 °F or 39.7 °C).The fever tends to make most dogs lethargic, listless, and lacking in energy, so the dog may be reluctant to go for walks or prefer to sleep and rest.

, Dogs with distemper may stop eating. This may be caused by the fever or because they feel unwell. They also may stop drinking, which can cause dehydration.Dogs may suddenly start vomiting or have diarrhea as well, which can also lead to dehydration., Distemper can cause abnormalities to the pads of the dog’s feet, like enlargement or thickening.This may cause him to walk strangely or avoid walking, running, or standing. This is a late stage development, so be alert for other signs first.


Be careful when you examine. The pads may be tender and he may snap at you because of the discomfort.

, For puppies who have not received their adult teeth, distemper can affect their permanent teeth. The adult teeth can be weak or misshapen because the enamel doesn’t form.This can also cause discolored teeth.


This is also a symptom that may arise in the later stages of distemper.

, In more severe cases, or in later stages of the disease, the virus can attack the dog’s bodily systems, especially the nervous system. This can lead to seizures, fits, hysteria, and paralysis., Many of the symptoms are nonspecific, which means that other conditions apart from distemper can cause similar signs. Usually dogs with distemper are extremely ill. If you are unsure, take your dog to the vet immediately.If you see any of these symptoms and you did not vaccinate your dog, see the vet immediately.

"
"
Vaccinate your dog.,
Keep your dog away from infected fluids.,
Clean the dog’s living area.,
Know how distemper is treated.",How to Recognize Distemper Symptoms in Dogs2," One of the most commons ways a dog gets distemper is through exposure to the virus without having an immunity to it. This means that both unvaccinated puppies and unvaccinated older dogs are at risk for the disease.Some dogs have a natural immunity to the disease, but you should not rely on that.Vaccinating helps keep your dog from getting distemper. If the dog contracts the disease, she could die or have lasting neurological or retinal damage., Distemper can be spread through contact with contaminated fluids, like urine, blood, mucus, or saliva. This can happen through physical exposure or contaminated food and water bowls. The disease can also be spread through sneezing or coughing.


Try to separate your dog from infected animals.In very young dogs, keep them away from any areas likely to exposure, like kennels.

, Keeping your dog’s kennel or home area disinfected can help get rid of the virus. This is especially important if your dog interacts with other dogs at public places, like pet stores, parks, or kennels., No medication will cure distemper. Instead, dogs are cured through supportive care. Dogs are given antibiotics to fight secondary infections and fluids to help with dehydration.If the dog recovers, an unfortunate late development can be seizures because of the virus in the dog's brain. Some dogs may recover but develop an old dog encephalopathy in later life, which means they develop a form of dementia brought on by long term low grade inflammation in the brain.

Encourage the use of all the mammary glands.,
Provide your dog with proper nutrition.,
Spay your dog.",How to Prevent Mastitis in Dogs1," The dog’s teats will naturally flush out bacteria as the milk is pushed out of it. This means it is very important that the puppies use all the teats as they nurse. This helps keep the teats healthy and the bacteria flushed from them.If the teats are not being used, try to manually get the puppies to use them. If this doesn’t work, you may need to squeeze milk from the teats. This helps release any milk contaminated by bacteria, and helps expel the bacteria so it doesn’t end up in the bloodstream.;
, Malnutrition may lead to a lowered immune system that can’t fight off bacteria. This may make the dog vulnerable to mastitis. Feed your dog the proper foods to get the best nutrition. Feed the dog multiple meals throughout the day. Slowly increase how much food you give the dog each day. The dog will need more food because of the increased milk production needed to feed the puppies.You may consider giving the dog puppy food, which has a higher calorific value than regular dog food.

, The only way to guarantee your dog won’t get mastitis is to spay the dog. Mastitis only occurs in female dogs that have given birth and have lactating mammary glands. Spaying keeps the dog from getting into the situations that leads to the condition.This may be a good idea if you have a dog who has previously had mastitis. Dogs who have had the condition before are at a higher risk of getting it again.

Look for swelling of the chin.,
Watch for swelling under the tongue.,
Check for salivary mucoceles in other places.,
Check for trouble eating.,
Look for bloody saliva.,
Watch for difficulty breathing or swallowing.,
Look for infection.,
Determine if your dog is a higher risk breed.",How to Recognize and Treat Salivary Mucocele in Dogs1," One of the major signs that a dog might have a salivary mucocele is swelling under the chin. The swelling occurs in the angle of the jaw. In the early stages, the swelling sits to either the left or the right side. The longer the mucocele has been present, the more it spreads and it can be difficult to tell which side it arose from.If you notice something isn't quite right with the dog's chin, make a mental note of which side was swollen first. This helps the vet figure out which gland is damaged. If in doubt as to which side is affected, stand directly in front of the dog and compare one side with the other to see which is more swollen.
The swelling will probably feel a bit squishy when you press it, like a fluid-filled balloon.;
, This swelling can be more difficult to spot. Sometimes the swelling is subtle and can be there for a long time before it becomes large enough to be noticeable. This swelling looks like large pink bubbles or cysts under the tongue, and they can reach a size where they displace how the tongue sits and push it over to one side. Swelling under the tongue can also cause problems chewing or cause bloody saliva.To check for swellings under the tongue, watch the dog very carefully when she yawns. Alternatively, open her mouth and gently move the tongue to one side so that you can get a look underneath.

, In rare cases, a salivary mucocele might appear at the back of the throat or on the eyelids.A salivary mucocele on the throat can cause difficulty swallowing or breathing.One in the eye can cause eye pressure and pain.Look for swelling along the eyelids or in the throat region.

, Since salivary mucoceles aren’t generally painful, your dog won’t display signs of pain. A salivary mucocele in the mouth can make it hard for the pet to eat because the tongue is displaced. This can cause her to bite down on her tongue or make it difficult to eat.She may also have trouble chewing on toys.

, Sometimes, saliva in the mouth may be bloody. This is as a result of trauma to the salivary gland.The saliva will likely be pink tinged or light red.

, If the dog has a salivary mucocele on the throat, it might not be detected from the outside. Instead, look for signs of respiratory distress or any trouble swallowing. These symptoms should be seen by a doctor immediately since the mucocele can blow the airways., In some cases, especially when left untreated, the mucoceles can reach large sizes and become infected. This can cause pain and damage to the tissue. Look for large pockets of swelling accompanied by pain., Any dog can get a salivary mucocele regardless of breed or age. However, some breeds are at a higher risk than others. Dachshunds, German Shepherds, Poodles, and Australian Silky Terriers are at a high risk for salivary mucoceles."

Keep the living area clean.,
Clean the mammary glands regularly.,
Groom the dogs.",How to Prevent Mastitis in Dogs2," Mastitis is a bacterial infection. One of the main ways dogs come in contact with the bacteria is from unclean living areas. To help prevent the bacteria from infecting your dog, change the bedding where the dog and puppies lay often. Make sure to clean the area as well.Many cases of mastitis start from the opening of the teat, so helping keep the environment clean can help prevent this.

, Since bacteria gets into the mammary glands to cause mastitis, you should clean the dog’s mammary gland are regularly. Use a warm compress to clean around the area every day.You should make sure to clean any wounds around the mammary glands that may be caused by a puppy’s claws.
Clean the underside of your dog after they go outside. Remove dirt and debris from around the teats. You should also clean them to make sure no urine has accidentally splashed onto the mammary glands.

, Another way to help prevent infection is to keep the dogs groomed. This includes the mother and the puppies. Start by shaving the hair around the mammary glands on the mother. This is important for longhaired dogs, since the hair can pick up bacteria and infect the glands.Keep the nails on the puppies trimmed. This helps reduce the risk of the puppies scratching the mother.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Treat mastitis.",How to Prevent Mastitis in Dogs3," When you have a dog who has just given birth, you should watch for the symptoms of mastitis. Mastitis can be a mild condition you can treat at home, but it can also turn into a severe condition that can lead to death. Common symptoms of mastitis include:Pus or bloody discharge from the teats
Red, swollen, warm, hard, or painful mammary glands
Lethargy or depression
Loss of appetite or dehydration
Fever
Reluctance to nurse or neglect of the puppies
Aggressive behavior
Failure of puppies to thrive or grow
Crying or whining from puppies

, If you believe your dog has mastitis, you should take them to the vet. This is important because mastitis can move quickly and turn severe, which may lead to death. The vet can properly diagnose mastitis by performing a physical exam and running tests.The vet may be able to diagnose mastitis from only a physical exam. They may also take a bacterial culture, milk sample, or do a needle aspiration of the mammary tissue to analyze.

, Mastitis has a good prognosis, especially if it is caught early. The most common treatment for mastitis is antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. If the mastitis is severe, the dog may need to have the mammary glands surgically lanced and drained, or they may have to have them removed.Applying a warm compress to the mammary glands can help reduce swelling and help the milk flow normally.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Drain the mucocele.,
Give the dog antibiotics.,
Remove the salivary mucocele surgically.",How to Recognize and Treat Salivary Mucocele in Dogs2," If your dog has signs of a salivary mucocele, you need to take her to the vet. Your vet may refer your dog to a specialist, depending on the amount of damage or the infected glands., The vet can drain or lance the salivary mucocele. However, this is a temporary solution. Generally, the mucocele will come back after draining., If your dog has an infection that occurred because of the salivary mucocele, your vet might prescribe antibiotics to rid the dog of the infection prior to any surgical treatments. Antibiotics might also be prescribed to help reduce the inflammation., Most of the time, treatment for this is surgical. This helps reduce any recurring inflammation. Your vet will diagnose the dog and determine the best kind of treatment for your dog’s case.


This is why it’s important to know which side the swelling started on. A vet will need to know which side the infected gland is on so she can remove it.
Sometimes, if the swelling is under the tongue, the salivary glands under the tongue can be removed, but this can be demanding. Instead, many surgeons favor marsupialization of the swelling. This means they make an incision into the lump to let it drain out, then suture the edges to the tongue so that the lump stays permanently open and saliva cannot build up again. Instead, it drains into the mouth.However, some surgeons believe this method is ineffective."

Look for symptoms of Dwarfism in your dog.,
Consider whether there's really a problem.,
Look for possible breathing difficulties.,
Look for skeletal abnormalities.,
Help them with any pain from weight.,
Help with any breathing concerns.,
Address spine pain.,
Treat any issues with teeth.,
Look for signs of mega-esophagus.,
Address any skin issues.",How to Recognize and Treat Dwarfism in Dogs," If you have a puppy who seems to be developing with these traits they may have dwarfism.


Short legs with larger joints (usually in the correct proportion to one another; seen in virtually all dwarf dogs)
Under bite (front upper teeth are behind the front lower teeth when the mouth is shut)
Large head in proportion to body
Excessive panting
Snoring
Under bite
Bulging eyes
Pain of the spine;
, As mentioned many of these traits may not be a concern for the dog. As a puppy grows some of these traits may be decreased or increased, it is important to recognize them early so you can pick up on any changes that may be a sign of discomfort.


If you are considering getting a puppy of a breed that has these dwarf traits, consider a well-recognized breeder who recognizes the potential health risks of their breed. Not all breeders are concerned with maximizing the health of their puppies. You need to be critical of a breeder. Often exaggerating the traits that the breed is known for can be done most easily with inbreeding leading to sever health issues. For pets form a pet store it is always a gamble with the health of the puppy. Puppies with these symptoms that are mix bred often have fewer health risks.

,  These symptoms are most likely suffering from breathing difficulties .


Possible symptoms include:

Snoring
Excessive panting
Breathing through mouth only
Under bite
Caved in appearance of the muscle
Loud, snoring-like or difficult breathing


These symptoms may not be due to dwarfism but they should be monitored. There are surgical procedures available for sever cases to reduce the amount of tissue in the nasal cavity that is likely causing the issue. In puppies this is only recommended in severe cases, as the dog is still developing and this procedure may lead to further issues.

, As mentioned some breeds will have shorter legs, and they will be perfectly happy and healthy. Some exceptions may include:


Disproportionate lengths in front and back legs. If your dog’s legs are disproportion you may need to purchase a rolling brace to allow them to move more easily.
Bowed legs. You will notice this more easily in the front legs. Bowing legs is something you should treat. While several things can cause this, a good calcium diet will help your dog’s bones develop and prevent uncomfortable bowing.  Large breeds can be put on a diet that will slow explosive growth and be fed supplements to strengthen and fortify bone development. The earlier you detect and treat this, the less risks your dog will face.

,  For large breeds that spring up to size rapidly with dwarfism. The difference in the structure of their legs can cause difficulty walking and often pain. Extra weight can increase this pain so getting more activity and a healthy diet is key. To help develop muscles, a swimming pool or lake is a very good option. Like humans with leg injuries, water therapy can take their body weight off their legs and allow it to build more easily. Go swimming with them. Depending on the breed you may want to purchase a life jacket for your dog to ensure their head stays above water.

, To keep breathing issues from affecting your dog’s health you can:


Minimize intense activity. This can be difficult with an energetic puppy, but try to take them on light walks and keep them in a calmer state
Try oxygen therapy. If a puppies tong turns blue or their gums appear pale, they are not getting enough oxygen. This type of treatment will require a special mask for your dog that you will hold on their snout. If you do not have this system on hand seek emergency care immediately.

, If a dog is experiencing pain in their spine you will want to determine the cause as soon as possible. Take your dog to the vet. Dogs with dwarfism are much more likely to develop serious spine issues, which can potentially cause paralysis. Inter vertebral Disc Disease is one such issue which has several forms that can occur at any point on the spine. Symptoms will include


Reluctance to preform usual activities

lack of enthusiasm for walks
lack of interest in treats
no interest in play


Pain during petting or grooming exhibited by

yelping
withdrawing
nipping
shaking


Fatigue. You will want your vet to examine your dog’s spine and preform x-rays to determine what the exact cause of the pain is. """"For treatment”“ your vet will discuss the possibility of physical therapy, massages, or surgical options. It is very important that you contact your vet immediately if you notice spinal pain as delaying increases the risk for lack of mobility and nerve damage.

, Similar to yourself, a dog will loose their puppy teeth once they reach adult hood. If a puppy tooth is not properly erupted it can cause pain while eating and a lack of desire to eat. """"Do not attempt to pull"""" these teeth can often have very long roots and can be extremely painful to remove. Attempted removal may result in sever gum tearing Your vet will be fully prepared to remove the tooth for you and may locally numb or sedate the dog depending on temperament and severity.

, This is an issue with swallowing food. This occurs from paralysis of the esophagus, and can lead to food or water resting in the esophagus or aspirating into the lungs. Investigate how to care for them.

, Thinning of the skin, scaling, and wrinkling are found in some dogs with dwarfism. Thin skin may result in skin being torn more easily(sometimes from grooming), scales can irritate the skin, and wrinkles if not cleaned can result in infection.


For thin skin. Use specialty brushes soft silicone brushes are available that will reduce skin injury. If your dog gets cut easily during play, you may need to reduce brush in your yard that can snag their skin. Try to reduce any rough play if this causes bleeding.
For scaly skin. This is simply a result of dry and irritated skin, but it should be treated if your dog is uncomfortable. Special shampoos are available for dogs with this condition that help eliminate residue and improve moisture for their skin.
Wrinkles aren’t too tough to deal with you will just want to be aware of them. Your dog may need regular bathing, but you can also purchase a cleaning solution that you can apply with a cotton ball.

Direct dogs away from mushrooms.,
Inspect areas for mushrooms.,
Learn about different strains of mushrooms.,
Identify toxic mushrooms in your area.,
Collect any pieces of the mushroom you can.,
Call your veterinarian, an emergency pet hospital, or an animal poison control center.If your dog eats a wild mushroom, get professional advice on how to proceed.,
Take your dog in for treatment.",How to Protect Your Dog from Toxic Mushrooms," When taking your dog for a walk, don't let it get too close to wild mushrooms. Your dog may pull and be insistent about wanting to sniff, or chomp, a mushroom, but you should be firm and resolute about keeping it away.


Most mushrooms you will come into contact with will not be poisonous. In fact, ninety nine percent are not toxic. However, one percent are and those will make your dog very ill, or even kill it.Don't assume that your dog will know the difference between edible and toxic mushrooms. There are some toxic mushrooms that are especially attractive to dogs, as they smell ""fishy."";
, If you are going to let your dog roam free in an area, you should be sure it is free of hazards, including mushrooms. It is easy to do this in a small yard, as you can do a routine scan of the area quickly. However, for a large yard or an unenclosed area, this can be difficult.


Remove any mushrooms that you find in your yard. It is best to eliminate the risk of your dog taking interest in them if you can.

, If you are interested in mushrooms and want to keep your dog away from toxic ones, spend some time studying different types of mushrooms and their properties. If you become a skilled mushroom expert, you will be able to protect your dog more effectively from mushrooms. To begin with, there are four main types of mushrooms that cause distinct issues. These include:Hepatotoxic: This category includes death cap mushrooms and they usually cause liver failure within six to twelve hours and death between one to two days. This type of mushroom is especially dangerous because the symptoms are delayed, so a dog owner may think that everything is alright when it is not.
Neurotoxic: These mushrooms will rapidly cause neurological problems, such as seizures, weakness, hallucinations, lethargy, and tremors. Additionally, they cause gastrointestinal problems.
Gastrointestinal: There are many types of mushrooms that will give your dog intestinal and digestive problems. These symptoms will usually come on very rapidly, sometimes as quick as fifteen minutes after eating the mushroom.
Nephrotoxic: The toxicity of these mushrooms in dogs is up for debate. However, they are said to cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and dehydration long after ingestion, usually after about twelve hours.

, If you are going to protect your dog from toxic mushrooms, you should focus on being able to identify those toxic mushrooms that are common in your area. Knowing what will, and what won't, hurt your dog is a key way of protecting it.


There are mycological societies in many towns and cities. Contact your local mycological society for information on mushroom identification classes or for specific information about species in your area., Identifying the mushroom your dog ate will help with your dog's treatment. Place the pieces of mushroom in a paper bag and refrigerate it if possible.Avoid putting the mushroom in a plastic bag. This will cause the mushroom to decay too quickly.
You will also want to note where the mushroom was and what conditions it was growing in. This will help in identifying it.

, They will advise you what you should do. Usually, if you are unsure what type of mushroom your dog ingested, you will be advised to bring your dog and a specimen of the mushroom in for evaluation.


If your veterinary office is open, call them, especially if the office is close by. If there is a veterinary hospital close by, you may want to take your dog there instead of your normal clinic, if that is far away.
If you have no veterinary services close by, then calling the animal poison control center will be your best bet.

, Even if your dog does not have symptoms right away, it's important to have your dog seen by a veterinarian to be safe. Bring your dog, and whatever piece of the mushroom you could get your hands on, into your veterinary office.If your veterinary office is closed, you should take your dog to an emergency veterinary hospital. You may have a vet bill because your dog ate a non-toxic mushroom, but on the other hand it could save your dog's life.
If your dog has no symptoms, your veterinarian may still make it throw up, give it charcoal pills, and may run some blood tests to look for toxins.If it is confirmed that your dog has eaten a toxic mushroom, your veterinarian will give it appropriate treatment for the type of toxin infested. This may include anything from surgical decontamination to simply supportive care until symptoms subside.

Be wary of using antibiotics to prevent pyometra.",How to Prevent Pyometra in Dogs," Pyometra is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition that takes two forms: open and closed. The difference between the two is as follows:


With open pyometra the cervix is open, which allows some pus drainage from the womb; with closed pyometra the cervix is shut which prevents drainage and means the womb may distend to the point where it ruptures.
However the womb can still rupture with open pyometra if the volume of pus produced in the womb exceeds that rate at which it drains away. In this case, sufficient pressure may build up to distend and rupture the womb.;
, Pyometra is most likely to occur around 4 to 8 weeks after the end of heat, although it can occur at any stage of a female dog's reproductive cycle. The condition is caused by the influence of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone on the lining of the womb.


Hormonal stimulation causes cystic proliferation of the womb wall and an increased amount of secretions. These secretions may become contaminated by bacteria present in the vagina that ascend into the womb. The combination of increased secretions and the presence of bacteria may lead to a womb infection.
The more hormonal stimulation the womb receives in the form of repeated estrous cycles, the greater the likelihood of pyometra developing. Thus, older dogs (over the age of 6 years) are more likely to suffer from pyometra. However, occasionally a young dog is unfortunate and gets pyometra after her first or second season.

, The accumulation of pus inside the womb causes toxicity, and these toxins are absorbed across the lining of the womb and enter the blood stream. This is a form of septicemia and it can cause organ damage and failure.


The signs of pyometra are largely associated with the dog feeling unwell, drinking excessively to try to dilute the toxins in her blood stream, and vomiting. Thus the symptoms include poor appetite, lethargy, and vomiting. In addition, the dog is often very thirsty.
If she has an open pyometra she may spend a lot of time licking her vulva and you might see pus staining her bedding. In extreme cases of closed pyometra her belly may become swollen.

, The only guaranteed way of preventing pyometra is to spay the dog. However, a wise precaution that helps to decrease the risk of (but not necessarily prevent) pyometra, is to avoid the use of hormones which postpone heat.


Some breeders with valuable breeding dogs have also toyed with using antibiotics during the dog's heat (more of this in part three) but this is unproven to be beneficial and spaying is a much safer option.

, Spaying is the removal of the dog's ovaries, both horns of the uterus, and the body of the uterus down to the level of the cervix. This is a surgical procedure most often performed via an open laparotomy. This is where the surgeon opens the dog's abdomen under sterile, surgical conditions, to gain access to the structures inside.


This operation is routine surgery which is none-the-less treated with a great deal of respect. There is a small risk of hemorrhage during the operation because the surgeon has to tie off major arteries to the ovaries and the cervix.
This risk is minimal in fit, lean dogs because there is minimal intra-abdominal fat and the surgeon can get a good grip for the ligatures. In older, fatter dogs the risk rises because fat cloaking the ovarian pedicles makes the ligatures slightly more likely to slip.

, Spaying your dog has distinct health benefits for her. Not only does it remove the risk of pyometra (as she no longer has a womb to become infected) but if performed before her second season there is also a protective effect against mammary cancer in later life.


That said, a female dog can be spayed at any age, it's just that the benefit against mammary cancer is lost after twp or more seasons.
Additionally, the spay operation needs to be timed between estrous cycles so that the surgery occurs when there is less of a blood supply to the womb and the uterine tissue is least friable.

, A female dog usually has two heat seasons a year and each is a huge hormonal event. There is a lead-in period whereby the blood supply to the womb increases, which then tails off after the season.


This increased blood supply makes the tissue more crumbly or friable; this means that the uterine body or horns are more likely to fall apart in the surgeon's hands, causing an increased risk of serious hemorrhage.
To avoid this, the ideal time to operate is when the womb is at its most hormonally quiet, which is a window of time that starts about two months after the end of the previous season up to around one month before the start of the next one.

, Hormone injections slightly increase the risk of a dog getting pyometra.


A single injection of delvosteron (see below) increases the chance of pyometra by 0.3%, whilst repeated injections carry an increased incidence of 1.4%.
Whilst avoiding hormone injections is not a true ""prevention"", by avoiding them it removes a risk factor for pyometra development., Hormone injections were once used more frequently than they now are, to prevent a female dog coming into heat at an inconvenient time.


However, greater knowledge about the risks of inducing diseases like pyometra, mammary cancer, and conditions such as diabetes mellitus has led to a fall in their use.
The most commonly used hormone to postpone heat is Delvosterone, which contains proligestone – a synthetic progestin. The latter is a hormone associated with pregnancy, so the injection fools the body into thinking the dog is pregnant, and hence she doesn't come into heat. Each injection works for around 4-6 months.

, This is an unproven method of preventing pyometra that has not undergone scientific trials and the results of which are largely anecdotal.


Breeders with valuable stud animals are keen to reduce the risk of pyometra any way they can because they do not want their stock animals neutered. The theory behind antibiotic use is to put the dog onto long courses of antibiotics during her season. This is because the cervix is open during estrous, so there is a theoretical increased risk of bacteria ascending up into the womb.
However, the presence of bacteria is only one factor in the development of pyometra, because significant thickening of the womb wall and increased glandular secretions must take place for the bacteria to colonize. Taking antibiotic does nothing to influence the anatomical changes taking part in the womb as a result of hormonal stimulation.

Know the signs that your dog has diarrhea.,
Isolate the cause of your dog’s diarrhea, if possible.,
Understand potential concerns.",How to Treat Dog Diarrhea With Natural Cures," If your dog has diarrhea, don’t give it any food for twelve to twenty-four hours.If your veterinarian recommends it, you may need to withhold food for up to forty-eight hours.A period without food will give your dog’s gastrointestinal tract time to rest and for any irritating substance to pass.;
, Diarrhea can mean the loss of large amounts of fluid. While your dog should not eat at first, it should have access to plenty of clean, fresh water so it doesn’t become dehydrated., There are a number of natural and herbal treatments that can help to treat your dog’s diarrhea. Talk to your veterinarian about the best choices for your dog, where to find these treatments, and how to administer them. Possibilities include:


Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus sporogenes and Saccharomyces boulardii.These help to replenish good intestinal bacteria that aid digestion and help prevent infection. Your veterinary clinic can also supply an over-the-counter dog probiotic that has the correct balance of probiotics for dogs.
Amino acids, like L-Glutamine.This helps to nourish the cells of the intestinal tract and support its proper functioning.
Herbs and herbal supplements, like Slippery Elm and Boswellia, which are traditionally used to treat diarrhea in humans.. These contain substances that may also help coat, soothe, and protect the mucus membranes of your dog’s gastrointestinal tract and/or reduce inflammation.

, Normally, you can begin to give your dog solid food again after twenty-four hours. However, you should feed your dog a “bland” diet for three to four days.Feeding your dog small amounts of easily digestible, low-fat foods several times a day will reduce nausea and gastrointestinal irritation. A bland diet means mixing four parts cottage cheese, boiled white rice, boiled white pasta, boiled potato to one part any of the following foods:


Boiled lean hamburger
Boiled skinless chicken
Boiled tofu

, If your dog improves while on a bland diet for a few days, you can slowly switch back to its normal food. Take three to five days to transition the dog off the bland diet and back to its regular food.


Be careful of transitioning too suddenly. Take it slow.

, Ensuring that your dog continues to eat enough fiber can also help it recover.Pumpkin, because it is high in fiber and water, is safe to feed your dog and can be a good choice for one recovering from diarrhea. Feed your dog equal parts canned pumpkin puree and canned dog food, or even just a few tablespoons added to its regular food.Be absolutely sure to buy canned pumpkin puree, and not pumpkin pie mix.

, Normally, a dog should recover from diarrhea fairly soon. Prolonged diarrhea could be a sign of parasites like roundworms and hookworms, bacterial infections, allergies, poisoning, or other issues.Bring your dog to a veterinarian if:Your dog has had diarrhea for more than a day. If the diarrhea persists for 24 hours after you stop feeding your dog, you should contact your veterinarian.Your dog acts lethargic.
The diarrhea is accompanied by vomiting or fever.
Your dog’s stools are dark-colored or bloody. This could indicate bleeding of the stomach or small intestine, which should be treated immediately.Your dog strains to defecate.
Your dog’s appetite decreases.
Your dog has unexplained weight loss.
Your dog is a young puppy. Diarrhea in a puppy can be a sign of serious diseases.

, Diarrhea can be an occasional problem even for healthy dogs. However, you can do a few things to help prevent it.Make sure your dog sees a veterinarian regularly and is up to date on all vaccinations.
Keep your dog free of parasites (fleas, ticks, worms, etc.). Ask your veterinarian if you need help doing this.
Keep your dog away from garbage.
When walking your dog, don’t let it eat or drink anything it finds on or off the street, including plants and water in puddles.
Keep your dog free from stress (from noise, other animals, changes in its environment, etc.)
Make any food changes gradually. Mix new food in with its current food, at first. This will make the transition easier on your dog’s digestive system.
Treatments such as probiotics may also be effective at preventing diarrhea., Frequent loose or liquid stools are the most common signs that your dog has diarrhea. However, it may be accompanied by other symptoms, including:Flatulence
Blood or mucus in stool
Changes in the amount of stool
Straining to defecate
Lethargy
Dehydration
Fever
Vomiting
Decreased appetite
Weight loss

, Diarrhea in dogs can have a range of causes, including stress, parasitic worms, infections, and allergies.If your dog doesn’t have any underlying diseases or conditions, however, the diarrhea may simply be caused by dietary indiscretion.If your dog eats something it shouldn’t, such as spoiled food, sticks, or plastic, its digestive system may become irritated and diarrhea may result., Diarrhea can cause dehydration and other issues that can endanger your dog’s health.However, ff you give your dog treatment and the diarrhea doesn’t last more than a day, you should not be too concerned.On the other hand, if your dog does not improve quickly, it may be a sign that your dog is suffering from a more serious problem.


Talk to your veterinarian for any recommendations based on your dog’s specific case.You should also contact your veterinarian if you notice any unusual symptoms or if your dog’s diarrhea continues for more than twenty-four hours.

Take your dog to the vet at least once a year.,
Get your dog vaccinated and keep vaccines updated.,
Prevent heartworm and other internal parasites.,
Consult your dog’s vet about its specific health needs.,
Familiarize yourself with your dog’s specific health risks.",How to Provide Preventive Veterinary Care for Your Dog1," Every dog should see a vet at least annually, regardless of breed. In addition to age and breed related considerations, a general preventive care routine involves:Vaccinations.
Heartworm and internal parasite testing.
Consultation and evaluation of behavior and diet.
Physical examination, including dental, body, and muscle condition.
Consultation about spaying and neutering or counseling about breeding and reproductive health, depending on your needs and preferences.;
, Core vaccinations vary according to your jurisdiction’s regulations. In most locations, your dog will need vaccines against rabies, distemper, and parvovirus.Talk to your dog’s vet about non-core vaccinations against germs that are more common in particular areas. Examples of non-core inoculations that your vet might recommend include vaccines against Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.Once you've completed initial vaccinations, annual vet exams will ensure they remain up to date.

, Heartworm, which is carried by mosquitoes, can affect blood flow, breathing, and kidney and liver functions. Your dog's vet will test it for internal parasites like heartworm and provide preventive medication, such as a monthly pill.Symptoms of parasite infection are often hard to recognize or not present, especially in early stages. In late stages, your dog might show shortness of breath, cough, or tire easily.
Preventive parasite treatment for puppies should begin between six and eight weeks.
Internal parasites like heartworm are life-threatening but are absolutely preventable with routine vet care.

, In addition to general canine healthcare, your dog’s preventive care plan should include more customized attention for its specific breed, age, and lifestyle.Remember, choosing a vet who’s familiar with your dog’s breed and potential breed-specific health risks is essential to its health.
A vet will provide blood screening and physical assessments if your dog is predisposed to problems like joint disorders, organ or gland issues, or bloat and other digestion issues.
They’ll also offer location-specific recommendations. For example, they can let you know if flea and tick prevention is especially vital in your location, and if certain products are more effective against pest populations in your area., While it’s important to choose a good vet who is familiar with general canine care and any breed-specific needs, you should also inform yourself about potential health risks. Search online for health information about common canine health risks and to learn more about your dog’s breed or mix of breeds' specific risks.For example, some toy dogs with smaller teeth are more prone to serious gum diseases. Basset Hounds, Dachshunds, and other breeds with extremely modified body forms are at a higher risk of developing joint issues. Brachycephalic or “smush-faced” breeds like bulldogs and pugs have issues breathing, with skin irritation and infections, and with staying cool in hot weather.
Your local breed club or rescue group can help you learn more about caring for your dog’s specific needs.
When you purchase a dog from a breeder, be sure to ask for its parents’ medical records. Their medical history will inform you about potential genetic disorders and help you and your dog’s vet create a more customized preventive care routine.

If you’re comfortable enough with that person, ask them how much they pay for preventive care services., Search online for a breed club or breed rescue group in your area. Contact them and ask if they have recommendations or if they have a close relationship with a local vet.Ask if they can recommend a vet who’s well-versed in your dog’s breed-specific health risks.

, Take hours of operation, location, and parking into account when selecting a vet. Ask about the emergency services they offer, and ask for a referral to an emergency clinic if you choose a vet who doesn’t offer emergency care.Shop around and compare preventive care costs. Ask trusted friends or family how much they pay for their vet. Find multiple options and make sure your selection fits your budget.
Look for a vet accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA)., You’ll need to find a good vet in your new location in order to maintain your dog’s preventive care. Ask your dog’s vet if they have colleagues or recommended vets in other cities.If they don’t have any recommendations, get in touch with any pet owners you know in your new location. Call a local animal shelter or breed club if necessary.
Ask your dog’s current vet to fax its medical records to the new vet once you’ve selected one.

Keep up with preventive care to avoid costly medical conditions.,
Keep up with your dog’s grooming.,
Find organizations that offer financial assistance.",How to Provide Preventive Veterinary Care for Your Dog3," Remember that preventive care is less expensive than treating a life-threatening disease. Do your best to schedule and keep your dog’s vet exams, keep up with vaccinations, monitor parasites, and maintain other elements of canine healthcare.For example, vaccinating your dog against a digestive disease, even if the vaccine isn't mandatory, is much less expensive than providing treatment if your dog gets sick.
Monitoring your dog for parasites and providing preventive medication will cost less in the long run than caring for a dog with heartworm.

, Maintaining your dog’s hygiene and grooming will reduce the risk of illness, which will help cut its overall healthcare costs.Brush your dog’s teeth two to three times a week, or more if their breed is at higher risk of dental issues. Use gauze or a cloth, water, and toothpaste for dogs. Don’t use toothpaste that’s meant for people on your dog.

Trim your dog’s nails if you start to hear clicking when it walks. Nails that are too long interfere with its gait and is harmful to its ankle and knee joints.
If your dog has skin folds, clean them out weekly to prevent irritation and infection. Use warm water and a cloth to wipe away any buildup, then towel dry thoroughly.

, If you’re having trouble affording preventive care for your dog, there are plenty of organizations that can offer help. If you live in the United States, you can search the American Humane Society’s resource list, which offers dozens of national and state organizations.Look online for breed-specific financial aid groups, or contact your local breed club and ask about assistance options.
You can also get in touch with your local animal shelter and ask about other financial aid options in your particular area if preventive care becomes unaffordable.
Pet insurance can also make preventive care more affordable and help with costly treatments if your dog gets sick or injured."

Treat diarrhea at home only if your pet appears normal otherwise.,
Encourage rest.,
Offer bland foods.,
Provide your pet with water.,
Do not give your pet over-the-counter medication for humans.",How to Treat Diarrhea and Constipation in Dogs and Cats1," Usually, diarrhea is not a medical emergency. Your pet may have eaten something that did not sit right with it. Monitor your pet's behavior. If it seems normal otherwise, you can proceed to treat the diarrhea at home.If your dog or cat has normal energy and appetite, and is not vomiting, you can probably watch and wait.
You should also examine the stool. If the diarrhea does not contain any foreign objects or blood, it's probably safe to treat at home for the time being.;
, You do not want a sick pet to overexert itself. Try to get your dog or cat to rest as symptoms persist. Avoid excessive exercise, like walking or running, while your pet is sick.If your pet tends to like lying on the couch with you, try to spend a night on the couch. This may encourage your pet to lie down and rest instead of running and playing. You may want to put down a cover, however, in case of an accident.

, It may help to offer bland foods to your pet as symptoms persist. Boiled chicken breasts mixed with white rice can be a good alternative dinner option. There's a slim chance your pet's regular food upset its stomach, so trying something different can help.Make sure not to season chicken or rice.
Cats may not eat rice. In this case, just offer them chicken.

, Diarrhea can cause dehydration, so make sure water is present for the duration of your pet's illness. Make sure your pet has access to a bowl of water at all times.Some pets may not want to drink water if they're not feeling well. Try adding a bit of chicken broth to the water to entice them to drink it.

, Things like Pepto-Bismol can be potentially harmful or toxic to a cat or a dog. Not only that, they may do more harm than good depending on the cause of the diarrhea. Diarrhea cased by a toxin in the gut, for example, clears an animal's stomach of harmful bacteria. You do not want to give your pet something that prevents this process from occurring."

Determine if your dog is constipated.,
Clean your dog’s anal region.,
Treat the constipation.,
Add more fiber to your dog’s diet.,
Increase your dog’s physical activity.,
Lessen your dog’s grass-eating habit.,
Give your dog frequent chances to defecate.,
Groom your dog regularly.,
Get your dog neutered.",How to Treat Dog Constipation," Common signs of constipation include staining to defecate and only small amounts of dry feces being passed after straining.You may also see matted feces around the anus, especially in longhaired dogs; feces can get stuck in the long hair when your dog defecates, which could prevent normal fecal passage.Although not as common, mucus can be seen with the feces when a dog is constipated.When your dog is straining, it is very possible that he is distressed and in pain.Keep in mind that signs of constipation can be confused with other diseases, such as urinary infections. Your veterinarian will be able to determine if the signs are due to constipation or another medical problem.If your dog has been constipated for several days, he may show signs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, and lethargy. You may even see blood around his anus. If he is this sick, take him to your veterinarian immediately for treatment.;
, As unpleasant as this sounds, you will need to do this if you see matted feces or anything else (eg, grass particles) stuck in his fur around his anus. Before touching this area, put on a pair of latex gloves;if you are allergic to latex, you can wear nitrile gloves.


If your dog has long hair, use a small pair of scissors to trim away the hair containing matted feces. Your dog may or may not like the feeling of the trimming process. If he doesn't like it, you can soak the hair in warm water first to make the hair easier to trim.Use warm & soapy water, along with a small towel, to clean the anal region. Because of the constant straining, this region will probably be very sensitive. Be very gentle when you are cleaning and talk to your dog in soothing tones to assure him that he will be okay.Your dog can be standing or lying down when you do the trimming; let him be in whichever position is comfortable for him.
Applying KY jelly to the region after it’s clean will help to soothe the irritation. You can find KY jelly in your local pharmacy., Unfortunately, once the constipation has developed, it can be tricky to clear and may require the use of an enema. Be aware that medicines given by mouth may take require days to travel from the top end of the digestive track down to the bottom end where they are needed. Thus, oral constipation products may not necessarily help once the problem has arisen, but are most effective for prevention. Your veterinarian may also recommend treatments that would require a prescription. If you are unsure about what to give your dog, call your veterinarian to see what they would recommend.


Give your dog a stool softener or laxative. Human stool softeners and laxatives are too strong for your dog, so you will need your veterinarian to write a prescription for dog-appropriate stool softeners and laxatives.Mix mineral oil in with your dog’s food for up to one week. Mineral oil should never be given orally, since it could accidentally end up in your dog’s lungs and cause pneumonia.Using a measuring spoon, add 0.5 milliliters (mL) of mineral oil per 2 lbs of your dog’s body weight (1/8 teaspoon is about 0.5 ml). For example, if your dog weighs 40 lbs, then you would add 10 mL of mineral oil, which is a little less than 1 tablespoon.Add a small amount of unsweetened, canned pumpkin to your dog’s dry food. Depending on your dog’s weight, add 1 tablespoon (< 25 lbs), 2 tablespoons (25-50 lbs), or 3 tablespoons (> 50 lbs) to the food.Switch to canned food for a few days if your dog eats dry food. Canned food has more moisture in it, making it easier to pass through your dog’s digestive system.Canned food can cause diarrhea, so just a few days of canned food should be sufficient.
Sprinkle a powder fiber supplement containing psyllium on your dog’s food every 12-24 hours (1/4 teaspoon for dogs <25 lbs, 1/2 teaspoon for dogs 25 to 50 lbs, and 1 teaspoon for dogs > 50 lbs). The additional fiber will help food material pass through your dog’s GI tract more easily. You can purchase this as an over-the-counter product at your local pharmacy.Provide your dog with plenty of fresh water as you increase the fiber content in his diet.If these home remedies have still not relieved your dog’s constipation after about a week, and he seems to be getting sicker, take him to your veterinarian for further workup and treatment., Additional fiber is a prevention/management tool as well as a way to treat constipation. You can sprinkle psyllium-containing powder onto your dog’s food as you did to treat his constipation. You can also add fresh vegetables to your dog’s diet to increase his fiber intake. Examples of vegetables that you can add include carrots, peas, and green beans.Make sure that you provide your dog with plenty of water when you increase his fiber intake. With more fiber, your dog’s GI tract will produce more feces. If he does not drink enough water, the feces will not be able to pass through the anus, which could cause another bout of constipation.

, Exercise can stimulate the motility of your dog’s GI tract, which will push food through more easily and prevent feces from getting stuck in the colon.The exercise does not have to be vigorous; 15-minute walks each day will help your dog get more exercise., Although your dog may eat grass on occasion, swallowing grass may give him constipation. Try to make sure that your dog does not eat grass while he is outside in the yard or out for a walk., If your dog indicates that he needs to go outside, let him out. If you make your dog hold it, so to speak, you may increase the chances that the feces will become stuck in his GI tract, increasing the likelihood of constipation., Longhaired dogs are more prone to constipation because of how easily feces can become matted in the long hair around the anus. If you are comfortable with trimming the hair, soaking it in warm water will help you trim the hair more easily. If you do not feel comfortable trimming the hair in your dog’s anal region, take him to get groomed on a regular basis. Dogs may also swallow their hair if they groom themselves, which could cause constipation. Regular grooming by you or a grooming service can decrease the chances that your dog will swallow his hair., As male dogs get older, their prostates may enlarge, which could make it more difficult for feces to pass through the GI tract. If your male dog is intact and your veterinarian has identified prostatic enlargement as the cause of your dog’s constipation, then having your dog neutered will help prevent further constipation.Enlarged prostates are just one example of medical problems, such as perineal hernias or anal sac disease, that can cause constipation. If your dog regularly has problems, always see your veterinarian so that any underlying health problems can be treated and corrected.

Do not feed your dog for 24 to 48 hours.,
Feed your dog a low fat, low protein diet.,
Feed your dog four small meals a day.,
Place your dog’s food bowl on a stool or low table.",How to Treat Acid Reflux in Dogs1," However, you should allow your dog access to drinking water. Withholding food from your dog can allow your dog’s stomach to rest and reduces the amount of acid that the stomach produces.


When the amount of acid is reduced, the esophagus will be able to create a fresh layer of mucus to fend off stomach acid with.;
, After 24 to 48 hours of not feeding your dog, you can begin to reintroduce food. Avoid high-fat, high-protein diets because these cause the stomach to produce acid. Instead offer carbohydrate such as rice, pasta, or boiled potatoes, with lean white meats such as chicken, turkey, cod, or coley fish.


Examples of ""bad"" foods includes fatty mince, sausages, bacon, cream, butter, and pate.

, If you feed your dog two or three large meals a day, there is more of a chance that his stomach will become very full, which in turn can stretch the esophageal sphincter and allow acid to leak out of the stomach.


Continue feeding your dog four small low-fat, low protein meals a day until he has been symptom free for at least 7 days. After these 7 days have passed, you can consider putting him back on his regular diet.

, Putting your dog’s food up high will force your dog to eat with his head raised above his shoulders. This makes his esophagus into a downhill slope to his stomach, which will help to keep the food in his stomach, rather than being regurgitated back up.

Understand veterinary care may be necessary.,
Keep an eye on your pet's bowel movements for 24 to 48 hours.,
Watch for other symptoms of constipation.",How to Treat Diarrhea and Constipation in Dogs and Cats2," Unlike diarrhea, there are few home treatment options for constipation. If constipation is caused by a mild issue, like a dietary change, it may clear up on its own. Therefore, the best method for at-home treatment is to watch and wait. If the constipation does not clear up within a day or two, you should take your pet to the vet's for evaluation., If constipation lasts longer than a day or two, you may need to see a vet. Keep track of bowel movements over the next two days to see if symptoms clear up or improve.For cats, you can monitor bowel movements via the litter box. Make sure to change the litter each day and watch for fresh stools. Cats should have at least one bowel movement per day. Any less than that may indicate the constipation is serious.
You should also be careful of mistaking straining, which could be due to a urinary bladder blockage, with constipation. A urinary bladder blockage is life threatening for your cat. Make sure that there are still wet clumps from urine in your litter box. If your cat is straining and the litter box is dry, then you should contact your vet immediately to check your cat for this condition.

, If your pet is constipated, look out for other symptoms. Constipation is a symptom, and not a condition itself. Knowing the other symptoms will help you figure out the potential cause of your pet's constipation.A constipated animal may be lethargic, dehydrated, and reluctant to eat. A constipated animal may also vomit and not want to drink water. They are sometimes described as having a ""hunched up"" appearance.

Call your vet right away in certain circumstances.,
Have your pet undergo a physical exam.,
Discuss your pet's medical history with your vet.,
Talk to your vet about treatment for diarrhea.,
Discuss constipation with your vet.",How to Treat Diarrhea and Constipation in Dogs and Cats3," For the most part, diarrhea should be monitored for a few days at home before veterinary assistance is necessary. However, under certain conditions, you should talk to your vet right away.Blood in the stool requires immediate evaluation. Bloody stools will be black and tarry in appearance.
If you think your pet got into something toxic, take it to the vet right away.
Pale gums and a fever accompanying diarrhea should be evaluated right away.
Diarrhea accompanied by vomiting should be evaluated.
If you have a young kitten who has not yet been vaccinated, have a vet evaluate things like diarrhea.

, Usually, your vet will conduct a brief physical exam of your pet. He or she will listen to your pet's heart beat and breathing and examine them for any obvious signs of injury or sickness., From here, your vet will ask for a brief medical history. You should include any unusual behaviors you've noticed previously. Diarrhea and constipation can sometimes be caused by underlying conditions, and a full medical history can help a vet determine which tests are necessary.If your pet was recently exposed to wildlife, or if it ate something unusual, mention this here.
Also, tell your vet about any medications your pet is taking. Some medications may cause diarrhea or constipation as a side effect.

, There are many different ways to treat diarrhea, if your vet determines medical treatment is necessary. Go over a potential treatment plan with your vet to make sure you understand how to properly correct the issue.Parasites can sometimes cause a problem with diarrhea, so your vet may recommend medication to correct this. If diarrhea is severe, your pet may need to stay overnight to receive intravenous liquids to correct or prevent dehydration. Other medications may be used to calm the gastrointestinal tract.
Not all cases of vomiting and diarrhea can be treated easily. If your pet is diagnosed with a lifelong condition, like diabetes, you will have to have a long talk to your vet about longterm treatment.

, It's a good idea to have constipation evaluated as well if it does not clear up on its own within a few days. You can talk to your vet about how to properly treat the issue.Stimulants or laxatives are frequently used to treat mild constipation.
Severe constipation can be more of a problem. Surgery or dietary changes may be necessary to treat an intestinal blockage or other issue.

Avoid feeding cats dairy.,
Maintain a clean litter box.,
Introduce new food gradually.",How to Treat Diarrhea and Constipation in Dogs and Cats4," Many cats do not have the enzymes necessary to digest dairy products. While cats enjoy the taste of cream and milk, you may want to offer other types of foods as a reward instead. This will make your cat less prone to outbreaks of diarrhea., For cats, constipation may be caused by litter box issues. Cats do not like using a messy litter box, and may hold in stools if their box is dirty. Be sure to clean your litter box every day to prevent constipation., If you're changing up an animal's food, do so gradually. Sudden changes in diet can cause diarrhea or constipation.At first, feed your pet half of its new food and half of its hold food.
Gradually increase the amount of the old food until your pet is comfortably eating the new food.

Give your dog gastroprotectants.,
Get your dog a prescription for sucralfate.,
Try giving your dog a prokinetic medication.,
Get your dog a prescription for Metoclopramide.,
See if antacid medications help your dog.,
Buy famotidine for your dog.,
Give your dog omeprazole.",How to Treat Acid Reflux in Dogs2," Gastroprotectants provide a degree of protection for the stomach (and esophagus). The most widely used gastroprotective is sucralfate, a prescription medication known as Antepsin or Carafate.

, Sucralfate is widely used as an anti-ulcer drug in humans that can also be used in animals if prescribed correctly. Sucralfate turns into a paste-like substance when it comes into contact with acid. It then sticks to the inflamed tissue, which seals the raw area off from the acid.


The dose is a ballpark figure of 0.5 to 1 gram by mouth three times a day (larger dogs receive around 1 gram, while smaller dogs will receive 0.5).The liquid form of this medication is more effective than the tablet for acid reflux, because the liquid coats the esophagus as it trickles down the gullet. The dose for the liquid form of this medication is 2.5 to 5 ml by mouth three times daily.Sucralfate is so effective a barrier that it does stop other drugs from being absorbed. Because of this, if your dog is taking other medications, you should give them to your dog an hour before you give him the sucralfate.

, A prokinetic medication increases the muscular tone of the digestive tract. The importance of this is that it tightens up the esophageal sphincter and makes it less likely that stomach acid will be able to leak into your dog’s esophagus. There is one important prokinetic, metoclopramide.

, Metoclopramide works by helping the gastrointestinal tract deal with acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter that gives messages for muscles to contract). This helps to keep the esophageal sphincter closed so acid can’t get into the esophagus.


The dose of metoclopramide is 0.1 to 0.4mg/ kg four times a day by mouth. A 30 kg dog requires 3 to12 mg a dose, so giving one 5 mg tablet four times a day is a sensible starting point.Metoclopramide should not be given to dogs with a bowel obstruction, because the enhanced muscular contraction could cause bowel perforation.
Also, metoclopramide is thought to increase prolactin release (the hormone that stimulates milk production) and should be avoided in female dogs have a false pregnancy as it will aggravate the symptoms. A false pregnancy is where hormones fool the bitch into thinking she is pregnant when she isn't. Part of this is to prepare her to feed the ""phantom"" puppies by producing milk. However, lactating when there are no puppies to suckle the milk can make the bitch more likely to develop infections of the mammary gland, such as mastitis.

, Antacids decrease the amount of acid produced by the stomach, so they limit the amount of acid that could leak up into your dog’s esophagus.


Some over the counter antacids are available (such as famotidine, marketed as Pepcid), while stronger antacids are prescription only (omeprazole).

, Famotidine is an H2-receptor antagonist which means it slows down the production and secretion of acid in your dog’s stomach.


Famotidine is available over-the-counter at pharmacies. There is no veterinary equivalent and so it is acceptable to purchase famotidine yourself in order to medicate your dog. The recommended dose range is quite wide, but an average dose is around 0.5mg/kg by mouth twice a day.Thus a 30 kg dog would be given one-and-a-half 10 mg tablets twice a day. Give this medication on an empty stomach. Famotidine can be given long term without reported incident., This is also known as GastroGard or Prilosec. It is a prescription medication. It is a proton pump inhibitor and prevents acid production both in the simulated stomach (when there is food to digest) or resting state (an empty tummy).


The dose is 0.5 grams once daily by mouth. Omeprazole comes in a range of tablet strengths (10mg, 20mg, 40mg) and so our 30 kg dog is best served with one 20 mg tablet once a day.Omeprazole is a very safe medication, with few reported side effects. There is a theoretical risk that if used for several months, the lack of acidity in the stomach could allow yeasts to overgrow, but this has not been proven.

Call your vet if your dog’s stomach looks swollen.,
Look for a swollen abdomen.,
Check for a tympanic abdomen.,
Monitor any drooling saliva.,
Keep track of non-productive retching or vomiting.,
Look to see if your dog has a hunched back.,
Watch to see if your dog appears restless.,
Look for signs of pain.,
Call your vet if you see signs of shock.,
Recognize collapse.",How to Recognize Bloat in Dogs1," Dog's with bloat deteriorate alarmingly quickly. A dog that develops bloat at bedtime, if left untreated, will most likely pass away by the morning. Sometimes the deterioration is even more rapid, and the dog may pass away in less than 2 hours after first developing symptoms. Because of this, it is absolutely imperative that you call your vet immediately, as soon as you notice the following symptoms.The key symptoms are a distended abdomen and non-productive retching (vomiting without producing any vomit). These signs alone should trigger an emergency phone call to the vet. However, other signs can also occur, as discussed in the following steps.;
, The abdomen (or belly) is the area behind the rib cage that extends back towards the pelvis. The stomach sits within the dome of the diaphragm, but if filled with air, it extends backwards into the belly. A gas filled stomach gives the physical appearance of a swollen belly.In some large breeds (St Bernards, Great Danes) the swollen stomach can be difficult to spot because of room for expansion within the dome of the ribs, therefore, an absence of swelling does NOT rule out gastric dilation. However, a swollen tummy is a significant sign.
If in doubt as to whether the tummy is a normal size or not, take a photo of the dog from a sideways angle. Take another photo at 10 minute intervals for comparison. If subsequent photos show the body walls bowing outwards more than previously, this is significant and you should immediately contact the vet

, The swollen stomach is often full of gas or foam. When you place a hand on either side of the swelling and press gently, the area feels hard and not compressible.If you gently flick at the swollen area with a finger (like flicking a drum skin) you may get the impression of a drum like noise due to the trapped air inside the stretched stomach.

, When the stomach flips over it is effectively sealed off. Gastric contents cannot escape; this also means that saliva, food, and water cannot get into the stomach. Thus your dog may drool saliva because he cannot swallow it down.

, The distension triggers receptors in the stomach wall that tells your dog to vomit in order to empty his stomach. However, the twisted stomach is sealed off and although the dog retches or attempts to vomit, he brings nothing up other than drooled saliva.


This is a serious sign and if present, contact the vet immediately.

, As the stomach swells it presses forward on the diaphragm and displaces other abdominal organs backwards. This causes abdominal discomfort which may cause the dog to stand in a hunched position with his back arched.


This is a general sign of abdominal discomfort, rather than specific to GDV, but if seen in conjunction with other symptoms, it should raise concern.

, A dog with a dilated stomach feels uncomfortable and nauseous. This makes it difficult for him to get comfortable and he will pace and be restless.


Some dogs repeatedly turn and look at their flanks, whilst others may even try to kick their belly with a back leg.

, GDV causes distension of the stomach and is a painful condition. Dogs differ in how they show pain but typical signs include:


Vocalisation (whining, groaning, or crying)
Dilated pupils
A worried expression
Changes in behavior such as increased aggression

, As the toxins build up, your dog may start to go into shock. This manifests itself as a weak pulse (the femoral pulse is located on the inner thigh, running parallel with the thigh bone.) A weak pulse can be difficult to detect because of low blood pressure within the vein and is easily lost when pressure is applied with a finger.


The heart rate starts to race and is above normal (greater than 100 beats per minute for a large breed dog, above 140 beats per minute for a regular or small dog).
The dog's gums will also be pale (normal color is pink, much like our own gums). If you press a fingertip on the gum and then release, it takes longer than 2 seconds for the color to return (a sign of circulatory collapse)
The dog may also have distressed or laboured breathing. He breathes more quickly (normal is below 35 to 40 breaths per minute) and takes shallower breaths than usual.

, Untreated, your dog may deteriorate, find it difficult to walk, and slump to the ground. As his abdomen becomes increasingly swollen, blood return to the heart is impaired by pressure from the stomach (which compresses the aorta and vena cava, much like putting your foot on a hosepipe) and the dog goes into circulatory collapse.

Place marijuana out of reach.,
Keep marijuana foods away from your pets.,
Place marijuana paraphernalia out of reach.,
Do not expose your pet to marijuana smoke.",How to Prevent Marijuana Poisoning in Dogs and Cats1," In order to prevent your cat or dog from getting marijuana poisoning, you need to keep marijuana out of its reach. A pet can easily ingest marijuana that is accessible to it due simply to curiosity. Not only should it be kept in a sealed container but that container should be kept in an area that your pet cannot physically get to.A sealed container is not a guarantee that your pet will not become interested in your marijuana and ingest it. Many dogs, for instance, will investigate and chew on items that are new to them. If your dog gets its teeth on a container of marijuana, it could easily ingest a harmful amount.
Dogs are much more likely to get marijuana poisoning than cats are. Because of this, you need to be especially adamant about keeping marijuana away from dogs.;
, Many cats and dogs that get marijuana poisoning do so by eating foods that have been infused with marijuana. Many pets are quickly attracted to food and will eat any food they can get their teeth on indiscriminately. If you have marijuana foods in your home, make sure that your pets have no way of accessing them.


If your pet accidentally ingests marijuana food, you need to think about the other ingredients that could affect its health as well. For example, eating marijuana food that also contains chocolate could be very dangerous for a dog.In this case, you need to take your dog to a veterinarian immediately.
Your pet can become very seriously ill from ingesting butter that is infused with marijuana, as the THC level of infused butter is very, very high. If your pet eats butter with THC, then you need to take it to a veterinarian immediately. This could cause serious illness or death due to the level of THC., If you have marijuana paraphernalia laying around your house, that could be a risk to your pet's health as well. Smoking apparatus such as bongs and pipes may contain a significant amount of marijuana. If somehow consumed, this could give your pet marijuana poisoning.


For example, if you have a bong out in the open, your dog could decide to drink the water contained in it.

, Pets can also be affected by marijuana when it is smoked in their presence. If you are concerned about the effects of marijuana exposure, as well as the health risks of second-hand smoke, do not allow your pets to be exposed to the smoke.


The level of exposure that creates marijuana poisoning, meaning a risk to your pet's life, is not possible just from inhaling smoke. However, marijuana smoke can have a negative impact on your pet's health and happiness.Remember, while you can make the consensual choice to be around marijuana smoke, your pet cannot give its consent. It will not anticipate or understand the effects of the drug and can be negatively impacted.

Assess your dog's risk factors.,
Take your dog to its veterinarian.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Treat the pancreatitis.,
Give supportive care at home.",How to Spot Signs of Pancreatitis in Dogs," If your dog has pancreatitis it is likely to experience problems digesting its food. Symptoms related to digestive distress include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.If your dog throws up once or has one incident of diarrhea then you should just keep an eye on the dog to make sure the problems clear up. If your dog has repeated incidents of throwing up and diarrhea, then this could signal pancreatitis.;
, When your dog is sick with pancreatitis the discomfort of the condition can impact your dog's behavior. Symptoms that can show up in your dog's behavior that are related to pancreatitis include lethargy, decreased appetite, and depression.


Pay attention to changes in your dog's personality. If it is unusually withdrawn or sullen, then that could signal a health problem.
Pancreatitis can also cause your dog to be low in energy. If it usually loves to play or go for a walk and it is currently resistant to any activity, this could signal a health problem.

, A dog having an attack of pancreatitis may have a hunched back due to abdominal pain. This is sometimes called a ""praying position,"" with your dog's tail end up in the air while its front end is lowered onto the ground.The dog gets into this posture in response to the pain caused by pancreatitis, as this posture reduces the pain.

, Fever is one symptom of pancreatitis. If you can take your dog's temperature, do it. A dog's temperature is usually between 99.5 and 102.5F.If your dog has an elevated temperature, that is another sign that your dog may have pancreatitis.


To check your dog's temperature, you can use either a rectal or ear thermometer.

, It is more likely that your dog has pancreatitis if it has some of the risk factors associated with the condition. These include:Obesity
Hypothyroidism
Blunt trauma on the area of the pancreas
Diabetes
Family history of pancreatitis
Eating a very high-fat meal
Taking certain medications

, If you suspect that your dog has pancreatitis, you should get it looked at by a veterinarian. When meeting with the veterinarian tell him or her about your dog's symptoms, including when they started and how often they occur.


If your veterinary office is not open when you notice the symptoms of pancreatitis you should take your dog to an emergency medical hospital., Your veterinarian will attempt to get a definitive diagnosis for your dog's illness. If the veterinarian suspects pancreatitis, they are likely to do a physical examination and then measure the amount of pancreas enzyme in the dog's blood. This enzyme is known as pancreatic lipase.There are a variety of reasons your dog may have pancreatitis. These include: trauma to the pancreas, a side effect from medication, hypertriglyceridemia, eating an excessively high-fat meal, or due to another disease. However, in many cases of pancreatitis the cause cannot be identified., Depending on the severity of the pancreatitis, the treatment will vary. For very mild pancreatitis, the treatment is usually just supportive, meaning that you allow the dog's body to recover naturally. However, the pancreas may need to be ""shut down"" temporarily to allow it to recover. This will require all food and liquids to be withheld so that the dog's pancreas doesn't secrete any enzymes.If food is withheld, the dog will need to be given intravenous fluids and electrolytes. This will keep its fluid levels stable and help it recover from any diarrhea or vomiting it has experienced.
Additionally, the dog may be given medications to control its diarrhea and vomiting, as well as pain. If the veterinarian suspects an additional infection, your dog may also be prescribed antibiotics.

, As your dog recovers from pancreatitis it will need to have food slowly reintroduced. Your veterinarian will give you directions for feeding your dog but that will usually include very small meals or a bland diet.


A bland diet that works well for dogs recovering from pancreatitis is cooked white rice and cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts. These foods are very easy for the dog to digest."
"
Avoid feeding your dog foods that are difficult to digest.,
Switch to feeding your dog premium dog food.,
Avoid giving your dog unwholesome table scraps.,
Add water to the dog’s food.,
Add probiotics or nonfat plain yogurt (with live active cultures) to their diet.,
Use a food or supplement designed to decrease flatulence.,
Talk to your veterinarian about using the additive “Beano” or “Gas-X” to help with manage the flatulence.While these products may be made for humans, they can be effective for dogs as well.

,
Serve your dog's food in a dog bowl that encourages your dog to eat slowly.,
Feed twice daily.,
Make a game out of mealtime.",How to Reduce Flatulence in Dogs," These gas-causing foods include peas and broccoli, which have high amounts of indigestible sugars. Foods with indigestible fibers, such as beans, should also be avoided. Avoid milk products, like cheese and fluid milk, as well., Low-cost dog food is made with fillers like corn and soy, which dogs cannot digest. These fillers keep the price down but their indigestible nature can result in everything from allergies to dog flatulence. Premium food costs more but it is made with higher amounts of digestible ingredients.


Begin feeding an anti-flatulence dog diet gradually. This can be done by incorporating the old and new foods together, gradually increasing the amount of the new food while decreasing the quantity of the old food at each feeding. Sudden dietary changes can exacerbate dog flatulence problems.

, Many human foods are beneficial for dogs, but processed foods and sugary snacks can upset your dog's stomach and create gas. Never feed your dog prepackaged, commercially-produced foods made for human consumption.

, This will help them to help slow down consumption.

, This will help add good bacteria to the intestines which may help with flatulence. Probiotics are available in several forms: liquid (usually refrigerated), powder, tablet or capsule.


These supplements can also help with looser stool and diarrhea.
You can use products for dogs or you can use human products.If you have questions about dosing, consult your veterinarian.

, Waltham dog food company experimented with adding activated charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate to the intestinal tract via a treat and flatulence improved by 86%.There are also special low residue diets that have been formulated to increase the digestibility of the dog food and therefore decrease gas production. These diets are sold through your veterinarian’s office.

,, When dogs eat too fast they ingest air, which gets expelled as flatulence. To slow your dog down while eating, purchase a bowl specifically designed to make eating a more challenging endeavor.


There are bowls designed to slow food intake. Search online or at your local pet supply store to purchase one.
You can also add appropriately-sized balls into your dog's existing bowl to help slow down mealtime.

, Breaking up mealtimes will give your dog time to digest smaller food portions throughout the day instead of forcing one large meal into the intestines at one time. Smaller amounts of food in the gastrointestinal tract means fewer chances for indigestible substances to react with intestinal bacteria.

, Instead of using a dog bowl consider placing small piles of food throughout your home and yard. This interactive feeding method prevents your dog from eating too quickly and ingesting air. Foraging for food also provides interactive stimulation and positive instinctual behavior which results in a more satisfied, mentally-balanced dog.

In addition, there are other risk factors, which include:Siblings or parents that have experienced bloat
Once a day feeding.
Vigorous exercise before or after feeding time.
Rapid eating of food- which adds more air in the stomach.
Conditions in which the outflow of food from the stomach is slowed or impeded.
Feeding dry foods with a high oil or fat content.
Nervous or high strung Great Danes.;
, Bloat occurs rapidly and needs immediate veterinarian attention to prevent the Great Dane's death. If your dog is exhibiting any of the behavioral signs of bloat, you need to take the risk of bloat seriously. These include:Pacing
Restlessness
Reluctance to stand or walk
Inability to stand or walk

, These are the tell-tale signs that your animal could be having a medical emergency. The physical signs of bloat in a Great Dane are:Excessive salivation
Retching or dry heaving without bringing anything up (The esophagus is involved in the twist so nothing can come back through the mouth.)
Abdomen (belly) becomes enlarged
Rapid and weak pulse
Pale gums

, If you see these signs contact a veterinarian immediately. Dogs can die soon after the signs appear, due to the damage done to internal organs, collapse of the circulatory (blood) system, toxin buildup, and shock.If your normal veterinary office is not open when you identify the signs of bloat, you should seek out an emergency veterinary clinic in your area. This is one situation that really is an emergency and requires emergency treatment.

, The veterinarian will do a general examination, ask questions about the onset of signs, and take blood samples to check for signs of shock and internal organ damage. Radiographs (X-rays) are generally taken, which will demonstrate the bloated stomach along with the twist in the stomach.


In some cases, a needle will be stuck into abdominal cavity and suction is applied to the syringe. This is done to determine if the stomach has ruptured, an unfortunate outcome in some cases of bloat.
A tube may be passed through the patient’s mouth and into the stomach to relieve the pressure of air buildup. Occasionally a tube will be placed directly through the skin and muscle into the stomach to relieve the pressure in the stomach.
An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in a vein to provide medications and fluids.

, The treatment of bloat is surgery to untwist the stomach and to suture part of the stomach to the inside of the abdomen wall to prevent it from recurring. This is called a gastropexy.If the stomach ruptured the stomach will be repaired and the internal abdomen will be flushed. Dogs will be closely monitored after surgery. Generally the dog will be placed on antibiotics and pain killers before and after surgery.

, Depending on your veterinarian clinic and how intensive the surgery was, the dog will need to remain hospitalized for up to 7 days. After that, you will need to be gentle with it and help it recover gradually. This means keeping it from licking or gnawing on stitches, as well as limiting its activity.


Sadly, up to 15% of dogs with bloat do not survive surgery despite the skill of the veterinarian., Researchers at Purdue University have compiled research into the causes and prevention of bloat in large-breed dogs, such as the Great Dane.Through this valuable research, they have determined that many ways to prevent bloat revolve around how you feed your dog. One key prevention technique is to feed your dog multiple small meals, instead of one big meal.


For dry food feed, give your dog no more than one cup per thirty pounds of body weight per meal.

, Feed from a bowl on the ground, which provides a better angle for the dog. This also applies to water bowls as well.


There is some controversy surrounding whether this actually impacts a dog's chances of developing bloat. However, what little research there is suggests that not using a raised dish may help., If your dog is a greedy eater and gulps its food, invest in a food dish that forces the dog to eat slower such as the slow feeder or fun feeder. Slowing down your dog's eating will help it more slowly digest its food, and will lessen the chances the stomach turns due to excess food.You should also restrict gorging on water, as this can impact the dog's stomach as well., Wait one hour before and two hours after eating before letting your dog exercise or before going for walks. Especially avoid vigorous exercise that involve running, jumping, or swimming.Activity increases the chance of the stomach turning. Instead, let your dog have some quiet, calm time to digest its meal.

, This means that if you live in a rural area, don’t allow your Great Dane to roam. He or she may find unsuitable food (deer or other animal carcasses, piles of grain left over from harvesting), gorge on them, and then develop bloat.


Also, do not feed table scraps to your Great Dane. A large-breed dog, such as the Great Dane, needs a controlled diet.

, An energy-dense diet should be given to your dog to reduce the risk of bloat because it will mean that you have to feed the dog less for it to get enough calories. Check labels so that fat isn’t in the top four ingredients.Ask your veterinarian for advice if you are uncertain what to feed.

, Include wet foods, for instance the canned variety of the food you are feeding, or large meat chunks in the diet. Again, ask your veterinarian for advice if you aren’t sure what to feed.However, do not moisten dry food. Get a canned variety of the food if you want to add a little wet food to the diet.

, Discuss with your veterinarian if your Great Dane would be a good candidate for a precautionary gastropexy. The procedure consists of attaching the stomach to the abdominal wall, which prevents it from turning. Military service dogs (large breeds like German shepherd and Belgian Malinois) are frequently given a precautionary gastropexy to avoid any emergency situations when they are on the battlefield.However, most owners opt to monitor their large and giant breed dogs, instead of taking this measure.

Spitting up food.
Pain when swallowing (your dog may whine when he tries to swallow).
Weight loss and a lack of appetite.

, The vet will use an endoscopy to determine if your dog has acid reflux or not. An endoscopy involves sending a small camera down your dog’s throat to inspect the lining of the esophagus.A dog with acid reflux will have a red, raw, sore, ulcerated looking esophagus near the opening to the stomach.

, While this article outlines the steps you can take to help your dog, it is important to work with your vet to make sure that your dog gets the appropriate treatment given his specific medical history.

It is essential to seek immediate veterinary assistance.Even if you have financial constraints and cannot afford surgery, the humane option is to contact a veterinarian to euthanize your dog to prevent unnecessary suffering. While this can be a hard decision to make, it will ultimately save your dog from a lot of pain.

, Veterinary treatment includes aggressive intravenous fluid therapy to support the circulation and dilute systemic toxins. Once your dog is stable, the vet will give him general anesthesia and laparotomy; the stomach is repositioned and an incision made to release the gas.


The stomach is then rinsed out, any portions of dead stomach wall resected, and the stomach sutured to the body wall to prevent future episodes of torsion.

, If you are not within traveling distance of a veterinarian then try to comfort your dog. Speak to him calmly to reassure him. In the early stages of bloat try gently walking him, to help relieve stomach cramps. Stay by him and keep him calm. Try to find a vet who will come to where you are if you cannot transport your dog to a vet.Medication or pain relief is of no benefit because it cannot pass the twist in his gullet to enter the stomach and be absorbed.

In this case, you should take your dog to the veterinarian immediately.


Watch your dog or cat eat. Is it having trouble ingesting its food? This could signal that it is having problems with its motor control.
Is your dog or cat having trouble getting up or walking normally? If it has not had previous episodes of trouble with movement, then it could be under the influence of marijuana.

, Dogs and cats that ingest marijuana are prone to depressed or antisocial behavior while under the influence of the drug. If your pet's personality has shifted suddenly and they are acting out of character, this could be a sign that they have ingested marijuana.This shift in personality is understandable on some level, as they do not understand what is happening to them and may be very disoriented and scared.

, If your dog or cat has ingested a large amount of marijuana it may lose control of some of its body functions. Even if the pet is house broken, it may urinate or defecate in the house. It may drool uncontrollably. It may also vomit due to the ingestion.One way to tell if your pet has ingested marijuana is if the marijuana is visible in your pet's vomit.

, If you suspect that your pet has ingested marijuana and it is experiencing severe side effects, then you should call your veterinarian or call poison control to get advice about what to do.Your veterinarian may be able to induce vomiting or give activated charcoal to minimize the effects of the marijuana.They can also give fluids and oxygen, give calming medications, and give general supportive care.Tell the veterinarian when you think the dog or cat ingested the marijuana and what their symptoms have been. Say: ""I think my dog may have ingested marijuana - he's vomiting and looking unwell.""
It can be embarrassing to admit to your veterinarian that your dog or cat has been exposed to marijuana. However, for the health of your pet, it's important that you do. That will allow your veterinarian to understand the situation better and to help your pet for effectively.
It is especially important to take your pet to a veterinarian if you suspect that it has eaten marijuana that was combined with another drug. Be honest with the veterinarian about what you think your pet has eaten so that the vet can treat your pet quickly and effectively.

Have your vet diagnose the cause of bile in the vomit.,
Hospitalize your dog, if necessary.,
Administer medications as prescribed.,
Allow your vet to remove an obstruction.,
Discuss dietary changes with your vet.,
Feed multiple small meals during the day.,
Feed a late night meal.",How to Treat a Dog Throwing Up Bile," In general, a dog throws up bile when its stomach is empty or upper small intestine is irritated. Specific health conditions can make throwing up bile more likely in your dog. After performing a physical exam and getting a thorough history of the problem from you, your vet will run several diagnostic tests, including blood work, a fecal sample, and imaging tests (for example, x-rays and abdominal ultrasound). Health conditions causing bile in the vomit include:Gastric motility disorder (abnormal movement of food through the stomach)
Giardiasis (Giardia parasite infection)
Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
Obstruction in the small intestine;
, After your vet determines why your dog is throwing up bile, treatment can begin. If your dog has been vomiting frequently, your vet may want to hospitalize and fast your dog (withhold food and water) for about 24 hours. Hospitalization would allow your vet to monitor your dog closely, administer fluids and electrolyte therapy, and slowly reintroduce bland food after your dog stops vomiting.Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, water) are important for your dog’s overall health. If your dog has been vomiting constantly, it may be dehydrated and have really low electrolyte levels.
If your dog does not need to be hospitalized for the fast, carefully follow your vet’s instructions for the fast and reintroduction of food.
Hospitalization would increase the cost of treatment.

, Depending on the cause of bile in the vomit, medication may help treat the problem. For example, if your dog has a Giardia infection, your vet will prescribe a medication to kill the parasite. For a gastric motility disorder, medications are available that will help move food through the stomach at a normal rate.Follow your vet's instructions for giving the medication.


Some dogs that throw up bile may also have stomachs that secrete too much stomach acid. This acid can irritate the stomach lining and cause vomiting.Your vet may prescribe a medication to reduce stomach acid secretion.

, If your vet identified an obstruction, they will need to remove it. If the obstruction is small enough, your vet could thread an endoscope (thin tube with a camera at the end) down your dog’s throat to remove the obstruction. For a large obstruction, your vet would need to perform surgery.An endoscope can reach into the upper part of the small intestine.
With an endoscope, your vet would gently nudge the obstruction free so that it could pass normally through the digestive tract.

, Dietary changes may be the ideal treatment for your dog’s vomiting problem.Before making any changes to your dog’s diet, talk with your vet first. They can give you recommendations on what adjustments to make, such as type of food and feeding schedule.


Do not make more than one adjustment at a time. For example, if you change the type of food, do not change your dog’s feeding schedule at the same time.

, Most dog owners feed their dogs twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. Since a dog’s stomach empties about every two hours, your dog could have an empty stomach for most of the day and possibly throw up bile. Feeding your dog several small meals during the day would keep its stomach from emptying out completely, reducing the chance of bile-induced vomiting.Talk to your vet about leaving food out for your dog during the day while you’re not home. This strategy may work if your dog can graze on its food all day, rather than eating it all at once.

, A dog’s stomach is typically empty first thing in the morning. If your dog throws up bile in the morning, it could have a condition called bilious vomiting syndrome. A simple, effective treatment for this condition is a late night meal before your dog’s bedtime.If you feed a late night meal, feeding multiple small meals during the day may not be necessary. Talk to you vet about how often you should feed your dog.
A dog with bilious vomiting syndrome usually has no other common symptoms of vomiting, such as loss of appetite and weight loss."

Elevate your dog’s food.,
Try hand feeding your dog.,
Experiment with different food textures.,
Put your dog on a high calorie diet.,
Be vigilant about secondary problems such as aspiration pneumonia.",How to Manage a Dog with Megaesophagus1," A key strategy for managing megaesophagus is to get gravity to work for, rather than against, your dog. To do this, your dog's food bowl should be raised up on a surface such that his gullet slopes down to his stomach. .For a Labrador this means putting his dinner on a chair or table, such that he puts his front paws on the flat surface to reach the food. This elevates his head, neck, and forequarters above the level of his heart, which means that when he swallows the food is more likely to trickle down into his stomach.
However, food passing down the esophagus under gravity does not happen instantaneously so it is important to keep your dog's forequarters elevated for about 10 minutes after he eats. This might involve training him to stay in this elevated position, and perhaps giving small food rewards to encourage the good behavior.;
, Some dogs with this condition respond well to hand feeding, possibly because they cannot bolt food down quickly if you are rationing it out. If the food is eaten more slowly it gives each mouthful a chance to go down without a pile-up forming higher up the gullet.


A useful tip for hand feeding is to create ""meatballs"" by rolling tinned food mixed with kibble between your palms in order to form food balls. This is an easy way to ration out food, and the round shape of the food gives the gullet something to grip on to, making it easier to move the food down into the stomach.

, There is no hard and fast rule about which food texture is more likely to be kept down. There are many variables when it comes to megaesophagus, such as the size and length of the pouch, and the diameter of the viable lumen through which food passes.


It is worth experimenting to see which food texture works best for your dog. Some cope better when given dry food (it gives the esophagus something to grip) while others do much better on a liquid diet (fluid can pass through a smaller opening than solid food). Experiment and see which works best for your dog.

, An underweight dog who struggles to keep food down could benefit from a convalescent diet. These are diets that are designed to be calorie dense, such that each mouthful contains more calories than standard foods.


These foods generally come in a pate or liquid formulation.

, If your dog breaths in at the wrong moment as he regurgitates, he may inhale food, or fluid, down into his lungs. This creates an ""aspiration pneumonia"" which can be serious and needs prompt treatment with antibiotics.


Dogs with this condition tend to be feverish, lethargic, have labored breathing, and lose their appetites. This can be serious and urgent veterinary attention should be sought if a dog with megaesophagus shows these signs.

Be intimately acquainted with your small dog's regular toileting habits.,
Be vigilant about what they are producing.,
Monitor your dog for vomiting.,
Know the signs of digestive problems.",How to Solve Digestive Problems With Small Dogs1," A healthy digestive system produces a formed stool which can be picked up. Dogs usually move their bowel after eating, so if your dog is fed twice a day, their natural tendency is to toilet twice a day - although individual variation occurs and if it is normal for your dog to go once or three times a day, then that's fine., If you let the dog out into the yard and for days on end never check what they've produced, this can mean you miss the early stages of a digestive upset. Do a daily poop patrol so that you are aware of changes in consistency and color, and know if blood or mucus is present.

, If the dog vomits, take note of the color and consistency. An occasional barf is nothing to be concerned about, but if the dog seems unwell and vomits, he repeatedly retches and doesn't bring anything up (a sign of bloat) or vomits repeatedly over the course of a few hours, then you should seek veterinary attention. In the meantime, whilst you are waiting for the appointment, take his food away but leave water down. It is best to rest the dog's stomach.

, Indications that your dog may have a digestive problem include its feces becoming runny or liquid, the presence of blood or mucus in the feces, repeated straining to move his bowel, and increased frequency of passing a motion. If necessary, take a photo of your dog's abnormal bowel movement as it is helpful for your veterinarian to see the consistency for himself.

Familiarize yourself with the concept of bloat.,
Consider the risk factors that can make your dog more likely to get bloat.,
Know when bloat occurs.,
Look out for the key danger period.",How to Recognize Bloat in Dogs3," Bloat refers to the stomach filling with gas and becoming distended. The dilated stomach then flips over on itself, sealing off the esophageal sphincter (the entrance to the stomach) and the pylorus (exit). Gas producing bacteria trapped in the stomach continue to ferment and produce more gas, distending the stomach still further.


This outward pressure prevents blood flow to the stomach wall, and without an adequate blood supply this tissue dies off. Toxins are then absorbed into the bloodstream and a combination of toxicity, shock, and circulatory failure will kill a dog who has not been taken into the vet.
Most dogs become seriously ill within 4 to 6 hours, but death can happen in as little as 2 hours after occurrence, which again makes it very necessary to bring your dog to the vet.
Bloat is more correctly known as gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) which is a term that describes the stomach distension followed by twisting.

, Because of their anatomy, some dog breeds are at higher risk of acquiring bloat than others. Typically, deep-chested breeds are at greater risk, such as the German Shepherd dog, Dobermans, Great Danes, Irish and Gordon Setters, weimaraners, and Greyhounds.This is because these breeds have a narrow abdomen and deep chest, such that the stomach is suspended inside the abdomen like a hammock slung between trees. This gives the stomach more range of movement within the tummy, and predisposes it to flipping over on itself, especially if the dog is exercised with food in his stomach.

, It is normal for small volumes of gas to develop during digestion (hence the reason we burp!) Certain foods, such as those with a high cereal or pulse content, produce more gas than others (just think of baked beans!)


Thus, as a result of gas produced during digestion bloat is more likely to happen within 90 minutes of feeding. If that dog then rolls over, or goes for a run, the weight of food is more likely to make the stomach swing from side to side and if it gains enough momentum, possibly flip over.

, The key danger period is within two hours of feeding. Any deep-chested breed predisposed to bloat should be never be exercised within 90 to 120 minutes of eating."

Watch for signs that you should take your dog to the veterinarian.",How to Keep a Dog From Throwing Up," Many dogs gulp their food down way too fast, which means they swallow air with the food. This then causes the dog to be sick later.


Strategies for slowing a greedy eater include putting their food in a muffin tray, putting large rocks (too large to swallow) in the food bowl, or purchasing a commercially available slow feeder platter.;
, Place it on a low wall, chair, or table, so that the bowl is above the dog's shoulder height. When your dog has to raise his front end off the ground to eat, gravity will help the food pass down his gullet down into his stomach.Try keeping him in the raised position for 10 minutes after he's emptied the bowl. This works best if the dog has a condition called megaesophagus in which the dog has weak contractions in the gullet so food takes a long time to pass down into the stomach.

, Review your dog's food intake for the past month and work out what types of meat he has eaten. Then, select a meat he has never eaten before (such as venison) and feed him a diet of just that meat and one carbohydrate source (for example, potato).Some dogs have food sensitivities or intolerances. The allergen is most commonly a protein source (a meat such as lamb, beef, or fish), but can include gluten or even rice. The allergen causes your dog to release inflammatory cells, which causes him to vomit., Alternatively, your vet can advise you about prescription hypoallergenic diets where the hard work of preparation has been done for you. Feed this diet and nothing else, and don't expect to see results for about 2 weeks. It can take that long for the inflammation to settle down.Examples of these diets include the Hills DD range, HiIls ZD and ZD ultra, and Purina HA.

, Worms can sometimes irritate the stomach lining, making the dog more likely to throw up. Regularly have your dog dewormed by the vet, preferably every three months.Consider having your dog dewormed more often if he regularly scavenges or hunts.

, Some dogs suffer from motion sickness when they go on car journeys. Make sure the car is well-ventilated and not overly stuffy. It may help if a small dog can see out of a window, in which case, purchase a dog booster seat to raise him up (always wear a safety harness when traveling in the car).


For long journeys, your vet can prescribe Cerenia (maropitant) which is a highly effective, non-drowsy medication that prevents motion sickness. It won't make your dog drowsy, so he'll be alert for the day. The dose of maropitant is 2 mg/ kg by mouth, once every 24 hours for up to 5 days., If his feces are normal, he is not losing weight, he has plenty of energy and his coat is glossy, but he is throwing up several times a week, considering seeing a vet. In addition, make some observations which can help the vet. Take some photos of the vomit (this can help the vet decide if this is true vomiting, or if the dog is regurgitating food.)You can also keep a simple diary of how often he is sick, how long after eating it happens, and what the dog is fed. This can help you to spot any patterns that emerge. For instance, did the sickness start not long after you changed his brand of dog food? Did the sickness start right after his favorite toy went missing?

, He may still be feeling nauseous and chances are that any food he eats may be vomited back. The repeated contraction of the stomach muscles when the dog vomits can cause inflammation of the stomach lining. This will make him more likely to vomit again, creating a vicious cycle.Avoiding food for the day allows the nausea to disperse and stops the cycle of vomiting. Do however, allow the dog access to drinking water. If he drinks and vomits, seek veterinary attention.

, Allow him to drink small amounts of water regularly (like humans sipping water when sick). For a small dog, say under 10 kg, offer an egg cup full of water every half an hour. If he drinks this without vomiting, then after two hours you can allow him free, unrestricted access to water. If he vomits even this small amount back then seek veterinary attention. (A larger dog, say a Labrador size, is allowed half a cup of water every half an hour).If the has vomited recently, he may wish to get the nasty taste out of his mouth. However, if he goes to a large water bowl and drains the entire volume of water, that water will hit his sensitive stomach and he's likely to vomit the water back up.

, When the 24 hours of no food is up, give your dog a small meal of bland food. This should only be a fraction of his usual amount, to see if he eats and test out if the food stays down. As a general rule bland foods are low fat, white meat such as chicken, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley and an easy to digest carbohydrate such as white rice, pasta, or boiled mashed potato (without the addition of dairy products).Avoid high fat foods such as dairy produce, oily fish, or rich protein sources such as red meat. Your veterinarian can also supply ready-made diets that are proven to speed recovery time from stomach upsets. These include Hills ID, and Purina EN.

, If everything goes well and your dog doesn't throw up again after 24 hours of bland food, transition him back to his regular diet. Avoid sudden changes of food, so mix ⅓ of his regular food with ⅔ bland diet on day 1, then half on day 2, then ⅔ regular and ⅓ bland on day 3, and day 4 entirely back onto his regular food.It is best to feed little and often, so as not to overload his stomach. Try dividing his daily food allowance into four portions and space those four meals out over the day: breakfast, lunch, tea, and supper.

, Throwing up can be a general sign of ill health, and should not be ignored if your dog vomits regularly. A dog that cannot keep fluids down may become dehydrated which is dangerous in itself and requires medical attention. Here are some signs that your dog should get medical attention:Not keeping fluids down: If the dog drinks water but is unable to keep it down, and this persists for more than one to two hours.
If the dog has other problems such as diarrhea (which means he is losing fluid from his back end as well as through vomiting)
Persistent vomiting for more than four hours
Blood in the vomit
The dog is on medication such as a painkiller from the NSAID group (such as Metacam, Onsior, or Rimadyl)
The dog is dehydrated - lift his scruff and let it go. If it takes over 1 - 2 seconds to flatten back down, the dog is dehydrated.
The dog has other health problems such as kidney disease or diabetes.
Lacking in energy or listless.
The dog vomits regularly (daily) and is losing weight.

Understand the difference between diarrhea and soft stool.,
Understand what to do if your dog has diarrhea.,
Understand the dietary needs of dogs.",How to Firm Up Your Dog's Stool1," There is a subtle difference between diarrhea and soft stools. A soft stool is bulky but formed, and you should be able to pick it up for poop disposal. Diarrhea contains much more fluid and is usually liquid, with no form, and impossible to pick up. Diarrhea is usually an indicator of ill health or that the dog is trying to eject potential toxins from rancid food from their gut. Soft stools, on the other hand, are usually not the result of infection or disease, but are a result of an inappropriate or poor quality diet, lack of fiber, or feeding food to which the dog is intolerant., Dogs with diarrhea need to be carefully monitored, with the owner following the dog outside to observe the nature of the tummy upset. If there is blood present, the diarrhea is very watery, or the dog seems unwell — then a veterinary check up is strongly advised.If the dog is otherwise well but has diarrhea, then don't feed them for 24 hours, but make sure plenty of fresh water is available. After a day's starvation, introduce a bland diet such as cooked chicken and boiled white rice (one third chicken, two thirds rice) and feed this for two to three days until the stools firm up. See How to Prepare Chicken and Rice for your Dog for more information.
Any dog that has diarrhea for more that two days should see their veterinarian.

, If your dog has soft stool you will want to improve their stool quality to make poop patrol more bearable and to make sure your dog is in optimal health. Dogs need a diet composed of digestible proteins and digestible fiber in order to be healthy and to have normal bowel movements.Meat-based diets are best for dogs. Dogs can eat a vegetarian or a meat-based diet. However, they do require high protein levels, and in a vegetarian diet this means providing beans and pulses. These have a tendency to cause flatulence and a soft stool. So if your dog in on a vegetarian diet, consider a change to a good quality meat-based diet.

Understand that there is no cure for megaesophagus.,
Use gastrostomy tubes in severe cases.,
Ask your vet if surgery is an option.,
Understand that surgery is not always successful.",How to Manage a Dog with Megaesophagus2," In a small percentage of cases, the megaesophagus is a symptom of another health issue such as an underactive thyroid, or myasthenia gravis. Treatment of this underlying condition can help maximize esophageal motility. However, in the majority of cases no predisposing factor is found and it is a case of management rather than cure.


Sadly, there is no effective drug treatment that promotes muscular contraction in the gullet. A medication called metoclopramide is sometimes used for its prokinetic properties on the stomach and end part of the gullet. However, the drawback is that this drug also increases the tone of the gastric sphincter, so although the esophagus may work harder, it is effectively pushing against the closed door of the gastric sphincter, so you are back to square one.

, In extreme cases of this condition, the lumen of the esophagus is so severely affected that even fluid struggles to pass down into the stomach. These dogs are at risk of dehydration, in addition to being very thin. In these cases a surgical procedure to place a tube directly into the stomach is the dog's best option. This tube bypasses the esophagus so that you can put food directly into the stomach via the gastronomy tube.However, gastrostomy tubes require constant care and rigorous hygiene in order to prevent infection around the stoma site, and it is a huge commitment on the part of the owner.
Food needs to be liquidized in order for it to pass through the gastrostomy tube. After each feeding session, the tube needs to be flushed with water to remove food contamination which could harbor bacteria. Because the tube empties into the stomach, this cannot be done with disinfectants, but must rely on copious flushing with water.
Despite this, tube infections, or infections where the tube is inserted into the skin are common. Should this happen then antibiotics are required, and should the infection be severe the tube has to be removed until the infection is brought under control, and then a new tube needs to be fitted under general anesthetic.

, In the first instance, if the megaesophagus is caused by a correctable problem then an ideal management strategy is surgical correction of that issue. Dogs with a vascular ring anomaly have a persistent right aortic arch that traps the esophagus. This can be identified by barium studies that identify the megaesophagus, and then a specialist tests to identify the abnormal vascular ring. These include endoscopy and/or angiography.


Endoscopy involves passing an endoscope down the esophagus to determine if the gullet is being restricted externally. For angiography the dog is given an intravenous contrast agent and then special x-rays are taken which follow the circulation of the contrast through the circulatory system. If the contrast passes through an extra blood vessel around the esophagus, then the condition is confirmed.
Surgical ligation of this blood vessel means undergoing a general anesthetic and the chest is opened at the level of the fourth intercostal space (the gap between the ribs). The vessel is identified and tied off, which frees the esophagus from restriction.

, However, even with successful surgery the esophagus may remain baggy (much like a balloon that has been repeatedly inflated and deflated, it loses the ability to bounce back into shape).


If this is the case then the dog may still have signs associated with mega oesophagus  such as regurgitation, and may require management as discussed in the previous section.

"
"
Understand the causes of megaesophagus.,
Take note if your dog starts regurgitating his food.,
Identify any difficulty swallowing or weight loss.",How to Manage a Dog with Megaesophagus3," Megaesophagus may happen for two reasons: firstly, damage to the muscular wall of the esophagus means a ring of scar tissue forms, and secondly, because of an anatomical quirk called a ""vascular ring anomaly"".


The latter is caused by the retention of a blood vessel present in the fetus, which should break up before birth. The location of the blood vessel (the right aortic arch) completes a band around the esophagus, equivalent to placing a tight rubber band around a tubular structure.

, This is a passive process, which means there is no muscular involvement—when the dog's head lowers food simply slides back towards the mouth under gravity. This is one of the main symptoms of this condition.Characteristic of regurgitation is that there are no ""heaving"" efforts involved, such as when a dog is sick. Likewise the food that reappears tends to be a sausage shape, reflecting the size and shape of the pocket in the esophagus.
Because the food hasn't got as far as the stomach it consists of chewed food mixed with saliva and is not digested at all.

, Dogs with megaesophagus have difficulty swallowing and make repeated attempts to do so. Another sign is a dog with a good appetite who is either underweight, or has difficulty keeping weight on. This is because he loses calories when he regurgitates, so despite eating well he is not benefiting from the food.

Assess whether your dog's digestive issues are serious.,
Remove food for 24 hours, but leave water down.,
Introduce a bland diet after 24 hours of starvation.,
Feed a bland diet until the dog's stools have firmed up.,
Consider asking your vet for a probiotic suitable for dogs, such as Fortiflora.,
Consider trying a hypoallergenic diet.,
Know what not to feed your dog.",How to Solve Digestive Problems With Small Dogs2," A ""well"" dog with a funny tummy can usually be treated at home. If your small dog has a disturbed digestion but is perky and asking to eat, then you can try to solve the problem before calling the vet.


If the problem persists beyond 24 hours, or the dog deteriorates and becomes unwell, then reassess the situation and call the vet.

, Check the dog is drinking (the water level goes down in the bowl if you don't actually catch him in the act of drinking), which helps him avoid dehydration. If the dog has diarrhea (liquid stools) and refuses to drink, there is a risk of dehydration so phone the vet for advice.

, Feed an easy to digest food that is easy on the stomach and easier for the bowel to digest. A common home prepared diet is chicken and rice. The ratio of rice to chicken is 2 to 1, which means you give 2 cups of rice to every one cup of cooked chicken.


Feed little and often, so four small meals should be spaced over the day.
Alternatively, you can source prescription foods that are designed to ease stomach upsets, from your vet. These include Hills ID, and Purina EN.

, Be aware the volume of stool will be smaller than usual, as so much of the food is digested. Once your dog has produced formed stool for 1 - 2 days, then gradually transition back onto a regular diet.


To do this start by adding in a small amount of the regular food. For example, on switch-over day one, give your dog ¾ chicken and rice with ¼ normal diet. On day two your dog gets ½ and ½, on day three it gets ¼ chicken and rice with ¾ regular food, and then fully onto your dog's normal diet on the fourth day., Sometimes when a dog has an upset stomach it loses the bacteria that aids digestion and gets an overgrowth of bacteria that interferes with digestion. Your dog could need a course of antibiotic to correct the imbalance, but it might be corrected by a course of doggy probiotic. Fortiflora is a powder and comes in sachets. You mix one sachet a day for 5 days with the dogs food. You should see an improvement within this time frame if the problem is due to an bacterial imbalance.
Human probiotics contain different bacteria to those found in the dog gut and are unlikely to be helpful.

, This is a diet that consists of one protein source (a meat) and one carbohydrate (potato, pea, or rice) that the dog has never eaten before. This diet is fed exclusively (nothing other than this) for 8 - 12 weeks.The idea behind this diet is that any allergens or ingredients the dog was intolerant to pass out of the system, and the new protein and carbohydrate do not trigger the same response. It can take around 8 weeks for the inflammation caused by a dietary allergy or intolerance to settle down, so this won't be a quick fix.At the end of this time the dog should have a normal stool, have a glossy coat, and regained lost weight.
If the dog's bowel movement still doesn't improve then dietary allergy is less likely. At this stage he or she really must see a vet.

, Do not feed your dog people food. It's especially important not to feed your dog fried foods, grapes or raisins and their products, dates or dried fruits, olives or their oils, chocolate, and tropical fruits or their oils unless the vet gives the OK. Also avoid wheat, gluten, and soy ingredients if you can; these can cause digestive issues in sensitive canines.

"
"
Decide if your dog's digestive problems are bad enough to warrant a visit to it's vet.,
Take along a fecal sample to the consultation.,
Follow any directions for treatment your vet gives.",How to Solve Digestive Problems With Small Dogs3," If your small dog lacks energy, refuses to eat, passes blood-stained stools, or has a poor appetite and is losing weight, then he or she should see a vet. These could be signs of a severe medical issue.


If the problem is long term, lasting for several days or weeks, and your dog is fed a regular dog food (and you are unable to get to a vet) consider changing his diet. Some dogs have a dietary intolerance and cannot properly digest some of the ingredients in their food., Your vet may want to send it away for analysis and culture to see if any parasites or gut infections are present. This can then point to a specific course of treatment, such as fenbendazole for coccidial infections, or antibiotics for giardia or campylobacter.

, There are a variety of possible diagnoses your vet may give and all of these will have specific treatments. Along with the fecal sample, your vet may take a blood sample to test for common health problems that lead to problems with digestion.


Digestive problems in small dogs can be caused by EPI (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). This is a lack of the digestive enzymes necessary to digest fat, and can lead to cow-pat like, rancid stools. You vet can diagnose this using a blood test and the treatment is a pancreatic enzyme replacement powder sprinkled on your dog's food.Another common issue is low levels of B vitamin in the bowel wall. B vitamins are vital to good appetite and healthy digestion and sometimes the levels do fall. Again, this is diagnosed with a blood test. The B vitamin needs to be boosted up by four, weekly injections. Unfortunately, oral supplements are less effective because the stomach acid is likely to destroy them."

Choose a well-balanced diet.,
Give your puppy a lactose-free diet.,
Switch from wet to dry food.,
Avoid giving your dog fatty foods.,
Feed your dog a bland diet if soft stools persist.",How to Firm Up Your Dog's Stool2," This does not always mean that you need to feed your dog a top-end pet store diet. For instance, the pâté-type diets can be very rich and high in minerals (such as salt) to make them palatable for fussy eaters (in much the same way chocolate cake is more appealing than a bean salad — tasty and healthy don't always match up). Instead, look for a food that lists meat as the main ingredient. It must list actual ""meat"" and not ""meat derivatives,"" ""meat offal,"" or ""meat by-products.""


Choose white meats (low-fat) such as chicken, turkey, rabbit, or white fish. Look for a low number of ingredients, since the food is likely to contain less processed ingredients and preservatives, and contain ingredients closer to the actual food.
Look for the carbohydrate in the form of rice, wheat, oats, or barley, rather than soy or soya products.Although price is no guarantee of quality, expect to pay more for a good quality food than a highly processed, cereal high product simply because you are paying for better quality ingredients.

, The only milk suitable for dogs is bitch's milk. For young nursing puppies this is available as a milk replacer, Lactol, which is made up with water. If your pup is very young and you have just switched them to a milk replacement diet, you should select a lactose-free replacement if you notice your puppy is passing soft stools. Some puppies are born with a deficiency in an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme breaks down the primary sugar component in milk, which is lactose. In effect, puppies with this deficiency cannot break down lactose into sugars that can be digested and absorbed. Because undigested sugars draw water from the intestine, the puppy then passes soft stools., Remember that wet diets (canned or pouched) contain around 75% water, whereas dry diets are around 10% moisture. This higher moisture content translates into wetter, more bulky stools. This will make a big impact on the volume (reduces it) and moisture content (much harder and firmer) of the stool.Take your time to switch a dog over to a new diet. Take at least four to five days, gradually adding the new diet into your dog's existing food and cutting back on the original food. This gives the bowel flora and fauna that aid digestion a chance to adapt.
High protein diets, like beef, chicken, and dog foods with high protein content can also soften stools. By-products of protein digestion also draw water from the intestines.
Wheat-based dog foods, or foods that are high in wheat content can also cause soft stools.

, You should also avoid fats that easily become rancid. Do not give fried fast foods to your dog. Usually fried commercial fast foods are fried using palm oil; this oil is hard to digest and can easily turn rancid. Bad fats can form a layer in the intestine, causing your dog to have watery stools.

, A bland diet would consist of soft cooked rice and lean ground pork or lamb. Feed your dog this mixture for at least five days and check to see if their stool firms up at all. Keep in mind that most commercially available dog foods that are made for improving stool are rice-based because rice is low in protein and salt, and is a very digestible starch.Dog foods that promote more solid stools include: Hill’s Prescription Diet i/d, Royal Canin Intestinal, Eukanuba, Royal Canin Digestive Low Fat, and Hill's Science Diet.

Get bloat treated.",How to Prevent Bloating in Dogs," We are not entirely certain why bloat occurs but we do know that it can run in families. Determine your dogs relatives (littermate, parents) have had bloat. If they have, then your dog has a higher risk of getting it., Middle-aged and older large and giant breed dogs are more likely to experience bloat. Most of these dogs have a deep chest and a thin body frame. These physical traits can contribute to the incidence of bloat., How your dog eats will influence its risk of getting bloat. Feeding habits that can increase the likelihood of bloat include: Feeding a dog from a raised bowl.
Feeding a large amount of food or water at one time or over time.
Once a day feeding.
Vigorous exercise around feeding time.
Rapid eating of food which means more air in the stomach.
Conditions in which the outflow of food from the stomach is slowed or impeded.
Feeding dry foods with a high oil or fat content.

, While there are some factors you cannot change, such as the genetics and the build of your dog, there are some things you can do to lessen the risk of your dog getting bloat. Researchers at Purdue University performed a major study on bloat in dogs.Study results determined that there were some steps that dog owners can do to help prevent bloat. These steps are:


Divide the food into two or more smaller servings a day.
Do not feed from a raised bowl. Feed from a bowl on the ground.
Make sure that fat isn’t in the top four ingredients of the food you feed your dog.
Do not feed an all dry food diet. Include wet foods or large meat chunks in the diet.
Do not moisten dry food.
Wait one hour before feeding and two hours after eating before letting your dog exercise or before going for walks, etc.
For dry food, feed no more than one cup per thirty pounds of body weight per meal (divided between at least two meals).
If your dog is a greedy eater and gulps its food, invest in a food dish that forces the dog to eat slower, such as the slow feeder or fun feeder.

, Discuss with your veterinarian if your dog would be a good candidate for a precautionary gastropexy. Military service dogs (large breeds like German shepherd and Belgian Malinois) are frequently given a precautionary gastropexy to avoid any emergency situations when they are on the battlefield.However, most owners opt to monitor their large and giant breed dogs instead of taking this measure., The signs of bloat usually come on rapidly. These include:Pacing and restlessness
Excessive salivation
Enlarged abdomen (belly)
Reluctance or inability to stand or walk.
Rapid or weak pulse
Pale gums
Retching or dry heaving without bringing anything up. The esophagus is involved in the twist so nothing can come back through the mouth.

, Keep in mind that this is a medical emergency and the dog needs to be taken to the veterinarian as soon as possible if bloat is suspected. Dogs can die soon after the signs appear due to damage done to internal organs, collapse of the circulatory system, toxin buildup, and shock.


A dog that is brought into the veterinarian’s office is first given a physical examination and blood is checked for responses to internal organ damage. Radiographs (X-rays) are generally taken, which will show the bloated stomach along with the twist in the stomach.
In some cases a needle is advanced into the abdominal cavity and suction is applied to the syringe. This is done to determine if the stomach has ruptured, an unfortunate outcome in some cases of bloat.

, A tube may be passed through the dog’s mouth and into the stomach to relieve the pressure of air buildup. Occasionally a tube will be placed directly through the skin and muscle into the stomach to relieve the pressure in the stomach. An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in a vein to provide medications and fluids.The treatment of bloat is surgery to untwist the stomach and to suture part of the stomach to the inside of the abdomen wall to prevent it from recurring. This is called a gastropexy. If the stomach ruptured the stomach will be repaired and the internal abdomen will be flushed.
Dogs will be closely monitored after surgery. Generally the dog will be placed on antibiotics and pain killers before and after surgery. Depending on your veterinarian clinic and how intensive the surgery was, the dog will need to remain hospitalized for up to 7 days.
Sadly up to 15% of dogs with gastric dilation and volvulus do not survive surgery despite the skill of the veterinarian."

Get a container ready.,
Collect the sample without touching it.,
Collect a small sample.,
Make sure the sample is from your dog.,
Get a fresh sample.,
Store the sample in a fridge before the appointment.,
Write your dog's name on the sample container.",How to Get a Fecal Sample from Your Dog," Many people use zip-lock bags to collect fecal samples in. Some people use plastic lidded containers that they don't plan on using again. Whatever container you use, make sure the container is leak proof.


If you are worried about finding a good container, you can always get one at your veterinary office. Drop by before your appointment and ask for a fecal container to use when collecting your sample. Most veterinary offices will always have some on hand.;
, You should either use a disposable utensil or pick the feces up with the container you plan on holding it in. For example, if you use a plastic bag, such as a poop bag, turn it inside out and stick your hand inside of it to use it like a glove. This will allow you to grab the feces and then turn the bag right side out without any skin contact with the feces.


This process will end up with the poop in the bag and your hand clean.
Try to avoid including debris from the area in your sample. Avoid getting a lot of grass or rocks in the sample container but a few pieces will not damage the sample.

, You do not usually need a huge stool sample to bring to the vet. A small sample will be easier for you to deal with and it will provide plenty of feces for the veterinarian to test.Any tests done on the stool will use a minimal amount. With this in mind, usually about a gram of stool is enough.

, If your dog goes to the bathroom in an area where other dogs also go to the bathroom then you need to make sure that you are getting the correct sample. Watch as your dog relieves itself and grab its specific feces.


This does not mean that you need to chase your dog around your yard and collect its feces before it hits the ground. It just means that you need to be sure that you can identify its specific feces by seeing where your dog goes to the bathroom.

, Your vet will need a stool sample that is soft and pliable in order to test for parasites. Don't take the sample too far in advance and don't pick up stool that is old and dried out.Wait until a time close to your appointment to collect the sample, but be sure not to wait so long that your dog doesn't have a bowel movement when you need it to.

, If you can't get a really fresh sample, for instance your dog only poops in the morning and you have an appointment in the afternoon, then store the sample in the fridge.This will help to keep the stool fresh enough so that any tests that are run on it will be accurate.


Make sure that the sample you bring in was collected within 12 hours of the appointment.Be sure to place the sample in the container inside of another container, such as a plastic bag, and keep it well away from the food in your fridge. You may also want to put a note on it to warn any other household members about what is in the container.
Only place the sample in the fridge as a last resort in hot weather if you have nowhere else to keep it cool.

, While you probably only have one fecal sample to deal with, and thus won't get it mixed up with other ones in your fridge, there are likely quite a few in your veterinary office. To avoid any possible confusion at the veterinary office, label your sample with your dog's name."

Talk with your veterinarian about what to expect during the first few days you own a dog.;
, If your dog has a chronic illness or condition, ask your vet if you should expect stomach upsets as a symptom of your dog’s illness.You can create a treatment plan in advance to help manage the stomach problems when they occur.

, If your dog is taking medicine, ask your vet or read the label to know the potential side effects. Some medication may induce nausea, diarrhea, or other stomach problems.


If you think a medication is causing your dog’s sickness, talk to your vet and request a different medicine.
Your dog may vomit out or excrete necessary medications even if this is a garden-variety stomach ache. Talk to your veterinarian about how to make up missed doses of medication.

, There are certain foods that are toxic to dogs and that you should never feed your dog. Some of these foods can cause stomach upsets, while some can lead to serious medical problems, emergency treatment and occasionally quick death. Seek veterinarian attention immediately if your dog may have eaten any of these:Raisins and grapes
Spoiled meats or foods, moldy foods
Cooked bones—the cooking makes them brittle and unsafe for consumption
Gum or food made with xylitol
Alcoholic beverages
Avocados
Macadamia nuts and walnuts
Onions, garlic
Tea, coffee or anything containing caffeine
Chocolate in any form
Dough made with yeast
Cherry, apricot, peach pits and apple and mustard seeds.

, If there has been any trauma, especially a blow or injury to the head, chest or abdomen, call your veterinarian for advice. Your dog may be concussed, in shock, or experiencing internal damage., It is not uncommon for dogs with stomach problems to experience diarrhea and vomiting, much like humans do. If your dog’s vomit, diarrhea, or urine looks unusual, contact your veterinarian.Especially if you notice any blood, blood-like, or black-tarry substance in the vomit or diarrhea. A black, tarry substance in poop might be digested blood.
Especially if your dog is retching uncontrollably or has unproductive vomiting. This could be a symptom of bloat (generally an issue with deep chested large breed dogs) and is a medical emergency.

, If you do not know what is causing your dog stomach problems and your dog seems truly ill, your best treatment involves seeking a professional. If your dog has dull eyes, lack of energy, lack of appetite, blood in vomit or stool, or a painful belly, your dog may have a severe infection. All severe ones require professional help.All infections require adequate fluid intake to treat. Usually this means drinking enough water.Severe cases of infection require intravenous treatment, nutrition, and medications. Non-infectious disease treatment might also involve blood tests and x-rays. Certain disease conditions within the body—such as liver, pancreas, intestinal, stomach disease—will show as diarrhea, vomiting and/or loss of appetite.
Only bacterial infections will respond to treatment with antibiotics. Your veterinarian will make a decision as to whether bacterial infection is likely and thus whether to use antibiotics.
Roundworms (and other intestinal worms) will be treated by specific medications.
There are no specific medications that treat viruses in dogs. However it may be necessary to give your dog supportive care, such as intravenous fluids or drugs to prevent nausea, while the dog's immune system fights the virus.

, Dogs can have an intolerance or sensitivity to food; a true food allergy is rare and typically shows up as a skin issue. If you are unsure about a food sensitivity, eliminate all the common foods that cause sensitivity in your dog’s diet. Replace with a novel, or never eaten food, for a few weeks. Gradually reintroduce various foods to see if the stomach problem reoccurs. Common food sensitivities include:Grains such as corn or wheat
Commonly fed meats such as chicken and beef
Eggs
For example: try replacing these with boiled potato or duck
If the stomach problem still prevails despite diet changes, contact your veterinarian.

, What kind of water is your dog drinking? Sometimes, there are chemicals in your water that are safe for humans, but not dogs. Try switching up what water your dog drinks: try bottled water, filtered water, or water from a different faucet. If the stomach problem prevails, try switching other aspects of the diet, or contact a veterinarian.

, Your dog must be well hydrated in order to avoid dehydration, which can lead to serious complications. However, make sure your dog is not overindulging in water, or drinking too fast.Sometimes, drinking too rapidly can cause nausea and vomiting
Contact your veterinarian if your dog is unwilling to drink water

, You must rest the stomach to give your dog’s digestive system time to reset. When your dog seems calm and comfortable enough to eat again, move on to the next step., You will be making a bland mush for your dog to eat while experiencing stomach problems. Find out how much your dog weighs in pounds (lbs). Divide this by 10. Multiply by 1.25. This is the number of cups of food you should make.Amount of food you need to make for 1 day (in cups) = 1.25 * For example, if your dog weighs 30 pounds, you will need 3.75 cups a day.

, The general ratio for a good recovery dog food is ⅔ white rice and ⅓ white meat. This white meat can be chicken, rabbit, or white fish.


The rice should be cooked and soft
Add beef broth if desired, or if you have a picky eater
Avoid red meats, eggs, and cottage cheese. These foods are not bland enough.

, Feed your dog in 5 servings spaced throughout the day. Feed your dog only this and water.This bland diet and water should help your dog’s digestive system get back on track.

, This ensures your dog’s digestive system is healthy and clear of infection, and that your dog can handle more complicated food. If symptoms reappear, keep serving this diet until symptoms disappear again, and then for 2 more days still. If the reappearance of symptoms seems concerning, contact your vet.

, The other half of your dog’s food should be from its regular dog food., After a few days of rest and a bland diet, your dog should be back to his normal self. If your dog is not better, the symptoms reappear, or the symptoms seem to get worse (lack of energy, refusing to eat, blood in vomit or stool, painful belly), contact your veterinarian."

Give your dog probiotics.,
Add fiber to your dog's diet.,
Make sure your dog always has fresh water.,
Avoid doing stressful activities daily with your dog.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian if soft stool persists.",How to Firm Up Your Dog's Stool3," The gut relies on a population of bacteria to aid digestion. If your dog has had a poor diet and soft stools for a while, then the bowel can get an overgrowth of ""unhelpful"" bacteria, and an imbalance in the natural and desirable bacterial balance in the gut. Supplementing with ""helpful"" bacteria can help correct this imbalance, improve digestion, and firm up a soft stool. The bacteria needed is called Enterococcus faecium and this is contained in non-prescription probiotic powders called Fortiflora. This is a dog-specific probiotic. It comes in sachets and typically you mix one sachet a day into the dog's food, for about five days.Dogs do not have the same bowel fauna as people, so feeding them human probiotics at best is thought not to be helpful, and at worst, the lactose in the human products could trigger diarrhea.Fortiflora can be purchased without a prescription online or from your veterinarian
In general, you should give larger dog breeds at least one small bottle per day for five days, or half a bottle for five days for small breeds.

, Some dogs with soft stools benefit from increased fiber in their diet. Fiber helps soak up fluid like a sponge and can help normalize the feces, drying up diarrhea and firming up a soft stool. It also is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer, and is a bulking agent which helps the dog feel fuller for longer and decrease their calorie intake if overweight.However, you can have too much of a good thing, so on food packaging look for a crude fiber content at or around 10%.You can add fiber to their diet by mixing in oat or wheat bran. Start with around 1 teaspoon per 10 kg of your dog's body weight.
Also consider giving raw fruit and vegetables; however, avoid canned vegetables, as they often have high salt levels.

, Dogs with soft stools lose extra water because of the raised fluid content, so it is important for them to have free access to clean drinking water to replace this lost fluid. Wash and clean your dog’s water bowl at least every other day and make sure that he or she always has fresh, clean water.

, If taking a bath is stressful to your dog, try to delay it for a few days and observe if the stool firms up. In some dogs there is a strong link between stress and digestive disturbances. If this is the case, you need to reduce the stress in order to firm the stool.


Stress causes the physiology of the intestines to become more basic (acidic intestines favor the good bacteria), making it harder for your dog to process foods.In these circumstances give the bowel less work to do by putting the dog onto a bland, easy to digest diet such as chicken and white rice.

, While a lot of cases of soft stool can be cleared up simply through changes to diet, it can be a sign of other health problems. If your dog continues to pass soft stools, even after you have tried changing their diet, take them to a vet to get checked out.

Get further testing.",How to Diagnose Bloat in Great Danes," Your dog's stomach may be swollen if it makes a tympanic, drum-like sound when you flick it. This means the stomach is full of gas. While swelling is the most obvious symptom of bloat, it can be difficult to spot in Great Danes because of their large size. If you're unsure whether your Great Dane has a swollen stomach, discuss your concerns with a veterinarian rather than wait for symptoms to improve. Early treatment of bloat can greatly increase chances of survival.Increasing stomach pressure may lead to:Swelling
Closing of the stomach so that it becomes sealed full of air
Shutting down of blood supply to the stomach wall
Decreased blood supply to major organs
Organ failure
Toxin buildup in the blood stream
Shock from major swings in electrolytes and blood pressure
Death from low blood pressure and toxin buildup;
, Lift up your Great Dane's lips and look at his gums. They should be a healthy pink color and color should quickly return if you press the gums and release your finger. If you notice pale or ashen gums or the gums remain blanched white after you press them, your dog may have bloat.


If your dog's gums are unusually dark red, blue, or white, get medical attention immediately., Your dog may have bloat if he has labored breathing that sounds heavy and rapid. It might sound like your dog is panting instead of breathing. If he has bloat, your Great Dane's pulse will also be rapid as though he just exercised.Under normal conditions, a Great Dane's heart rate is around one beat per second. He should also breathe every two to three seconds during rest., Your Great Dane may drool heavily and have strings of saliva hanging from his mouth. This happens when the stomach is sealed off, leaving swallowed saliva nowhere to go. The Great Dane gives up swallowing and drools instead.You may also notice your dog dry retching. If your dog has eaten recently, but is dry heaving contact a veterinarian immediately.This is a classic sign of bloat.

, Dogs that are deep chested and narrow-bodied are at high risk of bloat. Because of their unique anatomy, Great Danes are at the highest risk of suffering from bloat. A Great Dane's large stomach is suspended in only two places within the abdomen, like a hammock. If the stomach is full of food and gas, it can become unstable and flip over on itself, especially if the Great Dane exercises or rolls after eating.Other breeds that are at high risk for bloat include: German Shepherds, Irish Setters, Red Setters, St. Bernards, and Weimaraners.

, Most noticeably, your Great Dane may be uncomfortable and unable to settle. He may also look anxious and frequently glance at his flanks, where you might notice swelling as air fills his stomach. As the bloat worsens, your dog may become increasingly distressed. He may whine or howl to vocalize his pain and discomfort. If untreated, he will go into shock and might collapse as his circulation system fails.Bloat is usually associated with recently eating a meal. After eating, you may notice your Great Dane become restless and pace around.

, If you suspect your dog has bloat, get veterinary attention immediately. Call or meet with the veterinarian to discuss your Great Dane's symptoms. Since early treatment is vital, it's better to be overly cautious and get medical attention as soon as you see signs of bloat.


Even with veterinary care, around 25-33% of dogs with bloat die, so early treatment is important., The veterinarian will feel your dog's abdomen for signs of tympany (gas build up) and check for signs of shock. If bloat is suspected, the veterinarian might insert a large bore catheter into the stomach where there's the greatest buildup of gas. This will remove the immediate pressure.Your Great Dane probably has bloat if foul smelling gas comes out through the catheter.

, The veterinarian may want to confirm a diagnosis of bloat with additional testing. In one test, your Great Dane will lay on his side while an x-ray is taken of the front of his abdomen. The veterinarian may confirm bloat if the x-ray shows a stomach dilated with air and soft tissue running across it.The veterinarian may also order an ultrasound to look at the location of the spleen. However, it's more likely that the vet will want to begin relieving stomach pressure and corrective surgery instead.
