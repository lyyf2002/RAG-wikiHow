Some dogs have more sensitive stomachs than others and yours may have eaten something that upset it.If you know that your dog has eaten something they shouldn’t have recently, like garbage or feces, make sure that your dog can’t continue to eat this.;
, In most cases, diarrhea can be treated safely and effectively at home. There are cases where your dog needs to be taken to the veterinarian so they can assess their condition and begin treatment. Keep an eye out for the following symptoms. If your dog begins displaying these, take them to the veterinarian immediately:Black or tarry stool
Stool with bright red fresh blood
Frequent vomiting
Loss of appetite
Signs of abdominal pain (like bloating, groaning, or avoidance when their belly is touched)
Marked lethargy
Symptoms lasting longer than 48 hours

, In this context the ""history"" refers to relevant information about your dog, such as the dog's vaccination status (vaccines protect against some of the viral causes of diarrhea), recent diet, and the animals he has been mixing with.


This history should include a detailed description of what the diarrhea looks like and how often your dog has been experiencing diarrhea. This information helps the vet to pinpoint whereabouts in the gut the diarrhea originates from., Based on the veterinarian’s physical exam of the dog, the vet will then decide if additional medical tests are necessary, or if their diarrhea can be treated at home. Your vet may recommend additional testing to rule out other conditions when your dog has chronic diarrhea, which lasts more than four or five days.They may also recommend more testing if your dog loses weight, isn’t responding to bland diets or fasting, or if your dog is displaying other symptoms of a medical condition like a parasite.
At this point, they will either diagnose your dog with acute or chronic diarrhea.

, Based on your veterinarian’s recommendation, you may need to collect a fecal sample from your dog. The vet will then send this sample to a lab to diagnose different medical conditions like parasites, GI disease, or a vitamin deficiency.The vet will give you a fecal specimen container to return once you’ve collected a sample.


Simply scoop a small volume of feces up with the collecting spoon and pop it in the pot, then screw the lid back on. You want to collect a sample immediately after your dog defecates.Once you’ve returned the sample to your vet, they will send it to a lab for testing. There, the laboratory technician will examine the sample for any identifiable conditions, like parasites.

, If your vet thinks that the diarrhea may be caused by an underlying medical condition, they will want to do a blood test for your dog. Some of the medical conditions that the vet will look for include liver disease or pancreatitis.

These blood tests look at organ function and the balance of red and white cells in the body. This gives information about organ health, protein levels, anemia, and signs of infection. In turn these results may suggest a more specific line of investigation that is necessary to diagnose a problem for which diarrhea is merely a symptom., This test is usually saved for last, and will only be scheduled if the fecal analysis and blood tests come back normal or negative, despite their diarrhea continuing. These tests look at pancreatic function, any inflammation, and bowel health.They will use this information to find out if your dog is suffering from a medical condition. If they do find signs that your dog does have a condition like a pancreatic disease, the vet can begin treatment. The treatment for the disease will usually end up stopping your dog’s diarrhea as well.


The vet will also suggest these tests if your dog is losing weight rapidly, despite treatment.
The vet may skip straight to these tests if your dog’s medical history suggests that he may lack pancreatic enzymes.

, Imaging includes radiography and ultrasound. Imaging tends to be reserved for dogs that are losing weight and still have diarrhea, but all of the other tests listed above have come back normal. Imaging allows the vet to take a look at the bowel and see if it looks normal. In particular, this can help to rule out bowel inflammation and cancer., A bowel biopsy is invasive, and has a high complication rate, so it is generally avoided when possible. A biopsy involves surgically entering a dog’s abdomen and removing slivers of bowel wall to be sent for testing.Your veterinarian will discuss the risks, but bowel biopsy is a procedure of last resort and it may well be worth using information from previous tests to decide on a ""educated guess"" treatment (diagnosis by treatment), before resorting to biopsy.

Withhold food.,
Provide clean, fresh drinking water.,
Ease your dog back into a regular diet.,
Feed him a small meal at first.,

Do not free-feed your pet.Some owners free-feed their dogs, meaning they put out large amounts of food and allow their pets to graze throughout the day.,
Buy a good quality dog food.There are some foods in the pet aisle that market themselves toward a specific breed of dog.,
Do not feed your dog from the table.,
Don't let him play with sick dogs.,
Take your dog’s underlying health issues into consideration.",How to Cure a Dog's Stomach Ache," If your dog’s digestive system is upset, you want to let it rest for a while by not giving it any work to do. Feeding a dog requires his stomach and intestine to produce digestive juices to process the food. These juices will probably aggravate any inflammation or soreness he may have, and end up making him feel worse.


Don’t feed your dog for 24 hours.
If he’s still showing symptoms of stomach ache by then, get him checked by a vet.;
, Keep an eye on your dog to check if he’s drinking. If he drinks less than normal over a 24-hour period and still seems uncomfortable, then a vet check is in order. Also be on the lookout for thirsty drinking. Some dogs will drink excessively if they feel sick. A whole bowl of water hitting the stomach at once may cause him to vomit.


If he vomits the water back, ration the water into small amounts every half an hour.
For a dog under 22 lbs (10kg), provide an egg cup worth of water every 30 minutes. For a dog over 22 lbs, provide half a teacupful every 30 minutes.
If the dog drinks and goes 2 - 3 hours without vomiting, then allow free access to water.
If he continues to vomit despite rationing, then a vet check is required.

, If, after 24 hours without food, your dog seems back to normal and is asking for food, feed him a bland diet for the next 24 hours. Low-fat, easy to digest foods include chicken breast, rabbit, turkey, or cod. You can combine those meats with white pasta, rice, or boiled mashed potato (but without the addition of dairy products).


Don’t feed him a 'chicken flavor' food. These usually contain a very low percentage of chicken meat, and re a poor substitute for the real thing.You might ask your vet for dog food designed to speed up recovery from a stomach ache. These include Hills ID or Purina EN diets.

, For the first meal after his 24-hour fast, offer your dog a meal that’s about 1/4th of his usual size, to test out his stomach. A small meal is gentler on his system than a large one. This is a good way of checking out whether or not he truly is feeling better.


If after 24 hours of starvation the dog is not hungry or is still not 100% then a vet check is in order.

, You know from when you’ve been sick yourself that a little sympathy can go a long way to helping you feel better. Sit quietly with your dog and speak in a quiet, reassuring voice. Stroke his head and smooth the fur along his back.


Don’t massage his stomach. Your dog can’t tell you if you’re making him feel better or worse. If you hit a particularly tender spot, you could cause a sudden, sharp pain that makes him turn around and nip you.

, Some dogs seem to benefit from heat therapy. f your dog is shaking, try giving him a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to snuggle up to. Just make sure he can move away from the heat if he finds it uncomfortable. Don’t strap it to him so he’s stuck with it whether he wants it or not.

, If your dog’s in mild discomfort but is otherwise healthy, it’s fine to monitor him and take the above steps to make him more comfortable. However, if he takes a turn for the worse, you should always contact your veterinarian. This includes if your dog starts to show the following signs:


Non-productive retching: A dog trying to be sick but bringing nothing up is a serious sign that could indicate a twisted stomach. Do not hesitate to contact your veterinarian as a possible emergency.
Vomiting for more than 4 hours
Vomiting and not keeping fluids down: This poses a dehydration risk, so contact your vet. They can administer fluids through an IV if necessary.
Dull mental attitude or lack of energy
Not eating for more than 24 hours
Diarrhea (without blood) for more than 24 hours
Diarrhea with blood
Increasing distress such as whining, or crying

, If your dog has regular problems with stomach aches from a known cause (such as a dog undergoing chemotherapy, or who has kidney disease), then your veterinarian may prescribe a medication treat them.


Maropitant (Cerenia) is commonly prescribed for dogs on chemotherapy.This tablet is given once daily, and works for 24 hours. The oral dose is 2 mg/kg, which means an average sized Labrador takes one 60mg tablet once daily.

, Whether your dog is normally high-energy or a couch potato, you’ll be able to tell if he seems more restless than usual. This can be a sign of stomach discomfort.


He may not be able to find a comfortable position to lie down in.
He might pace back and forth endlessly.

, A dog’s flanks are by its hind legs, just in front of its thighs. Sometimes, dogs don’t understand what’s happening to them when they get sick. They crane their necks around looking for the source of discomfort, as if trying to see what is hurting. A dog that’s looking back at its flanks might have stomach pain.

, Stomach ache or cramps can make your dog feel nauseous. When that happens, dogs tend to lick their lips more frequently. Some dogs will lick a forearm or another part of their body in an effort to comfort themselves.


Unusual or excessive drooling can also be a sign of nausea or stomach disturbance. Some breeds naturally drool more than others, so use your knowledge of your pet to decide whether or not the drooling is abnormal.
Gulping is also associated with stomach discomfort.

, If a digestive disturbance caused the stomach ache, you might be able to hear his stomach rumbling. This sound is air moving within the bowel, and it may work itself out as flatulence!


If you can’t hear stomach rumbling, that doesn’t rule out a stomach ache. You just can’t hear it.

, This looks a lot like when your dog bows down in a playing position. You’ll be able to tell whether he’s playing or feeling sick by his demeanor.


The dog stretches with his bottom in the air and his forequarters low to the ground.
With this position, he’s trying to stretch his stomach to ease the discomfort.

, If your dog is suffering from these symptoms, you probably won’t have to look hard. Just like humans, dogs suffer from vomiting and diarrhea when they get stomach upsets. Even though the cleanup isn’t fun, don’t hold it against him! He can’t help it!

, As a dog-owner, you’ve probably learned that your dog will eat just about anything. Unfortunately, this includes rotten food that can cause stomach aches or more serious problems. Make sure all rotten food products are kept secured in your kitchen so your dog can't get into them. Scan your yard from time to time to ensure no vermin or other animals have died on your property. Remember, your dog will smell a carcass before you will.

, An owner may find this easier than keeping to scheduled meals, but experts discourage it. Free-fed dogs tend to eat far more than they should, resulting in obesity and its associated health risks. Binge eating in a short period of time can also result in stomach aches that you could have prevented with a small amount of effort.


Feed your adult dog the same amount of food twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening. How much food you provide per meal with depend on the size of your breed. Because the range provided on dog food packaging can vary wildly, ask your veterinarian for guidance.
You can also find calculators for recommended caloric intake online.After finding out how many calories your dog should be eating per day, look at the calorie content of your food and work out your meal size.

, However, breed has nothing to do with what you should feed your dog. You should focus instead on your dog's size and choose a dog food formulated for his metabolism.


Choose dog foods with high quality ingredients. The cheapest foods on the shelf likely contain cheap, hard-to-digest ingredients.
Just like with human food, dog foods must list their ingredients by how much of a given item is in the food. Look for dog foods that list a protein like fish, meat, or egg as the first or second ingredient. The more protein a food has, the more easily your dog can digest it.

, While dogs seem to eat and enjoy almost everything, their bodies cannot process all the same foods that ours can. Many common household foods are toxic to dogs. The stomach ache your pet gets from eating these foods in small amounts might actually be a reaction to doggy poison. Never feed your dog the following foods:


Avocado
Bread dough
Chocolate
Alcohol
Grapes or raisins
Food with hops in them
Macadamia nuts
Onion
Garlic
Xylitol, a product commonly found in ""sugar-free"" foods

, Just like kids passing around a cold at school, dogs can pass illness back and forth when they come into contact. If you know that a dog has been ill in the very recent past, keep your dog away from him until you're certain the dog is no longer contagious.


At a dog park, this can be hard to figure out because of how many dogs play one place. Also, different dogs show up from day to day.
If your dog becomes ill, you might ask around at the dog park to see if any of the other owners know of another dog that has been ill recently.
Talking to that owner will give you some more information on what is wrong with your dog and whether or not it's serious.

, Some conditions, such as pancreatitis, cause frequent stomach aches. If you know your dog has such a condition, watch him closely for signs of stomach ache or other deterioration on a regular basis. Look for loss of energy, sickness, or diarrhea. Early treatment by a veterinarian can make the episode pass faster and less painfully.


Also be careful if your dog has an illness (like diabetes) that would be made worse by his not eating. A simple stomach ache could trigger it and make it much worse. Contact your vet for advice if you see any change in his eating.

Abnormal behavior
Collapse
Weakness
Difficulty getting up and walking
Reluctance when lifting his head
Depressed demeanor;
, After your dog has vomited, reassure him that he’s done nothing wrong. Try to get him to lie down and rest. If he seems cool or is shivering, put a blanket over him and give him plenty of attention and support.Let your dog take it easy. Help him get comfortable on the floor, so that he doesn't have to try getting up and walking around., Dried vomit can cause your dog's hair to get matted, so it is a good idea to clean him up. Only do this once your dog has rested for a bit and stop cleaning if your dog becomes stressed by the bath.


You may want to place puppy pads or old towels under his chin and around him, so that if he's sick again he doesn't soil the carpet. Some dogs recognize puppy pads as appropriate places to toilet. This may relieve his anxiety about being unclean if knows he has somewhere to vomit.

, Keep a close eye on your dog after he has vomited since repeated vomiting needs medical attention. Signs that he may vomit again include retching, or a noise that sounds like he has something stuck in his throat; a stiff or rigid stance; and wandering around aimlessly., If your dog vomits, but nothing comes up your dog may have a serious and life-threatening condition called bloat. Symptoms include repeated attempts to vomit without actually producing vomit and drooling strings of saliva (because he can't swallow it).Your dog needs emergency medical treatment for bloat, since this serious condition can kill within hours if it's not treated.

, Once your dog vomits, he may feel nauseous which prevents him from wanting to drink. This, along with vomiting up fluid, can cause dehydration if the amount of fluid he loses is greater than the amount of fluid he's taking in.If your dog is showing early signs of dehydration, give him an electrolyte drink mixed with water every few hours for a day. If the dehydration doesn't improve, get medical attention.Early signs of dehydration include:


Excessive panting
Dry mouth, gums, or nose
Visible lethargy (fatigue)
Dry or sunken eyes
Lack of skin elasticity (the skin won't fall back into place immediately if you pinch a little and release it)
Weakness in the hind end (a later stage of dehydration)
Unsteadiness when walking (a later stage of dehydration)

, If the vomiting is simple and straightforward, such as after scavenging garbage, then most times you can nurse the dog better at home by offering fluids, and withholding food. However, you should always watch for signs that your dog needs immediate medical attention. These include:Retching with nothing coming up
Vomiting once or twice with your dog still seeming dull and depressed
Vomiting for more than 4 hours or not being able to keep water down
Vomiting blood which could indicate a serious ulcer in the stomach wall

, Dogs can often regurgitate, raise undigested food with no abdominal effort, without showing signs of other illnesses.If your dog regurgitates, he may just need his food to be raised off the floor so that gravity helps pass the food down into his stomach. However, if your dog forcefully vomits (acute vomiting) the contents of his stomach, this means his muscles are contracting. You'll notice your dog hunched up and the vomit will probably smell foul.Regurgitation is usually a sign of esophageal issues or other problems in the early stages of the digestive process. For example, often dogs eat too much too quickly. In this case, the food your dog expels will usually be undigested and tubular in shape.If your dog regularly regurgitates food, he may have a long term medical condition so put his food up on a chair, but also let your vet assess him., Think about your dog's recent diet, behaviour, emotions, and environmental conditions to determine what might be causing your dog's vomiting. For example, think about recent walks and whether your dog may have scavenged a carcass or eaten discarded food. Vomiting can be a common symptom of ""garbage gut"" where your dog eats things that aren't healthy which causes his body to force out the spoilt food. However, if he keeps vomiting, there may be a more serious cause including:Bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal tract
Intestinal parasites
Severe constipation
Acute kidney failure
Acute liver failure
Colitis
Parvovirus
Gall bladder inflammation
Pancreatitis
Ingestion of a poisonous substance
Heatstroke
An infected uterus
A reaction to medicine
Cancer

, If your dog vomits once, eats normally and has normal bowel movements, the vomiting was probably an isolated incident. If he vomits more than once throughout the day or if it continues beyond one day, take him to the vet immediately.Continued and repetitive vomiting should be investigated more fully by a vet. Your vet should be able to diagnose the condition by conducting a range of tests, including X-rays, bloodwork, fecal analysis, urinalysis, ultrasound imaging, and/or a barium study., Look at the vomit for foreign objects like wrappers, pieces of a plastic bag, bone fragments (you should not give your dog real bones as this are often implicated in vomiting episodes), etc. If you see blood in the vomit, take your dog to the vet immediately since severe blood loss can happen quickly and be fatal.


If there are no foreign objects, look at the shape and consistency of the vomit. Is it undigested food or is it more liquid in form? Write down what you observe so you will be able to tell your vet if the vomiting continues. It may help your vet diagnose your dog if you can show a photo or sample of the vomit.A photo can also let the vet see the volume of vomitus which may influence treatment.

, Vomiting can irritate your dog’s stomach lining, which can lead to more vomiting if he eats anything soon after vomiting. His stomach needs time to rest, and this will help you determine if his vomiting was food-related.Resist the urge to feed him even if he acts hungry. This fasting will also give your dog a chance to eliminate anything that might have caused the vomiting.A puppy or young dog should not fast for more than 12 hours.
If your dog has an underlying medical condition (especially diabetes), speak with your veterinarian before withholding any meals.

, Offer him 1 teaspoon of water for every pound of his weight every hour. Continue giving water this way throughout the day and night until your dog can drink normally. Drinking too much water after vomiting can cause your dog to vomit again, while not drinking any water can cause dehydration.Call the vet if your dog is unable to keep down even this small amount of water.


For example, if your dog weighs 12 pounds, he would get 12 teaspoons (¼ cup) of water every hour throughout the day and night.
Consider getting pedialyte or lectade from a pharmacy or the vet. Follow the packaged instructions to reconstitute this electrolyte powder with boiled water. It's gentler on the stomach and can help reverse dehydration. Offer it in the same quantities that you would water. Be aware that not all dogs like the taste and refuse to drink it.

, To prevent dehydration, you must keep your dog hydrated. Consider wiping your dog's gums with a washcloth soaked in water. This helps freshen his mouth at a time when he feels too nauseous to drink. Or, offer ice cubes for your dog to lick so he at least gets small amounts of water and keeps his mouth moist.You can also try giving him certain teas like lukewarm ginger, chamomile or mint which can help calm his stomach and digestive tract. As with water, you only want to give him a few tablespoons at a time.


If he won’t drink tea, try freezing it in ice cube trays and then breaking it apart into chips. He may take it this way.Keep trying to offer your dog a variety of fluids until you find one that he'll take.

, After 12 hours, begin introducing 2 to 3 teaspoons of foods that are low in fat and easy to digest. Lean meats like skinless chicken and hamburger will provide needed protein, while boiled potatoes, low-fat cottage cheese and well-cooked rice will give him the carbohydrates he needs. Create a mixture of 1 part lean meat to 5 parts carbohydrate. Make sure that these foods are well-cooked, drained of fat, and unseasoned which will make it easier to digest than regular dog food.If your dog does not vomit, give him a little more food every hour or two.But, if he begins to vomit again, take him to the vet for examination.

, After the first day of feeding your dog these bland foods, you can start to mix just a little bit of his regular dog food with the food you’ve been making him for one meal. For example, start with a 50/50 mix for one meal, then 3/4 dog food and 1/4 of the bland diet for one meal. Then return to feeding him normally unless he begins vomiting again.Always follow the vet's recommendations and return for any follow-up exams.


Stop feeding your dog if he begins vomiting again and take him to the vet. It's a good idea to keep a log of what your dog eats and drinks, the amounts he consumes, and his behavior. This will be useful information for the vet.
Don’t experiment with food or medications since this could make your dog’s vomiting worse."
"
Put the dog on a 12 to 24-hour fast.,
Provide fresh drinking water.During this period of fasting, let the dog have access to clean, fresh drinking water.,
Ease your dog off his fast with bland food.,
Try a prescription diet from the vet.,
Ration his portion sizes.Smaller meals give the bowel less stimulation to go into spasm.,
Transition your dog slowly back to a regular diet.,
Administer probiotics.,
Do not give your dog medications for human diarrhea.,
Determine if he’s eaten anything dangerous.,
Take his temperature.,
Take note if diarrhea is combined with vomiting.Vomiting and diarrhea is a dangerous combination because the dog is losing fluid at both ends.,
Check for dehydration.Diarrhea is basically feces that contain a large amount of fluid.,
Inspect the diarrhea for blood.If you find blood in the diarrhea, it may be because of inflammation or hemorrhage.,
Monitor your dog for weakness, lethargy, or collapse.A dog with mild diarrhea is always bright and alert.",How to Treat Dog Diarrhea," The presence of food in the gut causes contractions of the bowel wall to push food along. But if the dog has diarrhea, these contractions can be over-enthusiastic and push food through too quickly in the form of diarrhea. The answer is to withhold food for 12 - 24 hours to let the over-sensitized bowel wall calm down and act normally.;
, Monitor the water bowl to make sure it is going down (ie he is drinking). If he is drinking well, then the risk of dehydration is drastically reduced.

, After the fasting period, do NOT put the dog straight back onto his regular diet. Instead, offer him food that is gentle on his stomach and easy to digest.


An ideal bland diet avoids fatty foods and rich, red meat.
Offer your dog chicken — the actual meat, not than a chicken-flavored food. Don’t give your dog chicken skin, only meat.
Combine the chicken with boiled white rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes.
Avoid milk and dairy products, as many dogs have a lactose intolerance which could trigger diarrhea. This means no butter in the mashed potatoes.
Bland food produces a low volume (and pale) stool, so don't expect your dog's feces to look totally normal. What you are looking for is a stool that can be picked up as a sign he is on the mend.

, If you know that your dog doesn’t respond well to the bland, home-prepared meal, ask your veterinarian for prescription dog food for healing stomachs. Diets such as Hills ID and Purina EN are proven to speed up the recovery time from diarrhea.

, When your dog ends his fast, feed him the same amount of food in a day as his normal diet. However, divide it into four smaller portions and spread the meals throughout the day. This will prevent his diarrhea from returning.

, Once your dog’s diarrhea has safely passed, you can begin easing him back into a normal diet. Don’t switch him straight back onto his normal food, as the bowel needs time to heal. Stick to the bland diet for two days to make sure the diarrhea has passed. Then take a further 2 days to transition him back onto normal food using the following method:


Mix ⅔ bland food with ⅓ normal diet.
The next day, change to ⅓ bland diet and ⅔ normal food.
On the third day, it's okay to put him back onto a normal diet.

, Probiotics are bacteria helpful to digestion that speed up recovery from diarrhea. Useful bacteria can be lost during the violent expulsions of diarrhea. It then takes time for the population to build back up again and digestion to reach full efficiency. A supplement of probiotics boosts the bacterial population. Generally, probiotics are mixed into the dog’s food once a day, for 5 days.


The natural bacteria in a dog’s bowel differ from those in human’s. Don’t give human probiotics to dogs.
A variety of canine probiotics are available without prescription from your veterinarian, pharmacist, or major pet stores.

, Mild diarrhea should respond to the above steps. Giving your dog a drug that reduces bowel movement may hide a serious problem until it is too late. If the original symptoms do not settle after 2 -3 days with the methods mentioned above, chances are your dog has a problem which needs veterinary attention., Diarrhea is usually caused by a dog eating something he shouldn't. In most cases, he’ll get better whenever his body eliminates whatever he ate.


However, if you find out your dog’s consumed something toxic, like rat poison or household cleaning products, then take him to the vet immediately.

, Simple diarrhea is rarely accompanied by a fever. If your dog’s running a fever, he’s probably suffering from an infection of some sort. To take your dog’s temperature, have a friend restrain him by sliding an arm under his stomach and pulling the dog’s hindquarters against his/her chest. The friend should place their other hand firmly under the dog’s chin. Gently restrain the dog and speak in soothing tones if it begins to wriggle. Place a muzzle on the dog if you’re worried he’ll bite during the procedure.


Lubricate the thermometer, then, lifting the tail up, insert it gently into the dog’s anus. On a female dog, make sure you’re not inserting it into the vulva, which is found just below the anus.
Do not force the thermometer in, as you can injure your dog.
Wait for the thermometer to beep, letting you know it’s finished taking its reading.
A normal temperature is 100.5 to 102.5 F.
Any temperature of 103.5 F or higher is considered feverish., This puts him at risk of dehydration. This is especially worrying if the dog is unable to drink and hold fluids down. In such a case, seek urgent veterinary attention.

, If the dog passes a lot of diarrhea and doesn't replace that fluid, he will become dehydrated. Dehydration reduces the blood supply to organs such as the liver or kidneys, which can potentially cause damage.


To test for dehydration, lift the dog's scruff away from the shoulder blades and then let it go.
Fully hydrated skin pings right back into position.
The skin of a dehydrated dog is less elastic, and may take a couple of seconds or longer to fall back into place.

, While inflammation is uncomfortable, hemorrhage is potentially life-threatening. You won't be able to tell the difference at home so don't take any risks. Seek veterinary attention as soon as you see blood in your dog’s stool.

, If your dog is bright eyed and bouncy, but has diarrhea, monitor him carefully for the development of the signs above. Its okay to try controlling the problem yourself.


However, if your dog lacks energy, is listless and unable to settle, or worse - collapses, then seek professional help.

Recognize acute diarrhea.,
Fast your dog.,
Try feeding them a bland diet.,
Give your dog probiotics.",How to Diagnose and Treat Dog Diarrhea2," Many dogs have an upset stomach but are not sick in any other way. This means that while they have diarrhea, they are otherwise healthy. Diarrhea that occurs suddenly and stops after your dog fasts or has a bland food diet is acute.


For these dogs treatments like withholding food and then re-introducing a bland diet may be all that is needed., Diarrhea is a symptom of gastrointestinal (GI) distress. For a dog experiencing acute diarrhea, their stomach and GI tract need time to recover after they have had diarrhea. Do not feed your dog for 24 hours after they have experienced diarrhea.This 24 hour period gives your dog’s GI tract a chance to recover and heal.
Continue to give your dog small amounts of water so they do not become dehydrated.

, After your dog has completed the 24 hour period without diarrhea, you can reintroduce food. Healthy dogs that are suffering from diarrhea may only need a few days of bland food to reduce their discomfort. Rather than feeding them their regular dog food, try feeding them a bland food diet for 24 hours.


Offer your pet a small meal of boiled chicken and white rice. Do not use any seasonings when you cook the food as they may upset your dog’s stomach.You can continue feeding your dog this bland food diet until their stool becomes normal again., Diarrhea physically expels the bacteria in the bowel that help your dog digest food. To speed up recovery, it helps to give your dog a dietary supplement that contains helpful bacteria to help get your dog’s digestive system back on track.There are many canine probiotics available without prescription from your veterinary clinic, such as Promax (an oral paste) or Fortiflora (granules which are added to food). Typically these are given once a day for three days.
Dogs use different digestive bacteria than people do, so there is no point feeding your dog a human probiotic product.

Determine if your dog has chronic diarrhea.,
Treat parasites.,
Try putting your dog on a hypoallergenic diet.,
Give your dog vitamin B injections.",How to Diagnose and Treat Dog Diarrhea3," If your dog’s diarrhea is the result of an infection or disease, rather than snacking on something he shouldn't, then medical treatment may be needed. Your veterinarian will recommend the best course of treatment for your dog based on their diagnosis.It is important to treat the underlying cause of chronic diarrhea rather than just the diarrheal symptoms.Never give your dog over the counter medicine unless you have spoken to your veterinarian. These medicines, while they may work for acute diarrhea, could aggravate your dog’s underlying condition and make them worse.

, One of the common underlying causes of diarrhea is the presence of intestinal parasites, like worms. If the fecal analysis shows the presence of worms, your veterinarian will recommend an oral medicine to kill the parasites and then an additional medicine to prevent future parasites.A single oral dose will get rid of the parasites present at that moment in time. It is wise to repeat the dose a month later.It is important to use preventative care when it comes to parasites in your dog. By using a preventative oral or topical medicine, you can lessen the chances that your dog will experience diarrhea from this condition., If a dietary allergy or food hypersensitivity is suspected, then removing the allergen from the diet will treat your dog’s diarrhea. Your vet will recommend a commercial prescription hypoallergenic diet for your dog.By changing your dog’s diet to remove this allergen, their diarrhea should stop.
Changing foods can also upset your dog's stomach, so you will need to gradually introduce this new food by mixing it with their old food.

, Some dogs with chronic diarrhea experience this condition because they have an enzyme deficiency. Injections of B vitamins will replace the enzymes that your dog isn’t naturally producing. This kind of treatment is usually seen in dogs that have pancreatic conditions.


Injections will be stopped once your dog’s enzyme levels are high enough and their chronic diarrhea stops.

If you know your dog has eaten a food or substance that does not agree with it immediately stop your dog from gaining access to that item.
Non-specific gastroenteritis, otherwise known as an upset stomach, means no cause for the stomach upset can be found and the illness passes rather quickly. The other common causes of acute vomiting generally need medical or surgical intervention to diagnose and treat.;
, Many things can cause episodes of acute vomiting. Common causes, other than non-specific gastroenteritis, include:Liver disease
Kidney disease
Pancreatitis
A foreign body in the intestines (rocks, bones, toy)
Ingestion of toxic substances
Inflammation of the intestinal tract

, Chronic vomiting is vomiting that happens off and on with some regularity. While it is normal for a dog to vomit occasionally, due to an upset stomach, this behavior on a consistent basis can signal that there is a larger health problem.

, Some cases that are thought to be vomiting are actually cases of regurgitation.Vomiting is the ejection of food from the stomach. Generally there are some “warning” signs before vomiting, such as licking the lips, salivation or acting uncomfortable. With regurgitation, food is ejected from the esophagus generally without force and without warning. It is important to recognize the differences between the two, as they have different causes. For example, regurgitation is caused by disorders with the esophagus such as:Esophagus weakness due to diseases such as myasthenia gravis and Addison’s disease
Megaesophagus (non-reversible enlargement of the esophagus)
Foreign body stuck in the esophagus
Inflammation especially that caused by frequent vomiting
Stricture or narrowing of the esophagus (this generally happens after injury to the esophagus)

, Because of the many sources and causes of vomiting, it can be hard to figure out the most appropriate treatment. The first step to curing the problem is coming up with an accurate diagnosis of the problem.


Most of the time to get an accurate diagnosis you need to bring your dog to the veterinarian. An examination will be performed and, depending on the results, further testing may need to be done. Blood and urine tests can determine if your dog suffers from a disease, such as kidney or liver failure, pancreatitis, or if an infection may be causing the vomiting. X-rays can help determine if your dog has eaten a foreign body or if there is a mass (tumor) in the gastrointestinal tract.

, It is okay to watch your dog closely at home if your dog is still happy and begging for food after it vomits. If it has other symptoms, such as lethargy or spasm, you should take it to the vet immediately.


Keep your dog happy but it is also a good idea to protect your home from additional messes. Place the dog in a room with hard floors, in other words no carpet, so that any future vomiting can be easily cleaned up. Keep it company, however, and try to soothe it with lots of love and affection.

, The treatment for dogs with upset stomachs is to withhold all food for 12 hours (despite the begging) and give them small amounts of water every 2-3 hours during this time. If they are able to keep the water down after 12 hours of food withholding, you can offer them two teaspoons (for a small dog), two tablespoons (for a medium sized dog), or ¼ cup (for a large dog) of a bland diet.


A bland diet consists of carbohydrates and proteins that a dog can easily digest. The most common bland diet to give a dog is a mixture of cooked white rice and boiled chicken, without bones or skin.This meal gives your dog's digestive system a break because it is very easy to digest.
If the dog can keep the first small amounts down, offer the diet in these same amounts every 3 - 4 hours for the first day. Then mix it with the dog's regular food half and half the next day. By day three, the dog should be back to its regular food and feeding amount.

, Even after your dog has stopped vomiting, you should still keep a close eye on them for a few days. Call a veterinarian if the following occurs:


If the dog is continuously vomiting.
If the dog has other signs of illness: diarrhea, extreme lethargy, pale gums, frequent urination, yellow appearance to the eyeballs or skin.
If after a 24 hour food withhold the dog is still vomiting.
If you have any other concerns or suspect it’s more than a simple case of vomiting.

, At any time if the dog starts to vomit again or is unable to keep water down it should be brought to a veterinarian’s office. It should also be brought to the veterinarian's office if any of the following signs occur:


Increase in frequency or amount of urination
Yellow appearance to eye whites, skin or mouth
Pale gums along with extreme lethargy
Vomiting blood
Diarrhea that is very watery or has blood in it

, Treatment depends upon the cause of the vomiting. Some treatments include:


Withholding of food for up to 24 hours, then a gradual reintroduction of food or a bland diet for up to 7 days. The dog can have small drinks of water as long as it is able to keep this down. Otherwise withhold water as well.Medicine to treat intestinal parasites, inflammation, or infection.
Surgery to remove foreign bodies.

, Ongoing management will be needed in cases of chronic diseases. Food and medication changes are used to manage liver disease, inflammation of the intestinal tract, kidney disease, Addison’s disease, and myasthenia gravis. Food changes may also need to be made in dog’s with sensitive stomachs.In dogs with megaesophagus special feeding arrangements need to be made along with food and medication. These dogs need to be fed in a vertical position, not merely from an elevated bowl, and they need to stay in that position for 20-30 minutes after eating to ensure all the food stays in the stomach. A special chair, called a Bailey chair, can be made or purchased to keep them in this eating position.A soft to wet food diet is also recommended along with medications to increase the movement of the esophagus and to reduce acid from the stomach. With proper feeding position, food and medication dogs with megaesophagus can lead a long and healthy life.

Look for dry-vomiting.,
Check for excessive drooling.,
Look for signs of anxiety and restlessness.,
Feel your dog’s stomach for tightness.,
Consider your dog’s general personality and demeanor.",How to Detect and Prevent Bloating and Torsion in Dogs1," One of the more common symptoms of bloating and torsion, when your dog’s stomach turn or twist up to 360 degrees, is an attempt to vomit with no results. This can often sound and look like a dry-heave or sound more like a deep repeated cough.Vomiting with no results might also produce mucus or foam. Unless your dog is vomiting up more solid food they may be bloated or distended.Check your dog’s mouth for other related objects or foods that might be causing a similar symptom, like grass or plastic that might be blocking their windpipe.;
, Excessive drooling is a sure sign that something is negatively affecting your dog. If your dog is suffering from torsion and bloating they will likely be drooling for extended periods of time. Check your dog’s mouth and gums, as well as their bed and the floor around them, for excess drool. However, keep in mind that drooling is a general reaction that your dog will have to negative stimuli, which can also include vertigo and allergies.Drooling, paired with other symptoms, will help you determine what your dog might be suffering from. Consult your vet for a more informed opinions on what might be causing your dog to drool excessively.

, Many dog’s will be much less active when suffering from bloating and torsion as their stomach will make many movements uncomfortable. Dog’s suffering from bloating and distention might also be hunched or curled over by trying to physically compensate for the discomfort.Try calling your dog over to you if you think your dog is displaying unusual behavior. If they react in a way that is not normal, like slowly limping over or refusing to move, they may be experiencing physical discomfort.
Examples of signs of restlessness and anxiety are fidgeting, sighing or whimpering, constant eye movements, furrowed ears, and grimacing., Although this symptom is not the most pronounced or easiest to identify it is a clear sign that your dog is suffering from torsion and bloating. You should be able to tell if your dog’s stomach is tight by having them stand up and placing your hand on their abdomen, below their ribcage. Their stomach should feel soft and tapered when relaxed. If their stomach is firm, or makes a hollow sound like a drum when you pat it softly, they may be suffering from bloating or torsion., Taking your dog’s personality or general disposition into account will help you gauge when and if they are suffering from discomfort. Look to see if your dog is displaying any unusual behaviors, like lethargy when they are usually playing unusual body language, to determine whether or not they might be ill.


Bloating, torsion, and torsion is most common with specific breeds that have large chests, like Great Danes, Saint Bernards, Setters, Dobermans, and Sheepdogs."

Dry your puppy.",How to Give a Newborn Puppy a Bath," If you want to bathe your newborn puppy, you’ll need to make sure you have a few things you’ll need in the process. Purchase some tearless shampoo intended for use on young puppies. This will be gentler for the puppy, especially if it gets in the puppy’s eyes on accident. You’ll also need some warm towels, a wash cloth, a nonslip mat, and a hair dryer.Never use human shampoo on newborn puppies as most products contain chemicals that could be harmful for your tiny pup.;
, Since newborn puppies have fairly weak immune systems, you need to make sure the bathing area is clean before you introduce the puppy to possible germs. Use a natural cleaning solution to wipe down the area as harsh chemicals found in many cleaners could be harmful to the puppy as well.For example, if you are bathing the puppy in the kitchen sink, make sure you clean up any food remnants or germs that the puppy could be exposed to.

, Brushing your puppy is an important part of getting ready for bath time. Since water can worsen mats and tangles that already exist in their coat, it is important to brush these out before you get your pup wet. Spend a few minutes brushing your puppy’s coat out so that there are no more tangles.Regularly brushing your puppy’s coat will also help decrease the required frequency of baths because it helps keep your puppy clean.

, Since puppies have a hard time maintaining their own body temperature, it’s important that you keep them warm during bath time. The main thing you need to worry about is using warm water (not too hot though) during the bathing process. Use water that is comfortable on your own skin to wet the puppy down and to rinse out the shampoo.Test the water with your hand before getting the puppy wet so that you can make sure it is not too hot or too cold.

, Once the puppy is wet, it’s even more important to take steps to keep it warm. Use towels that are warmed slightly to keep the newborn puppy’s body temperature up while it is wet. You can put the towels in the dryer for a couple of minutes to heat them up a bit.You can also hold the puppy against your skin while it is wrapped in the towel to use your own body heat to help the puppy stay warm.

, After bathing your puppy, you want to make sure it stays inside your warm, heated house rather than going outside where the cold air could drastically affect the puppy’s body temperature with its damp fur. Keep the puppy inside the house where it can stay warm.You also don’t want your puppy to go roll around in something that could get it dirty again after you’ve just gone to the trouble of bathing it.

, Use warm water to get your puppy’s fur wet. Put the puppy on a nonslip mat in the sink and use the dish-spray hose to gently work the water into the puppy’s coat. You should start at the back end and move forward from there so that your puppy gets used to it easier and doesn’t panic.Be careful not to get the water in the puppy’s eyes as this will cause discomfort for the puppy and make it struggle against the bath even more.

, Use a warm washcloth to work the shampoo into your puppy’s coat. Apply a small amount of the shampoo onto the washcloth and gently rub it all over your puppy’s body. Keep the shampoo out of your puppy’s eyes, ears, and nose to avoid discomfort.Be sure to keep one hand on the puppy, keeping it stable, while you use the other hand to rub the washcloth around on the puppy’s body.
Remember to get the dog’s ears, butt, stomach, legs, paws, back, belly, and neck while washing.

, Use the dish-spray hose again to gently spray warm water on your puppy to get the shampoo out. Begin at the rear end and work your way forward, making sure you get all of the soap suds out as you go.Alternatively, you could use a cup that you fill with warm water over and over to rinse out the shampoo.

, Once you are done bathing your newborn puppy, you need to act quickly to get your puppy warm and dry again. Use a warm towel to rub the puppy and soak up any excess water.If you feel comfortable doing so, you can use a hairdryer on the puppy after you have towel-dried it. Make sure you put the hairdryer on a low setting so that it doesn’t get too hot for the puppy and so the sound will be a bit quieter.

While thorough cleanings are recommended from time to time, you may just have a muddy pup on your hands who needs a little rinsing. Before getting started, gather these materials so you have everything in one place:


Towels: enough to both dry the dog and protect the ground from splashing water
Dog shampoo: shampoo formulated for humans will dry out a dog's skin, so buy dog shampoo at the pet store, vet, or online. If your dog has any skin conditions, consult your vet for recommendations.
Sponge
Comb or brush
Small cup or bucket (for pouring water)
Doggy treats (optional, but can comfort stressed dogs);
, While bathing a dog too often will cause dry, flaky skin, you should still give him a thorough cleaning every once in a while. When you notice your dog getting smelly, it might be time for a cleanup. You'll need everything listed in the last step, plus as many of the following optional materials as you'd like:


Dog conditioner: this will keep his fur soft and smooth after shampooing
Toothbrush and dog toothpaste
Cotton balls for ear cleaning
You don't have to do all these things at once the first time. If you feel your dog is getting overwhelmed, just work on the bath-time first. Then, you may add in more extensive things, like nail trimming, later.

, Since your dog is small, you have the option of choosing a bathtub, sink, or even a plastic tub or bucket outside. Choose a location where you can stand, sit, or kneel comfortably without straining yourself. The bath area should be warm and free of drafts — only bathe a dog outdoors on hot days, so he won't get cold.


If there's any chance your dog will get skittish and jump away from you, bathe him in a bathtub. Don't risk a fall from the sink!
Consider taking your dog with you right into the shower. You'll get wet no matter what, so this can be an effective time and mess-saving approach.
Put cotton in your dog’s ears if you take him into the shower. This prevents water from getting in the ears and causing an ear infection.

, To keep your dog from slipping on the wet surface, give him a mat or towel that will help keep his feet under him. He'll feel more comfortable and secure, making it easier for you to proceed with the bath.

, But whether you have an adult or puppy, the bathing process might scare your dog, so take things slowly. Help him associate the tub or sink with pleasant things by going through several dry runs. Depending on the dog, this might take a few days, a few hours, or just a few minutes — let your dog set his own pace.


Help your dog into the dry tub. Speak reassuringly in a soothing voice, petting and praising him while he sniffs around and explores. Give him treats for being calm inside the tub.
Touch and rub him all over while he’s in the tub, so he knows how the bathing process will look.
When he's comfortable with that, try splashing a little water on him and continue praising and treating.
Let him hear the sound of the running faucet while he’s not in the tub until it’s no longer frightening.
Rub him down with a dry towel after every session, to get him used to the drying process.
Place him in a tub or sink that has enough water to just cover his paws, then gradually work up to a full, immersive bath.

, If the fur is too matted, take your dog to a professional groomer, then groom him more regularly in the future to avoid matting. Even professionals can knick the skin handling severe mats — you might do serious damage trying to do it yourself.


To remove small mats, place your fingers between your pet’s skin and the mat, then snip it away a few hairs at a time.
Check under the tail for fecal mats (""dingleberries"") that need to be trimmed off. If the stool is too hard, you can wait until after it's soaked in the bath to work it out of the hair.
After the bath, put diaper rash or hemorrhoid cream on any irritated skin around the anus after the mat is removed.

, If you intend to wash your dog's face, you can buy ointment that will prevent stinging from soap. This is especially important for breeds with protruding eyes. You can buy this ointment from your veterinarian's clinic. You can also use a drop of mineral oil instead of prescription ointment.


Use a dropper to place the ointment or mineral oil onto the eyeball without touching the eye itself.
Let the dog blink several times (or push the eyelid open and shut yourself) to spread the ointment or oil around.
Never use your finger to wipe ointment onto the eye, and don't let the tip of your container touch the eye.

, If water or shampoo gets into your dog's ear during the bath, it can result in an ear infection. To prevent this, gently tuck a small piece of cotton ball into each ear, but be careful not to push it in too far. You should be able to see it and pull it out easily.


If in doubt, skip the cotton ball and use a washcloth to wash the dog's head instead of pouring water over it.

, The water level should reach your dog's chest level. Test the water temperature before beginning to wet your dog's coat. It should be warm, but not hot. Keep your hand in the water to make sure the water temperature remains correct.


Lift your dog gently into the tub if he can’t get in on his own.

, Work from the front to back of the body, but save the head for last so shampoo doesn't have time to drip into his eyes. Work the shampoo into a gentle lather, moving from the neck down the back to the rear, then on to the belly and legs. Make sure to get between the pads and toes and over the tail and genitalia. Combine your rubbing with soothing praise — your dog should be enjoying your caring touch!

, Skin problems can often indicate more serious health concerns, so take this hands-on opportunity to inspect your dog. Look for strange marks on the skin, rashes, flaking, redness, lumps or bumps, hair loss, or change to skin color.Your vet can perform tests to figure out if these things are skin issues, or whether there may be internal problems., If you're using a kitchen sink, you can use the spray attachment if you have one. If not, just pour water over the coat using a cup or bucket. Either way, use a wet washcloth on the face so you don’t overwhelm the dog. If you can still see bubbles on the dog, you need to rinse a couple more times. Any soap, shampoo or conditioner residue left on the dog will attract dirt, defeating the purpose of the bath. Soap residue can also irritate your dog and cause itching.


A dog conditioner is a good idea for dogs with long fur. Apply after thoroughly rinsing out the shampoo and follow the instructions on the bottle.
You can buy a bathtub spray attachments at the pet store or online.

, If a dog swallows human toothpaste, he's likely to get an upset stomach. Make sure your dog is used to you handling his mouth before brushing his teeth, so you don't get nipped on the hand.


Lift his lips and brush the teeth at the front of the mouth.
Gentle encourage him to open his mouth by pulling up on his muzzle. Brush the inner teeth.
Give praise and speak in a soothing voice throughout, taking frequent breaks for petting.

, Apply it to a clean cotton ball or an ear-cleaning pad bought at a pet store. Wipe the cleanser first over the outside of the dog's ears, then over the inside of the dog's outer ear. You can move a little way into the ear canal, but don't poke your finger into the dog's ears.


Do not pour anything, including water, into your dog's ears, as it can get trapped down by the eardrum and cause infection.

, Place your dog on a dry towel, then wrap him in another towel to absorb most of the water. Change towels as needed to continue drying your dog's coat. Let his coat air dry once you have blotted up as much water as you reasonably can. Dry the insides of the ears with cotton to prevent infection.


Blow-dry the coat to speed up the process, if he tolerates it. Make sure to keep it on a cool setting so you don't burn the dog's skin.
If your dog is scared of the blowdryer, don't push him. Put in the extra time needed for a towel-drying.

, Shower him with praise and give him a tasty treat, even if he had trouble getting through the experience. He'll quickly learn that getting a bath is not a frightening experience, but one that leads to treats!

, It's very important to brush your dog after every bath so his hair doesn't get matted or gets dandruff. As with humans, brushing or combing is a lot harder when the hair is wet, and you run the risk of damaging the fur. Furthermore, you risk building up an unpleasant association between baths and painful skin-tugging. Wait for the coat to finish air-drying before you brush it out.

Calling your vet as soon as you are able to identify and detect the symptoms of stomach bloating in your dog will help you determine whether or not your dog needs immediate medical attention. Only your vet or another trained professional will be able to accurately diagnose your dog’s condition. Be sure to give your vet an approximate arrival time so they can be ready to treat your dog immediately.Call your vet and describe symptoms by saying, “I think my dog is suffering from torsion, they are trying to vomit and are displaying anxious behavior” or “My dog’s stomach is very tight and they are not walking around very often.”
Remember, only your vet will be able to treat your dog’s bloating or torsion.

, Your vet should be able to give your dog an x-ray once you bring them to their office. An x-ray will help determine whether or not your dog has stomach dilation (bloating) or GDV (bloat and torsion). Bloating can often be treated with less invasive procedures whereas bloat with torsion will often require an emergency surgery.

, Surgical correction is often needed in cases of bloating and torsion. The immediate concerns of GDV surgery are to return your dog’s stomach to a normal position and identify any damage done to the stomach or spleen. However, depending on your dog’s condition, and how long they have been suffering from torsion, there may be limited options.Ask your vet when euthanasia should be considered. Your dog’s chances of survival will be poor if they have suffered from cell death or perforation of any kind.

, This should not be done unless you are comfortable with the known causes and symptoms of bloating and torsion. The first step in treating any case of bloat and torsion is to call your vet immediately. Once your vet is notified that you are bringing your dog in for treatment, consult first aid guides detailing specific actions that can be taken, like Kifka.Remember that first aid is first aid and not treatment.

Ask your vet about preventative gastropexy.,
Feed your dog smaller meals throughout the day.,
Add high protein wet food to your dog’s meals.,
Avoid exercise after meals.",How to Detect and Prevent Bloating and Torsion in Dogs3," Preventative gastropexy is a non-invasive surgical procedure that can be performed on dogs that are prone to bloating and torsion. There are a few different procedures when performing gastropexy, but most result in adhering part of the dog’s stomach to their torso to prevent torsion.Consult your vet to see which gastropexy options are available and which might be most effective for your dog., Feeding your dog only one large meal a day can cause bloating and torsion as your dog will likely be eating too quickly. Separate your dog’s daily food allotment into 2 to 3 smaller meals throughout the day in order to promote healthy eating and digestion. Align your dog’s eating schedule with your own, give them food before you begin your day in the morning and food again in the evening.Try using automatic dog feeders if you find that your schedule will not allow you to feed your dog multiple regular meals.

, Many dry foods can be too rich in carbohydrates and be over processed for dog’s digestive systems. Dogs who eat highly processed grain diets will often have weaker stomach muscles, which can increase the risk of bloat and torsion. Add high protein wet food to your dog’s meal to increase your dog’s nutrition and digestive activity so that they can naturally decrease their risk of bloat or torsion.Start by supplementing half of your dog’s dry food for wet food.
Consult your vet or local pet store about high protein wet foods. Ask questions like, “Which wet foods do you recommend for my dog?” or “Is there a particular food or brand that helps combat bloating and torsion?”

, Exercising your dog after they have just eaten increases their risk of bloating or torsion as their stomach will be full, heavy, and easier to twist. Give your dog at least 2 hours of digestion time before you take them on a walk or have high energy play. Try feeding your dog an hour after they have exercised to create a simple and healthy feeding routine.

Bathing your clumsy dog outdoors instead of inside is a great way to help minimize the damage done to your home.But make sure you only bathe your dog outside when the weather permits. If it is too cold or raining, you should probably forego this option.;
, It is important to brush your dog out before you give it a bath. This will help remove any loose fur and to get rid of any troublesome tangles in your dog’s hair.Brushing your clumsy dog beforehand will also help make bath time easier because you won’t have to fight with the tangles in your dog’s fur while they are

, If you are giving your dog a bath outside, make sure to do it safely. Your dog should be contained somehow so that they cannot run away. You would probably feel terrible if your dog was scared from the bath and ran away from home.You can try to bathe your dog in a fenced-in yard. Or you could tie your dog’s leash to something sturdy so it can’t get away.

, When washing your pet, it is important to follow some basic guidelines to help keep your pet safe and happy. You don’t want to do anything to unintentionally make your pet uncomfortable during bath time.Make sure you keep the water and the shampoo out of your pet’s eyes and ears.

Make sure to have all your supplies by the sink; this way you won't have to interrupt your dog's bath or leave them unattended to go get something later. Your bath time supplies should include:Dog shampoo and conditioner
Towel to dry your dog after the bath
Treats
Brush or comb
Dog toy
Hair dryer (optional; kept away from the bathing area)

, To prevent water from entering your dog's ears, place small cotton wads in each ear. Do this gently and be careful not to hurt the dog if they wriggle around during this process. To make things easier, brace the dog's head and offer them something to bite (like a toy or bone) while you insert the cotton.Don't push the cotton in too far.

, If your small dog has long hair, run a brush or comb through it before the bath. Be sure to get out any mats or tangles, which will get worse in the water. Be gentle and avoid pulling too hard; praise and pet your dog after you're done."

Use a nonslip surface.,
Place your dog in the tub.,
Shampoo your dog.,
Rinse your dog.,
Towel dry your dog.",How to Bathe a Clumsy Dog2," To make bath time safer and easier for your clumsy dog, you should use some kind of nonslip surface. This will ensure that your pup won’t slip and hurt itself in the slick bathtub or on the wet bathroom floor.Try using one of those nonslip bathmats that go inside of bathtubs. Or you could place a towel inside the bathtub and one on the floor just outside of the tub.

, Pick up your dog and gently place it in the tub. Make sure your dog is face down so that it can stand on its feet in a comfortable position during bath time.If you have a small enough dog, you can bathe it in the kitchen sink instead of the bathtub. Just make sure your pup fits safely in the sink.
You can also get in the shower with your dog to bathe it so you don’t have to worry about trying to stay dry during the process.

, Put some dog shampoo in your hand and begin lathering it all over your dog’s coat. Gently work the soap into the fur. Speak gently to your dog while you are doing this to reassure it during this time that it is probably uncomfortable.Make sure you use dog shampoo when giving your dog a bath because it will not dry out your dog’s skin and coat like people shampoo will.

, Use the shower head to gently rinse the shampoo out of your dog’s coat. Use your hand to help clean the hair. Make sure that the water pressure isn’t too forceful as this could make your dog uncomfortable.If the shower head is too startling for your dog, you can rinse it off using a cup. Fill the cup with water and pour it over your dog’s soapy coat. Use your hand to help get the suds out. Repeat this until all the shampoo is out of your dog’s coat.

, Take your dog out of the tub and use a towel to lightly dry the dog off so it isn’t just dripping wet. Don’t rub the dog too hard with the towel. Be just firm enough to help remove some of the excess water.Some people like to use blow dryers on their dog after a bath, but the noise and sensation can be startling to some dogs. So it is probably best to just towel dry your clumsy dog.

Take your dog to the groomer.,
Have your vet bathe your dog.,
Ask a friend to help you.",How to Bathe a Clumsy Dog3," If your dog is very clumsy and you don’t want to deal with bath time yourself, you can take your dog to the groomer and pay for them to bathe your dog. If you can afford it, this is a great way to minimize the hassle of bathing a clumsy dog while still ensuring that your dog gets bathed regularly.Of course, this might not be an option for everyone. Remember that you will have to pay the groomer to bathe your dog for you.

, You might consider having your dog professionally bathed at your veterinarian’s office if your dog is especially clumsy and difficult to handle. Again, this is an option you will be required to pay for, so you should consider your financial situation before you decide on this course of action.This option might be especially helpful for you if your dog is unreasonably hard to handle during bath time.

, Sometimes you just need an extra set of hands to help you while you bathe your clumsy dog. If you have a friend present, they can help steady your dog, help minimize the mess, and help your dog feel more secure during the entire process.


This should be a trusted friend that your dog is already comfortable around. Otherwise, your dog will be made more nervous by the stranger and it may act even more clumsily than usual.

Place your dog in the sink.,
Introduce your dog to the water.,
Lather up!,
Turn off the water and dry your dog.",How to Bathe a Small Dog and Keep Him Calm2," Slowly and gently place your dog in the sink. Continue holding them and speaking to them soothingly; be calm but assertive. To keep your dog happy, bring one of their favorite, water-resistant toys into the sink while you bathe them.To reduce your dog's anxiety about bath time, place them in the sink a few times beforehand, with treats and without adding any water, to make them feel comfortable there.Don't forget to put something on the bottom to keep your dog from slipping.

, Have the faucet running lightly and slowly introduce your dog to the warm water. Only let the water run onto your dog from the neck down. You can wipe their face with a washcloth to be sure that you keep water out of their eyes. Be gentle and reassuring., Gently apply a small amount of dog shampoo to your dog's coat, lathering softly; do not use too much shampoo, or scrub your dog. Wash from neck to paws; avoid washing the head to be sure to keep soapy water out of their eyes. To be extra-gentle, try diluting the shampoo with water before using it on your small dog.To help relax your small dog, purchase a dog shampoo with lavender extract in it., Shut off the faucet and wrap your small dog in a towel; don't let them get cold enough to start shivering. Pat the dog gently until their coat is semi-dry (i.e. not dripping). Using a blow dryer on a low setting is an option for drying your small dog's coat, but be mindful that the noise and intensity might scare them.If using a blow dryer, do not hold the nozzle too close to your dog's skin or you risk burning them. Also, do not use the blow dryer anywhere near water.

Give your dog a treat before the bath.,
Don't rush bath time.,
Reward your dog for getting their bath.",How to Bathe a Small Dog and Keep Him Calm3," Once you've placed your dog in the sink, give them a treat right away. The treat will both distract your dog and reward them for behaving. The best way for your dog to have positive associations with its bath time is if you feed them during the process., Take the time to make your dog's bath a more relaxed experience. Prioritize your enjoyment of the experience with your pet, and your dog's comfort, over getting your dog clean in a fast and efficient manner.A slow pace will also allow you to use a softer water pressure to wash and rinse your dog, which will be more soothing to them., Use positive reinforcement to make your small dog more comfortable with their bath time. After they are clean and dry, reward your dog with a treat, praise and lots of petting. Play with your dog while they dry off and give them lots of love and attention. "

Speak with your veterinarian.",How to Give a Stubborn Dog a Bath," If you want to give the dog a bath, you’ll need to get some dog-bathing supplies, as well as a few extras. You should get some canine shampoo, several towels, a nonslip bath mat (if you’re planning on bathing the dog in the bathtub), a leash to use in securing the dog, cotton balls to clean the dog’s ears, and treats to encourage the dog to behave.Don’t use human shampoo on the dog; instead, purchase specially formulated canine shampoo at your local pet store.;
, A stubborn dog who dislikes baths will be more likely to attempt an escape while you are bathing it. Because of this, you’ll need to take some extra precautions to keep the dog from getting away from you during bath time.If you’re bathing the dog in your bathroom, make sure the door is securely closed after you bring the dog in.
If you’re bathing the dog outdoors, try to do it in an enclosed area, like your garage or a fenced-in yard.
You could search online to see if there is a dog wash in your area. Some pet stores or dog grooming businesses offer facilities where you can easily bathe a dog in a dog-friendly setup for a small fee.
If none of these options are available to you, make sure you securely tie the dog to something so it can’t get away from you. You might want to use a leash that you can hold or a chain that you can stake to the ground.
While you are securing the dog, talk to it and make sure it is comfortable. Comfort the dog before its bath by brushing, petting, and soothing it for a few minutes. You should keep a leash on the dog so you can have control of it.
Consider having treats on hand to make the dog's experience more positive.

, Because a stubborn dog is more likely to put up a fight during bath time, it’s more likely that it will make a mess with all the soapy water that you'll be bathing it in. To avoid a massive cleanup afterward, try to stage the bathing area in such a way as to minimize the mess ahead of time.Put some towels down on the floor and around the bathing area to soak up any soap and water that the dog may shake off.
Use a nonslip surface in the bathtub so the dog doesn’t slip and send more water flying if it tries to get away.
Try to ask a second person to help you hold the dog while you’re bathing it. This way, the dog will move less and won’t shake as much water around.

, If the dog is stressed, it is more likely to yell, pull on its leash, and make abrupt movements. Move slowly and reassure the dog with petting, calm words, and treats., Keep a leash in one hand and a water hose in the other. Stand on one side of the dog and keep the hand that's holding the leash on the other side, so if the dog becomes hyper, you can pull it away from you and avoid getting bitten.


Try to keep a distance between yourself and the dog during the bathing process.

, Start at the dog’s back with some water. Slowly go down one side and then down the other. Switch the position of your body to whatever side you're bathing, but keep the hand with the leash on the opposite side.Be careful not to get water directly in the dog’s ears, eyes, or nose.
Always soak the dog in water before you begin using shampoo.

, After the dog is wet, apply some shampoo, starting at the back, and massage it in well. To clean the dog's back legs and rear, you can put the hand holding the leash on the dog’s lower stomach to raise its back.Throughout washing, soothe the dog by talking to it in a quiet, calm matter. Every so often, you should scratch and rub under the dog’s chin to let it know that it's fine and that it's still loved.

, Once you have finished soaping the dog up with shampoo, you’ll need to use water to rinse out all of the soap. While you’re spraying water all over it, you should rub its fur to help the soap come out.


During all of this, you shouldn't let go of the leash, but you can still rub the soap out while holding the leash.

, Be gentle and use a clean, dry towel to rub and pat the dog dry. Try to keep hold of the dog while you're drying it. You should take the same precautions and safety tips as you did with the bathing process to keep the stubborn dog from escaping or making a mess.Sometimes, a dog will shake back and forth to dry itself, but this can be a bit messy. If you don’t want the dog to shake, try to get a towel on it as soon as you are done bathing the dog.
A stubborn dog will probably dislike a hair dryer being blown on it, so it’s probably best to just let the dog dry itself after you towel it off.

, Remember that with a stubborn dog, it might not understand what is going on, so naturally, it will be scared and skittish. It may struggle against you in an attempt to free itself from the frightening situation. It is easy to become frustrated in these situations. If the dog keeps trying to jerk away from you or show some other sign of disobedience, remain calm, get the dog back in the position for bathing, and continue with the task at hand.


If the dog is extremely stressed or if you are becoming very frustrated, you may consider taking a short break. As long as the dog is safe, step back for a few moments and let the situation cool down before slowly resuming the bathing process.
Provide lots of love and affection to the dog after washing it. Even though it might not enjoy being bathed, giving it lots of attention will let it know that it wasn’t just receiving a punishment.

, A stubborn dog may be unhappy that you are forcing it to take a bath when it doesn’t want to. You should be cautious about this if you think that the dog could bite you or lunge at you in an attempt to escape.Stay away from the dog’s head whenever possible to minimize the possibility of it biting you.
You can also consider using a muzzle if you are afraid that the dog will bite you.

, Your vet can provide you with advice about how to approach bathing the particular dog breed. They may offer a mild anti-anxiety medication that can keep the dog relaxed throughout the bathing process. Additionally, they can recommend a local canine behaviorist or dog trainer that can help you desensitize the dog to bathing.

Keep your dog away from known tick habitats.,
Identify tick habitat in your yard.,
Check your dog for ticks every day, especially if it's been outside.,
Check your home for ticks.",How to Prevent Ticks on Dogs1,"


Ticks inhabit dense, wooded vegetative areas--patches of overgrown shrubs, meadows with thick brush, and places where the ground is covered with decaying leaves.
Ticks engage in a behavior called ""questing"": they climb low shrubs and grass until they're 18-24 inches off the ground, and they lurk in wait for animals--like your dog--to brush against their perch.Be especially wary if you're passing through an area with a profusion of low, thick underbrush.
Ticks have heat sensors that can detect the body heat emitted by a dog. The tick uses its legs to grab onto your dog's fur as the dog passes by. It worms its way through the fur like a covert operative, like a heat-seeking, blood-thirsty missile toward the skin. The tick begins to gorge itself on the dog's blood in order to fertilize its eggs.
Stay on the trails when hiking with your pet, and make sure that your pet remains with you. Avoid wooded areas and long grasses where ticks are common. If your dog runs off the trail (as they often do), make sure to check him for ticks when you get home.;
, If your dog spends a lot of time running about your yard, it may be at risk of encountering ticks.Ticks don't usually live out in the open--say, in the center of your lawn. Ticks congregate on the fringes: where yards border wooded areas; where there are ornamental plantings and thick gardens; and anywhere shady, where leaves are decaying with high humidity.
Rake up decaying leaves, trim overgrown brush, and keep your dog from sticking its nose into wooded areas. Keep your lawn trimmed low (below ankle height) so that it doesn't become a hospitable environment for ticks.
Secure your trash cans with strong lids; take out any rock piles and brushy cover. This helps keep away rodents that may carry ticks.

, Be thorough. Dogs tend to pick up many more ticks than humans do.


Groom your dog after a walk in the woods. Work through its fur with a fine-toothed comb to remove any ticks that are clinging to the hairs. Part the fur with your hands and inspect your dog's skin to make sure that no ticks have already taken root. Feel for irregular lumps.
Remember to check between your dog's toes, behind and in the ears, in the armpits and belly, and all around the tail and the head.
If you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away. Use tweezers or a tick scoop, and be gentle. If you're using tweezers: Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible by gripping its head. Steadily pull upward until the tick releases his grip. Do not twist or jerk the tick or you might break off the head or mouth parts; you do not want to leave the tick head embedded in your pet's skin. Do not squeeze to the point of crushing the tick, or you may may spread any diseases that the tick is carrying.
Ask your veterinarian to conduct a tick check at each exam.This is a great way to ensure that you haven't missed anything. Carefully watch the vet conduct the tick check so that you can improve your own technique.

, Dogs can carry ticks in that do not latch on immediately, but instead spread throughout a home. Keep your eyes peeled for small, eight-legged, spider- or mite-like creatures.


Be aware that ticks may take a while to work their way through the fur before they actually bite a dog. If your dog comes into the house before the tick has properly latched on, there's a chance that the tick will instead find its way onto you or one of your family members.Ticks love interior textures that are reminiscent of their outdoor environment: thick carpets or fabrics--anywhere that they can hide. If you think that you might have a tick infestation, consider thoroughly vacuuming your home. Be vigilant.
Consider spreading diatomaceous earth, baking soda, or borax into your carpet to kill fleas and ticks. Diatomaceous earth is toxic to ticks, but not to humans or dogs; however, you should be sparing with baking soda and borax treatments.

Make your dog an unappealing host for ticks.,
Use topical insecticides.,
Use a tick collar.,
Bathe your dog in flea-and-tick shampoo.,
Use a tick spray.",How to Prevent Ticks on Dogs2," It is safest to keep your dog away from wooded areas and tick habitats, but if you do decide to take him for a hike, you can make him less appetizing to these bloodthirsty bugs.


Try applying a topical insecticide directly to your dog's skin for long-term protection. This may be the easiest solution. A one-time dose will protect your dog from fleas for anywhere from 30 to 90 days.
Try fitting your dog with a tick collar. Tick collars need to be changed every 3 to 4 months, but they are relatively non-intrusive and they will kill ticks. Many tick collars contain a dog-safe pesticide--an acaricide--that kills ticks without poisoning your dog. Some acaricides kill ticks on contact; others are absorbed into your dog's bloodstream, over time, and kill ticks that attach and feed.
Try using tick sprays. Tick-repellent sprays are typically designed for a one-time use, and they tend to wear off more quickly than the other options. Tick sprays are often made from natural ingredients, whereas many other tick repellents are based on pesticides and insecticides.
Be careful not to mix medications. Ask your veterinarian before starting your dog on a new anti-tick product, particularly if it's a pesticide.

, Apply these treatments to a small area on the back of the dog, between its shoulders; they may be the easiest product to use, and they typically last the longest.


These medications must be reapplied once a month, typically, although some products may last as long as 90 days. Avoid touching your dog's back for a few hours after you've applied the product to give it time to sink into the skin.
Some products kill fleas and ticks, and others just fleas, so check the label carefully. Active ingredients may include permethrin, pyrethrin, or fipronil. Do not use a product containing permethrin on cats: it can be deadly.
Visit a pet supply store or a veterinarian and explore the range of products available to you.

, These can be used instead of--or in conjunction with--topical flea medications, and they fit alongside most regular dog collars.


Check the package to see how long the collar will protect your dog. Many collars must be changed every 3 to 4 months for optimal protection.
Be aware that many collars lose their effectiveness when they get wet. If your dog spends a lot of time in the water, then this may not be the solution for you.
To get the right degree of snugness, you should just be able to get two fingers between the collar and the neck of your dog. Be sure to cut off any excess collar to prevent your dog from chewing on it.

, These products are primarily designed to rid your dog of the ticks that he already has on him, although some shampoos have a lingering anti-tick effect.


You can find medicated shampoos in your local grocery or pet store.
To properly use a flea and tick shampoo, you must be sure to work the shampoo in over your dog's entire body, and then leave it on for at least 10 minutes before you rinse it off. This is true of almost any medicated shampoo.
Remember to protect your dog's eyes and ears.
Consider placing a white towel beneath your dog while you bathe it. Ticks may fall off of your dog and onto the towel, making them easier to spot and kill., This may be a good solution if you don't normally have a problem with ticks, but you are taking your dog to an area that you know is heavily infested.


Tick sprays are usually designed for temporary, immediate use, but you can apply them as needed. Follow your veterinarian's and the manufacturer's directions on how often to spray, and spray in a well-ventilated area. Sprays often contain permethrin or pyrethrin.
Many tick sprays are made from natural ingredients. This is a good alternative if you worry about your dog being exposed to pesticides. Most other tick preventatives are based on insecticides or pesticides.
Flea and tick control sprays can come as aerosols or pump bottles. When using a spray, you do not have to soak your dog with the spray, but be sure to spray every inch of its body. Spray a small amount on a cotton ball to apply the product around the eyes and ears. Do not get any of these products in the eyes."

Take your dog to your local veterinarian.",How to Tell if Your Dog Has Fleas," When fleas feed on your dog’s blood, your dog will itch, scratch, lick, or chew at flea bites due to experiencing irritation or an allergic reaction to flea saliva. Your dog may also shake its head or scratch its ears. Keep an eye on your dog more often than usual to watch for signs of itching and scratching.;
, These signs are indicative of flea bites, and are most commonly found on your dog’s stomach, groin, armpits, under the hind legs, and at the base of the tail. Gently roll your dog over on his or her back, and perform a full examination of the skin to locate flea bites.

, Excessive itching and scratching can lead to hair loss, dryness, and scabbing on your pet’s skin. If you are unable to keep an eye on your dog’s behavior due to spending time away from home, check for signs of hair loss and dry skin, which often suggest your dog is suffering from flea bites.

, Adult fleas are between one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch (0.15 to 0.31 cm) in size, have flat bodies, and are brown or black in color. Fleas that have consumed a high amount of blood may be lighter in color. Have your dog lie on its side, and gently check between your dog’s hairs all over its body to look for visible signs of fleas., A flea comb is a metal, fine-toothed comb that can help detect and catch both fleas and flea dirt. Run the flea comb along your dog’s back and belly using enough pressure to put the comb in direct contact with your dog’s skin, then submerge the comb into a bowl of warm, soapy water to drown the fleas and catch flea dirt. This will help prevent any fleas you find from jumping back onto your dog.

, This method is known as the white towel test, and can help you visibly spot fleas or flea dirt as you brush or comb your dog. Flea dirt often resembles small grains of sand, and turns red in color when exposed to water on on behalf of blood being ingested and excreted by fleas., Fleas will thrive in all the same environments in which your dog spends most of its time. Examine your dog’s favorite hang-out spots, feeding areas, and bedding for signs of fleas or flea dirt. You can also try wearing white socks around the house and inspect them afterwards for signs of fleas or flea dirt.

, Flea traps, also known as light traps, can help detect and catch any existing fleas in your household.


Fill a small bowl with liquid dishwashing soap and water and place it on the floor near your dog’s bedding or feeding area before going to bed.
Place a nightlight or flashlight on the floor next to the bowl of water, and allow it to sit overnight. Fleas will be attracted to the light, and may likely jump into the bowl of water to get closer to the light.
Examine the bowl of water the following morning to check for fleas. If there are several fleas floating in the water, your dog and home may be infested with fleas.

, If there are numerous brown or black spots in the water, it’s possible your dog has fleas., Your dog’s vet will perform an examination to check for signs of fleas, and recommend the proper course of treatment to rid your dog of fleas. Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-flea medicines for your dog, suggest that you buy flea shampoo, or recommend that your dog wear a flea collar to deter fleas.

Put together a “flea-be-gone” bag.",How to Keep Fleas Off Dogs1," Topical flea treatments, such as Advantage, Frontline Plus, and Revolution, can be applied to your dog on a regular basis each year to help prevent fleas from making a home on your dog’s body. This topical treatment is usually a cream or thick liquid that you drop onto a spot on your dog’s back, between his shoulder blades.Check with your veterinarian as to which flea treatment you should use for your dog and what dosage to give. Boxes of these topical flea treatments usually come in different amounts based on the size of your dog.
The reason why the topical treatment is applied to the spot between your dog’s back is so he cannot reach it once it’s applied. It takes a little time to soak in and start working, so you do not want your dog washing it off too soon.
Some topical flea treatments include something called “permethrins.” While this is safe to use on dogs, it is toxic to cats. Do not use this product on your cats.
Alternatively, you can use a few drop of lavender essential oil on your dog to help prevent and repel fleas.;
, Flea collars are another method to help prevent fleas from taking up residence on your dog. Flea collars, however, need to be applied properly in order to work effectively. Once on your dog, you should be able to get two fingers in-between the collar and your dog’s neck. The collar should not be any tighter or looser than that. Most flea collars are longer than you’ll need, so cut off the excess portion of the collar once you’ve fit it on your dog.If you aren’t sure which flea collar to use, ask your veterinarian or vet tech for a recommendation.
Make sure to read the collar’s instructions. Some collars become less effective if they get wet. This means you may want to take the collar off or replace it if you dog goes for a swim.
If the collar starts to irritate your dog’s neck, take it off. You may need to try another type of collar instead.
Never use flea collars with any of these ingredients on cats — Amitraz, permethrin, organophosphates.

, In addition to store bought flea collars, you can make your own using natural ingredients. All you need is: a bandana or your dog’s regular collar; 1 to 3 tablespoons of water; and 3 to 5 drops of either cedar or lavender essential oil. Mix the water and essential oil together to dilute the oil. Use an eyedropper (or something else that works in a similar way) and put 5 to 10 drops of the mixture on your dog’s collar or a bandana. Rub the fabric together so the mixture covers all the fabric. Put the bandana or collar on your dog.You will likely have to reapply the mixture once a week to keep it effective.
You can also put a mixture of 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil and 1 to 2 drops of this mixture near the base of your dog’s tail. This way the fleas are being prevented at both ends!

, There are currently several oral flea preventative treatment products on the market for dogs and cats. One such treatment is called Program. For dogs, you can get the product in pill form that you give to your dog once a month. The pill contains an insect development inhibitor that doesn’t allow fleas to form on your dog, but it won’t kill adult fleas already on your dog. Other products are also available, such as Capstar, Comfortis, and Trifexis.Capstar only stays in your dog’s system for 24 hours, so it better for situations where you need a quick solution.
Trifexis also helps prevent heart worm and can help if your dog has a hookworm, roundworm, or whipworm infection.

, You can add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar (or distilled white vinegar) to your dog’s water bowl. One tablespoon should be used for every 40 pounds (18 kg) your dog weighs. For example, if your dog weights 80 (36 kg) pounds, then add 2 tablespoons (30 ml). If you dog weighs 20 pounds (9 kg)), then add only ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of vinegar.Note that apple cider vinegar is also good for your dog’s skin and coat.

, There are several supplements that can be added to your dog’s diet that may help prevent and repel fleas. Not all supplements work on all dogs, so if you’ve tried a supplement for one month and nothing has changed, it probably isn’t going to work.Garlic — Giving your dog garlic, either in raw (crushed) form or via a capsule, can help prevent fleas. Large dogs can get 1 glove of garlic, medium dogs can get ½ clove, and small dogs can get ¼ clove. The dosage of the garlic oil capsule can be estimated based on the assumption that a human dose is for a 150 pound (68 kg) human.
Vitamin B Complex — A plant-source of vitamin B complex can be given to your dog on a regular basis. The amount to give your dog can be adjusted based on your dog’s size and the average human dose. You can also consider giving your dog brewers yeast as it contains B1.
Note that some dogs are allergic to brewers yeast. Check with your veterinarian before giving your dog brewers yeast.

, To make this preventative flea comb, all you need is 1 fresh lemon cut into slices, 1 pot of fresh water, and a comb, brush or sponge. Put the lemon slices and the water into a saucepan and bring the water to a boil. Once boiled, take the saucepan off the heat and cover the pot. Allow the pot to sit overnight with the lemons in the water. The following day, use a brush, comb, or sponge to dip in the water and then apply to your dog’s fur.Whether you want to use a brush, comb, or sponge may depend on the type and length of your dog’s fur or hair. Use whatever option works best for you.

, The nice thing about this spray is that it not only repels fleas, it makes your dog’s coat look great! All you need is: 1 cup (250 ml) of distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar; 1 quart (approx. 1 litre) of fresh water; 2 to 3 drops of cedar or lavender essential oil; and an empty spray bottle. Combine the three liquids together in the spray bottle (e.g. vinegar, essential oil, and water). Shake the spray bottle to mix everything together, then spray the mixture on your dog.The type of vinegar used in this mixture is not important. You can use either white vinegar or apple cider vinegar, although apple cider vinegar does tend to smell more pleasant. You can also use a combination of the two types of vinegar if you do not have enough of each — as long as the final measurement is 1 cup or 250 ml.
The essential oil isn’t a requirement of this spray, but does make it smell nicer.
Make sure you don’t spray the mixture in your dog’s eyes, nose, or ears. It’s better if you avoid spraying your dog’s face at all and just use a cloth or sponge to apply the mixture to his face.
You can also spray the mixture on your dog’s bedding to help prevent fleas.

, To create this bag, you’ll need: two 6 inch (15 cm) squares of breathable fabric; a handful of cedar chips; 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of dried lavender buds; and 1 lemon peel. Sew the two 6 inch (15 cm) squares of fabric together on three side to form a bag. Fill the bag with the cedar chips, lavender buds, and lemon peel. Tie the top of the bag with a ribbon or piece of string. Place the bag near your dog’s bed or other places your dog frequents. Replace the mixture inside every one to two months.If you want to try this option, but aren’t much of a sewer, you can also look for a pre-made bag of breathable fabric.

Consider keeping your dog pesticide-free.,
Consider making your own anti-tick powder.,
Make a homemade herbal tick ""collar"".,
Make natural tick shampoo.,
Make a natural flea and tick remedy with apple cider vinegar.Apple cider vinegar may may your dog's blood slightly more acidic, making it less appealing to ticks and fleas.",How to Prevent Ticks on Dogs3," The use of pesticides to treat pets--particularly permethrin, which is toxic to cats and has been known to kill indiscriminately--is somewhat controversial.


Read the ingredients listed on any commercial anti-tick product, and do your research to make sure that they're safe for your dog.
Ask your veterinarian before using any pesticide on your dog.

, If you want to avoid the toxins and pesticides found in most tick repellents, you can use ingredients from your home and garden to protect your dog from tick attacks.


Mix equal quantities of diatomaceous earth (natural diatomaceous earth, made from tiny fossilized water plants--not pool-grade diatomaceous earth); Neem powder (Indian tree containing the pesticide oneliminoid, the powder which can be found in health stores); and yarrow (a skin-soothing herb and natural tick repellent that grows wild across the northern hemisphere).Pour the mixture into a shaker jar. Ruffle your dog's hair to expose the skin, and methodically apply small amounts of the powder from the back of your dog to the front of your dog. Be sure to cover the neck area.
For a medium-sized dog, you should need about a teaspoon's worth of the dust. Apply it to your dog each month, and it may keep away ticks.

,


Mix two tablespoons of almond oil with Rose Geranium Oil or Palo Santo, and dab a few drops on your dog's neck before you head out into the woods. You can also place the oil directly onto the dog's collar. Re-apply weekly.
To make a citrus repellent: Cut a lemon into quarters and put it into a pint jar. Cover it with boiling water and let it steep overnight. Put the solution in a spray bottle and spray all over the dog, especially behind the ears, around the head, at the base of the tail and in the arm pits.

,


Mix several drops of Palo Santo into your favorite organic lavender shampoo.
Lather into your dog's fur, and let the suds sit on your dog for twenty minutes before rinsing. This may work to kill any existing ticks and prevent new ones from latching on.

, Add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to your dog's food or water dish as a preventative measure.Consider spraying your dog with apple cider vinegar instead of pesticidal tick repellent. Fill a spray bottle with the cider vinegar and lightly coat every inch of your dog before you venture into a tick-infested area.
Bear in mind that this is a home remedy, and it may not be as immediately effective as pesticide treatments. However, apple cider vinegar is not as potentially threatening to your dog's health.

Ensure your dog is healthy.,
Use an olive oil and essential oil spray on your dog.,
Give your dog a bath at least once a week.,
Comb your dog every day with a flea comb.,
Do not allow your dog to wander the house.",How to Keep Fleas Off Dogs2," Like any medical issue, the best place to start is to make sure your dog is strong and healthy. This means you need to ensure your dog is eating the right amount of good food, getting the right amount of exercise, having the least amount of stress, and getting lots and lots of love.Fleas seems to know which dogs are sick and which are healthy, and prefer the sick dogs (they taste better). Keeping your dog healthy will give your dog a better chance of not getting fleas or being able to fight them off.

, A mixture of 10 drops of certain essential oils in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil can be used as a spray to help repel fleas from your dog. As with other treatments, this may not work for all dogs. If you don’t notice any changes in your dog after three to four weeks of treatment, it’s not likely working.The following essential oils can be used: cedar, tea tree, citronella, lavender, eucalyptus, and pennyroyal.
Note that both eucalyptus and pennyroyal are both toxic to cats. If you have cats in your home, use one of the other options.

, If your dog is already infested with fleas, and you’re working to remove them, give him a bath at least once every week. For washing, use either a non-insecticidal shampoo or soap, or use an unscented hypoallergenic shampoo. Shampoos and soaps with fewer additives will help prevent your dog’s skin from drying out due to the frequent baths. And make sure to completely rinse off any shampoo or soap residue from your dog.If you aren’t sure which shampoo or soap to use, consult with your veterinarian or vet tech for a recommendation. They may even sell some shampoos at the vet clinic.

, Use a flea comb on your dog as often as possible to check how effective your flea removal efforts have been. Focus on combing around your dog’s tail, stomach, and face. Don’t just look for adult fleas, but also look for eggs (which are tiny white dots) and feces (which are tiny black dots).If you find anything on your dog, you can comb it off and drop it in a glass of water. The water will kill the fleas and the eggs.
Note — Flea feces is composed mostly of your dog’s blood. When you drop this into water, it may turn the water a dark brown or even red colour. Do not be alarmed. This is actually a good way to confirm what you found was really flea feces.

, If your dog is infested with fleas, you will want to limit the areas of the house he is allowed to go. Flea eggs can very easily make their way onto fabrics and into carpets and become dormant until the perfect environment (i.e. your dog) comes along in the future. If possible, keep your dog in areas of your house with the least amount of fabrics and fibres (e.g. kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, mud room, etc.) until the flea problem is resolved."

Keep your yard clean.,
Sprinkle a water-diatomaceous earth mixture in your yard.,
Use a garden hose to flood areas your dog frequents.,
Wash and vacuum your floors often.,
Give your dog’s bedding a good cleaning at least once a week.,
Hire a professional steam cleaner.",How to Keep Fleas Off Dogs3," Fleas and their eggs can easily hide in the grass and in areas of your yard where debris (e.g. leaves, etc.) has built up. To prevent fleas from being able to make a long-term home in these areas, keep your yard clean and your grass cut short. This is especially important in the areas of your yard where you dog hangs out the most., Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a calcium dust that’s ground from single-cell ocean organisms. Only use DE that’s been certified as “food grade.” You can mix some DE in water (in a watering can if you have one) and sprinkle the mixture on your grass, sidewalks, decks, paving stones, and even in your flower beds. Focus on areas of your yard where your dog hangs out the most.This mixture dries out flea eggs and makes it impossible for adult fleas to breathe, therefore killing them off.
If you live in a moist and humid climate, you may need to apply this mixture every two months.
If you live in a dry climate, you won’t need to apply as often, maybe once every three to four months.
Make sure to wear a protective mask when handling the DE dust as it can irritate your lungs.
You can buy DE online at shops like Amazon or at hardware/garden stores. Pest control companies may also sell it, as it’s used extensively to kill other types of pests as well.

, Water drowns fleas and flea eggs. You can use a garden hose to drown fleas and their eggs in your yard in areas where your dog frequents (e.g. kennel, dog run, favourite nap area, etc.). Just spray water in the area until it’s practically flooded., In order to kill fleas and their eggs inside your house, you need to keep up a regular cleaning routine around your house. Start by washing hard floors (e.g. wood, tile, etc.) as often as you can. Pay special attention to the cracks and gaps in the floors where fleas can hide. You should also vacuum your rugs and carpets every day to remove any fleas or eggs that may fall off you or your dog.To help keep fleas at bay, and to prevent you from needing to do too much work, it may be easier to simply remove and store away your area carpets or rugs during flea season. Give them a good cleaning before you store them and when you take them back out again.
When doing your daily vacuuming routine on carpets and rugs, you may also want to run the vacuum over any furniture in the same rooms (e.g. couches, ottomans, pillows, etc.).
If you use a vacuum with a bag, you can freeze the bag in-between uses to kill the fleas you vacuum up. Note that the fleas will stay alive inside the bag between vacuuming if you simply store the vacuum between uses.

, If small enough, wash your dog’s bedding in your washing machine every week with hot water and mild laundry detergent. If the bedding is too big for the washing machine, you can always soak it in a tub of water mixed with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. Worst case scenario, if your dog’s bedding is too big for either washing method, make sure to vacuum it thoroughly., If the flea infestation is really bad, or if it’s over but you want to make sure you got every last flea, consider hiring a steam cleaning company to come to your home. Ask them to use just hot water to steam clean your floors, furniture, and your dog’s bedding. Make sure you move furniture in order to steam clean underneath too."

Apply spot-on products.,
Use tick spray.,
Put a tick collar on your dog.,
Wash your dog with flea and tick shampoo.,
Apply tick powder.,
Check your dog’s coat for small bumps or lumps.,
Remove any ticks with a tick hook or a tick twister.,
Dispose of the ticks properly.,
Trim your lawn, bushes, and trees.,
Keep your dog indoors, especially during high tick season.,
Avoid exposing yourself to ticks.",How to Treat Canine Tick Problems," You can apply spot-on tick products directly to your pet’s skin. Part their fur and dot on the spot-on product in small amounts. Most spot-on products will need to be applied once a month.Look for spot-on products that contain pyrethrin, permethrin, fipronil, or imidacloprid. Make sure the product is licensed to work against ticks. Some products only work against one type of tick species or only have anti-parasite treatments that do not work only for ticks. Read the label on the packaging to ensure the product will work against ticks.;
, You can also apply tick spray, which usually come in an aerosol or pump action spray. Tick sprays usually contain permethrin or fipronil to kill the ticks.Make sure you spray all parts of your pet, including between their toes, and in their armpits and their groin area. Be careful when you apply the tick spray to their face, as you do not want to get spray in their eyes or allow your pet to inhale any of the spray. Put tick spray on a cotton ball and dab it on their face.
Your dog may not like tick spray due to the hissing sound from the aerosol can or the wet feeling on their coat from the spray. You may need to try a spot-on product instead if your dog shows an aversion to the spray.

, Tick collars can be put on your dog and do not require you to apply any sprays or other products. However, the active ingredient in tick collars tends to be located mostly over the head and neck, leaving your dog’s back area vulnerable to ticks.Make sure the collar fits snuggly around your dog’s neck so it works properly. Sometimes, tick collars can cause skin irritation. If this happens to your dog, consider using a different approach to remove the ticks.
Look for tick collars that contain active ingredients like amitraz or flumethrin. Collars that contain amitraz last about one month. Collars that contain flumethrin are effective for about eight months. Seresto collars are a good choice. They effectively distribute the active ingredient over your dog's body.

, You can also wash your dog with flea and tick shampoo to remove ticks that are attached to their coat. You will need to wash your dog’s entire body with the shampoo for it to work properly and leave it on for at least 10 minutes before you rinse it off.Make sure you protect your pet’s eyes and ears when you apply the shampoo, as the shampoo can irritate these areas. Most flea and tick shampoos contain pyrethrin.

, You can also put tick powder on your dog to kill and repel ticks. Check the label on the product to make sure it is made to kill ticks and fleas. You should apply the powder in a well ventilated area, as the powder can be irritating to the mouth or lungs if it is inhaled by you or your dog.You should only apply small amounts of the powder, rubbing it into your dog’s skin. Keep the powder away from your dog’s face and eyes.
You will need to apply the powder once a week to kill and repel ticks. You may also be able to apply the powder to the area where your dog sleeps and other areas of your house frequented by your dog.

, No tick spray, powder, or spot-on treatment will be 100 percent effective, so you should get into the habit of checking your pet daily for ticks. Do this by using your hands to smooth over your dog’s coat, checking for any small lumps or bumps. These lumps or bumps could be a tick. Make sure you smooth over areas prone to ticks, such as your dog’s muzzle, face, ears, paws, armpits, groin, and between their toes.You may also need to wet your dog’s coat so you can part their fur and confirm a small lump is a tick. You may also groom a long haired dog so you can better see their skin, making it easier to smooth them down for ticks.

, If you do find a tick in your dog’s coat, you should use a tick hook or a tick twister to remove the tick right away. You may also apply an acaricide to the tick so their grip on your dog’s skin is weaker and it is easier to remove them.Make sure you remove the tick by grasping the tick close to the surface of your dog’s skin. Then, pull upward until the tick releases from their skin. Do not twist or jerk the tick, as this can cause the mouth-parts of the tick to break off and stay attached to your dog’s skin.
If the mouth-parts break off, try to remove them with the tick hook or a pair of sterilized tweezers. If you cannot remove the mouth-parts, leave them alone and let the skin heal on its own.
Once you have removed the tick, clean the bite area with rubbing alcohol, or soap and water. Make sure you also wash your hands well with soap and water.
Do not try to remove the tick by coating it in vaseline or by burning it with a match. These approaches will only distress the tick, making it more likely to release its stomach contents into your dog’s bloodstream. This could then lead to an infection in your pet.

, You should dispose of the tick properly so it does not spread disease or infection to you or your pet. Submerse the ticks in alcohol and then place them in a bag or container. Wrap the container or bag with tape and put it in the garbage or flush it down the toilet.Do not crush the tick with your fingers, as this will only increase the risk of infection for you and your pet.

, Make sure you keep your lawn or yard tidy and clean, as ticks will thrive in dense shrubbery and foliage. Sweep up fallen leaves and trim back any large, unruly plants.Ticks are also common in woodland areas. But you cannot spray woodland areas or grasslands with insecticides. Instead, you should do daily tick checks and use tick products if your dog tends to run around in these areas.

, Spring and late fall are peak seasons for tick. Try to keep your dog indoors during these times so they have less exposure to ticks and a lower risk of getting ticks.If you keep your dog indoors in a kennel, make sure the kennel is pressure washed and cleaned regularly. If there are any feces in the kennel, remove them right away. You can also use a fogger to destroy flea and tick infestations in the kennel.

, You should also take care not to bring ticks in your home, where they can latch on to your dog, when you go walking or hiking outdoors. This will ensure you and your pet are at a lower risk for getting ticks.If you are going hiking or walking during tick season in woodland or grassland areas, you should wear a hat, a long-sleeved shirt, and long pants. Wear light-colored clothing, as this will make it easier to spot a tick. You should also tucks your pant legs into your socks or your boots and tuck your shirt or blouse into your pants.
Stick to the center of trails so you do not come in contact with grass or bushes. You can also spray insect repellent that contains DEET on your clothes and your exposed skin when you go for a hike or a walk.
Make sure you remove your clothing when you come indoors and wash and dry it at a high temperature. You should also do a check for ticks on your body to ensure you are not carrying any with you inside.

Figure out if your dog is at risk for tapeworm.,
Look for tapeworm eggs.,
Pay attention if your dog is dragging its bottom along the ground.,
Take your dog to the vet if you suspect tapeworm.,
Give your dog a deworming medicine.,
Be aware that not all deworming products contain praziquantel.,
Give your dog the proper dosage of medication.,
Follow your veterinarian's directions for how long and how often to give tapeworm medication.,
Prevent future tapeworm infection.A large part of preventing infection is removing access to the intermediate hosts.",How to Treat Tapeworm in Dogs," Some dogs are more at risk than others of picking up tapeworms. To become infected the dog needs contact with an ""intermediate"" host. These intermediate hosts are fleas and vermin, such as mice and rats.


If your dog has fleas, there is a good chance it could acquire a tapeworm infection. If it grooms itself and swallows a flea its digestive juices will break down the protective shell of the egg packet and release the eggs into the bowel, where they grow into an adult tapeworms.
Likewise if the dog is a hunter or scavenger and eats mice or rats, he will ingest tapeworm larvae that have formed cysts within the vermin's body tissue, and when the dog eats the encysted larvae they can go on to become adult tapeworms.
A dog cannot become infected by contact with the egg packets passed from his own anus, because the egg packets need to pass through the intermediate host to reach the stage where they are infectious to dogs.;
, The most obvious sign your dog has tapeworm is if you see the tapeworm eggs packet near the dog's anus or on its bedding. These egg packets can be white, creamy, golden, or gray colored, and vary in size between a cucumber seed and a sesame seed.


They are variously described as looking like a small grain of rice or sesame seeds. If the eggs are newly passed, if you look closely you may see them wriggling. If the eggs are older they dry out and then look more like sesame seeds.
The life cycle of the tapeworm means the adult worm within the dog's gut, releases these egg packets (also called proglottids) intermittently. These then migrate down through the gut and out of the dog's anus, ready to contaminate the environment and be a source of infection for the intermediate hosts (fleas or vermin).

, This migration irritates the lining of the rectum and anus, making it itchy and causing some dogs to scoot their bottoms along the ground. However, be aware that scooting can have other reasons beside tapeworm infection, such as full anal sacs or allergic skin conditions.

, Your vet can check for tapeworm infection by examining a fecal sample under a microscope to look for tapeworm eggs. However, it is possible to get false negatives because the adult tapeworm does not shed proglottids (the packet contained eggs) all the time but does so intermittently.

, Tapeworms are destroyed by specific deworming preparations containing the active ingredient praziquantel. This drug works by making the outer membrane of the tapeworm leaky, which allows nutrients to leak out and the tapeworm to die.A new drug is now available, Epsiprantel, which has a similar activity to praziquantel, but is not yet in widespread use.
Praziquantel is effective against all species of tapeworm, which makes it your first choice dewormer. However, a different drug called dichlorophen has limited action and will destroy 2 of the 3 main tapeworm species. Unfortunately the species it doesn't kill is Echinococcus, which under exceptional circumstances can be a risk to human health and is therefore not such a good choice.

, Always check the packaging to see if they are covered. Look for specific wording on the pack that says the product is effective against tapeworms and check that praziquantel is among the active ingredients. For example, a product such as Panacur contains fenbendazole only, which is not effective against tapeworm.The drawback of praziquantel is that it is not effective against roundworms and other common worms, therefore many deworming tablets are made up of two deworming ingredients.For example, Drontal contains praziquantel and pyrantel, Milbemax contains praziquantel and milbemycin, and Prazitel Plus contains pyrantel, praziquantel, and febantel.
Also be aware that many common spot-on parasite treatments that are highly effective against other species, do NOT work against tapeworm.

, Tapeworm treatments are most widely available in tablet form. Accurately weigh your dog, if necessary visit a veterinary clinic and weigh the dog on the scale there. Then carefully follow the dosage instruction on the packaging to make sure the dog has the correct dose.


Be aware that the medication kills any infection the dog currently has, but the treatment has no lasting effect and therefore does not protect the dog against repeat infection.
There is also an injectable form of praziquantel, Droncit.This injection can sting and if you have a large dog it will need a relatively large volume of injection, which can be uncomfortable.

, How often to give your dog a tapeworm treatment is controversial and usually judged on an individual basis. If your dog is in a high risk group, such as a hunting dog or a dog that has regular flea infestations, then monthly tapeworming is advisable. If your dog is at low risk such as an indoor dog that has regular flea treatments then speak to your vet and follow their advice.

, This is done through regular monthly treatments with an effective flea product to ensure your dog does not harbor the intermediate host.


Also, prevent access to vermin or carcasses so that the dog cannot scavenge and eat the encysted larval forms.

Find ways to show your dog how to associate bath time with happy memories.


Expose your dog to water during times other than bath time. Take your dog to the beach or a dog park near a body of water. Allow him to enter the water at his own pace. If your dog has positive associations with water, he might be less nervous about bath time.Allow your dog to spend time in the bathroom, near the tub, on a regular basis. Bring some of his toys into the bathroom and let him play in the tub when it's empty. This will help build positive associations regarding the bath tub.;
, When you start bath time, try using treats and toys to help your dog enjoy herself. This can make bath time less stressful for both of you.


Give your treats dog before, during, and after a bath. This way, she might be excited about the prospect of bath time as it means she'll get tasty food. You want your dog to see bath time as a reward rather than a punishment.Bring your dog's favorite toys into the tub as long as they are waterproof. Allowing your dog to play with her toys during bath time can make the event more fun for both you and your dog., Many people struggle to have fun because they get caught up on momentary hassles. Keep perspective and focus on the positives in the situation. A positive attitude can help you have fun despite troubling circumstances and if you're in a good mood your dog will feel happier and safer.Take your dog for a long walk before his bath. This can be calming and relaxing for both you and your dog. This way, you'll both go into the bath in a positive mood.Try to keep calm and avoid feelings of frustration when bathing your dog. If you're in a negative mood, your dog will pick up on this. Try to go into the situation in good humor. This will help you stay calm, which will keep your dog calm as well.

, The first thing you need to do is choose the right shampoo. There are many different flea shampoos on the market. Make sure you select a brand that works for you and your dog.


Aim for a shampoo that acts on both live fleas and flea eggs. This way, you'll fight both the existing infestation and prevent a reoccurrence.A common ingredient in flea shampoo is pyrethrins, a powerful insecticide. This product is usually safe for medium-sized or small dogs but may not be safe for a small dog or a puppy. Ask your vet if you're unsure if pyrethrins is safe for your dog.If you're unsure what product to buy, call your vet. He or she should be able to give you an informed recommendation based on your dog's health, size, and medical history., Anytime you give your dog a flea bath, especially if you're using a shampoo with pyrethrins, you should find a well-ventilated area. If possible, give your dog a flea bath in a pool outside. If not, keep windows and doors open during the bath., You do not want any shampoo to get in your dog's eyes or ears. This can cause irritation. Place cotton balls in your dog's ears before the bath. Consider covering your dog's eyes with a rag or bandana. However, some dogs may become nervous and tear off a blindfold. If your dog does this, be very, very careful when washing around the dog's face. In the event shampoo gets in your dog's eyes, flush the eyes thoroughly and then call your vet., Once you've found the right area, you can begin bathing your dog. Fill a bath with lukewarm water and place your dog inside.


Get your dog wet first. You can use a hose or a bucket to dampen your dog's coat.Follow all instructions when applying the flea shampoo. If you need protective gloves, wear them. Do not apply any more shampoo than recommended on the bottle.Lather your dog thoroughly. Pay attention to hard to reach areas, such as the stomach, paws, and legs. Be very careful when washing around your dog's head to avoid getting soap in her ears or eyes., Once your dog is lathered thoroughly, rinse him off. Make sure you get all the shampoo out as excess shampoo can cause irritation. You may have to rinse your dog off several times. Lightly squeeze your dog's fur and see if any suds are present to check if he is completely rinsed off., Once your dog is rinsed, drain the water. Allow her to shake off in the tub and then rub her down with an old towel. If you have a longhaired dog, you might want to try using a hair dryer. Just make sure it's turned to a lower heat setting to avoid burning the dog's skin., Be aware that the majority of flea collars don't work. The only effective flea collar is the Seresto collar, which is a prescription product available from your vet. If you prefer a collar, then talk to your vet.


You can buy a flea collar from your vet. You can also find one at a pet store or buy one online.A flea collar should be snug without causing discomfort. You should be able to comfortably fit two fingers under the collar. Always cut off any excess portion of the collar so your dog does not chew on the end.Flea collars lose effectiveness with time. Check the label of your flea collar to see when it should be replaced., Certain medications can prevent your dog from being getting fleas. They also may help treat existing flea infections. Products like Capstar and Frontline Plus are effective flea treatments. Ask your vet for a prescription., If your dog had fleas, you'll need to take efforts to rid your home of fleas. Fleas can leave your dog and get into the carpet and furniture.

Clean up the poop.",How to Treat Worms in Dogs," Roundworms, tapeworms, whipworms and hookworms are found in the intestinal tract of dogs and are shed in the feces of infected animals. These worms share several common symptoms that can be identified in some cases.Some intestinal parasites are transmitted from one dog to the next by what is called “fecal-oral transmission.” The worm eggs are deposited by an infected dog through the feces and enter the dog’s intestinal tract by mouth. Even though you cannot see the eggs or even the feces anymore, there can be eggs in the grass waiting for your dog to walk through. Your dog will lick their paws and ingest the eggs which begin the intestinal infection.Tapeworms specifically are transmitted by dogs accidentally ingesting fleas.While you may not be able to determine which type of intestinal worms your dog has, keeping an eye out for these symptoms can help you determine if your dog may need treatment for intestinal worms.;
, Intestinal worms can often be detected by observing changes in a dog's normal feces. Be on the lookout for any of these issues:


Roundworms and whipworms can both cause diarrhea. If your dog suffers from this condition often or for an extended period of time, this merits a trip to the vet.Hookworms and whipworms can both cause blood to appear in a dogs stool. If you notice blood in your dog's feces, contact your vet immediately.Tapeworm segments can often be seen in the dogs feces or clinging to the hair around its anus. If you notice something that looks like grains of white rice in the dog's excrement, this is most likely a sign of tapeworm., A dog with intestinal parasites may vomit frequently. In particular, this can be a sign of roundworms or tapeworms., In some cases, a dog with worms may develop a cough. More specifically, this may be a symptom of roundworms.A cough can be a sign of several different health conditions, so if your dog develops a cough, it is wise to contact a veterinarian promptly.

, If your dog suddenly becomes swollen around the mid-section, or loses weight rapidly, either of these may be a sign of intestinal worms.A swollen belly may be a sign of roundworms, whereas weight loss could suggest roundworms, tapeworms, or whipworms.

, Some intestinal worms can be detected by their impact on sheen of your dog's hair or the condition of its skin.If your dog's normally lustrous coat has become dull and flat, this could be a sign of roundworms.
Skin irritation could be a sign of hookworms.

, If your dog has been more flatulent than usual (i.e. is ""farting"" a lot), this can also be a warning sign, specifically of whipworms., Because these parasites steal vital nutrients from your dog, they may cause your dog to become iron-deficient.Anemia can be observed by looking at a dog's gums. Dogs' gums should be pink, like a persons. If they are pale, this is a likely sign of anemia, a condition that can result from both hookworms and whipworms.

, There are number of behavioral changes that can occur if a dog has intestinal parasites. For example:


A dog with tapeworms may become agitated, experience abdominal pain, or experience itching around the anus, leading it to drag its hindquarters along the ground.A dog with hookworms or whipworms may become lethargic. A sudden decrease in your dog's energy can be a warning sign that merits a visit to the vet., Heartworms are a blood parasite and are transmitted by mosquito bite from one dog to the next.Unlike the other types of worms discussed in this article, early infection with heartworm has no symptoms, and the dog can look and act fine for years.As such, it is important to have your dog's blood tested for heartworm regularly.


In most areas, an annual blood test is sufficient for both detecting potential cases of heartworm and ensuring any heartworm preventative medications are not making your dog unhealthy.In the advanced stages of infection, a dog may display symptoms such as a swollen belly, dull coat, coughing, rapid or labored breathing, or lack of energy.
For a dog displaying these symptoms, it may already be too late, as many advanced cases of heartworm are fatal. Thus, it is very important to have your dog checked regularly by a professional.

, If you suspect your dog is suffering from intestinal worms, your first step should be to make an appointment with your veterinarian, who will be able to properly diagnose the problem and prescribe the appropriate treatment.Your vet will most likely ask you to collect a stool sample before your appointment. She or he will use this sample to determine whether and what type of intestinal worms your dog may have.

, Most intestinal parasites can be treated with one of several different oral medications. Which type you use and how frequently is must be administered will depend on your veterinarian's recommendations and the type of worms your dog has.


For roundworms and hookworms, you'll most likely need to give your dog oral medication, called a ""dewormer,"" and the dog will probably have to be be checked for reinfection every 3-6 months for a certain period of time after the treatment has begun.More than one medication will treat roundworms and hookworms, some of which can be found “over the counter,” while others require a veterinary prescription. Pyrantel pamoate and fenbendazole can be found over the counter as a treatment for both roundworms and hookworms.Pyrantel is safe enough to give most puppies starting at 4 weeks of age. It is best to contact your veterinarian before administering any medication to your pet.In the case of roundworms or hookworms, the dog will also most likely need to have monthly heartworm medicine that contains roundworm prevention administered to manage reinfection.The drugs, Praziquantel and Epsiprantel, are commonly used to treat Tapeworms.Whipworms can only be killed by certain medications. These include fenbendazole or febantel. This treatment will last for five days, and will need to be repeated after three weeks. Monthly heartworm medicine that contains medication to prevent Whipworms is also often recommended., A dog that has been infected with heartworm should receive treatment as soon as possible The treatment for adult heartworm infection requires a veterinarian.The severity of the infection and the amount of damage the worms have done to the heart and lungs needs to be evaluated by your veterinarian so that the proper treatment plan can be developed.There are several steps to a typical heartworm treatment that take place over a period of six to twelve months. These steps include oral medication, as well as a series of injections (typically three) of special medicine into the back muscles of the dog.Heartworm is a very serious condition, and even with treatment, some dogs with advanced infections will not survive.

, To ensure that any type of worms are caught and treated before the case becomes advanced, see a veterinarian regularly.


For preventative purposes, it's a good idea to get your dog's feces tested at least once a year.If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors or with other dogs, if your dog hunts and eats live prey, or if you live in an area where any of these parasites are especially common, it is a good idea to have your dog's stool tested more frequently.

, Preventing heartworm is safer and cheaper than treating it, so you should start puppies on heartworm prevention medication as young as 8 weeks of age. Many of the preventatives available for heartworms are are also effective in reducing the risk of intestinal parasites, making the use of these medicines doubly important.There are many forms of Heartworm prevention medications available and your veterinarian can advise you of your options.The most common heartworm preventatives are available in both oral and topical forms.
Many heartworm preventatives also help to prevent fleas and ticks. While no one product prevents all parasites, your veterinarian will help you decide which product is most appropriate for your pet’s health.Heartworm prevention is typically administered or applied monthly, although there is one variety that can be administered as a long-acting injection and lasts six months.This medication only prevents heartworms and does not protect against intestinal parasites.
If you live in an area where heartworm prevention is not required, there are medications such pyrantel pamoate, fenbendazole and praziquantel that can be administered that treat only intestinal parasites., Tapeworm infections occur most commonly as a result of dogs eating fleas, so keeping your dog free of these nuisance insects is the best way to prevent tapeworms.There are several over-the-counter topical and oral flea prevention medications, as well as prescription flea products, that effectively manage fleas and therefore control tapeworm infection.Although not as effective, this can also be attempted with flea collars and flea baths., Hookworms and whipworms are both commonly transmitted through feces. Clean up your dog's poop often, and keep your dog away from the leavings of other dogs."

Avoid places where mosquitoes are common.",How to Treat Heartworms in Dogs," The official treatment for heartworms is a medical injection of Immiticide (Melarsomine). This treatment starts off with one injection given to your dog at the vet. Four to six weeks later, this is followed by two more injections that are given 24 hours apart.This treatment kills the adult worms, which will disintegrate over time and be absorbed by your dog's body.
There is a risk of the worms causing a physical obstruction in your dog's blood vessels. Your dog may also have an anaphylactic allergic reaction from the alien proteins in their blood stream. Because of this, it is crucial that your dog is cage rested for the duration of the treatment.
Sometimes steroids may be necessary to help suppress your dog's allergic reaction, but this makes your dog more vulnerable to a secondary bacterial infection.;
, When your dog has heartworms, your vet may prescribe them antibiotics. The larvae and worms can release bacteria when they die which can cause bacteremia, or a massive release of bacteria into your dog's bloodstream.


In order to prevent this, your vet may give your dog a four-week course of antibiotics prior to treatment so your dog doesn't get blood poisoning., There is another medication that is starting to be tested to treat heartworms, though it hasn't been officially licensed to do so yet. During this treatment, your dog receives low doses of the medication ivermectin over the course of several months.


Ask your doctor about this option for your dog to see if it's viable.

, There are certain cases where your dog may already be in advanced heart failure when they are diagnosed. If this is the case, the prognosis for your dogs may be bleak because they may not survive killing the worms within their blood vessels and heart. First, your vet will appraise your dog's likelihood of surviving treatment and discuss if treatment or putting your dog down is the kinder option.


If your dog decides that your dog can survive treatment, they must be stabilized before any medication can be given to kill the heartworms. Your vet may use drugs such as diuretics, which will shift your dog's heart fluid and make it easier for their heart to pump blood. The vet may also prescribe ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to regulate your dog's heart function. , Once your dog has been successfully given treatment, they should be checked for heartworms. About six months after your dog completes treatment, have your vet run tests to see if there are any heartworm antigens in your dog's blood.This will prove that the treatment killed all your dog's heartworms.

, Once your dog has been treated for heartworms, you should put them on heartworm preventative medicine in order to help them not get heartworms again. These preventative methods include medications from the Ivermectin family that you can get from your vet as well as store bought products such as Heartgard, Heartgard Plus, Sentinel, Interceptor, Revolution, and ProHeart 6.


Although the heartworm prevention is very effective in keeping heartworms from coming back, your dog should be tested for heartworms once a year. There have been cases where heartworms were contracted even if the dog was on preventative medication., Heartworms are discussed using three classes of severity. Class I heartworms may not present any symptoms. However, one common sign of heartworms at this level is a soft, persistent cough. At class II, the dog may cough more insistentlyYour dog may experience shortness of breath or rapid shallow breathing., Your dog may show signs of fatigue and lethargy. Class II and III dogs may have a severe intolerance to exercise. This means your dog may lay around the house more, not jump around or be as lively, and refuse to exercise when the dog used to enjoy exercising.In class III, the dog may faint or pass out during exercise.

, Heartworms can lead to your dog having a poor or decreased appetite. This means that your dog may refuse to eat or want to eat less food than is normal. Because of this, your dog may experience weight loss.Watch to see if your dog has changed their eating habits. A decreased appetite and weight loss is a symptom of many different problems.

, If you notice any signs of heartworms, take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as you can. Your vet will examine your dog, observing their breathing for signs of distress. Your vet may listen to your dog's breathing with a stethoscope to listen for crackles or harshness within the lungs as well as abnormal heart sounds.Your vet will need to rule out other causes of lung or heart disease, such as pneumonia or structural heart disease.
If after the examination, heartworms remain a possibility, a blood test will be administered to see if the body has produced antigens against heartworms. This shows that your dog is mounting an immune response against the worms.
This test may produce both false negatives and false positives in 20% of cases, so your vet will need to run other tests.This most common second test is the Knott's test, which is where a sample of your dog's blood is examined under the microscope to check for the physical presence of the heartworm larvae.If a false negative is suspected, your vet may double check to see if a negative test is accurate with a retest a month or two later to confirm the result.Your vet may also run blood tests to look for organ function, take x-rays, and a heart ultrasound scan to assess your dog's health.

, Heartworms are a condition spread through mosquito bites. A mosquito carrying a heartworm in its larval stage will bite your dog, which is left behind on the skin and introduced into your dog's bloodstream through the bite.


Once the larvae enters your dog's blood stream, it generally takes six to seven months for the heartworm to develop into the adult worm form., The fully grown adult heartworms live in your dog's heart chambers, which is how it derived its name. These adult worms interfere with your dog's heart's ability to pump blood. This causes problems with your dog's normal heart function, which effects the rest of your dog's health.


Heartworms can spread and also infect your dog's lungs and arteries if they are left untreated to reproduce.
Once fully grown, heartworms can live in your dog for five to seven years., One of the best ways to help prevent your dog from contracting heartworms is to prevent mosquito bites. The most problematic areas for mosquitoes are those with plenty of standing water, such as lakes and waterways. Mosquitoes like to breed in these areas, which means they are an intermediate host for heartworm.


Whereas heartworm was once limited to south and southwest regions of the United States, now it is widespread all over the world."

Use a tick repellent collar on your dogs.,
Check your dogs once a day for ticks.,
Bathe your dogs regularly.",How to Keep Ticks from Your Dogs1," Having your dogs wear a tick repellent collar can help keep ticks away from their heads and necks. These types of collars sit on your dogs' skin and release chemicals or active compounds into the fatty tissue just below your dogs' skin.


These chemicals won’t hurt your dogs, but they will kill and repel ticks.
Place the collar carefully on your dogs so that they won’t be able to turn their heads and chew or bite it.Make sure that you use a product that is licensed to kill ticks, such as Seresto, or your dog will not have adequate protection.;
, Every day, you should comb through your dogs' fur and check for ticks, particularly if your dogs spend a lot of time outside. You might occasionally find one or two, and getting them off your dogs every day will help prevent a serious infestation.


Place your dogs on a white sheet so that you can better see if any ticks fall off when you’re combing their fur.
Using either your fingers or a comb, comb the fur along your dog’s back and belly, making sure you get all the way down to your dog’s skin. As you comb, look for ticks, which will sometimes look like gray beans or black poppy seeds or smaller.If your dog has long hair, then you might consider clipping their hair to make finding ticks easier.

, You should shampoo your dogs every two weeks with an anti-tick shampoo. These shampoos contain ingredients that kill any ticks that might already be on your dogs and repel any ticks that try to bite your dogs later.Bathing your dogs is a good way to prevent ticks, but it should be used in conjunction with flea medications. Relying only on baths probably won’t prevent your dogs from getting ticks.

Vacuum frequently.,
Maintain your yard and garden.,
Keep your dogs away from heavily wooded areas.",How to Keep Ticks from Your Dogs2," You and your dogs can easily bring ticks into the house from outside, so one of the best ways to prevent an infestation is to vacuum your home regularly. Vacuuming helps suck up live ticks as well as any eggs that might have come in on you or your dogs.


You should vacuum your whole house, but also pay special attention to the areas where your dogs hang out the most – near their beds or favorite nap and play spots., You can prevent ticks from getting into your yard by making sure any grass and plants are neatly maintained. Cut your grass frequently, avoid storing any of your yard tools near the edge of the yard in tall grasses, and trim plants and bushes often., If you and your dogs take frequent walks, try to avoid heavily wooded areas or areas with a lot of tall grass. These types of areas are ticks’ natural habitat and taking your dogs through these types of areas almost guarantees your dogs will pick up some ticks."
"
Administer oral medications.,
Apply a spot-on treatment.,
Use an anti-tick spray.,
Shake on anti-tick powder.,
Apply a dip.",How to Keep Ticks from Your Dogs3," Tick preventative oral medications – usually in the form of pills – are available over the counter or from your vet. These pills target ticks at all stages, including eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult ticks.


You'll need to give your dogs this medication regularly, usually once a month. Check the packaging or talk to your vet to make sure you know the proper dosage and frequency.
Giving your dogs oral medications also prevents any children or other pets from coming into contact with the medication.

, Spot-on treatments usually come in liquid form, and are available online, over the counter at a pet store, and from you vet. However, only use products that are licensed to kill or repel ticks. This means they have been proven effective and will provide your dogs with the best protection. This type of medication should be applied at base of your dog’s neck or between their shoulder blades.


This type of medication is also applied monthly or once every two weeks depending on the product. You should consult with your vet about whether a spot-on or oral medication is better for your dogs.If you use a spot-on treatment, make sure your kids or other pets don't come into contact with it.

, Tick sprays are applied topically and work much more quickly than an oral or spot-treatment. Apply the spray all over your dogs' bodies.You can use tick spray in conjunction with most tick medications, but always make sure that you check both sets of packaging for contraindications.
It’s a good idea to use tick spray after you’ve come in from a long walk.
When you use the spray, be sure to avoid your dogs' eyes, nose, and mouth.

, Powders can also be applied topically on your pet to get rid of ticks. As with an anti-tick spray, you should apply the powder all over your dogs' bodies. You’ll need to select a powder that is specific to the age and size of your dogs.


Take care to avoid inhaling the powder yourself or letting your dogs inhale it.

, Tick dip is a concentrated chemical which can be applied with a clean cloth, sponge, or cotton swab on the skin and fur of your dogs, after diluting the dip with water. The dip doesn’t need to be rinsed off, but should instead soak into your dogs' skin.


Don’t use dips on very young dogs (younger than four months), or pregnant or nursing dogs.Some dips are also not suitable for certain breeds, such as Chihuahuas, so always check the label first.

Make your pet and home unpleasant environments for ticks.",How to Get Ticks off Dogs," Ticks enjoy tall grass and low shrubs. Some ticks are very small— almost flea sized—while others are much larger. Ticks are generally black or brown and oval in shape. Like spiders and scorpions, they belong to the group of arthropods called arachnids, and they have eight legs.;
, You will need a pair of fine-tipped tweezers and a jar filled with alcohol. You will also want to have some disinfectant around such as a chlorhexidine solution (Nolvasan) or povidine iodine solution (Betadine) to clean the wound after removing the tick from your pet.


If you live in an area where ticks are common, you may also want to get a device designed to remove ticks. These clever instruments looks like a spoon with a notch cut into the side and works great to remove ticks off people and pets.
Though a common belief, you cannot actually kill ticks by flushing them down the toilet. The only way you can properly kill them is to put them in alcohol or spray them with flea and tick spray., Removing ticks isn’t fun for your dog either. Give him his favorite toy to chew on and a treat or two (along with your love and affection) before you get started.

, You should check your canine friend for ticks whenever he has been somewhere that is known to have ticks (hiking trails, yards with tall grass, etc.) You should feel for small bumps with your hands and look for dark, circular bumps with your eyes. Begin your search on the top of your dog's back and move down each side towards his chest and belly. Be sure to search in and around his:Legs
Between his toes and pads of his feet
Under his legs (armpits), belly, chest, and tail
On top of, inside, and under the ears
Face and on the crown of the head
Chin
The front of the neck

, If you have a hard time going through your pet’s hair, you might want to enlist the help of a fine-toothed comb to search your dog for ticks. If that doesn’t seem to work, you can set a blowdryer on cool and use that to part your dog’s hair. Just be aware that some dogs are afraid of hairdryers.


You should use these instruments in addition to your hands since feeling the bumps is still the best method.

, These products may not be safe for very young puppies, so read and follow the directions carefully. Again, the chemicals will kill the ticks and make them easier to remove. If your pet is too young to use a shampoo or dip safely, don’t use the product. Proceed instead with manual removal of the ticks.


Do NOT use on cats unless the product specifically states that it is safe for cats.

, You want to keep the hair separated so that you don’t lose the tick. Though, if you accidentally lose the part you made, simply check the same area. Ticks don’t move while feeding since they bury their heads into your pet's skin.

, Carefully follow the directions on the bottle and wait for the chemicals to kill the tick. Do not overdo it. You don’t want to poison your pet. The chemicals will cause the tick to release its bite and fall off or at least make it easier to remove manually.


As with shampoos, many sprays should be avoided on puppies. Read and follow the directions carefully.

, Grab the tick by the head and mouth area, right where they have entered the skin. It is very important that you grab the tick by the head rather than the body. If you grab the tick by the body, the body will break off, leaving the head stuck in your dog’s skin. This can cause irritation and infection.Do not use your fingers to remove the tick. If you use your fingers, you could squeeze the tick’s body and facilitate disease transfer to your pet. Using the special tick removing device or carefully using tweezers is highly recommended.
If the tick does break off, your veterinarian will need to check the tick body parts left in the skin. Your veterinarian will determine whether there is a need to remove the leftover parts or not.

, If you’re too nervous about extracting the tick with tweezers or a tick-removing device, then you can try spreading a layer of petroleum jelly such as Vaseline over the tick, especially around the head. This prevents the tick from breathing, which will make it back its head out of the skin. You can then pick up the tick with the tweezers without risking breaking the head off the body.


This isn’t a guaranteed method, and even if it does work, you may have to wait several minutes after applying the petroleum jelly for the tick to reverse direction.

, Make sure that the tick is submerged and can’t get out of the jar. The tick may take up to several hours to die.

, Remember that depending on where your dog was playing, he may have quite a few ticks present, so be meticulous and detailed in your search to ensure that you remove each one.

, To help prevent infection, rub a triple antibiotic ointment on the spot where you removed the tick.Vets recommend a chlorhexidine or povidine iodine solution diluted in water.Check the directions on the label for specific dilution instructions.

, Once you have finished removing all the ticks, make sure that they are all thoroughly sealed in the jar of alcohol. Put the lid on the jar and leave them in there for a day or so. When you are sure they are all dead, you can throw them in an outdoor trash can., Ticks can carry many diseases, particularly Lyme Disease. After removing ticks, make an appointment with the vet to ensure that nothing has been transmitted to your pet.It can be helpful to your vet if you save a few of the dead ticks when you go to dispose of them. Place them in a plastic bag and bring them to the vet. By identifying the type of tick(s), your vet will have an easier time assessing the potential for disease transmission.

, Anytime you take your dog for a hike or let him play in some tall grass where you know ticks are prevalent, you should check your pup for ticks.


Depending on the area, certain ticks are more likely during different seasons. This information can be found through your local cooperative extension office, online, or from your veterinarian.

, Avoiding ticks is the most effective way to keep ticks off your dog. Apply an effective and safe tick and flea control product to your dog. There are spot-on products, oral products, and collars to help manage ticks on your dog. Consult with your vet before administering a new medication. Other ways to keep your dog and home tick free include:


Keeping your grass and weeds trimmed to below ankle height.
Securing your trash cans with strong lids and take out any rock piles and brushy cover. This helps keep away rodents that may carry ticks.
Staying on the trails when hiking with your pet and making sure that your pet remains with you. Avoid wooded areas and long grasses where ticks are common. If your dog runs off the trail (as they often do), make sure to check him for ticks when you get home.

Select the appropriate Advantix dosage for your dog.,
Remove the tube of Advantix from its packaging.,
Remove the cap from the tube.,
Have your dog stand up.,
Part your dog’s fur.,
Apply the Advantix.,
Throw away the tube.,
Wash your hands.,
Do not bathe your dog for two days.,
Do not let your dog eat the Advantix.,
Monitor your dog for side effects.",How to Apply Advantix for Dogs," Advantix is not a ‘one size fits all’ treatment, so you will need to make sure that you choose the correct dosage. Advantix comes in four dosage levels according to a dog’s weight.If you do not know your dog’s weight, contact your veterinarian or refer to the paperwork from your dog’s most recent veterinary visit.


Advantix comes in packs of four or six.Small dogs (4 to 10 pounds) – 0.4 milliliters (mL) Medium dogs (11 to 20 pounds) – 1.0 mLLarge dogs (21 to 55 pounds) – 2.5 mLExtra-large dogs (over 55 pounds) – 5.0 mL;
, You can either separate and peel the foil down with your fingers or use scissors to open the foil packaging. Using scissors may be easier and quicker., There is a specific way to remove the cap so that you can dispense the Advantix from the tube; it is not as simple as just twisting off the cap and squeezing out the product. First, make sure that you are holding the tube in the upright position. Next, remove the cap, turn it upside down, and put it back on the tube.Placing the upside-down cap back on the tube will break the seal on the top of the tube, allowing you to squeeze out the Advantix.When you see that the seal has broken, remove the cap from the tube and lace it to the side., You will apply Advantix to various locations along your dog’s back. Having your dog in the standing position will help you apply Advantix more easily and accurately on his skin.If your dog tends to be a bit squirmy, you can have someone gently restrain your dog while you apply the Advantix.

, Use your fingers to part the fur until you can see the skin. Advantix needs to be applied to the skin for maximum effectiveness. The first location where you will apply the Advantix is at the start of your dog’s back, right near the base of his neck. Small and medium dogs will need three Advantix applications along their backs.Large and extra-large dogs will need four Advantix applications along their backs.If your dog is extremely furry, it may be helpful to clip away a little bit of hair to make it easier to apply the Advantix.

, Gently place the tip of the tube on your dog’s skin. Squeeze about 1/3 or 1/4 of the Advantix onto the skin, depending on how many applications your dog will need. You want to be careful not to apply too much Advantix to the skin; this could cause the product to get on your dog’s hair and drip down his side.Not only will this waste the product, but it increases the likelihood that your dog may ingest the Advantix.


Advantix should not be applied if the skin is wet or broken.Dry your dog’s skin if it is wet. If the skin is broken, do not apply the Advantix and contact your veterinarian.
It is not necessary to massage the product into the skin after applying it.Another reason not to massage the product into your dog’s skin is that Advantix can be harmful to human skin.The remaining applications should be spaced at least a few inches apart down your dog’s back. For large and extra-large dogs, the last dose should be near the top of the tail. For small and medium dogs, the last dose should be near the middle of the back.Avoid petting the dog for several hours after application, as you may wipe the product off the skin. It might be best to apply Advantix shortly before the dog goes to bed to minimize the chances of accidentally wiping it off.

, If you used the entire tube, you can dispense of it by putting it in the regular trash. If you did not use the entire tube, you should still throw it away. However, do not throw the partially-filled tube in the trash or pour it down the drain. Contact your local waste department to learn how to dispose of the partially-filled tube.The remaining tubes that were not used should be stored at room temperature in a cool, dry place., Advantix can be harmful to human skin. Even if you are sure that Advantix did not get on your skin, washing your hands thoroughly is still a good idea after applying a product on your dog’s skin. If you notice that Advantix has gotten on your skin by accident, immediately rinse your skin with water for 15 to 20 minutes. Call a poison hotline or your doctor for further treatment recommendations., The Advantix will need time to be absorbed into your dog’s skin. Bathing your dog would remove the product from your dog’s skin.Even though Advantix is waterproof, it will take at least two days before it has absorbed enough in the skin so that it will not come off with bathing or swimming.

, Given that you applied Advantix to your dog’s back, his mouth should not be able to get to the areas where you applied the product. However, if some of the product happened to drip down his sides and land on the floor, he may be able to ingest the product that way. Advantix can be harmful to dogs if ingested, so contact your veterinarian or local pet poison hotline immediately for guidance on treatment.If you have other pets, keep your dog separated them so that they do not have a chance to ingest the Advantix or get it on their skin.

, It is rare that Advantix causes side effects in dogs. Potential side effects include lethargy, vomiting and drooling.You may notice that the skin is red where you applied the Advantix, which indicates irritation. Your dog may scratch at the application site if the skin is irritated, or he might just look uncomfortable in general.If your dog has any of these side effects, take your dog to your veterinarian."

To determine your dog’s weight, you will need to weigh yourself first.Take off your shoes, and take keys, cellphones, and other belongings out of your pockets. Then, step on the scale. Wait a few seconds for the scale to stabilize, and record your weight. Step off.
Do not hold on to anything while you are on the scale. This will produce an inaccurate reading.;
, Pick up your dog. While holding your dog, step onto the scale again. After the scale stabilizes, record the total weight. Step off the scale., Subtract your weight from the total weight, i.e., the weight of you and your dog together. The resulting number is your dog’s weight.For example, if your weight is 120 pounds and the weight of you plus your dog together is 150 pounds, then subtract 120 from 150. The remaining number, 30, is the weight of your dog.

, If you do not have a scale at home, or if your dog is too heavy to pick up, then take your dog to the vet’s office. Your veterinarian will have a scale that can weigh small, medium, and large dogs."

, Dogs should be standing to apply Advantage safely. Make sure your dog is standing up before you apply Advantage.Be sure your dog is standing still. Have a second person hold the dog, if necessary.
If your dog is nervous about standing, try using treats to coax your dog into a standing position. You can also use treats to encourage your dog to behave.

, You want to apply Advantage directly. This way, it will seep into your dog's skin and disperse throughout the body. This will poison any fleas or ticks on your dog's fur, and eliminate flea eggs and larvae.Locate the middle of the dog's back at the base of its neck between the shoulder blades. You want to apply Advantage on an area where your dog cannot lick it off.
Use one hand to part the fur and expose the skin. Use a disposable hair clip or hair elastic to hold the fur out of the way if your dog is long-haired or has a thick coat. This will help you get the Advantage on the dog's skin, not the fur.
If your dog is nervous, you may have to have someone else hold the dog still while you work.

, If you're applying Advantage to a dog under 25 pounds, only apply the dose between your dog's shoulder blades. For a larger dog, apply a dose between the shoulder blades, on the middle of the back between the hips, and at one point in between these places. Make sure you do not apply Advantage anywhere where your dog can lick.Place the open tip of the applicator on the exposed skin at the base of the neck.
Squeeze the applicator tube to release the whole dose onto the skin, for a small dog. For a large dog, release about a third of the dose. Release the other two thirds elsewhere on the dog's skin.
Check that all medication has been expelled from the dose tube. This will make Advantage work most effectively.

, You want to give Advantage a chance to absorb into your dog's skin. This will increase the chance it will effectively kill and prevent fleas.Avoid touching the area where the Advantage has been applied for about 24 hours after application.
If you have another dog, make sure that dog does not lick the area where Advantage was applied. Avoid leaving your dogs together unsupervised for about 24 hours.

, If your dog has a monthly bath, bathe him or her before applying Advantage. Advantage is waterproof, but you want to make sure your dog is dry when you apply the first dose.Advantage takes about 24 hours to absorb in your dog's skin. Therefore, you may want to avoid bathing your dog or allowing him or her to get wet for 24 hours after applying Advantage to ensure full absorption of the treatment.

, Advantage will be effective for about 4 weeks. It should be reapplied every month to keep your dog safe from fleas and ticks. Always mark the date when you apply Advantage so you know when to safely apply it again.Advantage will work best to prevent fleas, flea eggs and ticks when used once per month or according to your veterinarian's instructions.
Consult your veterinarian before applying Advantage more frequently than once per month. Severe infestations may need more frequent treatment, but Advantage can cause health problems when applied too frequently.

, Any new medication should be run by a vet before use. This is especially important if your dog is on other medication or has existing health problems.Some dogs do have sensitivities or adverse reactions to Advantage. A vet can let you know how to manage side effects in the event they occur.

, A little Advantage on your skin will not cause much harm. However, Advantage should stay out of your eyes and mouth. If you get any Advantage on your skin, wash the area with soap and water.If you get Advantage in your eye, wash out the area immediately. Then, see a doctor.
See a doctor as soon as possible if you ingest Advantage.

, There is always a risk of side effects when using medication. It's also possible to overdose on Advantage if you give your dog too high of a dosage. Make sure the Advantage you're using is safe given your dog's size and weight. If you notice any of the following symptoms, contact your vet:Muscle twitches
Lack of coordination
Confusion

Recognize the signs of an infestation.,
Be careful removing them.,
Call your vet.",How to Keep Ticks from Your Dogs4," Sometimes, despite your best efforts at prevention, your dogs might get ticks. If your dogs seem lethargic, exhibit lameness, or have fevers, you should contact your vet and set up an appointment to check for ticks.Keep in mind that ticks also bite humans and that you can therefore exhibit signs that there are ticks on you, your dogs, or in your home. If you have a rash, joint pain, headaches, or a fever, get checked out by your doctor and have your dogs checked by your vet., If you only find one or two ticks on your dogs, you can remove them yourself, but you must use proper technique. Grip the tick as close to the skin as possible and with a quick flick remove the tick. Avoid squeezing the tick's body as this can cause the tick to vomit its stomach contents (with infectious agents) into your dog's bloodstream.Use a pair of fine nosed tweezers or a special tick hook removing device. Take care not to leave the mouthparts in the dog's skin as this can cause a tick granuloma, which may requires treatment.
Using other commonly suggested methods of removing ticks can also make the situation worse. Avoid using petroleum jelly to suffocate the ticks or fire to burn the ticks off.

, Unless your dogs only have one or two ticks, you shouldn’t try to remove all of them yourself. Call your vet and ask for an appointment, but also find out what you can do to help your dogs in the meantime."

Only use on dogs 8 weeks or older.,
Buy the appropriate box.,
Choose the lower amount.,
Combine products.",How to Determine the Proper Frontline Plus Dosage for Dogs2," Frontline Plus is a topical medication that is used to prevent and kill fleas and ticks. You will need to re-apply it once a month. Only use Frontline Plus on dogs that are eight weeks of age or older., Frontline Plus comes in four different boxes that are differentiated by weight. If your dog weighs 22 pounds or less, then buy the 5 to 22 lb. box. The basic 5 to 22 pound box comes with three .67ml applicators. Only use one applicator per application. There are also 6 and 12 pack boxes available. These come with 6 or 12 .67ml applicators.If your dog weighs 23 to 44 pounds, then buy the 23-44 lb. box. The 23-44 lb. box comes with three 1.34ml applicators.
If your dog weighs 45 to 88 pounds, then buy the 45-88 lb. box. The 45-88 lb. box comes with three 2.68 applicators.
If your dog weighs 89 to 132 pounds, then buy the 89-132 lb. box. The 89-132 lb. box comes with three 4.02ml applicators.

, If your dog’s weight is in between two different weight ranges, then use the box with the lower amount. In other words, round down instead of rounding up. It is always better to use less rather than more in order to prevent an overdose.For example, if your dog weighs 22.5 pounds, then use the 5 to 22 lb. box.

, If your dog weighs more than 132 pounds, you will need to combine products in order to get the correct dosage. This means you will need to buy more than one box. You will need to buy the 89-132 lb. pound box plus an additional box. The additional box you use depends on how many pounds of your dog's weight exceed the 132 limit.For example, if your dog weighs 152 pounds, then apply a 4.02ml applicator and a .67ml applicator since your dog is only 20 pounds over. However, if your dog is 30 pounds over, i.e., 162 pounds, then use a 1.34ml applicator in addition to the 4.02ml applicator.

Clean your house with ACV solution.",How to Make a Natural Flea and Tick Remedy with Apple Cider Vinegar," Instead of putting vinegar directly onto your pet's skin, which can irritate his/her skin, you need to make a diluted solution. Mix up 1 cup of ACV, 1 quart warm water, and 1 ounce of Castille soap. This diluted solution is powerful enough to deal with fleas and ticks, but not so strong that you will be able to smell it.


If you want to add something extra to help repel the fleas and ticks from your pet, add 2-3 drops of lavender or cedar oil to the mixture. The scent of the oil will help keep the fleas and ticks off and also give the solution a pleasant smell. You can also add 2 ounces of aloe vera to the mix as well. It will help moisturize your pet's skin and repel the fleas.ACV is nontoxic to dogs and cats. However, if your pet has sensitive skin, change the ration of ACV to water in your rinse to one part ACV, three parts water.;
, Fleas and ticks can bite humans too, so it's important to protect yourself when you treat your pet. Wear rubber gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, and long pants to avoid getting bitten.


You may want to tie your pants around the ankles to prevent fleas from biting you there.

, Completely saturate your pet with the ACV wash solution, making sure to cover every part of her fur. Use your fingers to work the solution into the fur all the way to her skin. The Castille soap should lather some at this point, so rub the suds into her skin as well. Let the solution sit for ten minutes.


Make sure you don't get the solution into her eyes. It will irritate her.
If you're dealing with live fleas and ticks, it's best to work outside. If it's too cold to be outside, use your bathtub.
If you're dealing with a bad infestation, have a second batch or two of the ACV solution mixed up so you can give your pet a double treatment.

, Before you rinse your pet, you need to comb through the wet fur. Working section by section, comb through your pet's fur to remove the fleas. Each time you comb through the fur, dip your comb in a bowl of soapy water to get rid of the fleas on the comb. The fleas should come off your pet's fur easily, since they are repelled by the taste of the ACV. Once you finish combing your pet, rinse the wash out with warm water.If your pet has particularly thick fur, you may have to go over her body twice with the comb. After the first combing, rinse your pet and apply a second round of ACV treatment. Wait ten minutes, then start again.
Make sure you use a comb designed for flea removal. A regular comb will not effectively remove the fleas and their eggs.

, As you are combing your pet for fleas, you should also check her for ticks. Make sure you wear gloves when you check for ticks, because you don't want to take the chance of getting bitten. As you comb through your pet's fur, feel her skin to check for tiny bumps. If you see a tick, remove it carefully using a pair of tweezers. Grasp the tick and lift it away from her skin. Do not twist or crush the tick. The goal is to remove the tick without breaking its body away from its mouth parts. Pull directly outward.


Disinfect the bite site with rubbing alcohol right when you pull the tick off. You should also keep a check on the bite and put more on it every few days so it doesn't get infected.
Place the tick in a plastic bag. If your pet shows signs of infection, you'll want to have it to bring to the vet for testing.
Monitor your pet for a few days for redness, swelling, or illness. If you see any of these signs of infection, take her to the vet.
Have a partner help you hold your pet steady. The procedure might make her uncomfortable., Fleas have a life cycle that lasts a few weeks, so if you missed any fleas the first time around, they may lay more eggs in your home and cause a reinfestation. You'll have to keep giving your pet the ACV treatment every few days until you no longer see any signs of fleas.


Once the fleas are gone, repeat it once every week to ensure your pet doesn't get a new case of fleas., Fleas can live for days or even weeks in carpeting and pet bedding. Wash all bedding and linens your pet has touched with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle. You should do this a few times as you are fighting the infestation.


This is so your pet doesn't get re-infested with fleas from her environment as you are working on getting rid of them.
You should wash any other materials that your pet has come into contact with, including blankets and pillows., Just like your pet's bedding, fleas and ticks can live in carpet for a long time. Fleas lay eggs on your pet and then the eggs drop off their skin into the carpet and other fabrics in your pet's environment. In order to keep the fleas from hatching, you need to get rid of the flea eggs and any fleas that may be in your carpet. To do this, vacuum your house extremely well.


Make sure you vacuum off upholstery and fabric, crevices in your furniture, corners of the room, and any place that your pet has been., Once you vacuum and launder all washable materials, you can make a spray similar to your bathing solution to spray on your carpet and pet bedding to help get rid of the fleas. To make this solution, combine a gallon of ACV, 1/2 gallon of water, 16 ounces of lemon juice, and 8 ounces (230 g) of witch hazel in a large tub. Fill a large spray bottle with the solution. Spray every portion of your house, including carpets, wood floors, crevices and corners, windowsills, and furniture in a thick coating of the spray.


You may need to repeat this method for 2-7 days depending on how bad your flea infestation is.
If you are just trying to prevent infestation, you can do this once a month.Let the spray dry before you return objects to the wet areas.

, If you don't have a really bad flea problem but want to catch any fleas that might be lurking in your home, you can try a flea trap. Position a few night lights around the room in outlets close to the floor. Under each light, place a dish of water that has cap full of dish soap poured into it.


Check the dish every morning for dead fleas. Throw out the fleas and fill the dish with fresh soapy water every night.
You can use this method to check how well the natural spray is working. Once there are no more fleas in the dish, you can stop the spray treatments.
You can use tea light candles for this method as well, but you have to be around the flea trap all night so you don't risk the possibility of a fire., To keep the fleas off of you pet after you have gotten rid of your home infestation, you can make an ACV solution without the soap. Mix up two cups of ACV and two cups of water. Pour the solution into a clean spray bottle.


Make sure the bottle is completely clean and did not formerly contain cleaning solution or other chemicals that may harm your pet.You can make more if you want, depending of how many pets you have.
Just like with the wash, you can add lavender or cedar oil to your spray. It makes it smell better and gives your spray an added boost of repellent., This solution will help repel fleas and ticks and it is gentle enough that you can use it as a regular treatment each time you give your pet a bath. Spray your pet from head to toe to completely cover her coat in the solution. Rub the solution into her fur and let it dry. The smell of vinegar will go away once it dries.


Make sure you avoid the face when you spray your pet. To get her ears and face damp, wet a cloth with the mixture and rub it along her face.If you don't bathe your pet often, you may need to use the spray more frequently than you bathe her. Try to spray your pet every one to two weeks, especially during seasons when your pet spends a lot of time outdoors.Cats, and some dogs, may not like the feeling of being sprayed. If your pet is sensitive, treat her fur by saturating a clean washcloth with the ACV solution and using the cloth to apply it gently.

, Having your dog ingest ACV is a great way to repel fleas and ticks from the inside. The dog's skin and fur will smell like ACV if she regularly drinks it. Add a tablespoon of ACV to her drinking water once a day for every 40 pounds your pet weights.If your pet weighs less than 40 pounds, use less vinegar. For example, if your dog weight 12 pounds, only use 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon in her water.
Some pet owners feed ACV to cats, but others fear that ACV upsets cats' internal pH balance. In order to make sure your cat doesn't become ill, it's best to use ACV only topically on cats.
If your dog refuses to drink water with added ACV, don't force it. Using ACV topically works just as well.

, You can keep fleas and ticks from taking up residence in your home. To do this, use the same ACV solution you used on your pet to clean everything from floors to counter tops in your home. It's a completely safe, natural cleaning solution that kills bacteria and germs.


If you are cleaning surfaces where you prepare food, don't mix the vinegar with baking soda. The two react to neutralize their bacteria fighting capabilities.
You can spray your carpets as well to continue to help keep the fleas off.Your home will smell like vinegar until the solution dries. As soon as it dries, the smell should go away.

Monitor for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.,
Check for Canine Babesiosis.,
Watch for tick paralysis.",How to Identify Canine Tick Problems1," Lyme disease is spread by the deer tick. It may take a few months after being bitten by an infected tick for the dog to show signs. One unfortunate outcome, which seems to affect Golden Retrievers more commonly, is chronic kidney failure. There is a vaccine for Lyme disease in dogs which helps protect against disease.In dogs, the symptoms of Lyme disease are lameness, swollen joints and stiffness, a decrease in appetite, fever, dehydration, and lethargy.
It is the same Lyme disease that humans can acquire.;
, Anaplasmosis is another disease, like Lyme, which is spread by deer ticks. In fact, some dogs will have co-infections of Lyme and Anaplasmosis. It has also been called dog fever.Anaplasmosis can cause similar symptoms as Lyme: painful, swollen joints and stiffness, lameness, lack of appetite, fever, and fatigue. Dogs can also vomit and have diarrhea with Anaplasmosis. A few affected dogs can have seizures.
Dogs will have symptoms for one to seven days.

, Canine Ehrlichiosis is a serious dog disease found worldwide. It is spread by the brown dog tick and the Lone Star Tick. Dogs can contract this disease throughout the year. It is most common in the US on the Gulf Coast, the eastern seaboard, Southwest, California, and other warm places. Symptoms start to present one to three weeks after the bite.This disease causes numerous symptoms, including lethargy, lack of appetite, weakness, trouble breathing, swollen limbs, and bleeding. In extreme cases, dogs can have neurological signs, such as head tilt, difficulty walking, or seizures.

, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is spread by the American dog tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, and the Lone star tick.Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is a disease that can also infect humans, sometimes with very serious consequences.The organism attacks the cells lining the small blood vessels in the body and cause a variety of symptoms.


Symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, lack of appetite, weight loss, swollen limbs, sudden bleeding from the nose or other body orifices, difficulty stopping bleeding, trouble walking, and discolored spots in the mouth or on skin due to bleeding.Most infections of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever occur between March and October.

, Canine Babesiosis is spread by the dog tick or brown tick. It can also be spread via blood transfusions, from pregnant dogs to fetus, and through dog bites.The disease destroys the red blood cells in the body leading to anemia, jaundice (yellowing of tissues), weakness, lethargy, and vomiting.


This disease is common in American pit bull terriers and greyhounds.

, Tick paralysis is a disease caused by a toxin transmitting via the saliva of certain female ticks.The disease happens six to nine days after the tick attaches to the dog. The symptoms develop gradually.


These symptoms are generally related to a gradual paralysis of muscles. They include vomiting, difficulty eating, drooling, change in voice, trouble breathing, muscle weakness, and paralysis.Often, just removing the tick will reverse the symptoms. Sometimes the dog also needs supportive care."

Purchase a yard and kennel flea spray.,
Spray the kennel with flea spray.,
Treat the rest of the yard.,
Flood the kennel.,
Repeat the treatment.,
Use beneficial nematodes.",How to Get Rid of Fleas in an Outside Dog Kennel1," The first step in eliminating fleas in your dog’s kennel is to purchase a yard and kennel spray to kill fleas on contact. Look for an all-natural, non-toxic spray to kill fleas without exposing your pet to harmful chemicals. To purchase, look in pet stores, department stores, hardware stores, or online., Connect your garden hose to the treatment sprayer and turn the hose on. Turn the product nozzle to the “on” position. Spray the entire surface of the kennel evenly and leave it to dry thoroughly, overnight.Keep your dog out of the kennel until you are reasonably certain that it is flea-free (i.e. after a second treatment has been applied).
As a precaution, use a protective mask and gloves while spraying the treatment.

, To be safe, use the yard and kennel flea spray to treat the rest of the yard as well as the kennel. Remove chairs, toys, or any other items set up in the yard. Rake away leaves, twigs, and other debris, and mow the lawn. Spray the treatment evenly over the grass., A day after the product has been applied, use a garden hose to flood your dog’s kennel to remove eggs that fleas have already laid – eggs and larvae will not survive being flooded with water. Make sure to soak every corner of the kennel, as well as the ground around the kennel. If necessary, use a fan to ensure that the kennel dries thoroughly., To ensure that the treatment is effective, use it again after 2-3 weeks. Spray the kennel and surrounding grass with the yard and kennel flea spray. Focus on shady, cool, and damp areas of the yard where fleas would thrive.Once the treatment is repeated a second time and the kennel is dry, let your dog back in to it. If your dog has fleas itself, wait until its treatment is completed.

, Nematodes are microscopic worms found in dirt that seek out insects (like fleas), infiltrate them and release a toxin into them which kills them. Nematodes can be applied to your yard by means of a spray and do not harm humans, animals, or plants. The treatment will work quickly and last several months.Purchase beneficial nematodes from a local garden center or online.

If you have a puppy, though, you will probably notice if he has ascarids. A classic symptom of an ascarid infection is a pot belly.The harmful activity of the ascarids in the intestines causes the pot-bellied appearance.;
, As parasites, ascarids rob your dog’s body of important nutrients.A severe ascarid infection will cause stunted growth, weight loss, and a rough and dull hair coat., An ascarid infection may cause digestive upset, such as vomiting. Four- to six- month old puppies with a severe ascarid infection could vomit up a large mass of ascarids, each one being several inches long and moving around—this could be a very distressing sight to see!Ascarid infections can also cause chronic diarrhea in puppies.Ascarids are solid white or brown with round bodies.If your dog vomits up ascarids, contact your veterinarian with how best to dispose of them.
In severe cases, a large mass of ascarids could block part of the intestine, leading to digestive upset., Taking a close look at your dog’s feces may not seem very pleasant, but you may be able to see ascarids in the feces.Unlike in the vomit, ascarids exiting the body through the feces would likely be dead.If it doesn’t make you too squeamish, place a small portion of the feces in a sealable plastic bag to take to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian would examine this fecal sample for ascarids.

, Other than noticing the obvious symptoms of an ascarid infection, your veterinarian will take a small portion of your dog’s feces and use fecal flotation to detect ascarids.For this test, your veterinarian will need a fecal sample from your dog. The fecal sample will be suspended in saline and then spun down using a centrifuge. The eggs then float to the top of the saline where they are concentrated and easier to detect.

, Ascarid medications work by killing either the adult ascarid or ascarid larvae (developmental stage before adulthood). Because of the complicated life cycle of ascarids, both larvae and adult ascarids may be present in your dog’s body at the same time. For this reason, your dog may need multiple treatments to eliminate all the ascarids.


Although many ascarid medications target the adult worms, some of the newer medications kill the larvae., Deworming your dog is just like it sounds—getting rid of the worms. There are many deworming medications available through your veterinarian; he or she will decide which one will work best for your dog. Dewormers are given by mouth.If you have a litter of puppies with ascarids, treat all the puppies and their mother at the same time.Over-the-counter dewormers are available, but you should use only what is prescribed by your veterinarian. Dewormers can make your dog very sick if you give him the wrong dosage., During the ascarid life cycle, some of the larvae can remain dormant in the body, then ‘wake up’ and develop into adults. Some of the larvae in your dog’s body may have been dormant during the first round of treatment. To target these larvae, you will need to go back to your veterinarian in 2 to 4 weeks for another round of treatment., Preventing an ascarid infection can be just as simple and effective as treating an infection. Monthly preventatives are available by prescription. In fact, many heartworm preventatives also contain ingredients to prevent ascarids.Make sure not to forget or miss a dose—this could increase your dog’s likelihood of an infection.


To help you remember, give the preventative on the same date each month and mark this date on your calendar.

, If you are a dog breeder, deworm your puppies every 2 weeks, starting at 2 weeks of age and ending at 8 weeks of age. Since mothers can transfer ascarid larvae through their milk, treat the mother at the same time as her puppies.Treating pregnant female dogs with either fenbendazole or ivermectin can prevent transmission of ascarids to puppies., Ascarid eggs that exit your dog’s body through his feces can survive in the outdoor environment. They are very hardy—not only are they fairly resistant to heat and humidity, but they also stick to various surfaces.Ascarid eggs pose a health risk for dogs and humans (particularly children), so the sooner you pick up your dog’s feces, the better.


Wash your hands thoroughly after throwing away your dog’s feces.

, During your dog’s first year of life, he should receive 2 to 4 fecal exams. After the first year, he should have yearly fecal exams.The combination of a monthly preventative and regular fecal exams will help keep your dog roundworm free.

, Wild rodents can carry ascarids. If your dog catches and eats a rodent, he could get an ascarid infection.If you have a backyard, closely supervise your dog when he goes outside to make sure he is not hunting for small rodents. You may want to keep him on a leash in the backyard so he can’t run off suddenly., Without rodents in and around your home, you won’t have to worry much about your dog hunting them. Seal any possible paths of rodent entry into your home, including floor vents, under and behind kitchen cabinets, and the basement.You could also set up traps to trap mice and rats. In addition, you could get rid of any potential rodent food sources, such as bird feeders and compost bins.If you prefer, contact a pest control service to keep rodents out.

Wash your dog with flea and tick shampoo.,
Purchase a flea spray.,
Try a flea powder.,
Prepare a medicated dip.,
Put a flea collar on your dog.",How to Kill Fleas on Dogs1," While normal dog shampoo and dish detergent usually kill fleas, if you need something more potent, you could try a special flea and tick shampoo. Read the shampoo label carefully to determine the proper way to use the shampoo for your dog.
Soak you dog with warm water and rub the flea shampoo into its fur.
Let the shampoo sit on the dog's coat for at least 10 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.
Flea shampoos usually contain pyrethrins, a type of chemical used to kill fleas.
Flea shampoos kill fleas and ticks that are already on the dog.;
, Flea and tick sprays are available in both aerosol and pump bottle forms.


For best results, choose a spray that contains an adulticide and an insect growth regulator. Doing so will ensure that both adult fleas and their eggs are killed.
Follow your veterinarian's instructions and the instructions on the label for proper use.
Spray in a well-ventilated area and avoid getting the spray in your dog's eyes.
Wear gloves while administering the spray to protect yourself.
When spraying sensitive areas, such as the face, spray the product onto your glove and rub it on the dog rather than risking spraying in the dog’s eyes, mouth, or ears., A flea powder is can usually be purchase without a veterinarian's prescription and works in the same way that a spray works.Read the instructions on the label to determine proper use. If you are uncertain about anything, ask your veterinarian before applying the powder to your dog.
Usually, you apply a powder by dusting a fine layer over your dog's coat and letting it sit undisturbed. Note, however, that powders tend to make the coat feel gritty and need to be reapplied often.
Begin at the dog’s head and work back towards the tail, ensuring that the powder gets all the way to the dog’s skin.Also sprinkle the powder on the dog’s bedding.
Repeat once per week if necessary., Dips and rinses should be applied to your dog's coat after flea infestation has started.


Mix the dip or rinse as directed by the package label. Ask your veterinarian for further instructions.
A dip, also referred to as a flea bath, requires you to soak your dog in a diluted, medicated solution. A rinse is a medicated solution that you pour over your dog's coat until it is soaked. Apply both to the entire dog, and do not attempt to use as spot treatments.
Use dips and rinses in well-ventilated areas.
Most flea dips should be left on your dog, not rinsed away.These products usually contain chemicals known as pyrethrins, permethrins, and organophosphates.

, Flea collars vary greatly in quality, and many of them have a limited range of activity, only killing fleas that are near the collar (around the dog’s head and shoulders). However, high-quality flea collars can help repel or kill fleas when used properly. Be sure to select a collar that is appropriate for your dog’s age and weight.


Slip two fingers under the collar to determine if it is snug enough without being too tight.
Cut off any excess length from the collar after you put it around the dog's neck. Do not let the dog chew on the end of the collar.
Familiarize yourself with the label instructions so that you know how long the collar should last and what to avoid. Some collars become less effective when wet.
Monitor the dog's neck beneath the collar and remove the product if its skin becomes irritated.

Make and administer parsley water.",How to Treat Dog Worms With Food and Herbs1," These two herbs are great for preventing and expelling round- and whipworms. They also have many other health benefits as well, not the least of which are their ability to calm and act as an anti-inflammatory.


Use a ¼ teaspoon of tincture directly into the mouth per 30 pounds every few hours. If you brew your own tea, use 1T every few hours.
If you brew your own, make it strong: 4 tea bags (or 2T bulk flowers) to each cup of boiling water.
Chamomile is non-toxic so you can give this to your pup fairly liberally without fear of side effects.;
, This ancient herb’s anti-parasitic properties are fortified by the fact that it also provides an environment that is not conducive to their growth while also healing worm-infested areas in your dog’s digestive track.Administer 1/8 to ¼ teaspoon per 10 pounds of weight every day. Make sure that your furry friend drinks plenty of water too so that it doesn’t get constipated.
Take once a day, after meals, for 1 week. Then for large dogs, administer it after meals daily every other week for two months.
Long-term usage can be harmful so do not go over the two-month limit.

, While their effectiveness is amplified when used in combination with other methods (e.g. wormwood or black walnut), cloves taken daily after meals can help eliminate those pesky worms.For small dogs, use ¼ of a whole dry clove crushed and mixed into food 1 x daily for one week. Skip a week, then repeat the same dosage formula for the third week.
For medium size dogs, use ½ of a whole dry clove and repeat the same dosage formula as that of small dogs.
For large dogs use 1 whole dry clove and repeat the dosage formula as that of small dogs.

, Made from the hull of the black walnut tree, this herb is excellent for eliminating heart and intestinal worms. While it is safer than most commercial de-wormers, it can be toxic if overused so great care must be taken. Think of it as your next-to-last resort herbal treatment.As the tannins and alkaloids may be dangerous to your pooch, please be certain to consult your veterinarian for use and dosage amounts.

, There are sites that will recommend this herb but be very, very careful. Known to have serious negative effects on a dog’s nervous system, liver and kidneys, this should only be used under the direct supervision of a veterinarian., This helps keep your dog’s digestive system happy and healthy during the de-worming process. Parsley is full of nutrients and also acts as a diuretic to help flush out all those worms that are desperately hanging on.


Boil 1 quart of water and add one bunch of fresh parsley. Reduce heat and let simmer for 3 minutes. Strain, jar, and refrigerate the parsley water. Administer 1 T per 10 lbs of body weight once a day for 10 days.For dogs with renal issues, substitute Rooibos tea for parsley. Known to support the immune system and inhibit cancer and other diseases, Rooibos has zero tannin and is much healthier for dogs suffering from renal issues.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Diagnose the ailment.,
Treat the disease.",How to Identify Canine Tick Problems2," If you believe your dog has contracted a tick-borne illness, take him to the vet. When you remove a tick from your dog, make sure to watch him closely for any of the symptoms of tick-borne diseases. If your dog has been bitten by many ticks, consider taking him to the vet just to be safe., Diagnosing a canine tick problem is based upon a few factors. A complete examination of the dog will be done, generally including a blood test. He may also do a scrape of infected skin areas.Depending on what the vet finds, he will follow up with various tests. The vet will probably ask about recent activities, like if you and your dog have recently visited woods or been other places outside.Typically a complete blood count will be done, along with in-house testing that is specific for some of these diseases, like Lyme, Ehrlichiosis, and Anaplasmosis.
Veterinarians may also find signs of the parasite in the blood or blood cells when they look at a sample under the microscope.

, Each disease has its own specific treatment that your vet will recommend. However, in general the tick borne diseases will respond to antibiotics, like doxycycline or tetracycline.In some cases, anti-inflammatory drugs will be administered.Some diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, requires hospitalization.If other conditions are present, the veterinarian will treat them as well.
Some dogs with low blood counts may need blood transfusions, IV fluid treatments, and hospitalization in order to survive the illness.

Take caution in areas prone to ticks.,
Check your dog for ticks.,
Use a tick preventative product.",How to Identify Canine Tick Problems3," You want to do your best to prevent your dog from being bitten by a tick in the first place. Be careful when you take your dog outside in areas with high concentrations of ticks. You can also check online for maps of the areas with the most concentrations of tick-borne diseases.You may want to avoid taking your dog into densely wooded areas or into underbrush if your area has a lot of ticks or tick-borne diseases.
Ticks are most active during the summer, so take caution during warmer months.

, Check your dog every day for ticks, especially after going outside or into wooded areas. To check your dog for ticks, use your fingers to feel along the skin. Ticks may feel like bumps around the size of a pea.If you find one, carefully remove it.


Long-haired dogs can hide ticks better than short-haired dogs. Check your long-haired dogs carefully.
Ticks like to attack to the skin in dark, warm spots. That means check your dog's ears, groin, buttocks, armpits, and between the toes., There are a number products available to help prevent ticks from latching onto your dog’s skin. These include:Once a month topicals. These products are placed directly on the skin and last for up to one month. BioSpot and Frontline are examples of these products.
Tick collars. These can be placed around the dog’s neck to repel ticks and prevent attachment. Preventic is an example of an effective tick collar.
Powders and sprays. These are applied to the entire body to give control of ticks. You must be careful not to get these products in the dog’s eyes, nose, or mouth. You will want to protect your skin, eyes, and mouth as well while applying the product.
Dips, rinses, or shampoos. These products require you to bathe your dog in the product in order to be effective. Dips and rinses are not washed off, but shampoos are after bathing.
Not all dogs bitten by ticks will get a disease even if the tick that bites them transmits the disease to the dog. It is not known why some dogs get the disease while some seem to not be affected by it. Even dogs which test positive for having had the disease at some point without showing any symptoms will not come down with any apparent illness.

Spread out cedar chips.,
Maintain a clean yard.,
Keep your lawn dry.,
Check your pet for fleas.,
Visit the vet.,
Make sure your home is flea-free.",How to Get Rid of Fleas in an Outside Dog Kennel2," Fleas hate the small of cedar chips and tend to steer clear of them. To keep these parasites at bay, spread cedar chips around the perimeter your dog’s kennel, as well as in damp corners of the yard where fleas would thrive. For added protection, sprinkle them around the fence in your yard and near outdoor furniture.Mow over cedar chips to turn them into a fine powder that will ward off fleas.Cedar is non-toxic for dogs and only a danger as a choking hazard (i.e. if big pieces are swallowed by a dog).

, Fleas thrive in shrubs, trees, and leaves (as opposed to open grass). Keep your yard clean by mowing the lawn, raking leaves, and trimming shrubs and tree branches regularly. Toys (belonging to pets or kids) should be stored away when they are no longer being played with, not left lying in the yard.In particular, be sure that the area surrounding your outdoor kennel is as clear as possible of fallen leaves and foliage.

, Fleas like moisture, so keep them at bay by making sure your lawn stays dry. Avoid over-watering your lawn - as a general rule, grass needs 3/4"" - 1"" of water each week to stay green and healthy. Use a rain gauge to measure how much water your grass is getting.The water that your grass gets counts whether it's from a sprinkler or from a rain fall, so adjust your watering in accordance with the weather.

, To prevent fleas from returning to your dog’s kennel, make sure that your dog is free from infestation itself. Watch your dog for signs of scratching, and check for tiny dark specks in its fur. Watch out for dark brown-black insects, which can sometimes be seen moving on your pet’s skin.If you have difficulty determining whether or not your dog has fleas, try running a fine comb through its fur, close to the skin, and tap the comb onto a white piece of paper. Fleas will be visible if present.

, Bring your pet to the veterinarian for advice on the best way to treat your dog's fleas. Let the vet examine your pet to examine the extent of the infestation. Ask about topical treatments and medications, if necessary., To fully eradicate your flea problem you must eliminate these pests in all areas of your home; your dog can easily transport fleas from indoors to its outdoor kennel, and vice versa. Take all measures necessary to rid your home of fleas and keep it flea-free. This undertaking will include:


Washing all bedding, towels, and clothing
Vacuuming carpets and upholstery thoroughly
Mopping floors
Using a dehumidifier to prevent dampness and moisture

Apply a monthly topical.Monthly topical treatments are among the most effective and most popular type of preventative flea medication for dogs.,
Feed your dog a monthly flea tablet.",How to Kill Fleas on Dogs2,"


You will need a veterinarian's prescription for most of these topical or ""spot on"" treatments.
Apply a few drops or a small pre-measured vial of the flea medication where it tells you to. Some medicines tell you to apply between your dog's shoulder blades while others ask you to apply it in several different locations. Get the medication directly on your dog's skin and not on its coat.
This medication kills adult fleas that land on the dog or bite the dog. It is usually effective for one month.
Some products are also able to kill eggs, but not all products do so.
The medication should be applied monthly on a year-round basis. If you live in an area that regularly reaches the freezing point during winter, however, you might be able to use the product less frequently during these colder weather months, since fleas will be inactive.

, Ask your veterinarian about preventative tablets that you can administer to your dog on a monthly basis.


Feed the pill to your dog once a month during a meal.
Your veterinarian will need to prescribe the correct dosage to your dog based on its weight.
When a female flea bites the dog after treatment, it ingests a chemical known as lufenuron. This gets passed to the eggs and prevents them from hatching. (It does not, however, kill the adult flea, so the results may take some time to see).
As with any treatment, it's worth keeping an eye on how your dog reacts. Look at the place you put the treatment to make sure there is no reaction and do not use it again if the dog's skin goes red or sore.

Wash your dog.,
Comb your dog with a special flea comb.,
Repel fleas with lemon juice.,
Treat your dog with apple cider vinegar.,
Try brewer's yeast.,
Prepare a rosemary flea dip.,
Apply lavender essential oil.",How to Kill Fleas on Dogs3," Oftentimes, washing your dog with warm water and a mild liquid dish soap or a simple dog shampoo will kill most if not all fleas on the dog.This treatment is best done to treat mild to moderate flea outbreaks, but it may not be potent enough to kill fleas in large numbers.
Only use a mild dish detergent free from added dyes and perfumes and safe for use on sensitive skin. Stop treatment if your dog has a bad reaction to the soap. Follow the use of dish soap with a conditioner made for dogs to counteract its drying effects.
Lather and rinse the dog once per week. Washing a dog more often (particularly with dish soap) can cause damage to the dog’s skin by drying him out.
Soap traps fleas and lifts them off the dog. Additionally, it disrupts the cell membranes of the fleas and removes their protective waxes. As a result, the flea can no longer retain water and dies from dehydration.

, You can use a comb sold specifically as a flea comb, but you could also use any fine-toothed comb with very small gaps in between the teeth.


Flea combs physically lift fleas out of your dog's coat.
Comb your dog from top to bottom. As you comb, make sure that the comb reaches the dog's skin. If you only comb the fur without reaching the skin, some fleas may remain even afterward.
You should immediately dip your flea comb into a bucket or dish of warm, soapy water once you remove a flea. This soapy concoction should be able to kill the fleas.

, Applying diluted lemon juice to your dog's fur should help kill or fleas. Use caution, however, that you do not over-dry your dog’s skin with the lemon.


Mix equal parts lemon juice and warm water in a shallow bowl.
Alternatively, you could cut a lemon into quarters and cover it with boiling water. Let the mixture steep for eight hours or overnight before straining the liquid into a bowl.
Dip a dog’s brush or comb into the lemon mixture and brush the dog, coating the fur with lemon through contact with the brush. Be sure to brush the dog thoroughly, dipping the brush in the mixture with every other stroke or so.
Repeat this procedure once daily for three days., The apple cider flea remedy can be given to your dog topically.Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Coat your dog with the repellant, spraying it all over the coat but focusing on areas where fleas are prone to gather, like behind the ears, at the base of the tail, and under the legs.
If you dog's skin becomes unusually dry or if you suspect that your dog is having a negative reaction to the vinegar, stop treatment immediately.

, Brewer's yeast is a natural preventative treatment and presents an alternative to harsher chemical remedies.There has been mixed evidence of its efficacy, but it seems as though active yeast has more of an effect on the number of fleas.Add a Brewer's yeast tablet to your dog's food once every day or two. Ask your veterinarian to determining the best dosage based on your dog's age and weight. Do not attempt to determine the dosage without approval from your veterinarian.
The Brewer's yeast eventually seeps into the dog's skin and gets excreted through the dog's pores. As a result, the skin and coat become less appealing to fleas, effectively repelling them.

, This approach has not been scientifically proven, but there is some anecdotal evidence that it may be effective in repelling fleas. Soak your dog with rosemary-infused water and let it dry naturally.


Steep 2 cups (500 ml) of fresh rosemary sprigs in boiling water for 30 minutes. Use enough water to cover the rosemary completely.
Strain the liquid and discard the leaves.
Add up to 1 gallon (4 L) of warm water to the rosemary water. Use less water for a small dog.
Let the temperature of the rosemary water cool slightly. It needs to be warm, but it should not be so hot that it burns your pet.
Pour the water over the dog, drenching him/her completely. Let air dry.

, This approach has not been scientifically proven, but there is some anecdotal evidence that it may be effective in repelling fleas. You only need to use a few drops of lavender oil in a few key places to take advantage of this effect.Wash your dog normally with warm water and soap. Dry the dog using a towel.
Apply a few drops of lavender essential oil to the base of the tail and a few at the back of the neck. Use your fingers to gently massage the oils into your dog's coat and skin.

These seeds are very potent and effective, particularly against tape- and hookworm.Grind up pumpkin seeds into a fine powder and add one teaspoon for each 10 – 15 lbs. of body weight daily. Do this for two weeks and then add wheat bran to the dog’s diet; soak the bran in water and add an eighth teaspoon per 10 lbs. of body weight to larger animals and just a pinch for smaller ones.
You can even feed the seeds to him directly as a treat. Just make sure you use the same measurement guidelines. Also be sure to use unsalted, organic pumpkin seeds.

, These incredibly healthy seeds have many positive effects on the bodies of both humans and dogs. Proven to fight 800 bacterial and viral strains, it also supports the immune system, fights cancer, and, in this instance, are a natural for killing, weakening, and repelling parasites.Grind up the seeds to a find powder.

, If your dogs will eat it, the flesh of the papaya is also rich in papain. You might want to use this in combination with another method – even the papaya seeds. That way they will get all the health benefits and not rely solely on a small amount of papaya to do the job.


There is a reason you only want to feed them a small amount. Feeding them a lot can lead to the same problems you can have with all fruits: too much in one end can lead to a loose result on the other.
Feed your best friend fresh or dried papaya. Try to make it organic though. That will have the most papain and be the healthiest option for your dog.

, Rich in the enzyme ficin, eating figs will destroy the worms’ outer coating and cause them to get weak and lose their hold on the intestinal wall. Same general fruit warning: too much of a good thing can lead to too much of a bad thing. Feed your dog dried figs in moderation. One or two as a treat after meals is fine."

Grate fresh garlic.,
Add food grade diatomaceous earth (DTE).,
Drip Oregon grape tincture in their mouths.,
Cleanse their digestive systems.",How to Treat Dog Worms With Food and Herbs3," The use of garlic for pets is very controversial, and some researchers warn of its potential to damage red blood cells in dogs. Do your research before trying it, and err on the side of small amounts. Long known for its immune system benefits for humans, garlic may also be a good option for expelling worms while boosting the overall effectiveness of your dog’s immune system. Grated and combined with fennel, garlic can get rid of worms quickly and efficiently. As always, be careful not to overdo it.


Grate 1-2 cloves and let sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to allow enzyme changes that create allicin. Mix with and equal amount of fennel and administer at feeding time (generally twice a day).If you have a tiny dog, use a very small clove. Adjust the number and size of cloves to match the size and weight of your dog.

, Food grade DTE is a talcum-looking powder that consists of fossilized marine phytoplankton. Their microscopic, razor-like edges slice and scrape, dehydrating parasites (i.e. worms) and thus killing them.For small dogs, sprinkle 1t on their food once daily. For dogs over 55 pounds, sprinkle 1T on their food once daily. Make sure you mix it well as it is so dusty that inhaling it can cause irritation in your pooch’s respiratory system.

, The root of this plant is used for a variety of health-related applications and has been scientifically proved to be effective against parasitic worms. This is due to the presence of berberine, an anti-microbial alkaloid. You can get this at your local health food store (it may be labeled as an extract).Administer 12 drops per 20 pounds OBW.
Do not use with diabetic animals, those with acute liver disease, or those that are pregnant or nursing.

, While you’re eliminating worms from your furry friend it’s important to keep in mind foods that, while not qualifying as cures, greatly assist in getting rid of the parasites while simultaneously enhancing your dog’s overall health. Feeding them these foods will help heal their insides while promoting a healthy immune system as well.


Carrots, beets, and turnips. ½ T per day of these root vegetables will scrape the mucus lining of the intestines in a healthy, safe way (worms live in the mucus). The vegetables are neither digested nor absorbed and do not change in pH balance. In combination with a de-worming cure, they help flush away the detritus and return your dog’s digestive system to a healthy, happy state.

The most obvious sign is when you spot little segments of the worm - almost like grains of rice - around your pet's anus or in its fecal matter. Sometimes, behavioral clues might tip you off. If your dog seems to be dragging its butt on the carpet more frequently, you may want to check for tapeworms. It is possible that the dog's anus is irritated - hence, why it would rub its rear-end on the floor. Anemia occurs on rare occasions too., The veterinarian may want to verify the presence of tapeworms before a prescription is given to you. The best way to do this is to take a plastic bag and to collect a specimen. Don’t make physical contact with the worm. Just scoop it up and put it in a bag. In other cases, you might have to pick the worm segment off of your dog’s rear-end. Otherwise, your veterinarian may ask to keep your pet for a couple of hours to collect a specimen for himself., They'll either insist you come in for a check-up, prescribe you a medication over the phone, or direct you to an over-the-counter medication sold at most pets supply stores. There are a variety of medications — most of which use praziquantel — to combat these little wormy parasites. The most common medications are Droncit, Drontal Plus, and Tradewinds Tapeworm Tabs. These can be found at vet clinics and some pet superstores.Your vet will know exactly which treatment will best eliminate tapeworms. Depending on your pet, your pet’s size, and your pet’s age, your vet will take differed medicinal approaches.If you purchase a dewormer at a pet supply store, be sure to follow the directions methodically.
Most treatments are given orally, but there are injections and topical treatments too.

, All of these medications will have age and size specifications that you’ll need to follow. For example, most medicines cannot be used on young kittens (less than 8 weeks) or kittens under 2.2. lbs., Regardless of whether you are using a pill, liquid, or topical treatment, you’ll want to have the medicine ready in hand. If your pet is reluctant to receive any of these treatments, your job will be infinitely harder if you don't have the medicine ready.

, This can be done in a variety of ways and depending on the size of your pet, you may need another set of hands. Start by cornering in its hind legs. Your pet will most likely try to back out of whatever situation they are in. If they cannot, they’ll be easier to contain. Hold its head with one hand and have the other prepared to administer the medicine.If you are using an oral medication, place your pointer finger and thumb on either side of your pet's mouth and tilt its head backwards. This is the most effective way to get your pet’s mouth open to receive the medication., Now that you have your pet restrained, administer the medicine. Apply topical treatments according to the directions — most of the time on the back of your pet's head/neck, so it cannot mess with it once it has been applied. Insert the pill into the cat’s/dog’s mouth.


For oral medicines, you’ll want to close your pet’s mouth. Hold it closed for 5-10 seconds and rub the outside of its throat gently. This will spark the swallowing process.
Afterwards, make sure that the oral supplement has been swallowed. Dogs and cats will often spit it right back out. , Make this a pleasant experience for your furry friend. After all, it isn’t like it wanted to get tapeworms. Give it a treat. Pet your cat or dog profusely. If you do this, the next treatment will go easier, because your pet will associate the experience with tasty treats and love., Tapeworms must have an intermediate host, the flea, to complete their life-cycle and infest the next victim. Your pet gets tapeworms by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae or by eating a small mammal, usually a rodent that contains the worm. Flea control involves treatment of your pet, the indoor environment, and the outdoor environment where the pet resides. There are various sprays, foggers, and traps that you can purchase at most pet stores. Or you can have a pesticide professional come by and do it for you.If the pet lives in a flea-infested environment, reinfection with tapeworms may occur in as little as two weeks. Because the medication which treats tapeworm infection is so effective, return of the tapeworms is almost always due to reinfection from the environment., Consult your vet for specifics. Some medications, like Sentinel Spectrum, act broadly to protect against fleas, heartworms, hookworms, roundworms, and tapeworms., Since tapeworms begin their life cycle in your pet’s feces, take care of them from the start. Clean your cat’s litter box. Pick up after your dog outside. Dispose of your pet's waste carefully. Wear gloves. Use a disinfectant whenever possible. Put its waste into a plastic bag and dispose of it. Eventually the air will run out in the bag and the worms will suffocate. It is also just a public safety service. Don't spread your pet's tapeworms to other animals., Regular or anti-bacterial soap will help guard you from tapeworms. You don't want to inadvertently carry the tapeworm with you."

Remove feces promptly.,
Keep your dog away from other dog’s feces.,
Administer preventative medicine to your dog.",How to Prevent Whipworms in Dogs1," The removal of fresh feces is crucial to preventing infection. Fresh feces are not infectious because the eggs are not at the right stage to infect a host. Removing them immediately removes the potential source of infection before the eggs can embryonate. If left, eggs can shed from the feces and get into the soil or water, where they may pose an infection risk for years to come.Feces left on the ground may dissolve over time, but the whipworm eggs will be washed into the soil where they remain for years to come. If all dog owners acted in a responsible manner and cleared up after their dogs, this would go a long way to reducing the risks for the future.
You should remove feces from your own yard and when you take your dog walking. When you take your dog walking, remove feces as soon as your dog goes to the bathroom. This prevents any spread of infected eggs if your dog passes them.;
, Dogs become infected when they swallow embryonated eggs. They most commonly pick these up when they eat infected feces. When you take your dog walking, do not let him eat or get into another dog’s feces.If you take your dog to a dog park or other area where a lot of dogs may go, then don’t let your dog eat the soil. Dog’s can get whipworms by eating soil containing embryonated eggs.
You should also prevent your dog from drinking contaminated water.
Once whipworm gets into the soil, it is very difficult to remove it. The only solutions to get rid of them are to completely avoid the area or to remove that layer of soil and replace with new.

, A dog can have whipworm, yet even screening fecal tests aren't guaranteed to pick up infection. While a positive screen confirms a whipworm infection, a negative cannot rule it out. Routine deworming is advisable for all dogs. A minimum of once yearly worming against whipworm is advised, but giving your dog deworming medication every three months to prevent active infections from occurring is recommended.Many products that are effective against other parasites, such as heartworms, may also be effective against whipworm.
The products effective against whipworms need to be prescribed by your vet, so if you are using an over-the-counter dewormer, it is unlikely to be effective against whipworm. The product needs to contain one of these active ingredients in order to work: Milbemycin, moxidectin, praziquantel, or fenbendazole. Products that are effective against whipworm include Drontal Plus, Panacur, Interceptor, Sentinel, Sentinel Spectrum, Advantage Multi, Trifexis.
A false negative could occur if the dog was infected less than 90 days ago and the larvae have not yet matured into adults or the adult worms are not excreting eggs on the day the sample was taken.

Ensure that your dog has a nutritious diet that meets all of its needs.",How to Prevent Ringworm in Dogs," Ringworm is also known as dermatophytosis. It is not a worm but an infection of the skin, hair or claws of the dog, caused by a fungus. The fungus spreads easily through contact with an infected dog, its broken hairs or objects that the dog has come into contact with; it can also infect humans.Dogs are very susceptible to getting ringworm, especially if they are puppies, immuno-suppressed, taking corticosteroids, infested with fleas or mites, have a genetic proclivity or they are in a place with many dogs.;
, Look for lesions on the dog's skin. Infection is most common on the dog's head, ears, tail and front paws, but any part of the body can be infected by ringworm.The following signs indicate that the dog might have ringworm:An early infection will appear pinkish in color and you'll likely notice scaly skin pieces around the area and across the dog's body. Hair around the lesion turns brittle and breaks off easily.
A well-established infection will show round lesions, and the skin will cover the lesion and look scaly and grey.
Consider other possible signs. These standard signs tend to vary. You may also see patches on the skin that look as if someone has shaved the dog. Or, you may see bumpiness, pustules, inflammation, a poor coat, or crustiness., You can use a hairbrush on the dog's hair. Place the dog over white paper, then brush the dog. If the dog has ringworm, fungal particles will be obvious on the white paper.


It is recommended that you take your dog to the vet for professional advice and prescription medicine (topical and oral therapies)., If you know that a dog, cat or other pet has ringworm, separate any infected animal from the dog or dogs that do not have it. This quarantine will need to be maintained strictly, along with strictly regular cleaning and hygiene, and treatment of the infected pet(s).


If your neighbor's pets have ringworm, talk to your neighbor about preventing contact with your pets.

, This includes:


Regularly disinfecting the kennel, crate or other housing arrangement for the dog. However, be careful about the type of disinfectant you use, as some do not kill the fungal spores. Ones that do work include benzalkonium chloride, diluted (1:10) bleach and strong detergents.Washing bedding on at least a weekly basis. Use hot water if possible, and line dry in direct sunshine or a hot setting of the dryer.
Vacuum all areas likely to be affected by a ringworm infection, both during and after an infection, and as a precautionary measure. Dispose of the vacuumed contents in the outside trash can, in an enclosed bag.
Keep food and water bowls clean.
Giving consideration to keeping the dog only in rooms that are easy to clean. This will minimize environmental contamination if an infection does start., If your dog has been infected, keep it quarantined from other dogs for about six weeks.This includes doggy daycare, dog shows and spending time with the neighbor's dogs. This works the other way around; if your neighbor's dogs have been infected, keep your dog well away for six weeks after treatment.

, Wash your dog regularly with an appropriate dog shampoo and ensure that the dog dries properly.


If you don't like cleaning the dog, invest in regular dog grooming sessions.

, A healthy dog is less likely to get ringworm.

Clean your dog's living area on a regular basis to remove feces and other waste materials.,
Clean kennel runs often.,
Steer clear of animal feces when you go for walks with your dog.",How to Prevent Worms in Dogs1," Dogs may become infected with worms from old feces that remains in your backyard. Use a poop scooper to clean up your dog’s feces every day. Do not allow it to build up or it may pose a health hazard to your dog.Wash your dog's bedding at least once per week as well. Doing so will help to prevent fleas and other pests from breeding in your dog's blankets or bed.;
, Keeping your dog’s play area or kennel run very clean is one of the best ways to prevent hookworms. Hookworms live in soil and may either get into a dog through the skin on his feet or get ingested by the dog while he is grooming his feet.If you have a concrete kennel for your dog, clean it with a solution of bleach diluted in water. Use one part bleach to 32 parts water.In severe cases of hookworm infestation in grass runs, you may want to consider treating the area with sodium borate. Just keep in mind that the sodium borate will kill the grass along with the worms.

, Dogs like to walk with their noses to the ground and sniff for other animals. Unfortunately, they sniff feces and urine of other animals and may come in contact with parasites. If you notice any feces in your path, steer your dog away from it.


Keep your dog away from other dogs or cats that may be infected with worms. If you encounter an unfamiliar dog or cat during a walk, keep your dog away from it."

With a mild infection, the dog may not show any signs of ill health. With a more severe infection, the worms damage the wall of the large intestine as they suck blood, leading to inflammation. This can present as diarrhea, or feces streaked with blood and containing mucus.In the worst cases, the dog may hemorrhage and die from dehydration and blood loss.
The parasite infects the large intestine, which is distant from the stomach, so vomiting because of this parasite is rare.

, If you think your dog has whipworms, take him to the vet. The vet can take a stool sample and check it for whipworm eggs. If your dog has whipworms, your vet can prescribe a medicine that will kill the parasites.The medicine your vet prescribes is more effective at killing whipworms than medications you can buy in the store.
Even if your dog doesn’t have whipworms, your vet may give him dewormer medicine just in case.
You should take your dog to the vet annually to check for parasites, such as whipworms.

, A dog gets whipworms by ingesting whipworm eggs. The eggs have to be at a certain stage of development inside the egg for the dog to get infected. This means that eggs in fresh feces are not infectious. Instead, it takes a delay of around nine to 21 days to embryonate and become infectious.Eggs are extremely tough and can survive in the environment for years, despite extremes of temperature such as freezing.

, Once your dog becomes infected by ingesting an infected egg, the embryonated eggs hatch inside the dog's gut and become larvae. These larvae burrow deep into the mucosal lining of the bowel, and eventually mature into adult whipworms.This process can take 74 to 90 days. Prior to this time, the dog may test negative for whipworm, despite being infected, since the worms are not mature enough to shed eggs.

Control any infestations of mice or rats in the area with the appropriate bait and traps.,
Get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes may breed.,
Keep slugs and snails out of your dog’s yard area.,
Consider hiring an exterminator if you cannot eliminate pests yourself.",How to Prevent Worms in Dogs2," Tapeworms use mice and rats as hosts until they can find a larger host, such as a dog. If your dog eats an infected mouse or rat, then your dog may become infected with any tapeworms or other parasites that rodent was carrying., The only way for a dog to get heartworms is from the bite of an infected mosquito, so it is important to reduce your dog's exposure to mosquitoes.Mosquitoes pick up heartworms when they bite an infected dog, fox, coyote, or wolf, then they transmit the heartworms to the next dog or dogs that they bite.Get rid of any stagnant water that may serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes in your dog’s outdoor area.

, Snails and slugs can also infect your dog with lungworms, so do your best to keep snails and slugs out of your dog’s yard area. Do not allow your dog to eat snails or slugs because this is one of the main ways that dogs get infected. Clean up your dog’s toys at the end of the day as well because slugs and snails may leave slime trails on dog toys, which may cause your dog to be infected with lungworms.It is difficult to diagnose lungworms, but if your dog experiences respiratory problems such as trouble breathing or frequent coughing, or experiences weight loss, have your veterinarian check your dog for lungworms.

, If you are having trouble controlling the pests in your dog's outdoor area, you may want to consider hiring a professional exterminator to take care of the problem.


Keep in mind that repeated treatments may be necessary to take care of the pest problem and this can be quite expensive. Ask for an inspection and estimate before you decide to have your yard treated with pesticides.While the area is being treated, you will need to keep your dog inside. Ask the exterminator when it will be safe for your dog to go outside again.

Give your dog a monthly flea prevention medicine.,
Talk to your veterinarian about a de-worming plan for your dog.,
Use a veterinarian-approved insecticide spray or powder to help control fleas in your home.,
Ask your veterinarian for help treating a pregnant dog for worms.,
Become familiar with worms that may infect your dog.,
Learn about treatment options.",How to Prevent Worms in Dogs3," Infected fleas may give your dog tapeworms, so it is crucial to take steps to prevent your dog from getting fleas. You can purchase flea medicine online or in pet stores, but you may want to discuss flea medicine options with your veterinarian as well. Your veterinarian may be able to make recommendations based on your pet’s health history., Whether you have a new puppy or an adult dog, you should ask your veterinarian about heartworm testing and prevention medications. Heartworms cause serious health complications for your dog such as bleeding, trouble breathing, and heart failure. That is why it is so important to prevent heartworms and get immediate treatment if you suspect that your dog may have heartworms.Popular de-worming medications include Panacur, Drontal, and Milbemax. Ask your veterinarian about these and other de-worming medications to treat and protect your dog.
Remember that different dewormers kill different worms, and not all products kill all worm types.

, If your home is infested with fleas, then you will need to use some sort of spray or powder to get rid of them. Check with your veterinarian for recommendations or look for products that that labeled as pet safe.Do not use anything that may harm your dog if she comes in contact with it.

, Some worms, such as hookworms and ringworms, may be passed on from the mother dog to her babies in the womb or through her milk. Therefore, it is important to treat pregnant or nursing mother dogs for worms.Talk to your veterinarian to find the safest option for de-worming a pregnant or nursing dog.

, As you work with your veterinarian to protect your dog from worms, it may also help you to learn about some of the different types of worms that may infect your dog. The most common types of worms in dogs include:


Roundworms: Roundworms are long round worms which look a bit like string, noodles, or spaghetti. Roundworms are quite common and they pose a health risk to people, so it is important to control them. Most dogs are born with roundworms because the eggs cross the placenta when the puppy is in the womb. Puppies can also get roundworms from their mother’s milk. Roundworm eggs can even lay dormant in a dog for years before hatching. Roundworm eggs can also survive in the soil for months or even years. The eggs get into the soil from infected feces. Tapeworms: Dogs most often get tapeworms by eating a flea that is infected with tapeworms (such as when the dog grooms and swallows a flea) or from eating vermin contaminated with tapeworms.Heartworm: Heartworm is transmitted by mosquitoes. A bite from an infected mosquito is the only way that dogs can get heartworm.Hookworms: Dogs may become infected with hookworms from eating contaminated soil, or from larvae that go through the skin in the dog's paws. Hookworm infections are more common in warm, humid places. Hookworms may also be passed to puppies across the placenta or in a mother dog’s milk.Lungworm: Lungworm is a fox parasite that sometimes infects dogs. Dogs may become infected with lungworm after contact with infected fox feces, eating infected slugs or snails, or by coming into contact with the slime trail left behind by infected slugs and snails., Part of preventing worm infections is to clear the existing infestation with anthelmintics (drugs that kill worms). This ensures your dog is worm free and also reduces the shedding of eggs and larvae into the environment, which may infect your dog in the future. Make sure that you discuss treatment options with your veterinarian before giving anything to your dog. Giving your dog too much medicine may cause severe side effects.


Roundworms: Many products are effective at killing adult roundworms. The product most widely used for puppies is Panacur (fenbendazole) which can also be given to pregnant and nursing dogs. Other products suitable for older pups and adult dogs include selamectin (Revolution spot on) and praziquantel/ pyrantel (Drontal Plus) and milbemycin/pyrantel (Milbemax).
Tapeworms: Tapeworms are a bit harder to treat because they do not respond to some chemicals. An effective de-wormer for tapeworm must contain pyrantel, so Drontal Plus or Milbemax (or equivalent) are ideal.
Heartworm: Treatment of heartworm must be administered under the supervision of your veterinarian because complications may be severe or even fatal.The drug used to kill off heartworms is called Immiticide and is from the arsenic family.Prevention is a much better option. Your veterinarian may recommend either a 6-monthly preventative injection or monthly at-home preventatives such as HeartGard, Iverhart, Revolution or Trifexis.Hookworms: Panacur, Nemex, Drontal Plus, Telmintic, and Vercom Paste are all effective treatments against hookworms.Lungworm: Lungworm can be treated with products from the ivermectin family of drugs such as Advocate (imidacloprid) spot on, milbemycin containing products (milbemax), and they are also sensitive to long courses of fenbendazole (Panacur).Check with your vet before starting treatment if you think your dog has a lungworm infection. Lungworms may cause fluid build-up in the lungs and pneumonia, which may further complicate your dog’s situation."

Keep an eye out for bouts of diarrhea.,
Look for signs of general poor health.,
Take your dog to its veterinarian.,
Bring a sample of your dog's feces with you to the veterinary office.,
Don't assume your dog is not infected if tests come back negative.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.,
Give preventative treatments regularly.,
Clean up dog feces in your yard or in areas that your dog frequents.,
Avoid reinfection.",How to Diagnose Whipworms in Dogs," Whipworm infection should be suspected for any dog that suffers regular episodes of diarrhea, especially watery, bloody diarrhea. The diarrhea is caused by the whipworms attaching to the intestine wall and


If the bloody diarrhea persists the dog is liable to become anemic, and signs of this include a lack of energy, and pale gums.;
, This includes pale gums and a lack of energy, due to the anemia caused by the whipworms. In addition, the dog's coat can become dull and the dog can lose weight, due to a lack of nutrition cause by an inability to digest its food normally., Any dog with persistent diarrhea, but especially bloody diarrhea, should see a vet. Call your veterinary office and tell them about the symptoms. They will tell you if you should bring your dog in right away and will give you an appointment to get your dog checked out.


If you notice the problem during a time when your veterinary office is closed, you will need to gauge your dog's health and make a decision whether you need to take it to an emergency veterinary hospital. Your veterinary office may have a number you can call to get advice during an emergency.

, If your dog has a history of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, and poor coat, then the vet will suggest a fecal flotation test. This involves submitting a sample of feces to the lab where they suspend the feces in special saline solution.Eggs float to the top where they can be captured and smeared onto a microscope slide for identification. The pathologist looks at the smear and identifies the characteristic lemon shaped egg of trichuris.

, The test for whipworms can come up with a false negative, yet it is currently the only diagnostic test. One problem of diagnosis is that signs of illness can become apparent before the adult worms start to shed eggs. This means that fecal sample tests can be falsely negative if the adult worms are present but they aren't yet at a stage in their life cycle where they produce eggs.


It takes around 11 weeks from a dog being infected with whipworm eggs, for those eggs to hatch and produce adults that produce eggs.However, prior to this the worms are developing in the bowel and damaging the bowel wall, producing symptoms.In addition, another complication is that the female adult worms don't shed eggs all the time, but intermittently. Thus, even if you have reproductively-mature female worms present there is an element of luck as to whether they are shedding eggs at the time the sample is taken., Because false negative results are common on a fecal flotation test, it is acceptable to try a 'diagnosis by treatment'. This means treating the dog with an anthelmintic medicine that is effective against whipworm, and if the symptoms resolve then the case is proven.Not all anthelmintics kill whipworm, so double check the product you use to make sure trichuris is within its spectrum of activity. These are mostly prescription products supplied by your vet,

, Because of the high risk of infection from eggs in the environment, it's important to keep your dog protected. Give regular repeat treatments every 3-4 months.The good news is that many, but not all, heartworm preventatives are also effective against whipworm.
The drugs effective against trichuris include fenbendazole (Panacur), Milbemycin (Interceptor, Milbemax, Sentinel), imidacloprid / moxidectin (Advantage), and Febantel / pyrantel / praziquantel (Drontal Plus), It's important to practice good hygiene in your home and yard in order to limit your dog's exposure to this infection. It's particularly important to remove the feces of other dogs in areas that your dog frequents.The infection is easily passed from dog to dog through the ingestion of infected feces.

, Just because your dog has had an infection, and has been treated for it, doesn't mean the dog can't be easily reinfected. Part of the difficulty of dealing with whipworm infections is that the eggs are particularly hardy and can survive in the environment (even in concrete runs) for up to 5 years, making reinfection common.In order to limit this, clean your home and yard top to bottom after your dog has been diagnosed. Remove all feces from your yard. Wash all linens and wash down all solid outdoor areas with bleach water."

Apply preventative products.,
Clean the environment.,
Get regular a fecal screens.",How to Prevent Roundworms in Dogs1," One way to help prevent roundworms is to use a product on your dog that is specifically designed to prevent infection. Adult dogs should be treated against roundworms at least four times a year. There are numerous effective products, ranging from powders, liquids, tablets, and spot on products.Many of the heartworm preventatives are also effective against roundworms, so check the packaging to see if it lists Toxocara species as one of the parasites it kills. You can ask your vet to recommend a product or choose one from a pet store.
Treating the pregnant mother with fenbendazole during pregnancy can stop her shedding larvae via the placenta and milk, which reduces the infection risk to her puppies. She should be given the dose for her pre-pregnant weight, starting from day 40 of the pregnancy and given daily until two days after whelping.Fenbendazole is safe for puppies. They should be treated from two weeks of age, every two weeks until eight weeks of age, then again at 12 weeks. Then ongoing treatment should be with a good worming product monthly until six months of age. After that, an adult regime is used.;
, Feces containing worm eggs are not infectious straight away. It takes several days for the eggs to activate, so prompt removal of feces as soon as they are passed can eliminate environmental infection.If your dog or puppy messes inside, prompt cleaning helps remove any risk of infection.


Feces can contain other infectious agents, so wiping a surface over with a diluted bleach is also advised. To make a bleach solution, mix 10 parts of water to one part bleach.

, To help keep your dog roundworm free, keep a check on whether your pet has contracted the parasite. During regular vet checkups, the vet can take fecal samples to check if the deworming product you are using is effective.Typically four screenings are required in the first year of life, and then two a year thereafter.

Look for a swollen abdomen.,
Check for signs of malnutrition.,
Monitor for digestive issues.,
Check for weight loss.",How to Prevent Roundworms in Dogs2," The adult roundworm lives in the dog's intestine where it soaks up nutrition from the partially digested food. The roundworm takes up space, and this causes the dog to have a pot belly appearance.Your dog also might some pain in the abdomen.

, Because the roundworm is taking part of the dog’s nutrition, your dog is not getting all of the nutrients he needs. This means he may start displaying signs of poor nutrition. The loss of nutrients might lead to the dog's coat being dull and harsh. He may also develop skin conditions.Additionally, puppies may grow poorly as a result of beggin robbed of nutrition.

, Roundworms may cause digestive distress for your dog. If the worm burden is especially heavy, the dog may vomit up worms. This may look like white spaghetti. The irritation to the gut lining can also cause diarrhea.In severe cases, the mass of worms can cause an intestinal blockage which could rupture the gut and prove fatal., Because the roundworm is feeding on your dog’s nutrients, he may not be getting what he needs. This can lead to weight loss. Look for signs of any weight loss in your dog, especially if his eating habits have not changed. He may also stop eating as much due to loss of appetite.Coupled with this, your dog may become weaker or start acting lethargic.

Learn how a dog acquires roundworms.",How to Prevent Roundworms in Dogs3," If you suspect your dog has roundworm, take him to the vet. During an exam, your vet can check to see if your dog has roundworm. The vet can screen fecal samples to check for eggs or other signs of the parasite.This is a quick test that is done without putting your dog to sleep.
You should take your dog back to the vet after treating the roundworm for another fecal sample to ensure that the roundworms are gone.

, If your dog has roundworms, your vet will give you a deworming pill that will get rid of the roundworm. Because the medicine won’t kill the eggs, you will have to treat the dog again in about four weeks to get any newly hatched roundworms.You can buy deworming products at pet stores or supercenters. Make sure to read the directions carefully and administer the medicine as described. Deworming medication can harm your dog if used incorrectly., The roundworm life cycle is a complex one and there are several opportunities within that life cycle for the dog to acquire infection.Dogs are at risk from roundworm eggs passed in feces. These eggs have a tough outer shell and can survive in the environment for months or even years. Thus, the feces may have been washed away by rain, but the roundworm eggs survive in the soil.Vermin that have accidentally acquired a roundworm infection can also spread them. The parasite cannot complete its life cycle in mice and rats, but the larvae can lie dormant in their bodies, ready and waiting to be activated when a dog eats them.A puppy in the womb may be infected by a migration of larvae across the placenta into his body. These larvae then lie dormant in the fetus's body tissue, ready to hatch out over his lifetime. Hence, the puppies are born already infected with roundworms.Once puppies are born, they can also be infected from larvae present in the mother's milk."

Understand how hookworms infect dogs.,
Figure out why hookworms are bad for your dog.",How to Diagnose Hookworms in Dogs," A hookworm bites into the bowel wall, which can cause pain and stomach cramps. The dog is also likely to have diarrhea that is tinged with blood.Also, if there is bleeding into the bowel, by the time the blood have passed along the gut it gives the feces a dark color.
Some dogs may also vomit from hookworms, and this could contain blood as well.;
, The blood lost into the bowel, or consumed by hookworms, can cause anemia in the host. This blood loss causes the dog to lack energy and seem extremely tired. The anemia can also become life threatening in cases of hookworm that are left untreated.If you lift a healthy dog's lip, the mucous membrane lining the mouth should be a healthy pink color. However, in an anemic dog the gums are a pale pink or even a white color.

, In puppies with a heavy infection, the hookworms rob the puppy of nutrition. This causes the pup to grow poorly and its coat is likely to have a dull, harsh texture and color.However, puppies can have stunted growth for a variety of reasons. If your puppy does not seem to be growing in size, take it to its veterinarian to get checked out.

, The larvae migrate to the lungs where they are coughed up and swallowed down into the gut to mature. Therefore you may notice your dog has an intermittent cough.

, A dog that was kept in unsanitary conditions may have been subject to larvae migrating through the skin of its paws. This causes intense irritation, so the dog is liable to chew and bite at its feet.Remember, though, that this is not the only way that hookworms enter the body, so a dog infected with them will not necessarily have irritated feet.

, Puppies should be treated for worms starting at two weeks old, with additional doses every two weeks for two months.If your puppy has not gotten these treatments then it is more likely that it has worms.


If you got your puppy from a good animal rescue or humane society, they should have at least begun its deworming.
If you got your dog from an unverified source, such as from an online want-ad listing, then it may not have had any deworming treatments and is at risk of infection.

, If you notice some of the signs of a hookworm infection then you should get your dog checked out by a vet. The vet will perform a thorough physical examination to assess the patient, paying attention to what symptoms the dog has and how severe they are.

, If the veterinarian suspects a hookworm infection, a diagnosis can be confirmed on a fecal flotation test. This is a special test where a sample of feces is mixed with a special solution and the hookworms eggs float to the surface. This is because the hookworm eggs are less dense than the fluid and the feces.A clean microscope slide is then touched to the surface of the special solution and any eggs present stick to the slide. This is then examined under the microscope for the presence of hookworm eggs.
This test is liable to detect a positive hookworm infection because hookworms pass large numbers of eggs that are shed regularly.
The only time it is less reliable is in very young pups when the larvae have yet to mature into the adult form and therefore no eggs have been produced. This usually takes around 2 weeks, so if one negative test was obtained, a second test 2 - 3 weeks later should prove positive if the pup is infected.

, The good news is that hookworms can be killed with a wide variety of deworming medications. However, these are only effective against adult worms, so it is a good idea to repeat dose the dogs 2 - 4 weeks after the initial dose.Because of the greater risk of puppies being infected, it is advisable to treat them at 2,4,6, and 8 weeks of age with a product suitable for use at this age, such as fenbendazole (Panacur or Safeguard)., The scientific name for hookworms is Ancylostoma. They are a small, almost microscopic worm, with the adults being a maximum of 3mm long. They are rarely noticeable in a dog's feces because of their small size, and because they grip tightly onto the bowel wall, so they are not passed in large numbers.Hookworms are commonly found throughout North America.The adult worms live in the host's small intestine where they anchor themselves to the gut wall with hook-like mouths. The appearance of their mouths under a microscope is why they are named hookworms.

, There are several ways that dogs can get hookworms. Dogs can be infected while they are growing in their mother's womb or are nursing, by licking contaminated feces, and through the skin of their paws.


Unfortunately, hookworm infection is prevalent in puppies. This happens because hookworm larvae that are dormant in the mother can become activated when she is pregnant, migrate to the uterus, and infect the puppies in the womb.
Also, the larvae migrate to the mammary glands where they are excreted in the mother's milk to infect the pups when they are suckling.Dogs can also be infected orally if they lick feces contaminated with hookworm eggs. This is likely to happen if groups of dogs are kept in dirty conditions or they walk through feces and then lick their paws clean.
Dogs can also be infected when larvae migrate through the skin on their paws. Again, this is caused by living in unhygienic conditions and being exposed to contaminated feces., Hookworms suck your dog's blood, leading to blood loss.One of the reasons that the blood loss is so extreme is because hookworms inject an anticoagulant through their mouths that stops a dog's blood from clotting. This means the dog then bleeds continually from the bite mark, even if the parasite let's go and relocates.


This blood loss can be life threatening for puppies, and make a full-sized dog chronically ill.
Hookworms can also cause your dog to have diarrhea and weight loss.

Provide your dog with preventative medicine.,
Pick up feces.,
Avoid letting dogs go to the bathroom where children play.,
Wear protective coverings.,
Take your dog for regular checkups.",How to Prevent Hookworms in Dogs1," Deworming your dog frequently will help to control hookworm infections. Most heartworm medication includes medication that is effective at killing hookworm infections. Treating your dog once a month with a deworming medication will keep these pests in check.Mother dogs and puppies should also be dewormed frequently. Pregnancy may reactivate an undetectable infection in mother dogs. A veterinarian should be consulted in order to make sure the dewormer is safe to use on pregnant or nursing dogs and on puppies.;
, The main step to prevent hookworm infections from spreading is to pick feces up immediately. This keeps any eggs from being able to develop into infective larvae. Fecal material should be picked up immediately after a dog defecates and disposed of in the garbage.


If the dog or puppy defecates on a surface that can be cleaned, after picking up all fecal material, it can be disinfected with a dilute bleach solution. This can be made by mixing one part of bleach with nine parts of water. Make sure to spot test the surface to avoid bleaching the material., Humans can easily get hookworms from infected feces or contaminated ground. To protect yourself and others, do not let dogs or puppies defecate in areas where children play. This includes playgrounds, sandboxes, and beaches. Take them to a designated potty spot before going for walks in these areas.You should cover children's sandboxes when they are not being used to discourage roaming cats and dogs from using the bathroom in it.
If the dog or puppy does defecate in these areas, clean the stool up promptly and thoroughly.

, One way you can prevent hookworms in you and your family is to wear shoes and other protective coverings. Make sure not to walk barefooted in areas where dogs may have defecated. This is how many cases of dog hookworm infections are acquired by humans.You should take precautions when gardening if your dog or neighborhood dogs or cats defecate in your garden area.If you are to tropical climates, consider wearing shoes on the beach and using protective mats when lying down on the sand.

, You should take your dog to the vet at least once a year for checkups. You may want to bring a sample of your dog’s stool to the checkup to have it examined for possible parasites. This is a simple and quick way to make sure your dog is as healthy as possible.Your vet can perform tests in the office where he can check for parasites if you do not want to bring a stool sample.

Isolate dogs that are infected.",How to Prevent Ascarids in Dogs," Feel free to ask your vet for suggestions. There are a huge number of effective worming products available on the market. Key to worming success is checking the package to see exactly which parasites the product is effective against. You are looking for effectiveness against ascarids species, including toxocara and toxascaris.


Deworming medications can be taken orally or applied topically. The oral medications can come in pill, liquid, or granule forms.The topical medications usually come in liquid form and are applied directly to the skin.
Some of the more old-fashioned wormers, such as piperazine, are effective but can cause extreme muscular contractions of the gut, which causes belly ache.
Not all products are safe for all ages of puppy, so always read the small print very carefully to check your dog falls within the recommended age and weight.
If in doubt, Panacur (fenbendazole) is both safe and gentle, and suitable for puppies from two weeks of age. However, always take care to dose accurately by weighing the puppy before hand.;
, Always follow the dosing frequency and whether the medication should be given with food or on an empty stomach. For example, Panacur should always be given with food in order to increase its absorption into the bloodstream.Although dewormers taken orally can come in liquid, granule, or pill form, they are usually all mixed with your pet's food.

, How often worming takes place depends on the age of the dog and the results of fecal tests to show whether infection is still present. Adults dogs should be dewormed monthly with fecal checks 2 - 4 times a year to check the effectiveness of the product used.Puppies should start deworming treatment from 2 weeks of age with Panacur (which is safe at this age), and repeated every two weeks until the puppy is old enough to use a spot-on product that is efficacious for one month (at around 8 weeks of age).Once a sustained, slow release spot on product is used, then monthly application suffices.

, A dog that hunts and eats rabbits or mice is at increased risk of infecting itself. Likewise, earthworms can acquire infection when burrowing through contaminated soil. It is therefore essential that dogs that eat these types of creatures are wormed monthly in order to decrease the risk of egg shedding.When the ascarids encounter a non-host species, such as rabbits, the eggs hatch and develop into larvae. The larvae then migrate through this intermediate hosts tissue and embed in their body tissue. When a dog then eats the intermediate host, they also eat the embedded larvae. The larvae then hatches out and develops into adult worms in the dog's gut, starting the cycle all over again.

, Ascarids are parasites with a complex life cycle that is perfectly adapted to infecting new dogs and therefore spreading infection. Preventing ascarid infection involves interrupting the parasites life cycle and preventing contamination of the environment.To understand how to prevent ascarid infections in the dog it helps to understand how ascarids are transmitted from dog to dog. A dog can become infected in the following ways:Ingestion of eggs contaminating the environment.
Ingestion of larvae via the mother's milk or infection in the womb when larvae cross the placenta from mother to pups.
Eating an intermediate host that is infected with roundworms.

, The adult worms live in the dog's gut. As the adults mature they release eggs which pass out in the dog's feces and contaminate the environment. These eggs can be ingested by other animals (such as children playing in contaminated soil) or wildlife such as rabbits. This is why it's essential that dog owners pick up their dog's dropping and dispose of them responsibly in approved bins.


Unfortunately ascaris eggs are tough and can survive in the environment for years. Thus, it is best to stop the contamination from happening in the first instance.

, Most ascarid eggs are resistant to disinfectants and so washing down the soil is an ineffective means of cleaning up. An added problem is that it takes 2 - 4 weeks from an egg being passed in feces until it becomes infectious. While this is good news because it means fresh dog mess is less of a risk to children, it is also a problem because eggs may have been left behind while there no visible trace of the original contamination.


This emphasizes the importance of personal hygiene and teaching children to always wash their hands before eating or putting their fingers in their mouth., Pregnancy can activate larvae in the mother's body tissue. The larvae can then mobilize and cross the placenta to the pup. Treating the pregnant dog with panacur (fenbendazole) from day 40 of pregnancy to 2 days post birth can greatly eliminate this larval shedding and decrease transfer to the puppies.


This is best done under veterinary supervision who can advise you about the correct dose for your dog's pre-pregnant weight.In addition, ascarid infection can be passed to the pup in the mother's milk., If you know your dog has roundworms then you should keep it away from other dogs. Be sure to pick up its feces immediately and don't allow it to go to the bathroom in areas that are accessible to other dogs. It is your responsibility to help keep the infection from continuing to spread.


If a dog has abdominal swelling, abnormal feces, lethargy, or is vomiting frequently, it may have a roundworm infection. Get it checked out by a vet as soon as possible and keep it away from other dogs. "

Keep your dog away from infected dogs.,
Use preventative medication.",How to Get Rid of a Dog's Whipworms," A dog with a light infection of whipworms typically won’t show any signs. However, those with large infections or infected puppies will show typically signs. Sometimes these signs can be very severe and life threatening. Signs include:Watery, bloody diarrhea
Mucous coated stool
Weight loss
Anemia (due to blood loss)
Dehydration
Poor appearance in puppies: rough and flakey hair coat, poor growth;
, You will need to have a veterinarian diagnose the infection. A dog or puppy with the above signs of infection should have a stool sample collected and examined under a microscope. Whipworms eggs are only shed (passed) about every three days so some veterinarians will probably request a three day stool sample collection.Once the samples are collected they are processed in the veterinarian’s laboratory using special techniques. These include fecal floatation (using fluid to “float” the eggs to the surface) and/or centrifuging. The veterinarian or veterinary technician looks for the oval shaped and thick shelled eggs under the microscope after processing.

, Getting rid of whipworms in the dog requires the use of medication. There are a few medications used for treatment. These include:Fenbendazole (50 mg/kg) for three days in a row.
Drontal Plus (febantel/pyrantel pamoate/praziquatel) one single dose based on body weight.

, In order to kill all the eggs after they hatch treatment should be done once a month for three months in a row. Your veterinarian should supply you with this medication when treatment begins., There are two types of whipworms that commonly infect dogs in the United States. The scientific name of these whip worms in dogs are Trichuris vulpis and Trichuris campanula.A whipworm infection is typically called Trichuriasis.


They get their common name, whipworms, from their shape. The back end is thick like the handle of a whip while the front end is threadlike like a whip.They live in the large intestine and cecum, a pouch like outcropping of the colon.
Whipworms burrow their threadlike end into the lining of the large intestine and then they hatch.This attachment irritates the colon, producing mucous and bleeding.

, Dogs ingest the eggs of the worm typically from eating or licking the ground or items contaminated with fecal material from a whipworm-infected dog.Eggs from the whipworm are very hardy and can survive in the environment for up to 5 years.

, Many of the once a month heart worm and/or flea treatments will also treat whipworm infections in the dog. These include the products Advantage Multi, Interceptor, Sentinel and Trifexis.Keeping your dog on one of these once a month medications will help control any infections your dog may get from dog parks or any other spots that may be contaminated by other dogs.

Maintain regular veterinary visits.",How to Identify Different Dog Worms," Because worms can look very similar, one of the best ways to identify the type of parasite that is plaguing your dog is to understand the environmental or situational factors that most lead to each type of worms. Roundworms are often passed to puppies from a roundworm-infested mother because the eggs and larvae cross the placenta to infect the puppy in the womb, and eggs are also excreted in the mother's milk. Puppies should be wormed as a matter of routine.
Tapeworms are caused by a dog’s eating vermin already infected with tapeworm, or from fleas that contain tapeworm eggs. Thus, hunting dogs or dogs with a flea infestation are likely to pick up tapeworms.
Hookworms and Whipworms thrive in damp soil and the dogs most at risk are those kept on grass runs, especially in warm, humid conditions. These infections are more common in kenneled dogs that have access to communal grassy runs.
Heartworm is spread by insects such as mosquitoes and is therefore endemic in certain areas where insects are more common. High risk areas include the Southeastern and Midwestern United States and along the Atlantic coast.
Lungworm is becoming more prevalent and is spread via fox feces, slugs, and snails. Contact with any of these is considered a risk factor.;
, Many of the symptoms of worm infections are general and non-specific. Thus, it is not possible to diagnose what sort of worms a dog may have, based on symptoms alone. However, signs in a dog that has not been wormed recently should raise suspicion of worm infection and trigger an investigation into what sort of parasite is present.

, Sometimes, even in an asymptomatic dog, you may see physical evidence of the worms in the dog’s feces. If you are not completely confident in worm recognition, collect the worm in a screw-top container and take it to the vet clinic for identification.


Collecting a worm is far more helpful to your vet than describing it, since most worms have similar physical appearances to the naked eye.

, Although life-cycles vary, all worms will at some point travel through the gut. If the numbers are low, then the dog may not show any signs. However, when larger numbers colonize the bowel they can cause irritation to the lining which results in symptoms such as sickness, diarrhea (sometimes with mucus and/or blood), poor appetite and weight loss. , Worms either live in or transit through the gut, thus at certain stages in their life cycle evidence of infection is passed out in the dog's feces. In a heavy infestation you may see actual worms in the feces, but this is less common if mild infections. Instead, either eggs or larvae may be present in the feces, which is harder for the naked eye to spot. Scoop a sample of feces with a popsicle stick or a disposable spoon and place it in a clean, screw-top container that has a tight-fitting lid (your vet can provide you with a container specific for this purpose if you don’t have anything appropriate).
Store the sample below 30 degrees Celsius and drop it off at the vet clinic when you can (the sample does not have to be especially fresh to have evidence of worms.
If your vet asks for a pooled sample, you will take samples from the dog’s stool once daily for 3 days in a row, placing them in the same collection container. This may be necessary for a suspected ""false negative"" result. The pooled sample reduces the risk of unreliable results.
The vet may run the fecal analysis, which involves examining a smear of feces under the microscope to look for worm eggs or larvae, or she may send it to an outside lab for assessment.

, Some worms that cause serious illness, such as lungworm or heartworm, can be diagnosed on a blood test. The veterinarian draws a small volume (1-2ml) from the pet to obtain as the test sample. A variety of tests are available but in practice an ELISA test is most common. The test looks for the presence of antibodies to the heartworm and causes a color change if positive.
Most veterinarians in high-risk areas for heartworm require a yearly test as part of the dog’s physical checkup before renewing or prescribing a monthly preventative treatment.

, Some worms, such as roundworms, can be transferred from dogs to humans. Young children who become infected with roundworms may experience damage to their eyesight.


Worms or feces infected with worms should be removed from children’s play areas.
Infected feces should be handled or collected with gloves.
Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling animal feces.

, Sometimes the best way to diagnose the types of worm is to document the risk factors for the dog. Make notes of the dog’s environment, climate, and habits. Be sure to also document the severity and duration of any symptoms of illness and provide the information to your veterinarian if you suspect an infection.

, If worms or worm parts are visible in the dog’s feces or vomit, you may be able to identify the type of worms. While many worms look similar, each has some distinguishing characteristics that may allow you to pinpoint the worm variety. Roundworms look a lot like cooked spaghetti noodles. They average 8 - 10cm long, but can reach 18cm in length. They have a round profile and smooth bodies.
Tapeworms are distinctive with flattened bodies made up of segments. The length varies with the species but averages from 50 centimeter (19.7 in) to 250cm long. If you see tapeworms in the feces or vomit, it is likely to be individual segments, not the entire tapeworm.
Hookworms and Whipworms are much smaller than roundworms or tapeworms. They are usually between 0.5- 2 cm long and extremely thin, like a strand of thread or hair. Their small size tends to make them appear translucent, and they can be more difficult to see without close examination.

, Lungworm and heartworms infest blood vessels and either the heart or lungs. This can cause symptoms such as coughing, heavy or rapid breathing, lack of energy, or even collapse and death. Lungworm and heartworm can interfere with blood clotting and so some dogs show the alarming symptom of uncontrolled bleeding after a minor injury.
Any of these signs should prompt an immediate visit to your vet. Though treatments can be costly, prompt treatment is more likely to result in a favorable outcome.

, A sure sign of tapeworms is egg packets stuck to the dog’s fur near his anus. This happens when the mature tapeworms release eggs into the bowel lumen, after which the eggs wriggle out of the dog's anus, which can also cause itchiness around the anal ring. These egg packets look like sesame seeds or small rice grains stuck to the hair near the dog's bottom.
If you look carefully you can sometimes see these small, cream-colored seed-like objects wriggling.

, Because worms, particularly tapeworms, absorb nutrients from the dog’s food and make less available for the host, worm-infested dogs may have poor fat cover over their bones but swollen bellies due to the excessive worms in their gut. The classic appearance of a wormy puppy is a bony, ribby dog with a potbelly and a dull coat.

, The best way to diagnose the specific type of worm is to let the professionals do it. They will be able to examine the worms or eggs under a microscope and have experience identifying minute differences between worm types. With worm eggs the differences can be subtle, such as the shape being oval instead of round, of having a plug at one or both ends.

, Worm infections tend to get worse the longer they are left untreated. An infection with a great number of adult worms, known as a “heavy” infection, can have adverse effects on a dog’s overall well-being, so identifying worms before the infection becomes “heavy” is the best approach.


Some canine worm infections can cause gastrointestinal illnesses such as diarrhea.
Some worm infections can ultimately lead to a dog’s death, particularly with heart or lung worms.

, Particularly if you live in a high-risk area with many mosquitoes, you should give your dog a monthly heartworm preventative. Heartworm preventatives require a prescription.


Most vets require a negative heartworm test to write a heartworm preventative prescription.
Many heartworm preventatives are meat-flavored and chewable, making them easier to administer.

, Because some worms are transferred by fleas, keeping your dog free of fleas with a regular flea treatment can help him stay free of worms as well.


Some companies make a combination heartworm and flea treatment in one chewable pill.
It is also possible to administer a monthly topical flea treatment. This is usually squeezed onto the dog’s scruff, at the back of his neck.

, Ensuring that your dog stays away from environments that are most conducive to worms can help eliminate the need for de-worming.


Keep your dog away from warm, grassy areas shared with other dogs who have not been de-wormed.
Do not let your dog come into contact with wild or prey animals.
Avoid warm, humid climates that have high populations of bugs such as fleas or mosquitoes.
Do not let your dog eat or rub themselves in the feces of other dogs or wild animals.

, If your dog has worms, you may need to administer a de-wormer. A precise worming protocol depends on the individual pet's risk factors, and is best discussed with your veterinarian. Most de-wormer is a powdery substance that can be mixed into the dog’s food or another vehicle such as plain yogurt (consult your vet before feeding your dog food made for humans).
Most de-wormers need to be administered only once, but if your veterinarian prescribes fenbendazole, you'll need to administer it repeatedly over the course of several days. Fenbendazole is a very gentle de-wormer frequently used for young puppies.
Be sure to read the directions on the package of de-wormer and consult your vet before giving your dog any kind of medication.

, Having your dog checked regularly by a veterinarian will keep her in generally good health. The vet will have the opportunity to identify problems before they become extreme and cause lasting harm to your canine companion.

Recognize the symptoms of hookworms in dogs.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Treat the hookworms.",How to Prevent Hookworms in Dogs2," Hookworms are parasites that suck the blood from where they attach to the intestines. This means that you dog may show signs of anemia. Your dog may have pale gums or be lethargic due to the blood loss. If a puppy, your dog may have stunted growth due to the hookworms feeding on him and the blood lost.Hookworms attach themselves to the intestines, so the major symptoms of hookworms are related to the digestive tract. Dogs may suddenly lose weight or have bloody diarrhea.
Irritation and itching around the paws is a symptom of a large infestation of the environment.

, If you believe your dog has hookworms, take him to the vet. Your doctor can perform an exam and take a stool sample to check for hookworms. Your vet will look for eggs floating in the dog’s stool.In very young puppies, this method may not be effective for diagnosing because it takes a few weeks for the hookworms to start producing eggs. Your vet may give a young puppy a different test or go ahead and treat him just in case.

, If your dog has hookworms, you can treat them with medicine. These medicines kill the hookworms. However, these medicines only kill the adult worms, not the eggs or larvae. You will have to give your dog the hookworm medication for two to four weeks to kill any newly hatched worms.These medications are oral medications with very few side effects.
You should remove all feces from the yard of the infected dog using gloves to help protect against reinfestation.

Learn how hookworms are contracted.,
Know that hookworms can infect humans.,
Treat human hookworm infections.",How to Prevent Hookworms in Dogs3," The adult hookworm lives in the dog’s small intestine attached to the intestinal wall where it sucks blood from the infected dog.The hookworm lays eggs, which pass out of the dog’s intestinal tract on the feces. When the dog passes the feces, the feces contain eggs that turn into larva. The eggs develop into infective larvae in five to ten days.If another dog comes along and steps in the area where infected feces are, the larvae can penetrate into the dog’s skin. If you or your children come into contact with the infected feces or contaminated ground, the hookworms can get in through your skin.The dog may also manage to get the larva into his mouth either directly from the environment or through eating another animal or even a cockroach infected with hookworms.Your dog may also get hookworms from contaminated water.
Puppies can become infected from their mother’s when nursing or even while they are developing in the uterus., There are three primary types of hookworms that infect dogs. Humans can also catch these three types of hookworms by stepping in a contaminated area or coming in contact with infected feces.


In humans, the hookworm causes an itchy, painful skin condition as the worm travels through the skin., To treat human hookworm infections, your doctor will prescribe a medication to kill the hookworms. The medication is usually taken for one to three days. They generally have very few side effects.If you are anemic due to the hookworms, your doctor may suggest taking iron supplements.

If you have a puppy that is showing clinical signs, he will have a potbelly. In addition, your puppy’s coat may look dull, and he may not be growing and putting on weight as he should.He will be smaller than what he should be for his age.


The potbelly appearance is due the large number of adult roundworms in your dog's belly.;
, When roundworms find their way to the intestine, they feed off of partially digested food. This robs your dog of vital nutrients and causes him to experience digestive upset, including vomiting and chronic diarrhea.You may be able to see worms in the vomit.Puppies that are four to six months old and have heavy roundworm infections may vomit large worms that are still alive, which could be very distressing to you.The roundworms will be an off white color. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, it is unlikely for your puppy to have such a severe infection.
The vomiting is due to the adult roundworms irritating the lining of your dog’s stomach.Call your veterinarian if you see live worms and are unsure how to dispose of them.
The chronic diarrhea may cause your dog to eliminate more often in the house, which would leave worm eggs in your home and potentially expose other pets, or re-expose him, to infection.With the digestive upset, your dog will eat less.

, In the complicated life cycle of roundworms, the larvae will migrate up to your dog's lungs, which will cause him to cough. The coughing action moves the larvae into your dog's throat, causing your dog to swallow the larvae.If your dog has a severe roundworm infestation, the larvae in the lungs could give your dog pneumonia.Signs of pneumonia include difficulty breathing, a deep cough, and lethargy., Looking at your dog’s feces isn’t exactly enjoyable, but it could help you determine if your dog has roundworms. Adult roundworms are three to four inches long and look like spaghetti.The larvae would likely be too small for you to see with the naked eye, and the eggs would not be detectable at all.


If you see adult worms, you may want to place a small sample in a tightly sealed plastic bag and take it with you when you take your dog to the veterinarian.
Wear gloves when you collect the sample and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Roundworms are usually found in the feces., As soon as your dog is showing signs of a roundworm infestation, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.A potbellied appearance will be the most obvious sign of roundworms, so schedule the appointment when you see the potbelly. Your veterinarian will be able to confirm the diagnosis.


If your dog defecates outside of your veterinarian's office, pick up and discard the feces immediately to prevent infecting other dogs.

, Your veterinarian will be able to definitively diagnose a roundworm infection by examining your dog’s feces under a microscope.If you were not able to collect a fecal sample at home, your veterinarian will take a sample during the appointment. Since a single adult worm can produce up to 85,000 eggs per day, a small sample of fecal material should be sufficient to identify roundworms microscopically., Your veterinarian will prepare a fecal solution (also called a ‘fecal flotation’) that will make it easier to detect the roundworm eggs. Under the microscope, roundworm eggs will be large and stout looking.Roundworm eggs have a very characteristic appearance, so it is unlikely to mistake them for another type of worm egg.

, Although fecal examinations are the primary way to detect roundworms, they are not foolproof. A dog with a roundworm infection does not continuously shed roundworm eggs, so a single fecal sample may not contain any eggs. In addition, if the sample has only a small number eggs, those eggs may not be detectable. Even if no eggs are detected, your veterinarian may still diagnose a roundworm infection, especially if your dog is a puppy and is showing other clinical signs of infection., If your veterinarian diagnoses your dog with roundworms, he or she will prescribe a medication to kill the roundworms. There are many available deworming agents (e.g., fenbendazole, piperazine, ivermectin), so your veterinarian will choose the medication and dosage that will work best for your dog. If you have a very young puppy, he will need to be treated every two weeks until he is two months old, and then monthly until he is six months old.Although unpleasant, you may see dead or dying roundworms in your puppy’s feces.If you have the puppy’s mom at home, she will need to be treated at the same time as the puppy.This will kill any larvae that may migrate to her milk and cause the puppy to be re-infected.
Follow the prescribing instructions carefully to ensure effective treatment.

, After your dog finishes the treatment, your veterinarian will probably want to test his feces several more times to confirm successful treatment.Your veterinarian will determine when those follow up appointments should take place.

, During the complicated life cycle of roundworms, the eggs will develop into larvae that essentially entomb themselves into different body tissues. After a while, they emerge, migrate through the body, and develop into adult roundworms. The deworming agent will kill the adult roundworms. However, since the larvae will be emerging and developing at different times, the medication needs to be given every few weeks to kill all of the adult roundworms., All dogs need a monthly roundworm preventative, especially those who have had roundworms. Roundworm preventatives are often combined with heartworm preventatives to make it easy for dog owners to protect their dogs from disease. Since roundworm eggs are very hardy and can remain in the environment for a long time, do not stop administering the preventative when it gets cold outside.Even with a monthly preventative, you should have your dog screened for roundworms once or twice a year after his first year of life., Roundworm eggs are resistant to disinfectants or any other products you may put in your grass to try to kill them. To keep the eggs from staying in the environment and possibly re-infecting your dog, pick up and throw away your dog’s feces immediately. Children are especially susceptible to roundworm infections, so pick up your dog’s feces if he goes to the bathroom in a playground or around sandboxes where children play.Roundworm eggs become infective after one to three weeks of being in the environment., Roundworms are a public health issue, since they can cause disease (visceral larval migrans and ocular larval migrans) in humans. These diseases are rare, but can be serious. If you have children, make sure they wash their hands frequently and properly.Wash your own hands frequently and properly as well, since you are most likely the one who is picking up your dog’s feces.

, When your children play outside, keep them from areas where your dog or other dogs normally defecate.If they do play in an area where dogs frequent, make sure they wash their hands when they come back inside and before they handle food.While they are outside, do not let them put their hands by their mouths, since this could cause them to swallow roundworm eggs.

Take your dog to see a veterinarian.,
Be aware that enemas should only be used to help with constipation.,
Monitor your dog’s bowel movements.,
Consider medical conditions that may put your dog at risk of constipation.,
Make sure the problem is not trouble urinating.,
Rule out diarrhea.",How to Give a Dog an Enema1," Before you decide to give your dog an enema, you should take your dog to see a veterinarian. If you suspect that your dog is constipated because you have noticed him straining or because you have noticed that he is not pooping at all, then make an appointment to have your dog examined. Your dog may have an obstruction or the problem may be related to an underlying cause that requires treatment.


Performing an enema incorrectly can be harmful to your pet. Do not attempt to perform an enema on your dog without first consulting your veterinarian and getting advice.;
, Constipation is the buildup of feces in the lowest part of the bowel. This can occur because of a lack of fiber in the diet, which tends to produce a hard, dry stool that is difficult to pass. Other less common causes of constipation include:Not getting enough exercise. If your dog does not get much exercise, then he may become constipated.
Dehydration. If your dog has not been drinking enough water, then he may become constipated.

A blockage. If your dog is eating well, exercising, and getting enough water but still not producing any stool, then a blockage may be to blame.

A change in the anatomy of the pelvis, such as after being hit by a car. This may cause the pelvis to become narrower and that may make it hard for the dog to pass feces.

Arthritis pain in the hips. This may cause a dog to avoid defecating as much as possible rather than deal with the pain and discomfort. This causes the feces to dry out, which makes it even more difficult to pass., Your dog’s bowel habits and bowel movements can help you to confirm whether or not he is constipated. If you think that your dog may be constipated, then observe him when he goes to do his business and check the yard after he has gone as well. Things to watch for include:Producing hard, dry, and/or small stools. If his stools are hard, small, or if he is not pooping at all, then he may be constipated.

Not pooping for several days. If he is eating well but does not poop for several days, then he is probably constipated.

Straining when trying to go. If he then starts straining and nothing comes out, then he is likely to be constipated.

Crying when trying to defecate. If your dog cries when he tries to go to the bathroom, then you should take him to see a veterinarian right away.

, Certain medical conditions can make it difficult to pass feces. In the male dog, an enlarged prostate gland is a common problem. The prostate sits below the rectum and pushes upwards as it grows bigger. Like putting your foot on a hose, an enlarged prostate can make passing feces difficult., Difficulty urinating can sometimes look like constipation, especially in female dogs.A dog that often strains when trying to urinate should be taken to a vet as soon as possible, especially if that dog is not passing any urine.

, Diarrhea can be mistaken for constipation because of the behaviors associated with it. Diarrhea may cause a dog to squat often due to a feeling of urgency. That is why it is so important to check your dog’s bowel movements and rule out the possibility that he has diarrhea.If your dog passes liquid stools, then it is unlikely he is constipated and an enema is not necessary or advised.

"
"
Choose an area that will be easy to clean.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Choose a micro-enema is your dog is suffering from mild constipation.,
Use warm water if your dog needs a full enema.,
Gather your equipment and enema fluid.,
Ask someone to assist you.",How to Give a Dog an Enema2," Giving a dog an enema is extremely messy, so choose a place that will be easy to clean and where it will not be a problem if the enema liquid splatters. It is also important to choose an area that is away from food and food preparation areas. Some good options include:


An outdoor yard or cement area that you can hose down afterwardsA garage with lots of newspaper laid out on the floor

, Consider purchasing a disposable plastic apron to protect your clothing from enema liquid splatters. Wear waterproof footwear that you can wash afterwards, such as Wellington boots. Disposable latex or rubber gloves are also essential to protect your hands.After giving an enema, dispose of all soiled protective clothing and wash your hands well.

, If your dog is mildly constipated, then a micro-enema is appropriate. Your dog may be only mildly constipated if he has just started straining and hasn't missed a bowel movement.


Micro-enemas are commercial enemas designed for human use. You can purchase these enemas from a pharmacy. A typical commercial enema is Micralax.Micro-enemas contain a small volume of lubricant which is delivered into the rectum to gently lubricate the feces. These enemas have a gentle (rather than explosive) effect and when used in the early stages of constipation, these types of enemas should help your pet to pass feces normally.

, For a full enema, a larger volume of liquid will need to be introduced. The liquid may be warm water or warm water with a small amount of liquid paraffin added.


Avoid using pure liquid paraffin because it can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood., The liquid can be introduced into the bowel via an enema pump (which veterinarians commonly use, or a syringe with rubber tubing attached (home enema). It is possible to purchase enema kits from a pharmacy or the internet. The general principle is the same regardless of the exact method of delivery, and this is a reservoir of liquid (bulb, syringe, or pump) that is passed into the rectum via a soft tube.



Choose equipment that is appropriate for the size of your dog. A large breed dog may require an enema bag (large capacity) while a toy dog will do just fine with a 2.5 milliliters (0.08  fl oz) syringe. If you are not sure, then ask your veterinarian for a recommendation.Determine how much fluid you should administer. When giving a full enema, the recommended guideline for how much fluid to pump into the rectum is 10-20 ml/kg. Therefore, for a 30 kg Labrador retriever  you would administer between 300–600 milliliters (10.1–20.3  fl oz) of fluid. However, it is difficult to instill too much liquid as it will just reflux back out of the rectum.Make sure that you have plenty of extra enema fluid on hand. If your dog fails to pass feces after an enema, then you would need to repeat the process in 1 - 2 hours.

, It is helpful to have an assistant who can hold your dog still and keep your dog’s tail out of the way.This will leave both of your hands free to administer the enema. Your assistant can also comfort the dog by petting him and talk to him. Although, enemas are not painful, having an enema is not comfortable and it may frighten your dog.

"
"
Position your dog.,
Fill the enema bulb.,
Identify the anus.,
Prime the enema pump.,
Insert the tubing in a straight line.,
Administer the enema solution.,
Take your dog to use the bathroom.",How to Give a Dog an Enema3," Bring your dog to the chosen spot, making sure the floor is protected with newspaper. Have your assistant hold the dog in a standing position and elevate the tail when you are ready to administer the enema. Stand behind the dog so you have a clear view of his rear end.


If your dog has long fur or feathering around the rear end, then consider clipping away the long fur to reduce fecal soiling when the dog does go., Other types of enema equipment may use a pump or syringe that you will need to fill. Too fill the bulb, pump, or syringe, submerge the end of the tubing into the enema liquid. Then, compress the bulb to expel all of the air. Next, release the bulb so that the negative pressure pulls in liquid.


Make sure that the water is not too hot by testing it on the inside of your wrist. If the water is too hot, then cool it down by adding a little cold water.If you are using a syringe, attach the tubing to the hub of the syringe and suck back on the plunger in order to fill the syringe.

, The anus is the hole through which the dog passes feces. This is easy to identify in the male because it is the only hole. In the female dog the anus is immediately below the tail whilst the vulva is closer to the ground between her back legs.

, Wearing your protective clothing and gloves, squirt a small volume of liquid out of the end of the tubing to lubricate it or apply some petroleum jelly to the end.Then, take the end of the tubing and gently insert it into your dog’s rectum. Next, apply a bit of gentle pressure at the central part of the anus.


It may also help to apply a gentle twisting movement to the tubing as you advance it.

, The rectum lies parallel to the backbone. Aim to direct the tubing forward in a straight line parallel to the spine in order to follow the path of the rectum. Never apply pressure or force. If the tube refuses to advance, leave it where it is and try squirting in some liquid as it might be the tip is jammed against the fecal buildup.


Push the tubing about one to two inches into the anus.

, Once tubing is far enough into the anus, then slowly compress the syringe or squeeze the bulb in order to administer the enema. Go slow to ensure that your dog will not be uncomfortable and to prevent injury to the dog’s bowel wall.Once the full volume has been given, slowly remove the enema tubing.

, Take your dog to his usual potty spot and encourage him to go potty.It may help to take your dog for a nice slow, gentle walk to help the fluid mix with the feces and start the softening process.


If your dog does not pass feces on the first attempt, repeat the enema process 1 - 2 hours later.
Remember to give your dog plenty of opportunities to toilet in between enemas. When he is ready to go, he will need to go right away.
Never get angry at a dog that has had an enema and loses control. This is not his fault. To prevent your dog from having an accident on your carpet or furniture, you may want to keep him outside until he has gone.

If your dog doesn't like chicken, try another flavor, such as beef or pork.

, Any flavor will do: beef, chicken, pork, etc. Choose one that your dog likes best.

, You can also use burger grease instead. If you are using peanut butter, make sure that it is unsalted and does not contain xylitol. Xylitol is a substitute sweetener found in some sugar-free products and can be deadly to dogs., Stir them together with a spoon first. Once everything comes together, start kneading them by hand until they form a dough.

, They need to be big enough to fit your dog's pills. How many balls you end up making depends on how big the pills are. The smaller the pill, the more balls you'll be able to make.

, The hole needs to go only ½ to ¾ of the way through each ball. You can use just about anything to make them, such as chopsticks, pencil erasers, thermometers, or even the end of a small, wooden spoon.

, They will last about 1 week. If you won't use all of them in that time, you will need to freeze the rest. Begin by lining the pill pockets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper, then freeze them for 1 hour. After that, you can transfer them to a freezer-safe container."

Have your dog sit.,
Use your non-dominant hand to open your dog's mouth.,
Hold the pill with your dominant hand.,
Push the pill into your dog's mouth.,
Let go of the pill and remove your hand.,
Praise your dog.,
Ask your vet about a pill popper.",How to Get Your Dog to Take His Medicine1," If the dog is small then work at a comfortable height for you, by putting the dog on a table. Lay down a blanket or towel so the dog feels more secure. For medium to large-sized dogs, work with the dog on the floor but back him into the corner of a room so he can't try to run away from you.


If you can, have another family member or friend hold the dog steady by the shoulders.;
, With this hand, form an upside-down ""U"" shape with your first (or middle) finger and thumb. Place this arch-shape over the bridge of your dog's nose with tip of your thumb and first finger resting on the outside of the upper lips where they cover the cheek teeth. Now apply gentle inward and downward pressure as if you wanted to slide your finger and thumb into his mouth from this position.This has the effect of compressing the lips against the cheek teeth, causing the dog to open his mouth slightly in order to avoid biting his own lips.

, With your dominant hand take the pill between the tips of your first finger and thumb. Rest your middle finger in the center of your dog's bottom jaw, between the canine (fang-like) teeth, which you can see because the mouth is partly open. Apply downward pressure with the middle finger which has the effect of levering the mouth open slightly.At the same time, lever your non-dominant hand backwards slightly so that the dog's head angles slightly more up towards the ceiling., With your dominant hand, advance the pill into the dog's mouth. The further back you push your hand, the better. Your aim is to put the pill over the back of the dog's tongue and then release it. If it is over the back of the tongue, your dog will find it difficult to spit it out. He also won't taste anything, since there are no taste buds there., Once you let go of the pill inside the back of your dog's mouth, remove your hand from his mouth and instead lightly wrap it around his mouth and jaw to hold it closed. Watch his throat to see when he swallows and, once he has swallowed, thus letting the pill fully go down his esophagus, let go of his mouth., To make him happier and more willing to be ""pilled"" next time, be sure to lavish him with praise and tell him what a super clever boy he is. You can also pet him and scratch his ears; do whatever behavior he normally likes as a ""reward"" for doing something right. You could also give him a treat, which will get him to swallow again to make sure the pill is down.Be sure as well to fill up your dog's dish with clean, fresh water. It's a good idea to encourage your dog to have some water after taking a pill so that you can be sure the table has passed all the way down into his stomach and isn't stuck in his gullet (esophagus). , If you're worried about putting your hand in your dog's mouth, ask your veterinarian about a pill popper. These are devices that hold the pill so you can advance it deep into the dog's mouth but with your fingers safely on the outside. Once the pill popper is deep enough into the dog's mouth, you press a plunger which knocks the pill off it's mount and into the dog's throat."

Put your dog on a leash when you go for walks.",How to Diagnose Ascarids in Dogs," Ascarid infections in dogs may start with some mild symptoms and progress to more serious ones. These symptoms are often the first sign that a dog may have ascarids. Some common symptoms of ascarids include:


larvae in feces (may look like grains of rice or spaghetti noodles)
diarrhea
vomiting
poor appetite
colic
bloated belly
dull coat
coughing (due to larvae in your dog’s lungs);
, Dogs under one year old are the most likely to get ascarids and most puppies are born with ascarids. This is because dormant worms may become active when the mother dog becomes pregnant and the worms can also cross the placenta. If your dog is still a puppy, then it is likely that he has ascarids.


It is crucial to treat puppies for worms because puppies born with ascarids may fail to gain weight and even die from the larvae in their systems., Your dog’s veterinarian will need to inspect a sample of your dog’s stools to determine if he has ascarids. Dogs that are infected with ascarids carry lots of them in their feces, so they will be easy to spot in your dog’s feces. To collect a stool sample from your dog, you will need to:Wear gloves and wash your hands. Make sure that you wear gloves when you collect your dog’s stool sample and wash your hands right after collecting the sample as well.

Contain the sample. Use a clean plastic, glass, or metal container that you can seal tightly with a lid. You can also ask your veterinarian for a sterile container to use.

Label the container. Make sure to label the container so that it includes your dog’s name as well as the date and time of collection.

Place the sample in a sealed plastic bag. This will provide some extra protection in case the container leaks.

Deliver the sample as soon as possible. You will need to deliver the stool sample to your veterinarian’s office as soon as possible soon after you collect it or else it may dry out. Try to get the stool sample to your veterinarian’s office within one hour of collecting it.

, Sometimes when a dog is heavily infected with ascarids, he will vomit up worms that resemble spaghetti noodles. If you notice any cream colored spaghetti-like worms in your dog’s vomit, then take him to see a veterinarian for treatment right away. Dogs that are heavily infected may suffer from an intestinal rupture, so prompt treatment is essential.Clean up your dog’s vomit right away to prevent children or other animals from investigating the vomit. Wash your hands right after cleaning up the vomit.
You may also want to collect a sample of the vomit for your veterinarian to inspect. If you decide to do so, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after collecting the sample.

, If you have noticed symptoms of ascarids in your dog, then you should take him to see a veterinarian right away. Your veterinarian will examine your dog and administer medicine if your dog has ascarids. Your veterinarian will either give your dog an oral medication or an injection.Common drugs used to treat ascarids include:fenbendazole
milbemycin oxime
moxidectin
pyrantel pamoate

, You will need to follow up with your dog’s veterinarian at regular intervals to ensure that the worms do not come back. Your veterinarian will need fecal samples from your dog two to four times per year for the first year after your dog has been treated for ascarids and then once or twice per year thereafter., It is recommended to deworm puppies at two weeks old and then every two weeks until the puppies are eight weeks old. If your dog is eight weeks or older, then he will need to be dewormed until he reaches one year old.Pyrantel comes in a liquid formula that is often given to nursing mother dogs and puppies., Cleaning up your dog’s feces right away is the best way to prevent children and other animals from becoming infected. Make sure that you pick up your dog’s feces daily and do not allow your dog to defecate in areas where children play or where you grow food., Frequent handwashing is also a great way to protect yourself and others from accidental infection with ascarids. Make sure that you wash your hands after touching or petting your dog, after cleaning up your dog’s feces or vomit, and before eating or preparing food.Use warm water and an antibacterial soap to wash your hands. You should scrub your hands with soap for about 30 seconds and then rinse them thoroughly.

, Healthy adults are less likely to be infected by ascarids, but children and those who do not have strong immune systems may become infected more easily.Children and the immunosuppressed may also suffer more severe consequences from ascarid infection including:organ damage, especially of the liver
blindness due to larvae getting into the eyes

, Dogs like to inspect the feces of other dogs (as well as cats, raccoons, deer, etc.) and this can cause your dog to become infected with ascarids. To prevent your dog from investigating the feces of other animals, you should keep him on a leash at all times when you go out in public. Check your yard often as well to make sure that there are no strange feces from neighborhood cats, dogs, or other animals that your dog may encounter.

If you can't find any oat or oatmeal flour, you can make your own by grinding up oatmeal to a fine powder in a blender or food processor. You can also try using another type of flour instead.

, Try to get beef gelatin powder, if you can. It is beneficial to a dog's joints.

, What dog doesn't like peanut butter? Just make sure that you get the smooth, unsalted kind. More importantly, make sure that it doesn't contain xylitol. Xylitol is a substitute sweetener commonly added to sugar-free products. It can be deadly to dogs., Coconut oil is great not just for you, but for your dog as well. It can help make your dog's coat glossy and smooth.

, You can use the store-bought kind, but make sure that it is low-sodium. If you have extra time, however, you could make your own at home. This way, you can ensure that it is as low in sodium as possible.

, Once the dry ingredients soak up all of the wet ones, switch to kneading the dough with your hands. Be careful not to over-work it, however, or the coconut oil will turn too soft.

, The balls need to be big enough to completely cover your dogs pills. How many you end up making depends on the size of the pills. The smaller the pills are, the more pill pockets you'll be able to make.


Wet your hands first. This will make the dough easier to work with.

, You can make these holes using just about anything, from a chopstick to a pencil eraser. The holes need to be wide enough to fit the pill. Also, make sure that they only go ½ to ¾ of the way through each pill.

Administer the fluids in a different site each time.",How to Administer Subcutaneous Fluids to a Dog," To administer SQ fluids to your dog, you will need a fluid bag, fluid line (long plastic tube), needle, and metal coat hanger. To make the process more efficient, organize all the equipment in the area where you will be administering the fluid.The coat hanger will be used to hang the fluid bag once you have all the equipment assembled.In your vet's clinic, the staff would have your dog lay on a table for fluid administration; however, at home, it will probably be more convenient for your dog to sit or lay on the floor, or lay on another piece of furniture (if you allow your dog on your furniture).;
, Your vet may have already assembled the fluid therapy equipment for you. If not, you will need to do this yourself. First, remove the plastic packaging from the fluid bag and fluid line. The fluid line will have a plastic roller clamp, which you will open and close to start and stop the flow of fluid. When you take the fluid line out of the packaging, close the clamp.The clamp has a wheel-like apparatus. Roll this wheel with your thumb to close the clamp. The fluid line will squeeze in when you close the clamp.

, The fluid should be clear. If the fluid looks cloudy or discolored, do not administer it — it could be contaminated with bacteria.The SQ fluid should be at room temperature (neither hot nor cold). Do not refrigerate the fluid bag.Do not warm up the fluid, either — this could make the fluid feel uncomfortably warm as it enters your dog's body.

, The fluid bag has a small opening on its bottom where the drip line will go. Turn the fluid bag upside down, remove the rubber seal from the bag, and insert the sharp, pointed end of the drip line into the opening. Twist this end into the opening to make sure it stays in place.To prevent fluid contamination, do not allow the pointed end of the drip line to touch anything before you insert it into the fluid bag.Turning the fluid bag upside down will prevent fluid from flowing into the fluid line and making a mess on your floor.Turn the bag right side up once you’ve inserted the drip line.
Closing the clamp will also prevent fluid from spilling onto the floor when you connect the drip line.

, To prevent your dog from receiving a lot of air under their skin, allow some of the fluid to flow through the line first. To do this, open the plastic clamp on the fluid line.To prevent your floor from getting wet, position a small bowl or cup to catch the fluid as it runs through the line.


You could also hold the bag and line over a sink., The top of the fluid line will have a clear plastic drip chamber. Fluid flows into this chamber before flowing through the rest of the line. Before you start administering the SQ fluids, squeeze the fluid bag to fill the drip chamber until it is about halfway full., Your vet probably supplied with you several needles to use for administering SQ fluid. The end of each needle will have a plastic or metal hub. Screw this hub into the bottom of the drip line.Keep the needle cap on until you are ready to begin administering fluid to your dog.


Needles come in different sizes.Your vet will have chosen the size needle that will be most comfortable for your dog.
The larger the needle, the faster the flow of fluid; however, larger needles to cause more discomfort when entering the skin.

, The fluid bag should hang a few feet above your dog to ensure a good flow of fluid. Take your metal coat hanger and slightly straighten the hook (there can still be some curve in the hook). Next, slide the opening in the top of the fluid bag through the coat hanger hook. Hang the coat hanger on the top of a door in the area where you will be administering the SQ fluids., Fortunately, most pets don’t mind receiving SQ fluids.The entire process can take anywhere from five to 15 minutes, so you will want to your dog to get comfortable before you start giving the fluids.Pet and talk to your dog to help them become more comfortable.Do not ‘prep’ the skin by rubbing it with alcohol. Alcohol does not sterilize the skin. Also, the coldness of the alcohol will feel very uncomfortable to your dog when you insert the needle., Making a skin tent will make it easier for you to place the needle just under the skin. With your nondominant hand, gently pull up your dog’s scruff (skin just behind the neck) with your thumb and index finger.Have the ‘triangles’ of the tent in line with your dog’s spine, rather than going from side to side.


If you have someone assisting you, have them remove the needle cap while you are making the skin tent.
If you are administering the SQ fluids on your own, you can remove the needle cap before making the skin tent; however, make sure the needle does not touch anything before you insert it into the skin. Do not try to remove the cap with your mouth.

, Hold the needle hub with your dominant hand. Position it behind the skin tent so it’s parallel with your dog’s spine (facing one of the tent triangles), with the hole of the needle facing up. Gently push the needle forward as you move the skin tent backward to meet the needle. Once the needle is under the skin, you can release the scruff.You will feel a ‘punch’ as the needle enters the skin.Do not hesitate when inserting the needle. This will slow the insertion and possibly cause discomfort for your dog.Because the needle is extremely sharp, your dog probably will only feel a slight prick, or nothing at all, when you insert it., With the needle under the skin, begin administering the fluid. Open the clamp on the fluid line by rolling the wheel on the clamp.The fluid should flow smoothly. If it is not flowing smoothly, or not flowing at all, it could be because the needle is not positioned well under the skin. Gently reposition the needle, without taking it out, until you see the fluid flow smoothly., Your vet will have prescribed how much SQ fluid to give your dog. On average, a dog or cat can receive 50 – 200 milliliters (mL) of fluid at one time. The amount of fluid your dog receives will depend on how dehydrated they are.Fluid bags typically contain one liter (1,000 mL) of fluid. The space between the numbers on the bag indicate 100 mL’s of fluid.Consider marking the bag with a marker to make it easier to see how much fluid to administer. Or, you could ask one of the vet’s staff members to mark the bag for you., As the fluid flows under the skin, a lump will start to form. Do not be alarmed! This is completely normal. When you finish administering the SQ fluids, it will take about four to 12 hours, or as long as 24 hours, for your dog’s body to absorb the fluids and for the lump to disappear.If you see the fluid on your dog’s fur rather the lump under the skin, that means the needle has gone through the skin (not that the lump has burst). Gently pull the needle back so it goes under the skin.If the fluid lump has not disappeared by the time you get ready to administer fluids again, contact your vet.When giving large volumes of SQ fluid, spread it over several different sites.

, Petting and talking to your dog can help your dog feel comfortable while they are receiving the SQ fluids.Those activities can also keep your dog pleasantly distracted during the process. Below are some things you can say to your dog:


""You're being such a good dog!""
""This will be over soon. Just stay still for a little while longer.""
You can also tell your dog about your day.

, When your dog has received the prescribed amount of fluids, close the plastic clamp, then carefully recap and remove the needle. Do not throw the used needle in your regular trash. Instead, contact your vet for guidance on how to properly dispose of the needles. Your vet may advise you to return the used needles to the veterinary clinic.You might a see little fluid leak out when you remove the needle. The fluid may contain some blood. This is normal. If you see the leakage, put pressure on the area until the leakage stops.Place a new needle on the fluid line to prepare for the next fluid administration., Choose a different location on your dog’s body to administer the SQ fluids. This will prevent one area from getting too sore from the needle insertion. Whichever area you choose, make sure you can pull up a lot of skin to create the tent. The larger the tent, the more fluid can go in that one area.

Coat the pill.,
Know if you can crush the tablet.,
Crush the tablets if possible.",How to Get Your Dog to Take His Medicine2," If your dog won't take a whole pill, considering ""tricking"" him by coating the pill in something tasty. A good choice is peanut butter, which also has the advantage of being sticky. Offer this peanut-butter coated morsel to the dog and hopefully he will chew it and be none the wiser there was a pill inside.Note that this tactic only works if the tablet does not have a bitter center that the dog can taste if he bites through it.
Pushing the pill into a piece of cheese is also a good option. You could also press the pill into his canned food if he eats that.An alternative to peanut butter are ""pill pockets"", which you can buy from most pet stores.These are soft, squashy treats with a hollow center. You hide the pill in the pill pocket and then give the treat to your dog.

, Some tablets are designed to be given whole. This is because the medicine tastes unpleasant if chewed or the medication is designed to release slowly over time. If you are not sure if the tablet has to be given whole, read the product instructions. In most cases, there will be instructions, such as ""Do not crush"" or ""Give whole."" If you're still not sure, contact your vet who should be able to tell you if the tablet can be crushed. If the tablet can be crushed, skip to Step 9.A clue that a tablet should not be crushed or chewed is a shiny ""sugar"" coating on the outside of the tablet. This outer shell is there to disguise the bad taste. If you crush the pill, it will release the bad taste and the dog is likely to smell that his food has been doctored. Alternatively, he'll eat the food and then have a mouthful of something unpleasant., If you don't want to give the tablet whole and it can be crushed, try this method. Place the pill in a cup or mug and use the back of a metal spoon to grind it into a powder. Add the powdered tablet to the dog's regular meal or special treat (like peanut butter ). It helps to pill your dog when he is hungry so that there's a greater chance of him eating first and asking questions later.You can also buy commercial device called ""pill crusher,"" which acts a bit like a miniature mortar and pestle. You simply put the pill inside the cup part of the crusher, put on the upper lid, which fits into the cup, and screw it down hard until the tablet is pulverized.

Check if the medication is ""palatable."",
Use a syringe.,
Mix the liquid medicine with food.",How to Get Your Dog to Take His Medicine3," When giving a liquid medication, check on the box to see if it says ""palatable"". This means that satisfactory or pleasant to taste. If the medication does say this, then try adding the medication (at its required dosage according to your vet and the instructions) to your dog's regular meal. Because the medication is designed to be tasty, the dog will likely eat his food quite happily and be none the wiser about the addition.

, If the medication does not say ""palatable,"" then syringe it directly into your dog's mouth. To do this, draw up the medication in the dosing syringe or pipette. Use your non-dominant hand to gently hold your dog's mouth shut.Hold the dosing syringe in your dominant hand, and wriggle the nozzle part behind the upper canine (fang) teeth. There is a small gap here through which you can gently syringe the medication without the dog opening his mouth.Alternatively use the grip and method for opening a dog's mouth to give a pill described in Part I and syringe the medication straight onto the tongue.
Never squirt medication quickly. If your dog does not get a chance to swallow the liquid, the medication can go down into his lungs and cause a serious chest infection. If in doubt, dribble in about half a cc at a time, then pause and give the dog a chance to swallow in between, and then repeat., You could melt a certain amount of cheese depending on the dose of medicine (e.g. more medicine, more cheese and vice versa), and mix the liquid medicine with the cheese to make it more palatable for your dog.


If you want a less timely procedure, mix the liquid medicine with some applesauce or some peanut butter.

Avoid using for certain dogs.,
Identify the side effects.",How to Buy Acepromazine for Dogs1," Your vet is more likely to prescribe acepromazine if you provide evidence that your dog needs it. Write down occasions when your dog is anxious, boisterous, or unruly. Note where the dog is, what they are doing, and what time of day it is. Record when your dog:


Is anxious during travel or storms
Becomes motion sick during travel
Refuses to stay still during grooming
Shows aggression around strangers
Struggles with itching and scratching;
, Explain to your vet the reasons for your appointment, and ask them if acepromazine is right for your dog. Show them the record of symptoms that you took down. Understand that your vet may recommend against acepromazine or they may suggest another medication. Always follow your vet’s advice.

, The brand name for acepromazine is PromAce, but there are many generic versions available on the market.Generic drugs are cheaper than brand name products, and your dog may react well to a generic version. Ask your vet if a generic version of acepromazine is right for your dog.

, Acepromazine is not recommended for all dogs. Older dogs or those suffering from heart conditions or seizures should not take it. Furthermore, certain breeds should not be given acepromazine as they are at a higher risk of side effects. These breeds include:Boxers
Collies
Australian Shepherds
Great Danes
Newfoundland
Pyrenean Mountain Dog
Any “giant” breed of dog

, While you may be anxious to ease your dog’s anxiety, you should understand that there are side effects to acepromazine. Before you buy the medicine, be sure that you are comfortable with these risks. These side effects include:


Aggression
Low blood pressure
Low body temperature
Pink urine
Swollen lips or tongue
Difficulty breathing

Check out a store or retailer.",How to Buy Acepromazine for Dogs2," Most vets keep a supply of animal medications in the office. While acepromazine is available as an injection, your vet will probably sell you the tablets as these are easier to give your animal at home.


Vets may mark up the price of the tablets by charging a dispensing fee. They are generally a more expensive option for buying pet medications, although they are the most convenient option for many people. If you need acepromazine immediately for your dog, the vet may be the only place where you can get it., Some pharmacies carry medications for pets as well as for humans. Call your local pharmacy to see if they carry pet medications. They may be able to order acepromazine for you, even if they do not carry it. Your vet may also be able to call in the prescription for you., There are many large retailers and supermarkets that stock pet medications at their pharmacies. You might have luck checking if you can buy acepromazine from them. Some stores that stock pet medications include:

Then just slide the pill into the open side of the Pill Pocket., You may skip peanut butter; if you close the Pill Pocket's opening and your dog will eat it all, great! But s/he may outsmart you by eating the pocket and spitting the pill out. The peanut butter helps make everything sticker so they can't just spit out the pill.

Grab a teaspoon and fill 1/3 of it with peanut butter.
Transfer this peanut butter to the Pill Pocket, completely covering the opening.

Watch for skin reactions.,
Understand reactions are common.,
Know when you need immediate veterinary care.",How to Administer Shots to Dogs," When you purchase vaccinations or other medicines from a veterinarian to administer yourself, you will have to sign a release form. Read this form carefully. Not only does it provide valuable information, it helps you understand your responsibilities when you decide to administer shots yourself.


By signing the release form, you accept full responsibility for your pet's injection and any reactions or accident that might occur. It warns that allergic or other life-threatening reactions can occur even if the shot is administered correctly.The form warns the shot may be ineffective if it is outdated, left unrefrigerated too long, improperly administered, or exposed to heat, sunlight, or freezing temperatures.Some forms state that if you administer your own rabies vaccine, it will not be accepted as valid by law enforcement agencies and animal care professionals. Make sure you know if this clause is present in your form and its repercussions. Your dog will legally be considered unvaccinated for rabies, which means many kennels will not let your board there and you may not be able to adopt other dogs from animal shelters depending on their policies.;
, If your dog has previously been given shots at a vet's office, they probably associate syringes with pain and discomfort. To combat this, allow them to look at, sniff, and paw at an empty syringe (with no attached needle) at a comfortable place in your home.Give treats and other forms of positive reinforcement during these sessions, such as attention, praise, and play. You want your dog to associate the syringe with positive moments to reduce fear and stress when you actually administer the shot., Some substances used in shots, especially vaccines, come in two vials: a liquid vial and a powder vial. The liquid and powder needs to be mixed before the shot is administered.


Insert the syringe's needle into the liquid vial and pull up the plunger until all the liquid is in the syringe.Push the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Make sure all the liquid empties before pulling out the syringe.Shake the vial. Make sure the powder is completely dissolved. There should be no clumps or residue collected at the bottom of the vial., You should know how many milliliters of medicine or vaccination you are administering to your dog. Before giving him the shot, draw out that amount.


Insert the syringe into the combined liquid and powder vial. Pull up until you have the desired amount of milliliters.Make sure there are no air bubbles. If you notice any, push the syringe down, empty the vial, and try again., Thought there are three different types of injections given to dogs, there is only one type — subcutaneous shots — that can potentially be administered by someone other than the vet. If you shot you plan to give your dog does not fall into this category, then you must take them to the vet.


Subcutaneous vaccines are given just beneath the skin. The majority of vaccines and shots are subcutaneous. These are usually administered on the loose skin just above a dog's shoulder blades. If you're administering shots yourself, always use the subcutaneous method. If the medication or vaccination specifically states it needs to be injected in another manner, take your dog to the vet's office.Intramuscular vaccines are injected into the muscle. If you're not a veterinary professional, it might be hard to locate a muscle on your own. It is best to take your dog to the vet if he needs an intramuscular vaccine.Intravenous injections must also be administered by a vet. These injections must be injected into a vein and you should not attempt to do this yourself. Vaccines are not given by IV injection.

, A hard, flat surface should be used when administering shots to your dog.


A flat surface, such as a counter or table, allows you plenty of room while administering the medication. Find something that allows you to work comfortably.
Have a friend or family member present. Even if your dog is normally calm, he might fidget or fight if he feels a prick. Someone should be present to hold the dog during the injection. This is particularly important if your dog is small and might leap off the table or counter., As you'll be using a subcutaneous vaccine, it's best to administer it on the loose skin found behind the shoulder blade.


Using your non-dominant hand, lift the skin upward, away from the shoulder blade. Using your index or middle finger of your dominant hand (which is holding the syringe), angle the needle at 90 degrees to the flat tented surface of the skin. Push inward to form a small pocket of skin. This reduces the risk of accidentally administering a shot into the body or catching sensitive areas., Press the needle into your dog's skin.


Before injecting, pull the plunger out a little bit. If you see any blood being draw, you're in a vein. This could cause harm to the dog. Pull out, refill the syringe with fresh medicine, and insert it again.Once you find a safe spot, slowly push the plunger down until all the liquid is gone., Some soreness after an injection is normal, but it also sometimes be a sign of infection or allergic reaction. Monitor the skin after injection for any signs of a serious reaction.


Mild reactions are very common and come in the form of a lump or swelling around the site of the injection. This may last a few hours, but might also stay for up to a week.If you notice hives, rashes, or swelling that occurs anywhere outside the injection location, such as the head or shoulder blades, seek medical care. This is a sign of a severe reaction and requires medical care., Reactions to injections, especially vaccinations, are very common. For the most part, the benefits outweigh the risks involved. However, your dog may exhibit a number of mild symptoms that should go away within a week.


Fatigue and a low grade fever are common reactions to an injection. Your dog might be lethargic and have a low appetite during the days following an injection.Your dog might also be sore in the area surrounding the injection. Be careful handling him after his shots, especially if you have any contact with his shoulder blades., Severe allergic reactions are rare, but can occasionally occur. If a severe allergic reaction does occur, it will usually be within 20 - 30 minutes of giving the injection and the most common sign is collapse. If your dog exhibits any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical care:


Vomiting
Diarrhea
Lameness
Collapse
Seizure"

Give the dog the injection.,
Remove the needle from your dog’s skin.,
Dispose of the syringe properly.,
Reward your dog.",How to Give an Insulin Shot to Dogs," Start by removing the cap from the needle on the syringe. The syringe should come with a plastic cap to ensure it is sterile.Once you remove the cap, pull the plunger back to the appropriate dose mark on the syringe. Your vet should tell you the dosage required for your dog.;
, Insulin is a suspension, not a solution, so it needs to be mixed before you give it to your dog. Roll the insulin bottle or tube between your hands quickly a few times. Then, turn the bottle upside down to make sure there are no white insulin molecules at the bottom of the bottle.If there are still white insulin molecules at the bottom, roll the insulin again until it is mixed.
Do not shake the insulin as this will cause it to foam, making it difficult to measure it accurately when you draw it out.
Insulin that has been refrigerated should be left out at room temperature for an hour before it is injected. Cold insulin can be painful when injected.

, After the insulin has been mixed, insert the needle into the insulin bottle. Then, push the plunger on the syringe down to inject the air from the syringe into the bottle.The air will replace the liquid you will draw out of the insulin bottle.

, Pull the plunger back up to draw out the insulin. Draw out more insulin than you need. Then, inject the excess back into the bottle by pushing down on the plunger. This will remove any air bubbles from the syringe.Always measure the dose at the edge of the plunger, where it is closest to the needle.

, Always give the dog insulin as it is eating or right after it has eaten. This will ensure the insulin is absorbed properly into its bloodstream. Time the insulin shots for the dog’s meal and be ready to give the dog insulin during meal time.You may want to record the time of the injection on a calendar so you can keep track of the insulin you are giving the dog.

, If you are right handed, hold the syringe in your right hand. Then, wrap your left hand around the dog’s neck towards its back. This will allow you to then hold the dog still while you inject the insulin.Alternatively, you can ask a friend, partner, or family member to hold the dog from behind with both hands. This will make it easier for you to administer the insulin properly without worrying about your dog moving or shifting around.

, Use your nondominant hand to lift up a fold of skin along your dog’s back or shoulders. You can also choose a fold of skin on the sides of the dog’s chest or abdomen.Make sure you use a different injection site every time you give the dog insulin.

, Push the entire needle into the dog's skin. Be careful not to push the needle into your finger.Keep in mind you do not need to sterilize the area with alcohol before you insert the needle. It is not an effective way to remove bacteria and is not necessary.

, Pull back on the syringe plunger slightly and check that no blood enters the syringe. Then, push the plunger with your thumb to give the dog the injection.If blood enters the syringe, this means the needle is in a blood vessel. Remove the needle and start again at a different injection site.

, Once the insulin has been injected, remove it from your dog’s skin at the same angle. Put the cap back on the needle., Most insulin needles are one use only and must be disposed of properly after they have been used. Put the needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant container. Do not simply throw it in the garbage, as this can be a health hazard., Praise your dog after the injection by scratching its head or giving it a treat. You can also use verbal praise like “Good job” or “Great going.”"

Get food your dog really likes.,
Hide the pill inside the food.,
Give the food to your dog.",How to Get Your Dog to Swallow a Pill1," You need to override your dog's distaste for his medicine by offering him something he finds irresistible. Make sure to choose foods that are healthy for your dog, like plain meat, cheese, peanut butter, or yogurt. Avoid junk foods like candy or chips.


This works best if your dog swallows food quickly, without chewing.
This works best with food in which the pill can be well enveloped, so that the pill does not fall out.
Using pill pockets available at your veterinarian sometimes works better than food.;
, There are different ways of doing this, depending on the kind of food you use. Generally, the goal is to fold the pill inside, or push it into the food, such that it is securely hidden. Try different ways of hiding the pill in the food to see what works best for your dog.


Ground beef, turkey or chicken can be molded around the medication.
Pills can be pushed inside a portion of hot dog.
Softer cheeses can be easily re-shaped to encapsulate the medicine.

, This can take a few tries. Sometimes dogs are able to separate the medicine from the food in their mouths, and they will then spit it out. In this case, try again. If you are repeatedly unsuccessful, it may be necessary to try another method.


You may want to try to wait until the dog is hungry, and then give two or three undoctored treats so that the dog gets a taste for them and looks for more. Then slip in the doctored treat, closely followed by another normal treat to get the taste out of his mouth.
If you have more than one dog, try this when they are both present. Give food without medicine to the other dog first. Then attempt to give the medicine. The competition from the second dog can increase the chances of successfully getting your dog to take the bait.

Get the dog examined by the veterinarian.,
Recognize reactions to vaccines.,
Understand the basics of vaccines.,
Follow a vaccination schedule.,
Prepare the injection.,
Prepare the dog.,
Insert the syringe.,
Remove the needle.",How to Administer a Vaccine to a Dog," You'll need to take the dog in for a thorough medical examination. The vet will determine whether the dog is healthy enough to be vaccinated at home. If the dog has a compromised immune system or is sick, giving a vaccine will only make him sicker or cause the vaccine to be ineffective.


While you can vaccinate the dog against a variety of diseases, you cannot give the rabies vaccine. The rabies vaccine must always be given by a veterinarian.;
, While it's rare for a dog to have a reaction to a vaccine, it's important to recognize possible reactions. Your dog may have swelling at the injection site, mild fever, decreased energy or appetite, sneezing or some coughing.One of the worst reactions is anaphylactic, a life threatening reaction that needs immediate medical treatment. If you notice your dog is having trouble breathing, has a slow heart rate or low blood pressure, see the vet right away. If your dog has a slow heart rate or low blood pressure, he may become unusually drowsy, may seem weak or drunken and then collapse, all within 20-30 minutes.


Most vaccines for animals are given just below the skin (subcutaneously) to reduce pain and possible reactions.
If your pet has ever had a reaction to a vaccine, no matter how minor, do not attempt to give a vaccine of any type at home in case of a severe reaction.

, A vaccine works by imitating a viral or bacterial infection. It does this by stimulating the body’s immune system to produce cells that fight the virus or bacteria.This prepares the immune system for future encounters with the virus or bacteria. So, if the vaccinated dog comes into contact with the virus or bacteria, his immune system will remember how to fight the infection, producing cells to fight off the virus or bacteria.The vaccine does not actually infect the dog, it only imitates the virus or bacteria, though the dog might have a slight reaction (like mild rash or fever).

, Many vaccines need an initial series of two vaccines given 3 to 4 weeks apart. This makes sure the immune system is working. After this, the dog will need an annual or 2 to 3 year booster shot of the vaccine to keep his vaccine status updated.


Each vaccination has its own timeline, so talk with the vet to determine the timing of vaccinations for your pet., Check the vaccines to make sure they've been properly transported and stored at the temperature on the label. You may need to mix vaccines. If so, there will be two vials that you'll need to combine according to the label instructions. Once mixed, draw back all of the solution into the syringe and remove excess air bubbles by tapping on the side of the syringe. The needle should be pointing up.Most vaccines will need to be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures.

, Make sure the dog is clean so that no dirt is visible around the loose skin on the neck. His fur should be dry before you vaccinate. Lift up the back of the dog's skin near the neck to make a tent. This gives you a pocket of space underneath the skin where you can inject the vaccine.Unlike humans, you don't need to prepare the site with an alcohol wipe.

, Hold the syringe level with the dog's back and place the needle with the bevel (flat part of the needle) along the tented skin. Gently puncture the skin with the needle and draw back on the syringe. Slowly press on the syringe plunger to give the vaccine.If you see blood in the needle, you will need to find another location to give the injection. Blood in the needle means you’ve hit a blood vessel and you cannot give a vaccine into a blood vessel.

, Once you've taken out the needle, apply pressure on the site for about 30 seconds. This will prevent bleeding. Place the needle and syringe in an appropriate garbage receptacle or in a glass jar to be disposed of at a veterinary clinic.Never put an uncapped needle into the garbage since people who work at landfills could get injured.

Understand why it is important to check for dehydration.,
Lift the dog's lip and touch his gums to check for dehydration.,
Use the scruff method.",How to Treat Diabetes Insipidus in Dogs1," A dog with diabetes insipidus who is denied water will initially be agitated and restless, as he seeks water but can't find any. As he becomes dehydrated there are relatively few warning signs, unless you specifically look for things such as dry gums and test his scruff for hydration.


Unfortunately, if the dehydration is undetected the blood supply to major organs will be reduced and those organs (of which the kidneys are especially sensitive) will go into failure. The first signs of this could be vomiting and collapse.;
, There should be moisture present; if the gums are dry this could point to early dehydration.

, You can also use your dog’s skin as a way to check for dehydration. Lift the scuff of skin located in between his shoulders; lift it away from his body and then release it. A well hydrated dog’s skin will fall back into place immediately.


A dog who is dehydrated will have skin that “tents”, which means that after you release it, it stays peaked and very slowly returns to its original position.

Feed the food to your dog.,
Get a baby's vitamin syringe if medicated food is unappetizing to your dog.",How to Get Your Dog to Swallow a Pill2," This works only with medication that can be crushed. Many times it is possible to crush medicine up for your dog. However, some medicine should not be crushed because the contents may taste extremely bitter and cause the dog to leave the food or because the tablet is designed to be slow-released over 24 hours and crushing destroys this ability.


Liquid medicine inside capsules can be removed by lancing the capsule and squeezing the medicine out.
Don't crush pills that have a coating.
Check the container or ask your vet to see if you can crush the pill.

, Rice and beef make a good combination that is easy to digest. It is not recommended that you try this with dry dog food, as moisture will likely be required in order to hold the medicine and the food together.

, Make sure that you don't give your dog too much, as unfinished medicated food means that your dog did not get his full dose of medicine.If you have other dogs, be sure that they do not eat the medicated food instead. Let the dog eat in a separate room if necessary.

, Take the pulverized pill and pour the powder into the syringe with water. Inject the water into the dog's mouth. He won't like it, but he'll get most of it.Open your dog's mouth. It doesn't have to be very wide, just enough to insert the syringe.
Insert the syringe near the back of the dog's mouth, so that you can squirt the medicine into the back of the dog's throat.
Push the plunger on the syringe, and squirt the medicine out. By giving your dog medicine this way, you make it nearly impossible for your dog to spit it out.

Get different foods your dog likes to eat.,
Drop some food on the ground while you eat.,
Pretend not to notice that you dropped the food at first.,
Drop the pill.,
Keep other dogs away.",How to Get Your Dog to Swallow a Pill3," You will not feed all of them to your dog, so they can be foods you like too. Make a show of enjoying this food, so that you've really gotten your dog's attention.The key is to make your dog desire what you're eating.

, This is not medicine, but a way to get your dog to expect good-old, no-medicine food. He will let his guard down. Your dog will take for granted that it wants to eat whatever falls.

, Other times, quickly grab the food from the dog. In this way you establish a sense that your dog must act quickly in order to snatch the food. This will encourage him to try to eat what you drop, without thinking.

, This can be hidden in food, or just by itself. Try to quickly grab it from the dog, in an attempt to trick him into eating it. If your dog already expects it might lose the opportunity, you may not even have to try that hard.

, This process works best when there are no other dogs around. There is a risk that another dog might try to take the pill this way, and so it is important to isolate the dog you want to medicate. However, keeping another dog in view, but behind a gate, in a crate, or outside, can increase the medicated dog's excitement.

Force your dog to gently swallow the pill.,
Start opening his jaws from the back of the mouth with one hand.,
Open your dog's mouth wide, and place the medicine inside.,
Hold his mouth shut gently.,
Give treats after your dog swallows.",How to Get Your Dog to Swallow a Pill4," Do this if you cannot get him to take his medicine another way. This may feel a bit extreme to do, but in some cases it can be entirely necessary. Don't worry, you won't choke him. By taking your time, and by being gentle, this can be a simple, surefire way to get your dog to take his medicine.

, Then, use your second hand to lift from the roof of his mouth. Fold his lips over his teeth in order to help prevent him from biting. Go slow so as not to hurt him. Do not cover his nose.

, Try to put it as far back as possible. You want to maximize the possibility that your dog will swallow the pill. By placing it as far back as you comfortably can, you will increase the chance that this will happen. If you don't put it in far enough, the dog will spit it out., Do this until he swallows. When a dog has swallowed can be difficult to perceive at first. Always check after, just to make sure the medicine is not still in your dog's mouth. It may seem tough, but hold a little bit to ensure your dog gets his medication.


Blow gently on his nose to help aid this process.
Rub your hand over the dog's throat after he swallows the pill to make sure that it goes down smoothly. This will stimulate his swallow reflex and he will have to swallow.
Have your dog drink some water if he needs to.
Be patient, calm but firm.

, Use high value treats. Give lots of them before, and especially after. Your dog won't mind this experience as much if he gets a huge reward after. Make sure you take the time to do this, especially if you will have to give your dog pills often. If your dog learns that this will only be an unpleasant experience, it will be more difficult to work with him.

Find how many milligrams are in a pill of Benadryl.,
Administer 1 milligram per pound of body weight.,
Administer Benadryl two to three times a day.,
Give the dog Benadryl before it’s exposed to an allergen.",How to Determine Benadryl Dosage for Dogs1," Different stores will sell Benadryl at different concentrations. Read the label to determine how many milligrams of diphenhydramine a single pill of Benadryl contains. It’s common for Benadryl tablets to contain 25 mg, but some may contain a higher or lower amount.If you need to obtain Benadryl, it should be available at any drug store, pharmacy, or supermarket. Benadryl is sold over the counter, so you won’t need a prescription (for yourself or your dog.);
, This is the general rule of thumb when giving Benadryl to a dog. Since dogs can be many different weights, you need to know your dog’s weight before administering the medication. For example, if you have a dog weighing 40 pounds, administer 40 mg of Benadryl.You’ll likely need to break Benadryl tablets apart and estimate how many milligrams are in each.

, To successfully counteract your dog’s allergy symptoms, you can give the dog Benadryl every 8 to 12 hours.Monitor your dog once you’ve administered Benadryl the first or second time: if its symptoms vanish, you don’t need to give a subsequent dose.

All of the doses should be the same size. Do not give your dog different level dosages of Benadryl throughout the day.

, Like most antihistamines, Benadryl works most successfully as a preventative drug. If you know that your dog is allergic to something (e.g. a specific type of grass), give the Benadryl before exposing your dog to the allergen. This will prevent your dog from experiencing allergy symptoms."

Troubleshoot your dog’s need to urinate frequently.,
Get your dog a prescription for synthetic ADH - DDAVP.,
Give your dog Chlorothiazide.,
Monitor your dog for complications.",How to Treat Diabetes Insipidus in Dogs2," A dog with diabetes insipidus pretty much needs constant access to an outside area. Installing a doggie door is a good way to handle this.Another might be the canine equivalent of a cat-litter box, perhaps utilizing the large type of tray used by garage's to collect oil drips from beneath cars.

, The synthetic version of ADH is called desmopressin, or DDAVP. This is available only in liquid form and is supplied in a dropper bottle. You will have to place the drops either in your dog’s nostril or eye. Although this sounds a bizarre way to give your dog medication, the DDAVP is absorbed well through these openings, and can be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream.In addition to this, oral forms don’t work because the medication gets destroyed by the digestive tract.
The dose is 2 to 4 drops twice a day into the eye or nose. The effect plateaus at around 4 drops, and increasing the dose further has not additional benefit.Sadly, even treatment with DDAVP does not reduce the concentration of urine your dog produces. The aim of treatment is to decrease the amount of water lost in the urine, so that your dog's drinking is manageable and your dog does not constantly have urinary accidents.

, Ironically, chlorothiazide belongs to a family of drugs called diuretics (these are drugs which encourage water loss from the body). The mode of action in diabetes insipidus is to cause sodium loss from the body (one of the actions that a diuretic has), which stimulates the body's tissue to reclaim fluid from the blood (instead of the kidney filtering water and holding onto it).


This drug does not make the urine a normal concentration, but can make it approximately 50% more concentrated than without treatment.While this is not perfect, this can make an appreciable difference in the amount of water the dog drinks and consequently urinates out. In turn this helps with house-soiling problems, if the dog does not need to go out to pass water quite so often.
The dose is 20 to 40 mg/kg given by mouth twice a day. This is available as a tablet for humans, in 250 mg and 500 mg strengths. Thus a 10 kg dog could safely be given a 250 mg tablet twice daily., Because the urine is dilute, it lacks the normal disinfectant properties that help keep bacteria in check, and an important part of treating diabetes insipidus is to monitor for evidence of urinary tract infections. Even dogs receiving treatment are not able to fully concentrate their urine and are therefore more likely to acquire bladder infections.Have your vet perform a dipstick test once a month to look for signs in the blood that could indicate a low grade infection. Every three months, a urine sample should be sent for culture, to try to identify any bugs that are surviving at a low concentration but are not causing overt signs of infection.
If is important to identify and treat urinary infections because the bacteria may track from the bladder up the ureter (the tubes connecting the bladder to the kidney) and set up a kidney infection.

Be aware that this is not the more common form of diabetes.,
Consider the implications of diabetes insipidus.,
Consider the two forms of this disease.",How to Treat Diabetes Insipidus in Dogs3," Despite the name ""diabetes"", this condition is different from the better known and much more common diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes). However, what the two conditions do have in common is that dogs drink excessive amounts of water and pass large volumes of urine.

, While diabetes insipidus in itself is not a painful condition, the main problem is your dog's constant need to drink. It takes a special sort of owner to cope with a dog's constant demand for water and then to bring the dog outside to urinate. Indeed, because the signs start in young life, affected dogs can be difficult, if not impossible to housebreak, and many of these dogs end up being euthanized because of it. However, it is important to keep in mind that just because your dog takes a little more work, does not mean that you should love him any less.


Untreated, even a house broken dog may have a full bladder that leaks in her sleep. Potentially this could cause sores and skin infections.

, To appreciate the problems of treating diabetes insipidus it helps to understand what drives the condition. There are two forms of this disease: nephrogenic (kidney based) and central (brain based.)Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a problem that is present at birth. The kidney does not have the ability to recognize a hormone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which is released when the body needs to conserve water. Thus, at times when your dog is thirsty and no drinking water is available, the body continues to lose water through urine, rather than reclaiming water, which produces concentrated urine.
Central diabetes insipidus results from a gland in the brain failing to produce ADH. This deficiency denies the kidney the signal it needs to concentrate urine.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to distinguish the two types of diabetes insipidus. The symptoms for both forms are identical and indeed, even with sophisticated imaging such as an MRI scan, unless physical damage to the brain has caused a loss of ADH production, it is difficult to distinguish the two.

Administer Benadryl for mild anxiety.,
Counter general allergy symptoms.,
Do not administer Benadryl for an acute allergic reaction.",How to Determine Benadryl Dosage for Dogs2," Benadryl can work in both humans and dogs as a mild sedative, which can calm dogs and alleviate the symptoms of anxiety. This can be helpful when taking anxious dogs on car rides, to the vet’s office, or in any other situation where dogs need to relax or sleep. Benadryl can also cut back on feelings of motion sickness in dogs.Do not use Benadryl for this purpose on a daily basis. If your dog frequently seems anxious or uncomfortable, take the dog to your vet and explain the recurring symptoms.

, Benadryl effectively works to counter most general allergy symptoms that dogs experience. (Of course, if you know that your dog reacts badly to specific allergens, keep the allergen away from the dog.) Administer Benadryl to sooth symptoms in your dog including:Itchiness or hives.
Swelling or inflammation from allergies.
Runny nose and eyes.
Allergy induced coughing or sneezing.

, While Benadryl successfully prevents mild to moderate allergic reactions, Benadryl will not be an adequate treatment if your dog experiences more serious symptoms. If your dog is experiencing difficulty breathing or has facial swelling, take the animal directly to a vet’s office.Veterinarians will have stronger medications at their disposal, and will be able to effectively treat a dog’s severe allergy symptoms.

Consult a veterinarian before administering Benadryl.,
Read the label of the medication.,
Do not administer Benadryl if your dog has a pre-existing condition.",How to Determine Benadryl Dosage for Dogs3," Although Benadryl is a safe drug to give to dogs, it’s still best to consult your vet before administering the drug.Your veterinarian will have interacted with your dog before, and may be able to provide specifically tailored dosage advice., Diphenhydramine is the active ingredient in most types of Benadryl in the United States, and can safely be given to dogs. However, if you’re outside of the US, Benadryl may contain other drugs which cannot be given to dogs.Read the medication label to confirm that you’re giving your dog diphenhydramine.

For example, some Benadryl products will contain the drug acrivastine as their active ingredient. This drug is not safe for dogs to ingest, and should not be administered., There are a number of medical conditions which can be worsened by diphenhydramine. The most frequently occurring condition is high blood pressure. Also do not give your dog Benadryl if it has glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or an enlarged prostate.

Watch for your dog to drink more throughout the day or drink more at one time. Monitor the water bowl to see if it empties faster., Another early warning sign of canine diabetes is frequent urination. This usually goes hand in hand with the increased thirst, since drinking more can lead to the need to urinate more often.Your dog may have more accidents than usual, or start having accidents in the house when they didn’t before.

, Dogs who have diabetes may start to eat more. This is usually combined with weight loss or no change in weight despite eating more., Weight loss is another early sign of diabetes. With diabetes, weight loss occurs despite having a normal appetite and eating a usual amount of food. Sometimes, weight loss occurs with increased eating., Another symptom of diabetes is cataracts. These appear as cloudy eyes or a film over the eyes. Cataracts connected with diabetes can even lead to blindness if left untreated. This is usually a sign of later stage diabetes., Canine obesity can lead to diabetes. If your Miniature Schnauzer is obese, you should monitor him for diabetes symptoms.If your Schnauzer is obese but not diabetic yet, put him on a diet plan to lower his body weight. This may help reduce the risk of diabetes.

, Because sugar is released through urine when a dog has diabetes, you might smell a slightly sweet smell from your Miniature Schnauzer’s urine. This might also be on his breath as well.You might notice acetone on your dog’s breath as well. If you smell this, it’s important to get your dog medical treatment as soon as possible. It commonly points to diabetes combined with ketoacidosis, which is a severe condition., Diabetes can cause your Miniature Schnauzer to sleep more or become less active due to a decrease in energy. Depression in a dog can point to diabetes with ketoacidosis, which is much more severe., Your vet will try to identify any concurrent diseases, such as infections, underactive thyroid glands, or Cushing's disease. These diseases can destabilize diabetes control.Correcting any other health issues is a vital part of diabetes treatment, in order to maximize the body's ability to respond to insulin.

, If diabetes is left untreated in a dog, he will eventually develop complications. These complications include cataracts, vomiting, and other health problems. The dog may also become ketotic, or toxic as a result of the body breaking down tissue to supply energy for its needs since it cannot soak it up from the bloodstream.If you notice any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet immediately. Since Miniature Schnauzers are prone to diabetes, your dog should be monitored closely for these symptoms, especially later in life.

, If you notice any of the symptoms for canine diabetes, you should take your dog to the vet immediately. Left untreated, canine diabetes can cause major problems. When you take your dog to the vet, your vet will perform an examination.


Your vet will check for cataracts, weight loss, in addition to performing a clinical examination to identify other general health problems which could impact diabetes control using insulin., The most basic test for canine diabetes is often a urine dipstick test. This looks for the presence of sugar in the urine.A negative test in a dog that is not on insulin therapy means the dog is not likely to have diabetes.
A positive test for glucose makes diabetes a possibility, but care should be taken not to jump to conclusions. Stress can sometimes cause the body to release adrenaline, which triggers the body to release glucose. Therefore, it is not safe to diagnose diabetes based solely on a positive urine dipstick test.

, In addition to the urine test, the vet will want to run blood tests. They will want to run a full panel that gives an overall view of organ function along with red and white cell numbers. This is to screen the dog for other problems which could impact on the diabetes.Part of this panel is a blood glucose measurement. Just as for the urine dipstick test, a normal result makes diabetes unlikely but a high result could be due to diabetes or could be due to stress.

, The vet may want to doublecheck a high blood glucose result to make sure it is not a misleading false positive. The vet will do this either by running a blood glucose curve or by running a blood fructosamine test.A blood glucose curve involves using a handheld glucometer and pinprick-sized spots of blood. The vet takes a small drop of blood from the dog once an hour for a number of hours (up to 12) and the reading is plotted against time. If the glucose levels are constantly raised, this confirms diabetes.
However, if the dog is extremely stressed, it is possible that he will show raised levels for quite some time, in which case a fructosamine test is more helpful.
A blood fructosamine test gives a longer overview of blood sugar levels. Fructosamine levels are slower to react and take days to weeks to change, so they give an average reading of sugar levels during a two week period. Therefore, a dog who is stressed at the vets but not diabetic will have normal fructosamine levels, while a diabetic dog will show a high fructosamine reading.

, Diet is an important factor in controlling diabetes. If your dog has diabetes, he should be feed a good-quality protein, along with complex carbohydrates and fiber. This helps energy release slowly into the bloodstream.You should discuss a diet plan for your dog with your vet. He can help you come up with an eating plan to treat your dog’s diabetes.Soft or moist foods should be cut out of your dog’s diet. However, don’t suddenly change your dog’s diet if you have been feeding him soft, moist food. Talk to your vet before changing your dog’s food.There are prescription diets your dog can go on, but most diabetic dogs can remain on their normal diets with some controlled alterations. Most do fine on high-quality foods available in stores.Since Miniature Schnauzers are prone to diabetes, before he gets diabetes, try to not feed your dog a low-fat, low-carb diet, and instead feed him high-fiber dog foods. This may help prevent diabetes., Your dog should be placed on a regular feeding schedule with meals spaced out over the day. Feed your dog at the same time every day. This helps smooth out blood glucose levels.If your dog is on insulin, timing of the meals is extremely important. If your dog is given insulin once a day, feed the dog ⅔ of his daily food before giving him the insulin shot. About six to eight hours later, give him the second meal. If your dog is on two shots a day, give the dog half his food before the morning injection. About 10 to 12 hours later, give him the second half of his food, just before the second injection.Since Miniature Schnauzers are prone to this disease, before he contracts diabetes, try feeding him smaller meals throughout the day to try to prevent diabetes., Dogs with diabetes need to have a regular exercise routine. This helps to regulate blood glucose levels. Come up with a regular exercise schedule for your dog, where he exercises at approximately the same time each day for the same amount of time. This helps regulate energy levels, which can help stabilize glucose levels.The exercise doesn’t have to be anything elaborate. A regular walking schedule can work for your dog.

, The dog will probably need injections of insulin in order to reduce his blood sugar levels. These are easy to give and your vet will train you up on how to give the injections painlessly, so you are confident to give them at home."
"
Feed your diabetic dog the same amount of food every day.,
Serve your dog meals at the same times every day.,
Keep a logbook to track your dog’s diet and health.",How to Feed a Diabetic Dog1," You want to make sure there are no unnecessary fluctuations in your dog’s insulin requirements. In order to make sure your dog has regular insulin levels, you should feed them the same amount of food every day.The specific amount of food your dog eats every day will be determined by your veterinarian based on your dog’s activity level and current weight.Your veterinarian will give you a specific amount of calories to feed your dog every day and then you can use this number to determine the amount of dog food.


The amount of food you feed your diabetic dog will depend on whether you have them on a maintenance diet or have specific weight gain or loss goals for your dog. Regardless, the main thing is to stay consistent in the amount of food you feed your dog.Use an online dog food calculator to determine the appropriate amount of food to feed your dog. You simply enter your dog’s ideal weight and activity level and your dog food’s calories, and the calculator will give you the proper serving size. Try the online calculator on the Dog Food Advisor website: Bring this recommendation to your veterinarian and ask if it is accurate.;
, The dog will be processing food and insulin between meals and insulin injections, so you need to get your timing right. You may want to talk to your veterinarian to figure out the appropriate times to feed your dog. Once you have your routine set, you should stick to it every day.If your dog eats two or three times per day, make sure these meals are spread out and given at the same time every day.
If you feed your dog when you wake up in the morning, try to keep this routine consistent and serve your dog at the same time every day. If you want to sleep in, try waking up at your regular time (e.g., eight o'clock ) to feed your dog and then going back to sleep. This way your sleeping habits won’t adversely impact your diabetic dog.

, It is important to keep track of your diabetic dog’s appetite, mood, appearance, weight, water consumption, and urination habits. You can use this logbook to report any changes to your veterinarian.You can also use it to track any possible symptoms of hyperglycemia such as drinking lots of water, frequent urination, loss of appetite, weakness and lethargy. If you see symptoms of hyperglycemia or notice high blood glucose levels, you should contact your veterinarian.You can use the logbook to track hypoglycemia such as confusion, restlessness, weakness, or lack of coordination and shivering. If you see symptoms of hypoglycemia, you should contact your doctor.You can keep track of your diabetic dog’s reaction to any dietary changes or shifts in appetite.

Recognize that overweight dogs are more likely to become diabetic.,
Take note if your dog is older than seven.,
Know what breeds are more susceptible.",How to Detect Diabetes in Dogs1," Canine diabetes can start when a dog is heavier than average. The best way to see if this could be an issue for your dog is by checking your dog's rib cage. Run your hand along your dog's rib cage. You should be able to feel the ribs easily. If not, your dog may be overweight. Some dogs have incredibly long and thick coats which may make it more difficult to feel their ribs. Another good test is to feel for their back hip bones. If you can feel them by pressing down lightly, then your dog is probably not overweight.


If your pet is overweight, talk to your veterinarian about safely decreasing calories and increasing exercise. There are special diets that may be appropriate or you may achieve success with your dog by cutting down on treats and snacks and adding in a few more walks per week.;
, Diabetes usually develops in dogs between the ages of seven and nine. As your dog gets older, decreased exercise can lead to weight gain. This usually indicates increased levels of glucose and an insufficient level of insulin, which leads to diabetes. , Some breeds of dogs are more commonly affected with diabetes, although any dog can develop the disease. Miniature Poodles, Mini Schnauzers, Dachshunds, Beagles and Cairn Terriers are well represented on this list. Mixed breed dogs are not immune to developing diabetes.Intact females (unspayed) are more prone to diabetes. A high-risk dog is an overweight, intact female from an predisposed breed such as a Dachshund or Beagle.

Restrict the amount of exercise your dog gets each day.,
Monitor how much salt your dog eats.,
Count your dog’s heart rate at home.,
Schedule regularly check-ups for your dog if his condition seems stable.,
Watch for symptoms of heart failure.,
Start your dog on a medication regimen if his symptoms appear to get worse.",How to Treat Heart Failure in Dogs1," When a dog has a weak heart, exercise can add extra pressure to his condition. Heart failure can lead to difficulty with blood circulation, meaning that your dog’s vital organs do not get enough oxygen. If your dog has heart failure, he should not be allowed to exercise heavily, though he can still wander around the yard. Forgo taking him on walks for peaceful hours petting him or letting him lounge. To help your dog rest:


Cut out activities that can put extra strain on his heart. Move his water and food bowls closer to where he spends most of his time. Keep him from walking up and down stairs unless absolutely necessary.
Making small changes like carrying him up flights of stairs rather than making him walk can help to make his life more comfortable.;
, Sodium chloride, more commonly known as salt, causes fluid retention. A high salt diet can slow down blood circulation and cause fluid to collect in pockets of your dog’s body.


Look for salt-free or low-sodium dog foods., Some dogs become stressed at the vet's office, which leads to the vet getting an inaccurate reading of how rapidly your dog’s heart is beating. Because of this, it is helpful to count your dog’s heart rate at home, when he is asleep.To do this:


Place your fingers on your dog’s heart and count how many times it beats in a minute. Likewise, counting his resting respiratory rate can give your veterinarian useful information.

, Because the heart deteriorates over time, it is important that you dog gets regular checkups to do everything that you can to make his lifelong and comfortable.


If your dog’s symptoms seem stable (as in they are not getting worse), you can schedule an appointment with your vet for every three months.
If your dog’s condition appears to be getting worse, you should contact your vet right away to set up an appointment.

, Heart failure in dogs is generally associated with fluid buildup around the lungs or in the abdomen. When this fluid build up happens, it can lead to symptoms that you should look out for if you are concerned that your dog may develop, or has developed heart failure.These symptoms can include:


Rapid breathing.
Excessive coughing.
Collapsing with exercise.
Lack of energy.
Panting after very slight activity.
Weight loss and lack of interest in food.
Rapid heart beat.

, When your dog begins to show symptoms like those listed in Step 1 of this section, it is likely that the vet will start your dog on a medical regimen that includes diuretics, and ACE inhibitor, and a positive inotrope.


Diuretics that you can give your dog will be covered in Method 2, while ACE inhibitors and positive inotropes will be discussed in Method 3.

Measure your miniature schnauzer’s glucose levels.,
Record the amount of insulin you give your miniature schnauzer.,
Watch for signs of hypoglycemia.",How to Treat Diabetes in Miniature Schnauzers," Diabetes may cause your miniature schnauzer to become hungry frequently and drink more water. The hunger results from glucose in the blood not making it to the brain—without much glucose, the brain will send out ‘hunger’ signals, even if your dog is eating. Diabetes makes a dog thirsty because he is urinating more.Your miniature schnauzer may start eating more to satisfy his hunger.Don’t be surprised if you’re refilling your dog’s water bowl more frequently.;
, With increased water intake, your miniature schnauzer will urinate more frequently. This may lead to more accidents in your home.If your miniature schnauzer has an accident, clean it up with an enzymatic cleaner that will remove the urine's scent.Do not punish your miniature schnauzer if he has an accident.Remember that it is the diabetes causing him to urinate more, not bad behavior.

, Diabetes may cause your miniature schnauzer to feel tired. This is because the glucose in his blood isn’t reaching his muscles, where glucose would be converted to energy. Without much energy, he will feel more tired than usual., Sudden weight changes can occur with diabetes—either weight gain or weight loss. Diabetes can also lead to a poor coat condition (e.g., dry, brittle fur).If your miniature schnauzer has gained weight, it may be due to his increased appetite., Diabetes that is not well controlled can lead to cataracts in dogs.A cataract is a cloudy lens. Cataracts can develop quickly in dogs with diabetes, and, if left untreated, can cause other eye problems, such as glaucoma., If you think your miniature schnauzer has diabetes, take him to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will examine your miniature schnauzer and run different diagnostic tests (e.g., blood work, analysis of the urine) to diagnose diabetes. Indications of diabetes on the blood work will include high levels of blood glucose and some liver enzymes.Glucose in the urine indicates diabetes.Any level of glucose in the urine is abnormal, since glucose is not supposed to be in the urine at all.
If your veterinarian identifies other health conditions during the exam, your miniature schnauzer would need to be treated for those along with his diabetes treatment.

, Several types of insulin are available to treat diabetes in dogs, with NPH being the most common.Diabetic dogs respond to insulin differently, so insulin dosage must be determined individually.To determine the insulin dosage for your miniature schnauzer, your veterinarian will hospitalize him for a day. During this time, your veterinarian will give him a certain insulin dosage, feed him normally, and take blood samples every 2 hours to measure blood glucose levels.Your veterinarian will use these blood glucose levels to create a blood glucose curve. The curve will allow your veterinarian to determine which insulin dosage will be most effective at maintaining your dog’s normal blood glucose levels (between 90 and 180 to 216 mg/dl).Your veterinarian may need to perform several blood glucose tests to determine the ideal insulin dosage.

, To give your miniature schnauzer his insulin, you will first need to prepare it. Mix the insulin bottle’s contents (liquid and powder) by rolling the bottle gently in your hands, without creating foam—foam will make the liquid measurement inaccurate. Do not shake the bottle.Keep the insulin stored in your refrigerator, where it will not freeze., Remove the plastic cap from the needle of the insulin syringe. Make sure the syringe’s plunger is at ‘0.’With the insulin bottle in one hand, insert the needle into the bottle, without bending the needle. Turn the bottle upside down so the top of the bottle is facing down.


With your hand holding the syringe, use your thumb and index finger to pull the plunger back and draw up the prescribed amount of insulin. If you see air bubbles, you can either flick them out with your fingers or push the insulin back into the bottle and try again., Insulin is injected just underneath the skin in the subcutaneous space. With your non-dominant hand, use your thumb and index finger to lift up a section of skin along your miniature schnauzer’s back, creating a ‘tent’ of skin. Quickly insert the needle just under the skin and into the tent at a 45-degree angle, making sure the needle doesn’t poke out the other side.You will feel resistance if you put the needle in the skin instead of under it.It may take a few tries before your miniature schnauzer adjusts to what you are doing. Be patient with him.

, Push the plunger with your thumb to inject the insulin, then withdraw the needle. Pet your miniature schnauzer and give him verbal praise for behaving well during the injection. Since you may not be able to throw the used needles in the trash, ask your veterinarian how to dispose of them., A healthy diet is essential to effective diabetes treatment in dogs. A healthy commercial dog food will have a high quality protein (e.g., chicken, beef), complex carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains), and a high amount of fiber. It will also be low in fat. A healthy diet will keep your miniature schnauzer’s blood glucose levels steady.Do not feed your miniature schnauzer soft or moist foods; these can cause rapid increases in blood glucose levels.Treats may not be a good idea for your miniature schnauzer if he has diabetes. Talk with your veterinarian about including treats in your dog’s diet.Your veterinarian can give you recommendations on diabetic diets for dogs., Not only does your miniature need to eat a healthy diet, but he needs to eat it consistently. Each day, before receiving his insulin, he should have the same food, in the same amount, and at the same time.By keeping a strict feeding regimen, your miniature schnauzer’s blood glucose levels will remain steady throughout the day.


Small, frequent meals throughout the day are ideal., Obese dogs have an increased risk of diabetes. Excess weight can also make diabetes treatment more challenging. If your miniature schnauzer is overweight or obese, he will need to lose weight as part of his diabetes treatment. Weight loss should be gradual.Work with your veterinarian to develop a weight loss plan for your miniature schnauzer. It will include ways to increase his activity and reduce his caloric intake.

, Daily exercise is an important aspect of diabetes treatment. Exercise can lower blood glucose levels by helping muscles absorb insulin and convert glucose to energy. Do not have your miniature schnauzer exercise too intensely—his muscles may use up too much glucose, causing him to have too little glucose in his blood.A few walks during the day could be enough exercise for your miniature schnauzer. Talk with your veterinarian about a good exercise plan for your dog.

, Keeping records of your miniature schnauzer’s progress during diabetes treatment is very helpful. For example, write down daily observations of how much he’s eating, drinking, and urinating.The insulin should help him maintain a normal appetite and not drink water or urinate excessively.


Keeping a written record of the eating habits can also help you see if you are maintaining the strict feeding regimen.

, You can measure glucose levels at home by using a glucose monitor or urine dipsticks. To use the glucose monitor, use a small lancet (available through your veterinarian or at a local pharmacy) to puncture your dog’s skin and get a blood sample. The monitor will suck in this blood sample and calculate the blood glucose level. The urine dipstick would provide an estimated level of glucose in the urine.The glucose level will indicate the insulin’s effectiveness.
Glucose monitors are available at your local pharmacy.
The urine dipstick is not as accurate as the glucose monitor.Talk with your veterinarian to decide which measuring method will work best for you and your miniature schnauzer.
Write down the glucose levels each time you take a measurement.

, After each insulin injection, write down how much you gave and when.If your miniature schnauzer reaches a point where he is not responding well to the insulin dosage, take him to your veterinarian for another blood glucose test. Do not adjust the dosage on your own! Talk to your veterinarian before making any dosage adjustments., During diabetes treatment, your miniature schnauzer’s blood glucose levels could become too low (‘hypoglycemia’). Causes of hypoglycemia include too much insulin, dietary changes (e.g., not eating the entire meal, eating at different time), and intense exercise. Hypoglycemia can be serious and fatal, so recognizing its clinical signs is very important.Clinical signs of hypoglycemia include weakness, muscle tremors, confusion and unsteadiness.If your miniature schnauzer is showing any signs of hypoglycemia, take him to your veterinarian right away.

Serve a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates and fiber.,
Design a diet that is either normal or high in protein.,
Avoid a high fat diet.,
Consider a prescription diet for your diabetic dog.",How to Feed a Diabetic Dog2," A diet that is high in complex carbohydrates and fiber will help ensure a steady release of glucose from the gut.Consider natural dog food. If you can find a natural dog food that is high in carbohydrates, you might consider this option. Natural dog food has the additional benefit of not having chemicals that are difficult for your diabetic dog to process.Diabetic dogs benefit from complex carbohydrates because they digest the food slower and the glucose is absorbed throughout the day.Feed your dog a diet with a low-glycemic index. Low-glycemic foods include fruits, vegetables, and whole wheat products.Simple carbohydrates should be avoided.If your diabetic dog eats a diet with simple carbohydrates or sugars, they will experience rapid spikes in their insulin levels.

, Many veterinarians recommend a diet that is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates, although carbohydrates should remain in the diet. Your diabetic dog should be getting at least a regular amount of protein and a higher amount of protein if they are either overweight or experience muscle wasting.If you increase the amount of protein in their diet, you should lower the amount of fat and maintain the same amount of carbohydrates.Forty percent of your dog’s diet should be protein. The rest of the diet should be composed of healthy fats and complex carbohydrates, with thirty percent of the diet allocated to each of these foods.You might try a raw food diet with plenty of protein but make sure your dog isn’t getting too much fat with it., You should avoid feeding your diabetic dog a diet that is high in fat. If your dog has high cholesterol, lipemia, or is overweight, you should move to a lower fat diet.Look for dog food that is lower in calories than similar products, which will typically mean it is also lower in fat.Thirty percent of your diabetic dog’s diet should be healthy fats.The rest of their diet should be protein (40%) and complex carbohydrates (30%).
Keep in mind that the amount of fat listed on dog food is not always accurate., Talk to your veterinarian about possible prescription diets for your diabetic dog. Although a prescription diet is not always necessary for diabetic dogs, your veterinarian should be able to offer advice on whether this is the right choice for you and your pet.

Ask your veterinarian about a prescription diet.",How to Feed a Diabetic Dog3," Your veterinarian may advise you to make sure that your dog has started eating before giving them their insulin. Therefore, you might need to administer your dog's insulin to him while he is eating. Ask your veterinarian for advice that is specific to your dog's situation.

, Start by talking to your veterinarian about an appropriate diet for your overweight diabetic dog. In consultation with your veterinarian, start feeding your dog on a strict diet. The diet be should be designed to allow your dog to lose weight in a gradual manner and in a way that is safe for their diabetic condition.


Ask your veterinarian: What kind of diet would be ideal for my overweight diabetic dog?
See if any of your friends have recommendations based on their experiences with overweight diabetic dogs. If any of your dog owning friends have dietary recommendations, look into these diet options in consultation with your veterinarian.
The insulin requirement will be lower after weight loss., If your diabetic dog is underweight, they should not be on a diet that is high in carbohydrates. You should give them plenty of protein and design a diet with your veterinarian that allows for appropriate weight gain.The first step is to talk to your veterinarian about the most appropriate diet for your underweight and diabetic dog.


Ask your veterinarian: Is there a diet that will help my underweight and diabetic dog to gain weight safely?

, Prescription diets are very good for dogs who are either underweight or overweight. In conversation with your veterinarian, you should be able to find an appropriate prescription diet for your overweight or underweight dog.Inquire about possible prescription diets for your dog: Is there a prescription diet that is appropriate for maintaining proper weight in a diabetic dog?

See if your dog is constantly thirsty.,
Notice if your dog sleeps more than usual.,
Check your dog's eyesight.,
Visit your vet immediately if you notice these symptoms.,
Run tests.",How to Detect Diabetes in Dogs2," One of the most obvious signs of diabetes is excessive drinking. As high glucose levels lead to dehydration, your dog will need to drink more and more water. A dog with diabetes will drink a lot more water than usual.As a result, your dog will start urinating more. Often times, pet owners will notice that their dog starts urinating in the house or in its own bed.

Do not limit the dog's water intake. Your dog needs the amount of water it is drinking to keep itself hydrated.

, A key sign of diabetes is increased lethargy. The dog is tired because the sugar doesn't get taken up into the cells, so the dog runs low on fuel. The resulting sleepiness is known as ""diabetes fatigue.""

, Long term, diabetic dogs can develop cataracts. In addition, diabetic dogs run the risk of sudden blindness from diabetic retinopathy (a disease affecting the retina at the back of the eye)., Diabetes that isn't treated can lead to further health complications. The vet will want to perform blood tests to see how high the levels of glucose are in your dog's bloodstream and to make sure no other organs have been affected by the diabetes.

, There are multiple tests (blood and urine) that your veterinarian will perform to diagnose your dog. Taken alone, any one of these tests cold indicate a wide range of conditions and illnesses, but taken together, they'll let your vet know if your dog suffers from diabetes mellitus.


A urinalysis is a chemical examination of your dog's urine. In the first instance the vet will ask for a urine sample for a dipstick test. If there's no sugar in the urine then diabetes isn't likely. If sugar is present then blood tests are necessary.A blood glucose test will be performed next. This can be done on a single pin prick of blood. Again, if levels are normal then diabetes is ruled out. If the levels are high then a full blood panel is warranted.
A CBC evaluates the level of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your dog's blood stream. If the vet finds higher levels of white blood cells, this could indicate a urinary tract infection — common in diabetic dogs. Low red blood count could indicate dehydration. It could also mean that your dog is suffering from ruptured red blood cells.
A serum biochemistry profile is taken from a separate blood sample. This test focuses on monitoring sugar levels and other materials in your dog's blood like enzymes, lipids (fats), proteins, and cellular waste. While abnormalities of any kind may indicate diabetes, vets primarily look at the serum glucose (sugar). Normally taken after the dog has fasted, any elevated glucose level likely indicates diabetes.
In addition, the vet may order a blood fructosamine test. This gives an overview of blood sugar levels for the preceding two to three weeks. This is significant because a single high blood glucose result is not conclusive for diabetes, as stress can cause temporary elevations. Thus either a blood glucose curve (tracking the sugar levels over the course of 24 hours) or a fructosamine, is advisable in order to confirm the diagnosis.

"
Understand what a diuretic does.,
Get the diuretic furosemide for your dog.,
Talk to your vet about giving your dog spironolactone.",How to Treat Heart Failure in Dogs2," A diuretic is a drug that helps to move retained fluid from the body. During heart failure fluid leaks out of the circulatory system and builds up either within the lungs (pulmonary edema), inside the chest cavity (pleural effusion), or in the abdomen (ascites). Each of these scenarios means the heart has to work even harder to push blood through the tissues and bring about effective oxygen exchange.


Getting rid of, or reducing, the amount of retained fluid helps to reduce the load on your dog’s heart. This reduces the effort the heart has to put into circulating blood.

, Furosemide is a ""loop diuretic"" which means it works by stopping sodium and chloride (which make up salt) from being reabsorbed by your dog’s kidneys. This then causes your dog to urinate more, which helps to get rid of salt buildup.


Furosemide is generally administered twice a day at a dose of 2 mg per kg body weight. For example, a 10 kg Cavalier King Charles Spaniel would start at a dose of 20 mg twice a day. This medication is available in 20 mg and 40 mg tablets, and a 50 mg/ml injectable form.Feed your dog bananas while giving him furosemide. Long term use of furosemide can cause your dog’s potassium levels to drop. To replenish the potassium, you can feed your dog one banana each day., Spironolactone is generally prescribed when you cannot increase your dog’s dose of furosemide any further. This drug works to bind to mineralocorticoid receptors in your dog’s kidney, heart, and blood vessels. Mineralocorticoid receptors help to regulate water transportation and maintain normal salt levels.


Spironolactone is generally prescribed as 2 mg per kg once daily by mouth, with food. It comes in 10, 40, and 80 mg tablets. For example, a typical 10 kg Cavalier would take half a 40 mg tablet once daily with food."

Have the fluid drained from your dog’s chest for short-term relief.,
Try an ace-inhibitor.,
Give your dog the ace-inhibitor Enalapril.,
Talk to your vet about getting your dog a positive inotrope.,
Consider giving your dog the positive inotrope Pimobendan.",How to Treat Heart Failure in Dogs3," If a lot of fluid has built up in your dog’s abdomen, your vet might recommend having the fluid drained. This will provide your dog with temporary relief because when the fluid is drained, his diaphragm will be able to expand more fully and pressure will be taken off of his vital organs. Unfortunately, the fluid will most likely return, though how long that will take depends on how sick your dog is.To drain the fluid, the vet will:


Pass a sterile needle or special catheter, passed through your dog’s previously clipped and sterilized skin. Suction is applied via a closed collection system, such as a syringe with a three-way tap, until all the fluid has been removed.
Most good natured dogs do not need to be sedated for this procedure, and will only need to be given some local anesthetic.

, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a drug that, like diuretics, decrease the heart’s workload. They work by increasing the blood flow out of the heart. Angiotensin plays a role in blood vessel contraction and salt retention.


When blood vessels contract, it makes it harder for blood to circulate throughout your dog’s body. An ACE inhibitor prevents this action and helps blood vessels to open up.

, One such ACE inhibitor is the drug enalapril. The recommended dose is 0.25-1 mg per kg given once daily, although in severely ill patients it can be given twice daily. Enalapril comes in 1, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg tablets. A 10 kg cavalier needs a single 10 mg enalapril tablet once a day., A positive inotrope is a drug that makes the heart muscle pump more strongly. Some inotropes also help to regulate the heart rate, and slow it slightly. This is helpful because a racing heart does not give itself time to fill fully before contracting, and this means the volume of blood pushed out with each stroke is less than optimal. It is more efficient to slow the heart slightly, let it fully fill, and then pump.

, Pimobendan encourages the heart muscles to respond to calcium more effectively, which in turn helps the heart muscle to contract more strongly. It also decreases the stickiness of platelets, meaning they are less likely to stick together in the circulation and cause a stroke.The dose is generally 0.1-0.3mg per kg, given twice daily. You should give the medication to your dog at least one hour before he eats. Pimobendan is currently only available as Vetmedin (this is the brand name), and comes in 1.25 mg and 5 mg tablets. A 10 kg Cavalier would take one 1.25 mg tablet twice daily.

Adjust your dog’s medication.",How to Diagnose and Treat Transient Diabetes in Dogs," A dog with transient diabetes will have temporary hyperglycemia. This temporary rise in blood glucose may be due to a stressful disease or medications that inhibit insulin function.Telltale signs of diabetes include increased water intake and urination, increased appetite, and weight loss.Signs of advanced diabetes can include anorexia, depression, and vomiting.The signs of diabetes seen with transient diabetes are not different than those associated with other types of diabetes (type 1 and type 2).;
, Transient diabetes can also occur in intact female dogs when they are in heat (ready to mate).A female dog in heat will have a bloody discharge coming from its vagina. The vagina may also be swollen, but the swelling might not be detectable.Pregnancy can also cause transient diabetes. During pregnancy, levels of the sex hormone progesterone increase. Progesterone inhibits insulin function, allowing blood glucose levels to rise., Certain medications, such as steroids, can inhibit insulin function, leading to hyperglycemia. Transient diabetes caused by steroids can cause a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).Along with the common signs of diabetes, DKA can cause anorexia and vomiting. Powerful, short-acting insulin is commonly used to treat DKA in dogs.Because of the risk of transient diabetes, vets usually do not keep dogs on steroid medications for long periods of time.

, Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It is a serious disease that can prevent the pancreas from functioning normally, and can lead to transient diabetes. Pancreatitis can make dogs very sick, so take your dog to your vet if you see signs of this disease. Below are some symptoms you may notice:Anorexia
Vomiting
Weakness
Diarrhea

, Having your dog examined by your vet will be the best way to confirm a diagnosis of transient diabetes. Even if you see signs of diabetes, it may be hard for you to know whether these signs indicate transient diabetes. Your vet will perform a physical exam and run various diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis.


During your dog's appointment, provide information to your vet about what you've noticed at home. For example, let your vet know if your dog is in heat, and if you've noticed signs of diabetes.

, As with other forms of diabetes in dogs (types 1 and 2 diabetes), transient diabetes causes hyperglycemia. Your vet may take a small blood sample to test the blood using a blood glucose monitor. Or, your vet will take a larger sample to perform a more thorough analysis of your dog’s blood.


Full blood work will allow your vet to see if there are any other underlying diseases causing the transient diabetes. These diseases would cause changes in different components of your dog’s blood.
If you have a female dog, your vet may want to test the levels of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone) in your dog’s blood. Increased progesterone levels could suggest transient diabetes if other signs of diabetes are present.

, Glucose in the urine (‘glycosuria’) is a classic sign of diabetes in dogs. Your vet will likely take a sample of your dog’s urine to look for glucose. They may also look for ketones in the urine, which is a sign of DKA.Ketones are substances that end up in the urine when a dog is using fat instead of sugar for energy., Once your vet diagnoses transient diabetes in your dog, you can begin treating your dog for the condition. As with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you will give your dog insulin to reverse the hyperglycemia.Your vet will prescribe insulin and instruct you on how often to give the insulin.


Several insulin products are available for dogs.
Insulin is a liquid medication that you will inject in the subcutaneous space (area just under the skin). After you draw up the prescribed amount of insulin into the syringe, create a skin tent just behind your dog's neck and stick the needle into the tent., If your vet identified an underlying condition, such as pancreatitis, pregnancy, or being in heat, they will recommend a treatment plan for that specific condition.For example, if your dog has pancreatitis, treatment will be vigorous and include fluid therapy, nutritional support, pain medication, and anti-nausea medication.If your female dog is pregnant or in heat, your vet will recommend spaying your dog.This surgical procedure involves removing the ovaries and uterus. Spaying will lower your dog’s progesterone levels, which should help your dog’s internal insulin start working again.

, If steroid medication caused your dog’s transient diabetes, your vet will start slowly reducing the steroid dosage. Steroid medication should not be stopped all at once. A sudden stop of steroid use can cause a dog to develop Cushing’s disease. Your vet will taper your dog’s steroid dosage over several weeks.Cushing’s disease occurs when the adrenal glands, located near the kidneys, produce too much of the hormone cortisol.

Get your doberman screened for the condition.,
Consider medicine to decrease the amount of work the heart needs to do.,
Discuss the need for medicine that regulates the heartbeat.,
Administer drugs to ease suffering.,
Limit your expectations.",How to Treat Heart Conditions in Doberman Pinschers1," DCM affects young to middle aged dogs. It is now known that early treatment with a drug called pimobendan before symptoms develop can protect the heart in dogs that have DCM. Therefore it's important to screen your Doberman for the condition even if they show no signs.


Pimobendan is proven to increase survival times by improving the ability of the heart to contract.Pimobendan needs to be given on an empty stomach, an hour before food. Two doses, 12 hours apart are given on a daily basis.;
, Treatment helps improve the way the heart works, usually through the administration of drugs. Drugs work in a number of ways, including improving the strength of contraction of the heart muscle. A family of drugs, called ACE inhibitors, are often given to dogs with heart failure. Basically, these medicines dilate the blood vessels in the dog's body to remove resistance to blood flow.Discuss these as an option with your veterinarian.


Less resistance means the heart has less work to do to push blood around the body.

, Some medicines slow a racing heart or control an irregular heart beat if present. These can be very important for decreasing the chances of sudden death, due to overexertion. Like the other medicines used to control a doberman's heart issues, talk to your veterinarian about the best treatment for your specific dog.


Even with these medications, it is sensible not to over exert a Doberman with DCM, especially if it is showing clinical signs of the illness. Extreme exertion could overload the heart and cause sudden death.

, For example, diuretics may be given as your dog deteriorates to help to shift the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and belly. This will help the dog to breath.The dog will drink more and urinate more while on diuretics. Even while it drinks more fluid, this will have the effect of shifting fluid out of body compartments.

, Unfortunately, once dogs start to show signs of heart disease, their life is often limited to months, rather than years.Give your dog good end of life care by feeding it foods it loves, showering it with affection, and easing its suffering when necessary.

Be aware that no symptoms may present.,
Know the treatment options.",How to Diagnose Heart Conditions in Doberman Pinschers," One of the symptoms of heart disease includes different respiratory problems. These respiratory problems occur because the heart has trouble pumping oxygen to the body and your dog's heart has to work harder to get blood flowing throughout the body.Your dog may exhibit an unusual shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or labored breathing. If these symptoms persist more than a few days, you should take your dog to the vet.Fluid in the lungs may trigger coughing fits, so your dog may also start coughing while he is at rest. If your dog coughs for more than three days, you should take him to the vet.
Your dog also might start panting more than he used to.;
, Heart disease may cause your dog to have a distended abdomen. This is due to a build of of fluid in the area due to increased resistance to blood flow, causing fluid to leak out of the blood vessels and accumulate in the body cavities.


The abdomen area may start to develop a pear shape. This is due to fluid building in the liver and abdomen area.
If your Doberman has a distended abdomen, take her to the vet immediately.

, Heart disease is accompanied by some behavioral changes. Your dog may experience weight loss. He may also be unable to exercise as he did before due to restricted oxygen flow. Because of the lack of blood and oxygen circulation, he may become tired sooner than he used to and be less active than he was before.Some dogs also faint because of the heart condition.
Many of these symptoms also point to other health problems, so if your dog exhibits any of these conditions, take him to the vet to get checked out.

, The signs of heart conditions can occur at anytime, including when Dobermans are puppies. However, most signs start presenting between the ages of four to 10.Symptoms can appear suddenly, which means your dog might go from being seemingly fine to sick very suddenly.

, One of the problems associated with heart disease is that in the early stages, there may be no outward signs of a problem. This means the dog has to get regular screening tests in order to pick up signs of a damaged heart before the dog starts to struggle physically.


Experts suggest once yearly screening with the dog wearing a 24-hour ECG monitor. This helps to pick up the earliest clues that heart problems may be present.
This is important because researchers now have evidence that a drug called pimobendan, when given at the very earliest stage, can extend life., If you notice any of the signs of heart disease, get your dog checked by a vet as soon as possible. This helps ensure your dog gets proper treatment. The vet will perform a careful physical examination of her to assess her body condition and to get an overall picture of her health.

, As an initial assessment of the heart, your vet will listen to its beating pattern. Your vet will use a stethoscope to check your dog's heart rate, the heart rhythm, listening for murmurs, and making sure each heart beat is followed by a pulse in the back leg.Listening alone is not sufficient to reach a diagnosis, but if a problem is detected, it raises the importance of conducting further tests. Clues such as a racing heart rate, skipped heart beats, or a heart murmur only develop once the heart has started to struggle, and so only appear in the more advanced stages of heart disease.

, To investigate further, the vet may run an ECG, which looks at the electrical impulses from the heart. This gives a detailed picture of whether or not the heart rhythm is abnormal.


Before signs of heart disease are evident, a ECG is a good screening test to look for the disease.
Since irregular heartbeats can be intermittent, a 24-hour trace of your dog's heart is needed before a dog can be given the all clear for that year. This means that your vet will equip your dog with a device like the Holter harness, which is a 24-hour monitor designed for dogs. Unlike an ECG or EKG performed in the vet office, a device like a Holter harness will continuously record the heart for 24 hours whereas an ECG usually only lasts for five minutes.The gold standard for Dobermans is to have a Holter trace taken once a year when he is healthy so as to pick up the first signs early and start medication., In dogs that are showing physical signs of heart disease, the vet may take radiographs of the dog's chest. This gives information as to whether or not fluid is present in the lungs, which can help the vet decide on the most suitable medication for the dog.


A cardiac ultrasound scan is a sensitive and invaluable way of monitoring the progression of the heart condition. It gives a 2D image in real time of the heart's contractions and allows the vet to take measurements, which show how efficient the heart is at pumping. The higher the measurements, the more serious the problem, and the measurements allow the vet to track progression of the disease., Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common and most serious heart disease Doberman pinschers develop. When your Doberman has dilated cardiomyopathy, her heart is basically like a balloon that’s been stretched and is lacking in tone. This means that the heart no longer has the elastic recoil it once had, which in turn means it's not so good at contracting to push blood around the body.Dobermans can also have septal defects, valve disease, pulmonic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, among other heart conditions.Having your Doberman screened for DCM will help your vet detect any other heart conditions as well.

, Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common condition for the Doberman. Unfortunately, it tends to be severe. It is a genetic condition, where affected parents pass the gene down to their puppies.The condition is connected to genetic mutations in the Doberman pinscher breed.Breeders should not breed any dogs with known heart conditions, especially DCM.
When you are buying a Doberman from a breeder, make sure to talk to the breeder about testing for DCM in the parent dogs.

, Because of the nature of the heart disease in Dobermans, your dog may never show any symptoms. Sometimes, Dobermans will just die suddenly with no symptoms, or present symptoms and die very soon afterwards.Death from heart disease can even occur in puppies or young dogs.This is why it’s so important to get your dog screened so you can discover if he has heart disease and manage it before death or irreversible damage occurs.

, A variety of heart meds are available which can support the heart. However, there is no cure for dilated cardiomyopathy. Once a dog is diagnosed with DCM, the best case scenario is that drugs extend survival time and give the owner more good quality time with the dog before the inevitable decline occurs.

"

Understand what dilated cardiomyopathy is.,
Pay attention to signs of exhaustion.,
Notice if your doberman is having trouble breathing.,
Look for an enlarged belly.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian if you suspect DCM.",How to Treat Heart Conditions in Doberman Pinschers2," The name of this condition describes what it's about. Taken literally ""dilated"" means stretched, ""cardiac"" means heart, ""myo"" means muscle, and ""pathy"" means abnormal. Thus, dilated cardiomyopathy is an abnormal stretching of the heart muscle.Think of a balloon that you blow up and let down several times. The balloon walls become baggy and stretched, and the empty balloon is saggy rather than tight. This is what happens with the heart muscle. It loses its elastic recoil and the heart behaves like a saggy balloon.

, This condition means the heart doesn't contract with normal force and each heart beat is weaker and less efficient. The dog may be able to cope at rest but when the heart needs to respond during exercise, it is unable to meet the demands and the dog becomes weak or even faints.


Signs that a Doberman may have a heart problem include persistent tiredness, lethargy, and weakness., Changes in the dynamics of the blood flow means that blood can pool downstream of the heart. This causes symptoms such as congested lungs and fluid build up.When the lungs become congested this causes the dog to cough. It may have labored breathing or use its abdominal muscles to aid its breathing.
Such dogs are often reluctant to exercise, as they can't breath when they do.

, A further sign is build up of fluid in the abdomen is that the belly begins to swell. This can be distinguished from obesity by the fact that the ribs and backbone are clearly visible through the skin due to weight loss.

, The veterinarian will most likely use an ultrasound examination where the clinician measures the thickness of the walls of the ventricles (the main pumping chambers in the heart) and the force with which they contract.This will be assessed to see if it is normal or abnormal.


Alternatively, a 24 hour Holter monitor harness can pick up abnormal heartbeats that occur erratically as a result of DCM.Both these tests help identify dogs in the very earliest stages of the condition so that medication can be started. However, the timing of onset of the disease varies between dogs with the DCM gene. Because of this, regular yearly screening is advised in order to catch dogs that have deteriorated since a normal screening.

"
"
Look for the general signs of heart problems.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Get your dog appropriate treatment.",How to Treat Heart Conditions in Doberman Pinschers3," While DCM is by far the most common heart condition in dobermans, these dogs can have other heart issues. The signs of congestive heart failure, and other health problems related to heart disease, include:Coughing: If your dog is coughing regularly for an extended period of time, for example more than three days, then it should be looked at by a veterinarian.
Problems Breathing: This could be while the dog is at rest or if it gets winded after very mild exercise.
Changes in Behavior: If your dog becomes withdrawn, less energetic, and tired all the time, then that could be a sign of a health condition affecting its quality of life.
Weight Loss or Gain: A heart condition could affect your doberman's appetite, whether increasing it or decreasing it. This is also a symptom of a variety of health problems, so any extreme change in appetite or weight should be checked out by a veterinarian.
Fainting and Collapsing: This is a sign that your dog may have a serious health problem, one of which could be a heart condition. If your dog faints or collapses, get it seen by a veterinarian immediately.

, If you suspect a heart condition, or some other serious health problem, the best thing you can do is get your dog checked out by a veterinarian. The veterinarian will be able to assess the physical health of your dog and give you some indication about what is going on.


Your dog's illness may be very obvious to the veterinarian or it may take some testing and sleuthing on your veterinarian's part. Be open to your veterinarian running multiple tests on your dog to help them figure out what the problem is. These could include an echocardiogram, a blood test, a Holter monitor, or electrocardiogram, among others., Depending on the seriousness and exact diagnosis, treatment for different heart conditions varies. Some diseases can be treated with medication, even forms of heart failure, while others need surgery to correct.Discuss the options with your veterinarian and decide what is best for your dog and you.


You need to take your dog's quality of life, its age, and your financial stability into account when deciding on what treatment to go forward with. For example, older dogs with heart failure may just need palliative care, as opposed to treatment that seeks to fix the problem.

Take your dog’s respiration rate when it is calm.,
Count how many breaths your dog takes for one full minute.,
Use a stopwatch.,
Use a journal to record your dog’s respiratory rate.,
Download the “Your Dog’s Heart” App.,
Make sure to share this information with your vet.,
Visit the vet if your dog’s respiratory rate exceeds 30 breaths per minute.,
Call the vet immediately, if your dog seems to be gasping for air.,
Take your dog to the vet if it has an increased respiratory rate combined with other symptoms of illness.",How to Measure a Dog's Respiration Rate," In order to determine your dog’s respiration rate, make sure that it is calm. Dogs naturally increase their blood oxygen levels while at play or when anxious. This means that they breathe more in order to circulate more oxygen through their systems. Alternatively, if your dog has just finished playing and is hot, it will increase its breathing rate to exhale the heat in their bodies, in an effort to cool themselves down. Wait until your dog is sitting still or laying down to take its respiratory rate., You don’t need to hold you hand in front of your dog’s nose, nor do you need to flip it over and feel for its lungs. These activities will only make your dog more nervous, which in turn will elevate its respiratory rate. Simply sit close enough to your dog to see its sides. Watch as its chest/torso expands and contracts. One breath is made up of one inhale and one exhale.The normal respiratory rate for a dog is between 15 and 30 breaths per minute. Excited and overheated dogs may exceed this number. Just watch their condition and make sure they return to the safe range if you are concerned.

, If you don’t have a stopwatch, use the second hand on your watch. For the first couple of times that you take your dog’s respiratory rate, be sure to count for a full minute. After you’ve done it several times and feel confident in your counting ability, you can reduce the time to 30 seconds. Then simply multiply your number by two to get your dog’s breaths per minute rate., Make sure that the journal or piece of paper you use has a space for a date and time, respiratory rate number, and any other comments you might have. Record your dog’s respiratory rate every time you take it, even if you think your dog might be a little excited or hot still. Simply note your dog’s recent activity in the side bar. There are templates online for you to use as well., This app allows its users to count and record the resting respiratory rate of your dog. The application is free and easy to use. You can set reminders to take your pets breath rate. The app will record and chart how their respiratory rate changes overtime. You can even put in a veterinarian’s information and have results sent straight to him. If you have family members that are worried about your pet, you can even use the app to post the data to social media (e.g. Facebook or Twitter)., Whenever you go in for your vet visit, make sure that you share your detailed respiratory rate readings with him. It is important — for better or worse — to share this information. Your vet might notice patterns in your dog’s respiratory rate fluctuations that you may not. Sometimes, these signs can be subtle indicators of heart problems., 15 to 30 is the normal range. This could be a sign of any number of issues ranging from bacterial and viral infections to traumatic injury., Serious lung issues may present themselves in such a dramatic way. Punctured or deflated lungs can be caused by a variety of issues and will certainly affect your dog’s respiratory rate.Be sure to call your vet before you actually visit his offices, just in case your dog shouldn't be moved. If this is the case, your vet will either advise you on what to do or will come to you.

, Coughing or nasal discharge combined with an increased breathing rate often signal issues with the lungs, which can lead to pneumonia."

Assess whether your dog's nose is normally dry.,
Notice if your dog has been in the sun for too long.,
Investigate whether a dry nose is due to a heater.,
Figure out whether your dog is dehydrated.,
Assess the texture.,
Look for changes in color.,
Keep an eye out for discharge.,
Take your dog to a vet when in doubt.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Dry Nose in Dogs," Not all dogs have a wet nose all the time. While a wet nose does increase a dog's ability to smell, as the moisture helps the dog hold onto smells, it is a myth that all healthy dogs have a moist nose all the time.A moist nose allows a dog to smell better because it absorbs scents, allowing the dog to process the smell more thoroughly.Just as you should regularly assess the state of your dog's body, usually done while you are petting or grooming it, it's a good idea to keep an eye on your dog's nose over time. That way you will be able to determine if your dog's nose has changed over time.;
, A dog that has been lying in the sun will usually have a dry nose. The heat of the sun will dry up a moist nose rather quickly. However, if your dog's nose is normally moist it will return to that state quickly after the nose returns to its normal temperature.


The nose and the pads of your dog's paws are two places on a dog's body that can sweat, meaning that they are locations where a dog can get rid of excess heat. If your dog is hot, moisture will evaporate off of its nose, cooling it down., Just like a dog that has been laying in the sun, a dog that has been near a heater may have a dry nose due to the heat. If you are concerned about your dog's nose, but you know it has been laying near a heater, keep an eye on its nose for a few hours after it has moved away from the heat.


If your dog is not ill, the nose should go back to its normal moisture once it has cooled down.
If your dog is panting, that is also a sign that your dog is overheated. This can be a clue that your dog's dry nose is related to heat, and not an underlying illness., One simple and common explanation for a dry nose is that your dog is dehydrated. Make sure that your dog has access to water at all times, especially if it is outside on a hot day.In many cases, your dog can be dehydrated because it is not drinking enough water. Watch how much water your dog is drinking. A healthy dog should be drinking about one ounce of water per pound of weight every day. This means that, for example, a mid-sized dog weighing around 60 pounds should be drinking between a quarter to a half gallon of water every day.Dehydration can be caused by a variety of illnesses as well. If your dog seems to be drinking enough water but it exhibits signs of dehydration, such as excessive panting, dry nose, gums, and mouth, lethargy, and a change in personality, then it should be taken to a veterinarian for evaluation.Dehydration can affect the nose because the nose is used for cooling down. Unlike a human, who can sweat all over, a dog only sweats from its nose and the pads of its paws. If your dog is dehydrated, it won't be able to move moisture to its nose, which cools the dog off as it evaporates. Thus, dehydration will diminish the dogs ability to cool itself off.

, A dry nose may not signal a problem but a cracked nose, especially one that has scabs or sores on it, does signal a problem. If your dog's nose is so dry that it has cracked and looks infected, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian.You will need to be able to judge whether your dog's dry nose is extreme or not. If the nose seems tender, such as your dog being more sensitive than normal to it getting touched, then there may be a problem.

, Changes to the color of your dog's nose may signal that is has a skin disorder or that its nose was sunburned. Dogs that have pink noses can be sunburned, leading to a red nose. If you know that your dog has been in the sun a lot, you should treat the change in color as a sunburn.If your dog's nose is sunburned then you should cool it down when you can. Apply a cold compress to the area.If your dog does not seem to be in pain, then you can usually just let the burn heal naturally. If it is in pain, then you may need to get medicine from your veterinarian to treat the injured area.
Consult with your veterinarian about a sunscreen that can be used on your dog in the future, as well as a treatment that can calm the existing burn. Using sunscreen on a dog with a light-colored nose can prevent serious skin problems, such as skin cancer.
Changes in the color of your dog's nose can also signal skin disorders related to hormone imbalance, allergies, or infections. If your dog's nose changes color and the dog has not been out in the sun, signaling that it is not sunburned, then you should have the dog checked out by a veterinarian., Discharge coming from the nose, in combination with a dry nose, can signal that your dog is sick. This is especially true if the discharge is yellow or green, and not clear as nasal discharge should normally be.If your dog has an especially dry nose combined with nasal discharge that is not clear, take your dog in to its veterinarian for a check up. Your dog may have an infection that could be cleared up with medication.
If your dog has a dry nose and clear nasal discharge it probably just has a minor cold. You should monitor the condition to make sure it doesn't advance, such as the mucus changing from clear to yellow or green and, if you are concerned, call your veterinarian to get advice about whether your particular dog should get looked at by a veterinarian.

, If you cannot identify the cause for your dog's dry nose, take your dog to a vet. There are many reasons that your dog's nose could be dry, so getting an expert opinion can be important.


Your veterinarian may or may not be concerned about your dog's dry nose. Feel free to ask any questions you may have, including whether the dry nose should be a cause for concern.

Provide a full history of your dog’s cough.,
Answer your vet’s questions about the coughing.,

Have your vet perform the necessary diagnostic tests.",How to Diagnose Coughing in Dogs," Coughing in dogs has many causes, including heart disease.The cough is a symptom and can't always be used to determine the cause; however, certain conditions do have distinctive types of cough, which can help point towards the source of the problem. Noticing what time of day your dog coughs can help determine the cough’s cause.


Coughing during the night can be caused by congestive heart failure, fluid buildup in the lungs, or tracheal collapse.Coughing can also occur throughout the day.;
, Sometimes, specific activities can trigger a coughing episode. For example, a dog with a collapsed trachea will cough if it tugs on its collar (the collar will squeeze the trachea) or drinks water. For a dog with heart failure, the cough is often worse at night, when the dog is resting. If a dog has a disease of the esophagus, eating will cause a coughing episode.If a dog has environmental allergies, inhaling a certain allergen (dust) can cause coughing; however, allergies usually aren’t the primary cause of coughing in dogs.Exercise can cause trigger coughing episodes in dogs with tracheal collapse., Some coughs in dogs have very distinctive sounds. The cough caused by tracheal collapse sounds like a goose honk. If a dog has kennel cough, it will have a dry, deep, hacking cough.Don’t worry if your dog’s cough doesn’t have a distinctive sound. Other details about your dog’s cough will help your vet diagnose the cough.

, A cough is considered productive if fluid gets coughed up through the mouth. Pneumonia, which is an infection that causes fluid buildup in the lungs, often causes a productive cough.Other causes of productive coughs include heart disease, heartworms, and kennel cough.Roundworms, which are an intestinal parasite can also cause coughing. During the roundworm lifecycle, the worm may travel to the lungs and cause coughing.A productive cough will sound ""moist,"" meaning that it sounds like fluid is in the throat during the cough.

, If your dog coughs only occasionally, there’s likely no need to take them to the vet; however, there are times when coughing warrants further examination. Look for these signs to help decide if you should take your dog to the vet:Cough lasts more than a few days
Coughing has become more frequent throughout the day
Your dog is becoming more tired and isn’t eating much

, Your vet will need a lot of information from you to diagnose your dog’s cough. During the appointment, give your vet a detailed history of your dog’s cough. Include the following information:When the coughing occurs (only at night, throughout the day)
What triggers the coughing (excitement, eating, exercising, lying down)
What the cough sounds like (goose honk, hacking)
Whether anything gets coughed up (fluid, foreign material)
What type of parasite treatments you use and when they were last applied

, In addition to the initial history you provide, your vet will ask you questions to develop a list of possible coughing causes. Examples of questions your vet may ask include:For how long has your dog been coughing?
Does your dog have trouble breathing?
Have you taken your dog to a groomer or boarding facility recently?
Have you noticed weight gain or loss in your dog?
Does your dog seem more depressed or restless?

, A thorough physical exam will also help your vet diagnose your dog's cough. During the physical exam, your vet will listen closely to your dog’s heart and lungs. They may also press on your dog’s trachea to trigger a cough. If your dog has a coughing problem, pressing on the trachea may trigger coughing that lasts at least several seconds.Your vet will also touch your dog’s lymph nodes to see if they are enlarged to due infection. They will also check your dog’s gums. Gums with very visible blood vessels can indicate heart disease., Depending on your dog’s coughing history and physical exam findings, your vet will recommend diagnostic tests to confirm a coughing diagnosis. Chest x-rays and an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) are useful for diagnosing heart disease as the cause of coughing.Your vet will recommend a fluid sample from your dog’s respiratory tract if they suspect a parasite (roundworms, heartworms) is causing the coughing.Additional diagnostic tests include blood work and a fecal exam.A fecal exam will check for intestinal parasites.
Talk with your vet to decide which combination of tests will help diagnose your dog’s cough.

, After you and your vet decide how to move forward, your vet will run the diagnostic tests. Based on the results of these tests, your vet will confirm the cause of the cough and recommend a treatment plan. Be aware that, if the cause is a chronic disease like heart failure, treatment will likely be for the rest of your dog’s life.

Identify the symptoms of coronavirus.,
Be especially cautious if your dog already has another virus.,
Take a puppy with diarrhea to the veterinarian immediately.,
Suspect coronavirus if your dog has been around other dogs or in a place where other dogs congregate.,
Make sure your dog is hydrated.,
Decide whether to seek a specific diagnosis.,
Allow your vet to take a blood or stool sample from your dog.,
Allow further testing if you are concerned about additional or different infections.",How to Diagnose Canine Coronavirus," Diarrhea is the common symptom, although this can occur for a variety of reasons. The diarrhea related to coronavirus is often very liquid with a foul smell, and yellow-orange in appearance.The diarrhea is often accompanied by stomach cramps, which make the dog depressed and miserable, and its likely to lose interest in food.


Unlike with parvovirus, vomiting is rare.
The diarrhea usually persists for several days, and if the dog is supported through this period so that it doesn't become dehydrated, its immune system should fight off the infection and make a recovery.;
, A dog that is fighting two infections, such as parvovirus and coronavirus, is less able to cope and is less likely to recover. However, in itself coronavirus is not as serious as distemper or parvovirus and adult dogs often survive infection.


Indeed, it should also be noted that many adult dogs that are well test positive for coronavirus, which is a sign of previous infection but they made a full recovery, and are now immune to further coronavirus infection., The biggest danger is to very young puppies (under 12 weeks of age), who tend to be physically weak and lack a fully functional immune system. They are vulnerable to death from fluid loss causing dehydration and organ failure.


Indeed, young puppies are also at greatest risk of picking up other infections, especially if kept in insanitary conditions, which further reduces their ability to cope and decreases their chances of survival., It is a highly infectious virus which persists in the environment and can be picked up when a dog sniffs or licks infected feces. Thus, a dog does not need direct contact with another dog to acquire infection.


This also means that places where groups of dogs congregate, such as a kennels or day-care, have the potential to act as a source of infection unless scrupulous hygiene and cleaning is observed.Happily, the virus is readily destroyed by most disinfectants.Once a dog acquires infection, the virus replicates (reproduces) in the gut wall in the first two-thirds of the bowel. The incubation period between infection and clinical signs of illness can be just one to four days.

, Any dog that has diarrhea should be closely monitored to make sure they are drinking water regularly and not vomiting it back. Check regularly for dehydration by lifting the skin of the scruff away from the neck and then letting it go. The skin should snap immediately back into place. If it takes a second or two to slip back down, the dog is dehydrated and veterinary support is required.


However, if you have a young puppy diarrhea don't even wait, but seek the advice of your veterinarian since puppies can deteriorate alarmingly quickly.

, There is no specific treatment for coronavirus, so knowing exactly which bug is causing diarrhea or illness may not necessarily alter the therapy given.


If your funds are limited, there is an argument that the money is best spent giving the puppy supportive care, such as intravenous fluids against dehydration and medication. This should decrease stomach cramps and help the dog feel better more quickly.

, In cases where it's appropriate to put a name on the infectious agent, then the veterinarian can either use feces or blood. A sample of feces can be sent for electron microscopy to look for the presence of the coronavirus. This virus has a typical appearance with a ""crown"" or ""corona"" of spikes sticking out from the surface. Alternatively the vet may take blood samples. Different tests are available and the choice is up to the individual clinician and the facilities of the lab they deal with.


However, viruses are too small to see with a regular light microscope and it requires the advanced technology and magnification of an electron microscope to detect them. This means sending the sample away to a specialist lab for analysis. Virus isolation looks for the presence of the virus in the bloodstream, while antibody titres look for the defense response mounted by the body in the face of coronavirus infection. These tests can give vital clues that the dog has been in contact with coronavirus.
However, exposure does not necessarily mean illness. Think of vaccination and how a low level of the infectious agent is given in order to provoke an immune response. Just because virus is present in the body, doesn't automatically mean it is this that is making the dog ill.
The vet will make a decision about the significance of the finding based on how compelling the levels are (low or high) and the pet's physical symptoms and how seriously ill they are., Further testing can build up the bigger picture. For example, could the dog have more than one problem, such as infection with parvovirus plus coronavirus. Further testing of the blood or feces could also identify different infectious agents that produce similar symptoms but have a treatment option (such as giardia or campylobacter). Tests that come back negative can also help to rule coronavirus off the list of possibilities. Further testing will cost you more money, especially if you don't have pet insurance. That is why it is up to you to decide whether or not to move forward.

, If you suspect your dog has kennel cough, call your vet and schedule an appointment. Your vet will be able to accurately diagnose your dog.


Let your veterinarian know that you would like to treat your dog with natural remedies. Your vet should be able to recommend safe products and methods to treat kennel cough naturally.
If your dog’s symptoms become worse, for example it develops a loss of appetite, becomes lethargic, or the cough gets worse, contact your vet immediately.

, Kennel cough is very contagious. It can be transmitted through the air or through contact with contaminated objects. If you own other pets, make sure to isolate your sick dog from these pets. Isolate your dog’s bed, toys, and food dishes in a separate room. Confine your dog to this room for at least a week, or until you see your dog’s symptoms improve. Make sure your other pets are in a separate room if you need to let your dog out.

, A kennel cough is a very dry cough. Therefore, keep the air in the room, or the area your dog is staying in, moist. Use a humidifier or a vaporizer to keep the air moist. Place the humidifier near your dog’s sleeping area, or in the room your dog is staying in.Make sure to keep your dog away from smoke, as well as other irritating and noxious fumes., Steam is also an effective way to remedy your dog’s cough. Steam will open up your dog’s bronchial tubes and break up phlegm.With the door closed, turn on your shower as hot as it can go, and let the room steam up for 15 to 20 minutes. Bring your dog into the bathroom, and sit with it for 15 to 25 minutes to let your dog breathe in the steam.

, Honey will help soothe your dog’s dry throat. It also has anti-bacterial properties. Give your dog a teaspoon or two of honey per day until its symptoms improve. Buy an all-natural honey., Coconut oil is thought to have beneficial properties that may help combat your dog's kennel cough. Pour two teaspoons of coconut oil over your dog’s food daily, or let your dog lick it from a spoon.Remember, coconut oil is high in calories, so feeding a dog too much is not recommended. Likewise, dogs who need a low fat diet for weight loss or other health-related reasons should not be given coconut oil.

, Chicken stock is great way to soothe your dog’s throat while ensuring it gets important vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Before feeding your dog, mix your dog’s kibble or drinking water with the chicken stock.


This is a particularly helpful method if your dog’s appetite decreases because of the cough.

, While your dog is recovering, make sure it gets adequate rest. Try not to exercise or play with your dog too much. Also, try to provide a stress-free environment. Too much activity and stress can weaken your dog’s immune system and prevent it from recovering.Keep your dog calm and relaxed by being calm and relaxed yourself. Limit screaming and yelling in the house. Also, limit other activities that can cause your dog to stress, like trimming your dog’s nails or giving it a bath.
Because a leash can irritate your dog’s throat and make a cough worse, use a leash attached to a harness if you walk your dog.Kennel cough is usually treated with a week or two of rest., Probiotics are a great way to boost your dog’s immune system. Keeping your dog’s immune system up is critical when treating kennel cough. You can buy probiotics specifically made for your dog from your local pet supply store. Probiotics come in several different forms, such as powders, capsules, chews, and dog food.Sprinkle a recommended dosage of probiotics on your dog's food before they eat.
If your dog is on an anti-biotic prescribed by the vet, make sure to wait at least two hours before administering the probiotic. If not, the two will cancel each other out., Another great way to boost your dog’s immune system is to supplement its diet with vitamins. Particularly, vitamin C is a great immune booster. Make sure to buy vitamins that are made specifically for dogs. You can buy them from your local pet supply store.Dog vitamins usually come in the form of soft, chewable tablets. You can either place a tablet in your dog's food bowl with its meal, or give your dog a tablet after it is finished eating.
The recommended dosage depends on your dog’s weight. Check the back of the bottle to see how much your dog needs.

Look out for a cough.Canine influenza is oftentimes confused with kennel cough, as both infections affect the respiratory tract.,
Watch for unusual moisture and wetness around your dog's nose.Your dog may have nasal discharge as a symptom of canine influenza.,
Observe for unusual lethargy and fatigue.If your dog is infected with canine influenza, he or she will be more tired as his or her immune system works overtime trying to fight off the virus.,
Consider your dog's appetite.Has he or she been eating less than usual lately?,
Be aware of risk factors.If your dog has recently been in public places (with other dogs), such as doggy daycare, a doggy boarding place, or to the local dog park, his or her risk of contracting the dog flu is higher than for dogs who are relatively isolated and stay at home.,
Get a diagnostic test.If you are worried that your dog has come down with canine influenza, your best bet is to see the veterinarian for an official diagnostic test.,
Begin treatment.If your dog has canine influenza, the vet can inform you about treatment options.,
Understand that being vaccinated does not prevent your dog from catching the dog flu.There is currently a vaccine available for the H3N8 strain of dog flu.",How to Diagnose Dog Flu," If your dog is coughing or showing other respiratory signs or difficulty breathing, you should bring him or her to the vet to be tested for (and possibly diagnosed with) canine influenza.;
, You will notice moisture and secretions in excess of your dog's usual ""wet nose""!

, Your dog may also have a fever, although this can be harder to detect without the tools and experience of a veterinarian.

, A decreased appetite is another sign that your dog may be suffering from canine influenza.

, This is because the virus is transmitted directly from dog to dog. Therefore, if your dog has been out and about with other dogs, the likelihood of him or her catching canine influenza is significantly higher.

, This can tell you for sure whether or not your dog has come down with the dog flu.


The vet will take a nasal sample, which will then be analyzed in the lab to test for the presence of canine influenza., Treatment is mainly ""supportive,"" meaning that your dog should get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and receive medications for symptom management. Although there is no cure for the virus itself, with the proper support (and sometimes antibiotics as well to prevent further infection) your dog should recover within a week or so.

, It comes as two shots, given several weeks apart, for approximately $50 per shot. However, the vaccine does not cover against the H3N2 strain of dog flu. Therefore, even if your dog has been vaccinated, it is still possible for him or her to catch the H3N2 strain of canine influenza and, if he or she shows symptoms suspicious of dog flu, it is best to see a vet.

Consider surgery if the condition is severe.",How to Diagnose Aortic Stenosis in German Shorthaired Pointers," A puppy born with aortic stenosis may show no symptoms at all. This may be especially true if the problem is mild and the heart is able to compensate for the problem. However, Aortic Stenosis is a genetic condition, meaning that the problem may be passed down from parents to puppies. Get the health records of the parents, and grandparents, if you can, to see if the disease is in the puppy's genetic history.;
, With this disease, the aorta is abnormally narrow, which causes turbulence in the blood flow leaving the heart. Your veterinarian may be able to hear this with a stethoscope when he or she listens to the dog's chest.


An aortic stenosis refers to a narrowing of the aorta, which is the main artery leaving the heart that carries oxygenated blood to the organs. Blood leaving the heart via the aorta is under a huge amount of pressure, as the heart is providing the energy to push blood all the way around the body. If the aorta is narrowed, this adds resistance to the heart as it pumps., Unfortunately, the signs of aortic stenosis are not specific to this condition. With aortic stenosis, the heart has to pump extra hard to overcome the extra resistance caused by the narrow aorta.If the narrowing is severe or the heart is fatigued, there is a restriction on the circulation of blood to the rest of the body and the dog starts to show clinical signs of heart disease. If your dog has any of these symptoms of heart disease, you should take it to the vet to get checked out:


Tires easily: The dog is happy but tires easily with exercise, play, or exertion. This is a very subjective thing but you know your own dog. If the dog's endurance starts to drop and it regularly lags behind where once it would have bounded ahead then take note.
Cough: The dog coughs persistently. The cough is due to a buildup of fluid in the lungs and tends to be a moist. How often the dog coughs depends on the severity of the fluid build up. In mild cases, it might be infrequent (a few times a day) while in more advanced cases the cough could be several times an hour.
Fainting: The dog faints or has brief episodes of collapse that are triggered by getting up from rest or by exercise.
Blue-tinged gums: A blue tinge to the gums and the membranes lining the mouth, which gets worse when the dog exercises.

, When a puppy or a dog visits the vet for a check-up or vaccination, it is routine to listen to its heart sounds using a stethoscope. Aortic stenosis causes turbulence in the blood as it leaves the heart. This turbulence may be heard as a murmur.


If the narrowing is only slight, then the murmur may be too quiet to hear. However, in moderate or severe cases the vet may hear a heart murmur. The loudness of the murmur can often be related to the severity of the aortic stenosis.The narrowing can worsen as a dog grows larger, so a murmur can develop up to the age of 12 months., It is not possible to be definite about the nature of the problem based on listening alone. There are several different heart abnormalities that also present with a heart murmur in young dogs, such as PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), VSD (ventricular septal defect) and mitral valve disease.The treatment and long-term outlook vary depending on the cause. This means it is important to investigate further and be sure what the problem is.

, In an adult dog, if the clinician hears a murmur it could be ""innocent"" or a sign of distress. A blood test can be done to figure out if the murmur is a cause for concern.The proBNP blood test looks for markers in the blood that signal that the heart muscle is distressed.


This is useful to know in adult dogs because it can help determine how serious the problem is and if investigation and treatment are required.
This is not so useful in puppies. A loud murmur indicates a severe problem, so the test isn't necessary. If the problem is mild then the chances are that the heart hasn't become fatigued yet, so a normal blood test may give a false sense of security.

, This will allow you to see how your dog is coping with the condition. X-rays can show a clinician how the heart and lungs are coping. For example, x-rays can show if there is fluid build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema), which is a sign that the heart is struggling and treatment is required.On an x-ray that is taken looking down on the dog's backbone, a bulge in the aorta just after the narrowing may be evident. When looking at the heart as a clock face, the bulge is located at around 12 - 1 pm position.

, An electrocardiogram (ECG) is another test that can give information about the heart's health but does not specifically diagnose aortic stenosis. The ECG readings can show enlargement of the left ventricle, which is the chamber that pushes blood through the aorta and is under maximum stress.Once the heart muscle becomes fatigued it tends to thicken and the chamber enlarges, as suggested on an ECG trace.

, This will give the most complete picture of the aortic stenosis. If you are short of money and can afford only one test, then an echocardiogram is your best option. This is because this type of ultrasound exam images the heart and the great vessels and gives a 2D picture of their structure and shape.


In the hands of a skilled ultrasound operator it is possible to see both the narrowing of the aorta and the 'post-stenotic bulge' (the bulge after the narrowing). It is also possible to see the blood flow within the aorta and to visualize the turbulence within the aorta.The operator can also measure the thickness of the left ventricular wall, which can give information about how well or poorly the heart is coping.

, The treatment options depend on the severity of the aortic stenosis and the age of the dog. A mild case may not need treatment. If heart failure develops in later life then treatment with diuretics to relieve congestion in the lungs is advisable.


As with all serious health problems in your pets, you need to balance your desire for the animal to live a long and happy life, its quality of life, and your ability to pay for medical care. It is a good idea to have veterinary insurance for your pet, so that the cost is not the determining factor in your medical choices.

, In some cases, drugs that slow a racing heart beat can help the heart function more effectively. Also, if the dog is prone to fainting or collapse, then restricting the amount of exercise it gets is important. This will help to avoid overloading the heart, which can cause fatality., In a young dog with a severe stenosis, a specialist veterinary cardiologist may consider doing surgery. The surgery consists of dilating the narrowing using special techniques called balloon valvuloplasty.


However, there are real risks to this procedure. Most importantly, it is risky to give a dog with a severe heart problem anesthetic and this procedure does run the risk of completely rupturing the aorta.

Be cautious bringing your dog to social venues.It is important to know that places where there are many dogs, such as doggy daycare, doggy boarding places, and even your local dog park, can increase your dog's risk of catching canine influenza.,
Stay away from dogs who show symptoms.Common symptoms of canine influenza include a cough, a runny nose, and a fever.,
Wash your hands after being in contact with any other dogs.Many people who are dog lovers enjoy petting other dogs.,
Consider getting your dog vaccinated.There is currently a vaccine available against the H3N8 strain of canine influenza.,
Take your dog to a vet if you are concerned.If you are concerned that your dog may have contracted canine influenza, despite your careful preventative efforts, take your dog to a vet for an examination and potential diagnostic testing that can confirm whether or not your dog is infected.",How to Prevent Dog Flu1," As with human flus, the more dogs your pet is around, the greater his or her risk of being exposed to an infected dog and of catching the infection.


If you do attend these places (such as doggy daycare), it is wise to ask the owner what they are doing to prevent the spread of canine influenza.
If the owner is aware of it and cautious as to what dogs are allowed to enter (preventing those who are infected with canine influenza from attending), your dog's risk is much lower than if the owner is less cautious.;
, Serious cases may lead to severe respiratory symptoms including pneumonia. If you notice another dog exhibiting these signs or symptoms (such as at the dog park), keep your dog away from them and walk in another direction. Also avoid touching the infected dog yourself, as the germs could get on your hands and then be passed along to your dog.

, If this is you, always wash your hands after petting another dog. It is possible for another dog to be infected with canine influenza without showing visible symptoms. You could inadvertently be picking up the germs and passing them onto your dog when you pet him or her if you do not wash your hands after contact with other dogs.


Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 30 seconds. Be sure to scrub all areas of your hands, including between your fingers.

, The vaccine consists of two doses given several weeks apart, and the cost is approximately $50 per shot (so a total of around $100). However, the vaccine does not cover for the more recent (and more prevalent) strain of canine influenza, which is H3N2. So your dog can still catch the flu even if he or she has been vaccinated.

, If your dog tests positive, the vet can then discuss treatment options to help your dog get better as quickly as possible.

Keep your dog at home and isolated from other dogs.If your dog has been diagnosed with canine influenza, and you are seeking to prevent the spread to other dogs in the community, it is important to keep your dog at home and isolated.,
Wash your hands before touching other dogs to prevent the spread of germs.Although humans cannot catch canine influenza, you can still carry the bugs on your hands after petting your dog.,
Obtain treatment for your dog to prevent complications.The vet will likely recommend that you offer your dog antibiotic treatment while he or she recovers from canine influenza.",How to Prevent Dog Flu2," Just as people who are sick are advised to stay home and not to go into the workplace (where they can easily get others sick), so, too, are dogs best to stay at home and away from public places like doggy daycare where they can infect others.


If it is a great inconvenience for you not to be able to take your dog to doggy daycare (or to other public places), consider hiring a dog walker who can come to your home once during the day and let your dog out for a bathroom break and a walk.
This is another way to ensure your dog is looked after during the day, and to give him or her exercise, without needing to rely on public venues to do so.

, If you subsequently touch another dog, he or she may become infected. Therefore, if your dog has been diagnosed with canine influenza, be sure to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after petting him or her to prevent the infection from spreading.

, Even though canine influenza is a virus (and as such cannot be ""cured"" with antibiotics), the antibiotics serve to prevent what is called a ""secondary bacterial infection."" What this means is that, while your dog's immune system is working to fight off the virus, he or she is more susceptible to catching a bacterial infection; therefore, the antibiotics serve to prevent this, and to ensure that your dog recovers as quickly and easily as possible.

Prevent future infections with a vaccine.",How to Treat Kennel Cough," Kennel cough is extremely contagious. If your dog has been playing with other dogs in a park or has been staying in a kennel, there is a possibility it has been exposed., A dog infected with kennel cough may suddenly develop a cough, which can vary in severity from a quiet, persistent ""huff"" to a harsh hacking, choking cough.The latter is commonly mistaken for the dog having something stuck in his throat. If possible, open his mouth to check for a stick or bone that is stuck.
An alternative means of determining if a dog has something stuck in its throat is to offer the dog a treat to eat. A dog with something stuck in his throat will not be able to eat the treat, so if he eats and swallows it without difficulty, it is unlikely it has a foreign object in its throat., Just as humans get a sore throat with flu, so do dogs with kennel cough. This can lead to throat clearing, or gagging and retching episodes.For some dogs, this is so severe that they retch up saliva or froth.
A dog that is vomiting because of nausea (rather than due to excessive coughing) will bring up yellow bile or food from the stomach. This is a likely a sign of some other problem., Some dogs with kennel cough show no signs of being ill, apart from an unpleasant cough. Others can be sluggish, lacking in energy and losing their appetites.


It is always a good idea to get a dog that is coughing seen by your vet, but it is essential if the dog suddenly lacks energy or doesn't eat for 24 hours., Kennel cough is highly infectious, because each time your dog coughs, it releases aerosol particles that can spread the illness. If you believe your dog has kennel cough, it is important to isolate it from other dogs immediately.A dog with kennel cough should not be taken on walks.
Other dogs in the same household are potentially at risk. However, by the time the symptoms develop they have already been exposed, so keeping them separated from the sick dog at this stage provides no benefit., It is best to get any dog with a cough checked out by a veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet will be able to verify that the cough is because of infection, rather than another cause such as heart disease. He or she will also be able to tell you if the dog needs treatment or not.The vet will perform a thorough physical examination, including taking the dog's temperature, feeling the size of the lymph nodes in its throat, checking its mouth for a foreign object, and listening to its heart and lungs with a stethoscope.
In the absence of a heart murmur, and if the veterinarian has a strong suspicion of kennel cough, he or she may suggest ""diagnosis by treatment"" rather than blood work and other expensive tests. If the dog then fails to respond to treatment as expected, further investigation may be needed.When you phone to make the appointment, tell the receptionist you suspect your dog has kennel cough. He or she may ask you to wait outside until the vet calls you in. This is to reduce the risk to other canine patients in the waiting room who might be exposed to infection.

, Your veterinarian may or may not prescribe antibiotics for your dog. If they are prescribed, administer as directed.


Antibiotics are not appropriate in every case. This is because the infection may be viral, in which case antibiotics will not help, because it is the dog's immune system that needs to fight and kill the infection. There is no way of differentiating bacterial from viral infections on the basis of a physical exam alone.On the other hand, if your dog is not able to fight off the infection on its own, or if veterinarian finds the dog has a fever or hears signs of congestion in the dog's chest, these can suggest the dog has a secondary bacterial infection as a result of the primary infection (which may be viral or bacterial). Under such conditions, an antibiotic may be prescribed., Run the shower on hot for a few minutes with the window and door closed. Sit with the dog in the steamy atmosphere for five to ten minutes, taking care to keep the dog away from the hot water.This helps to loosen any mucus in the dog's chest, which can ease the cough. The process can be repeated as often as necessary throughout the day.Never leave your dog unattended in the bathroom with hot water running, as it may scald itself.

, As much as possible, prevent the dog from engaging in any strenuous activity.


Do not take the dog for walks. Not only is it an infection risk for other dogs, but the exertion (especially breathing in cold air) is likely to irritate your dog's airways and make the cough worse., Coughing does the important job of moving phlegm out of the dog's chest and keeping the lungs clear. Stopping the cough completely is unwise, because this means the mucus just sits in the lungs and make it harder for the dog to breath. However, if the dog coughs so much it can't sleep at night, it is acceptable to give some cough relief.A suitable cough medicine is a spoonful of children's Robitussin DM. Give the dog about one teaspoon for every 20 pounds of weight.Never give other human cough and cold remedies to a dog without consulting your veterinarian first. Administering the wrong dosage or ingesting certain active ingredients in drugs may cause serious health problems.Ideally, give cough medicine just once in each 24 hour period.

, If your dog's throat is irritated, you can also give it a simple home remedy that will help soothe the tickle. Give the dog one tablespoon of honey and one teaspoon of lemon juice, mixed together in warm water.This concoction can be given hourly, if necessary.Never give this to a dog with diabetes, as the honey will be harmful., To help your dog fight the infection, ask your veterinarian about giving it vitamin C pills crushed in water, wild berry bark, peppermint, raw honey, or yerba santa.These treatments are not scientifically proven, but anecdotal evidence suggests they may be of some benefit.

, If your dog is in a high risk group (e.g. it spends time in kennels, attends dog shows, or mixes with lots of dogs in the park), consider a kennel cough vaccination to prevent future infection.This vaccine is effective against the major causes of kennel cough and gives 12 months of protection.Kennel cough is not typically a fatal condition, but it is a deeply unpleasant one. It is worth considering vaccination, especially if your dog is elderly or has other health problems."

Like humans, dogs can catch “colds” so make sure your dog has a full evaluation from a veterinarian.;
, Be descriptive of what your dog is experiencing. Describe the noise he or she is making because cough type is associated with a variety of diseases (i.e. kennel cough, heartworm, etc.). Also, don't forget to mention the last time your dog came in contact with another pup that doesn’t live with your family.

, Rather than wait and see, bring your dog to the vet the minute you suspect something is wrong. Especially if your dog is gagging and hacking your pup should be evaluated immediately because the diagnosis could be a range of issues.

These ingredients make up the majority of the food. Meat (not meat by-products) and vegetables should be the first few ingredients in the dog food. Lower down the list may be meat by-products and grains.Avoid common filler ingredients in dog food that may actually harm your dog's health. Some of these include: Ethoxyquin, Propylene Glycol, BHT/BHA, Corn Syrup and corn, and animal by-products.Occasionally, some dogs might show signs of a food sensitivity or intolerance. Watch for: diarrhea, vomiting, or skin conditions. Work with the veterinarian to determine what food ingredients the dog can and cannot eat.;
, Realize that certain human foods can hurt or kill a dog. Dog’s bodies can’t always metabolize foods like humans can so make sure your dog does not have access to these foods: grapes, raisins, chocolates, avocados, yeast dough, nuts, alcohol, onions, garlic, chives, and sugar-free gum (mainly the ingredient xylitol). These are all toxic to dogs.


While you can make your own dog food, you must work with an animal nutritionist or veterinarian with education in pet food nutrition. This ensures your dog’s diet is nutritionally balanced.

, A dog is considered overweight when he weighs 10-20% more than his ideal body weight. If he is 20% overweight, he's considered obese. Being obese can shorten a dog’s life span by 2 years. Obese dogs are at higher risk for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and urinary bladder stones.Talk with a vet about the ideal weight for your dog and feed him accordingly.


Most dogs are overweight or obese because they don't get enough exercise and get too much food. Refer to the package of pet food for specific guidelines about feeding based on ideal weight.

, Just like in humans, snacking or treats, can add quite a few calories to a dog’s daily calorie allowance. This could cause your dog to put on extra weight. Try giving your dog homemade treats, instead of store bought ones.Give your dog low calorie treats like baby carrots, canned green beans (low sodium or rinsed to wash off the added salt), or small slices of cooked sweet potatoes.

, Dogs need lots of fresh water for the body to properly work and digest food. The water should be clean and fresh, so change the water at least once a day. Clean the water bowl or bucket with dish soap and water every once. Rinse and dry the container before refilling with fresh water.


Bacteria and algae can grow in the bowl, especially during warm weather. In freezing temperatures, you'll need to keep the bowl from freezing.

, Brush your dog's coat to keep it shiny and healthy. This will also encourage good circulation. Note any new lumps, bumps, or cysts on the skin and bring them to your veterinarian’s attention. Scabs, redness, or itchy skin should also be addressed by a veterinarian.


Grooming is also a good time to check for skin conditions like fleas, ticks, and mites.

, While it may take a little time for you dog to get used to, clipping the nails can become a routine part of grooming. Just be careful not to trim the ""quick,"" the part of the nail that contains sensitive blood vessels and nerves.


If you aren’t sure how to clip the nails, have your veterinarian technician show you how to clip your dog's nails.

, This is also a good chance to check the mouth for sores, loose or damaged teeth, or any other odd problems. Only use a dental toothpaste made for dogs. The fluoride in human toothpaste is poisonous to dogs and can cause serious health problems.Occasionally, your dog will need a dental cleaning at the vet's office. He'll be sedated while the veterinarian performs a thorough examination and cleaning.

, The ears shouldn't smell or have any discharge. The inner part of the ear should be a whitish color; but some dark colored dogs may have dark colored inner ears. Flip the ear over to inspect it. It should be clear of dirt, debris, or parasites like ticks. Plant material can sometimes work their way into the ear. These should be carefully removed.If your dog has floppy type ears, they should be checked daily, otherwise check them regularly.

, Use a product specifically made to clean dog’s ears or use a solution of half white vinegar and half rubbing alcohol. Saturate a cotton ball with the fluid and gently wipe out the dog’s ear. If blood appears on the cotton ball stop cleaning and consult your veterinarian.Shaking the head excessively, scratching or pawing at the ear, odor, or discharge (waxy, fluid, or brown) is not normal. If you think your dog has an ear infection or other ear problem, take him to the vet.

, Most people with pet dogs chose to keep them in the house with the family. If you do keep your dog outside, provide an insulated dog house, warm bedding for cold climates, shade for warm climates, food, and water (that won't freeze or stagnate). Never chain your dog, since this could cause leg or neck injuries.


Don't keep your dog outside if he hasn't acclimated to weather extremes. It is considered negligence to keep a dog outside without proper shelter. If you can't shelter your dog correctly, keep him inside or don't get a dog in the first place.

, Depending on your dog’s breed, this could be anything from a 10-15 minute walk per day to a good hour romp in the park. A fun game of fetch or Frisbee can also be physically challenging to very active dogs. Playing or walking is a great chance for you to bond with your dog.


Exercise and playing can cut back on bad behavior, like tearing things up around the house, inappropriate chewing, and aggression. It will also keep your dog’s weight down and his body healthy.

, Once he's gotten all his important first vaccinations, socialize him. This means carefully introducing him to people, other animals and dogs, and situations outside the immediate home environment. Getting used to riding in the car, walking around the neighborhood and dog parks are great ways to introduce him to people and other dogs.


As long as the dog isn’t scared or threatened he will get used to these situations. The more unique social situations you expose your dog to when he's young, the better.

, Schedule yearly examinations so you dog can get important tests and vaccinations done. Your vet will also get to know your dog and will be able to tell if something's wrong with his health. Regular check-ups can prevent many treatable diseases.If you have a puppy, take it to the vet around 6 weeks old. The puppy will be checked for hernias, heart, lung, eye, and ear problems. The puppy will also be put on a preventative de-worming schedule and given important early shots and boosters.

, The rabies vaccination should be given around 12 weeks and is required in many areas. You might be severely penalized if you haven't vaccinated your dog and he nips or bites a person or another pet. Consider vaccinating your dog against Lyme disease. This disease causes joint pain, swelling, fever, and possibly fatal kidney disease.Dogs that spend a lot of time outside, live on farms, or hunt are at increased risk of getting this tick-borne disease.

, Spaying or neutering your dog can reduce some behavioral problems and decrease the chance of certain tumors and infections. If you spay or neuter your dog, you won't need to worry about caring for or placing unwanted puppies.Microchipping is also encouraged in case your dog ever becomes lost.

, Watch for signs of fleas on your dog: dark specks in the fur, lots of licking and scratching, or scabs on the skin.Once you've found fleas on your dog, you have several options. See your vet for an oral medication, wash your dog with flea shampoo, and put a flea collar on your dog.


Flea collars and monthly skin treatments are good ways to prevent fleas in the first place. Talk with your vet about a regular flea prevention routine., A yearly blood test is needed to check for this widespread disease. Heartworm is spread by mosquito bites so it's hard to prevent. Instead, a monthly tablet or a shot which lasts for up to 6 months is used to kill any organisms present in the blood stream.If your dog does get heartworm disease, there is a treatment but it is hard on him, expensive, and can take months to combat.

Watch to see if your dog is eating less.
Notice if your dog is sensitive to you touching his muzzle.
You may also visibly notice your dog having trouble chewing.;
, If your dog is coughing, it might not be a reason to worry. However, coughing that lasts for any longer than a twenty-four hour period might be something more serious. Get any severe coughing in your dog checked out by your veterinarian.


Coughing problems can disrupt your dog's sleep.Coughing in a dog can be a sign of anything from minor bronchitis to heart worms, have a professional examine your dog. , Just as humans may act differently when they don’t feel well, you may notice changes in your dog's behavior if it’s not feeling well.Changes may include, but are not limited to, increase or decrease in appetite or thirst, hyperactivity or noticeably lowered energy levels.
If you notice changes in your dog's behavior, visit your veterinarian.
If the irritation seems to relate to petting a specific spot, take note, it may be where your dog is injured or sick., Dogs can develop ingrown hairs, cysts, and other skin blemishes, so not every small lump or bump is an immediate cause for concern. However, the following symptoms should be seen by a professional.Lumps growing in size.Lumps becoming deeply attached to tissues.
Oozing or bleeding sores.

, Canine’s can run fevers just like humans can. If your dog has a fever, especially in conjunction with other symptoms, visit your vet as soon as you are able.A temperature of 103 is high. Take your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
A temperature of 104.5 requires immediate medical attention., Monitor the amount of water your dog drinks daily. If you notice any big changes in this amount, take note. Drinking too much or too little can indicate a problem that requires veterinary attention.Rule out everyday reasons such as strenuous play or a hot day.
If you notice your dog drinking much more than normal for a consecutive week, see your vet.

, Changes in appetite, especially those that lead to weight loss or gain, can indicate illness.Unexpected weight loss or gain should always be met with a trip to the vet.


In the short term, loss of appetite for your dog can be a sign of fever, pain, or stress, as well as many other possible reasons.
If the loss of appetite is combined with any other noticeable symptoms, you should see a vet immediately., Vomiting or diarrhea is a reason for concern with your dog.These symptoms can be a sign of anything from swallowing a sharp object to ulcers to parasites.Single instances of vomiting or diarrhea are not necessarily a cause for concern.
Repeated instances,especially lasting more than twenty-four hours,require a vet.Blood, in either vomit or diarrhea, can be a serious symptom and needs treatment as soon as possible.,
Lethargy, in combination with other symptoms, also requires the attention of your vet.Extremely high levels of energy can also be a problem that needs medical attention.

, All dogs scratch fairly regularly. However, excessive scratching can be a sign of a health problem. If the scratching is excessive, don't ignore it. Look for these possible causes or ask your veterinarian more about them:


Scratching is a typical sign of fleas, ticks, or mange mites.Scratching can also mean endocrine or hormonal problems in your dog.Dogs can also suffer from allergies just like humans, which can lead to itching.Take your dog to the vet.

Most vets will examine the animal, try to reach a diagnosis or suggest tests to reach a diagnosis.
After testing, your vet can prescribe a course of treatment to correct the underlying problem or at least make the dog more comfortable.



, If your dog starts showing signs of stiffness, manifested through difficulty getting up or climbing stairs, then you should have your pet examined. This symptom can be a result of anything from hip dysplasia to arthritis to Lyme disease from tick-borne bacteria.
The earlier Lyme disease is treated, the better the prognosis, so see a vet quickly if you notice this symptom, especially in younger dogs.

, Labored breathing can indicate a problem with your dog's respiratory system. Identifying the cause can be difficult by yourself. Bring your dog to a vet to accurately diagnose any problems with your dog's breathing.Labored breathing requires urgent attention.
If your dog's gums have a bluish tint, seek immediate care.

, House-trained pets rarely start having accidents unless there is a problem. If your dog inexplicably begins having indoor accidents, then your vet will likely want to schedule some tests to find out the problem.Having accidents for a few days in a row is a good indication of a problem.

, Changes in the frequency of your dog's urination can be an indication of a problem. Check also for any blood or strange discolorations in your dog's urine.If you find anything unusual about your dog's urine or urination habits, contact your veterinarian.Either an increase or decrease in urination can be an indication of an illness.
Problems with urination will may involve the kidneys or bladder stones.

, If your dog is trying to vomit, and cannot, this can be associated with the life-threatening condition, bloat. Get your dog to the vet immediately in order to ensure the best outcome., If your dog is having trouble standing, is swaying, or has collapsed then you must seek care quickly. Even if your dog is tired, it will be able to stand and move. Collapsing is a definite sign that your dog needs medical attention. , If your dog is trying to urinate, but is unable to do so, take it to the veterinarian quickly. Inability to urinate indicates some form of blockage and can be quite serious."
"
Check your dog over regularly for lumps and bumps on the skin's surface or just under the skin.,
Assess the lump.,
Have lumps checked out by a veterinarian.",How to Know If Your Dog Has Cancer1," The goal here is early detection of any tumors that could be associated with cancer. Grooming your dog is a great chance to become familiar with what's normal for its body.Don't panic if you find a lump. The lump could be a wide variety of things, from a harmless spot or mole to a more serious, aggressive cancer.;
, Check the size and shape of the lump. Measure the size of the lump and write it down with the date for future comparison.


How deep is the lump? Feel the lump and see if it seems to be in the skin, beneath the skin, or attaching the skin to the tissue beneath.
What shape is the lump? Is the lump round or does it have an irregular shape. Irregular lumps should always be checked urgently by a veterinarian.
How quickly is it growing? It is best to get any new lumps checked but if you are unable to get to a vet straight away, monitor the lump. Measure it weekly to see if it is enlarging. A rapidly growing lump needs urgent attention.
Is it painful or itchy? If the lump is red, inflamed, or the dog itches or chews at it, this is an important sign that it needs checking urgently by your veterinarian.

, They can perform a fine needle aspirate, to obtain a small sample of cells to examine under the microscope. Sometimes this is sufficient to make a diagnosis, but failing this a full biopsy may be necessary to know exactly what the lump is.


Some lumps are judged to be of lower risk than others, these tend to have the following characteristics (although it should be noted some more serious lumps can also mimic these signs) : Round, growing on the skin, the skin remains free and not attached to tissue below, slow growing, not sore or inflamed.
Higher risk lumps often have one or more of the following characteristics: irregular shape, rapid growing, deeply attaching the skin of the tissues beneath, inflamed itchy or painful.

Travel safely with dogs in your vehicle.",How to Know if Your Dog Has a Slipped Disc," It can be difficult to diagnose a slipped disc or IVDD at home. That's because the precise location of the affected vertebrae and the degree of injury can affect how noticeable your dog's injury is.However, some common symptoms to look for include:


neck pain
back pain
difficulty moving
a wobbly, uneven stride
inability to place paws flat on the ground
dragging one or more paws
complete paralysis;
, Some dog breeds are prone to developing skeletal problems. However, all dogs are capable of experiencing a slipped disc if they are seriously hurt.If your dog has fallen from any height, been hit by a person or object, or been involved in a traffic accident (including being in the car during one), your dog may have sustained spinal injuries.
If you suspect your dog has sustained a spinal injury due to physical trauma, contact your veterinarian immediately.

, While skeletal problems can afflict any dog breed, these issues tend to strike dogs with disproportionately short limbs. However, some larger dog breeds are also afflicted.Many dog breeds prone to back problems like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) end up suffering from herniated or slipped discs.Some breeds commonly afflicted by IVDD include:


Dachshunds
Pekingese
Shih Tzus
Beagles
Some poodles
Cocker spaniels
Welsh corgis
Basset hounds
Labrador retrievers
German shepherds
Shar-peis

, Whether your dog is of a breed prone to IVDD or has sustained a spinal injury, your vet will need to see your dog right away. A vet can help rule out other problems, diagnose the problem with your dog, and recommend a treatment plan.Your vet will need to perform a full neurological exam, as X-rays alone are usually insufficient at identifying a slipped disc.
Some tests your vet may run include an X-ray with dye contrast, a computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or some combination of these tests.
Your vet may also draw a small sample of cerebral spinal fluid to rule out a spinal infection., When your vet determines that your dog has a slipped disc, they will also be able to assess how severe the injury is. If the slipped disc was caused by trauma, your vet will instruct you on how to heal it. If it was caused by degenerative disc disease, your dog may require a more comprehensive treatment plan.How intensive your treatment plan is will depend on how advanced the degenerative disc disease is. There are five stages of disc disease, including:


Stage I - mild pain which usually heals on its own within a few days
Stage II - moderate to severe pain
Stage III - partial paralysis resulting in staggered or uncoordinated walking patterns
Stage IV - paralysis with feeling intact
Stage V - paralysis and total loss of feeling

, Regardless of how your dog's spinal injury developed, you will need to restrict its ability to move for a period of time. You may need to keep your dog confined for up to six weeks, depending on the severity of your dog's injury and your vet's recommendations.Keep your dog temporarily confined to a small space, like a dog cage or an enclosed area.
Do not let your dog run, jump, or twist at all.

, Anti-inflammatory drugs and/or pain relievers may be prescribed for dogs with moderate to severe pain, including partial paralysis. Some dogs who do not respond to medication or who have advanced degenerative disc disease may need surgery.Common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used for back pain include Rimadyl (carprofen), Etogesic (etodolac), and Deramaxx (deracoxib).You will need a prescription for these medications.

, Surgery is usually recommended when your dog has had more than one slipped disc, has persistent severe pain, or has had severe nervous system complications.Surgery is most effective when performed with the first few days of the injury, which is why it's imperative that you have your dog seen by the vet at the first sign of injury.Talk to your vet about whether surgery may be right for your dog. Only your vet can determine the best course of action to treat your dog's injury.

, Dogs love to run, jump, and play, but doing any of these activities too roughly can easily lead to spinal injuries. If your dog has suffered spinal injuries in the past, or if it's of a breed that is susceptible to spinal problems, you may need to monitor and restrict your dog's activity.Consider installing a small pet staircase so your dog doesn't have to jump on or off of furniture. You can purchase a pet staircase at many pet stores or through an online retailer.
Limit or restrict running, as this may aggravate an injury-prone spine.
If your dog plays with other dogs and they tend to play roughly, consider limiting your dog's playtime with that dog.

, You should always use a leash to walk your dog. However, instead of clipping that leash to your dog's color, consider using a chest harness. These devices slip easily onto your dog's torso, and you can attach any standard leash to a harness.When you pull on the leash, a harness will distribute that pressure across the dog's body. With a collar leash, your dog's neck and upper back receive most of the force.
You can purchase dog harnesses at most pet stores or through an online retailer.

, Any time you drive somewhere, you should always buckle up your seatbelt. The same is true of your dog. If your dog is freely roaming the vehicle and you make a sudden stop or are involved in a collision, your dog can seriously injure its back and neck. By taking precautions any time your dog travels with you, you can significantly reduce the risk of injury.Make sure your dog is used to traveling in a vehicle before you attempt any long drives with your pet. A stressed dog may wiggle, jump, and try to move around the vehicle.
Use a travel harness to keep your dog securely fastened in place during car trips. You can purchase a travel harness at many pet stores or through an online retailer.
Consider a skybox or booster seat, which is used in conjunction with a harness to keep your dog fastened in a cushioned box.
If you have a vehicle with a hatchback or ""boot,"" you may want to consider using a car grid. This metal grate fits over the backseat's headrest, keeping your dog confined to the trunk area during car trips.

Look for lameness or limping.,
Determine if your dog has lost weight or lost its appetite.,
Pay attention to unusually bad smells coming from the dog.,
Look for bleeding or blood in urine or feces.,
Get veterinary care for a dog that is coughing or having difficulty breathing.,
Pay attention to changes in behavior or character.,
Notice changes to your dog's body shape.,
Have your dog checked out by a veterinarian if you have a suspicion that your dog has cancer.",How to Know If Your Dog Has Cancer2," A dog can become lame for many reasons, ranging from a simple sprain or a cut pad all the way to cancer. Take your dog to the vet if it has any lameness, as limping is a sign of pain. Your vet should be able to determine what the cause of the pain is.


Bone cancers, such as osteosarcoma, are acutely painful and the dog may be in discomfort when you touch the area. The area may be swollen and feel hot to the touch.
Signs associated with bone cancer also include restlessness (as though in a lot of discomfort), a low grade lameness that gets worse rather than better, and loss of appetite., Again there are multiple causes of weight loss and poor appetite, ranging all the way from a change of diet or food the dog doesn't like, to kidney disease or cancer. Any weight loss should trigger a trip to the vet, but this is especially important if the dog seems dull, lacking in energy, and generally not itself.


Symptoms tend to develop gradually with a slow loss of appetite and loss of body condition. This is also reflected in the dog taking less care of itself, and grooming less. This lack of proper grooming leads to a dull coat. Sometimes the dog may also vomit on and off.
Take careful note of the dog's bowel movements, as this can give the veterinarian vital clues to what's going on.

, Give the dog a good sniff over to try and localize the smell. Sometimes a hidden tumor, such as a melanoma in the mouth, is not easy to see but it may become infected and start to smell.


Of course, there are other common infections that also smell and are usually not serious (but do need treatment). It's a good idea that if you detect a bad smell you should check in with a vet about it., Regular nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums, and bleeding excessively from small cuts all require urgent veterinary attention. One explanation is cancer, but other diseases, such as autoimmune disease, can interfere the body's ability to clot blood. Take note of blood in urine, feces, or vomit. Again, there may be an innocent explanation, such as cystitis or colitis, but these conditions also need treatment.

, Coughing can result from infection, bronchitis, heart disease or cancer, among other possibilities. Watch your dog's breathing: rapid shallow breaths indicate abnormality and you should get the dog checked as a matter of urgency. In the meantime, rest the dog so that it doesn't have extra demands on its body's oxygen., Brain tumors can induce changes in behavior that are quite marked. Your dog may develop an unusual habit, nervous tick, or even seizures. If it starts to bump into things, lose its balance, or have difficult walking in a straight line this could indicate a neurological abnormality. This should be checked out by a vet.

, For example, notice if your pet's belly changes shape and becomes suddenly swollen. This could indicate an internal bleed and loss of blood within the abdomen, causing it to become distended. This could be due to a ruptured lump within the abdomen. Seek immediate veterinary attention in this situation.

, It is difficult, or even impossible, to know if your dog has cancer without diagnostic tests. Even veterinarians find it difficult to know for sure that a dog has cancer, without running diagnostic tests such as biopsies, diagnostic blood tests, or examining cells from the abnormal area.Seek a second opinion. This will give you a better idea about your options and will hopefully give you more peace of mind that your vet is making the best recommendations for treatment.

Get a water bowl that is the right size for your dog.,
Buy a weighted water bowl.,
Invest in a water fountain.",How to Keep a Dog Hydrated1," Make sure your dog’s water bowl is the right size for them, as a bowl that is too big or too small will limit their access to water. Check that the water bowl is made for a small, medium, or large dog. Get the size that will make it easy for your pup to bend down and drink from the bowl.For example, tall, narrow bowls are ideal for dogs with long ears, such as Bassets and Spaniels. This can help to keep their ears out of the bowl, which can reduce the risk of ear infections.
Smaller dogs do well with a water bowl that is low and shallow, as this will make it easier for them to drink from the bowl.
A bowl that is big and wide is ideal for medium to large dogs.;
, A weighted water bowl will have a heavier bottom, making them less likely to tip over. This may be a good investment if you are worried about your dog tipping over their water bowl or moving the bowl around and spilling the water while they drink. Look for weighted water bowls online or at your local pet store.Test the water bowl before you give it to your dog to use. Fill it with water and tap or try to tip one side of the bowl. A weighted water bowl should make it harder to do this.

, Larger dogs and dogs who are picky about their water may benefit from a water fountain. Most water fountains will filter and recirculate the water so it is fresh and tastes delicious to your dog.You can buy water fountains online or at your local pet store.

Watch for burst stitches.",How to Help Your Dog Recover from Surgery," These might be queries such as the phone number for the emergency vet, if you have concerns once you get home. Also, if the dog is on medication, make sure to ask about when his next dose is due (day patients may be given their meds by injection, so it might not be necessary to give him medication the evening he is first home).


In the excitement of seeing your pet again it is all too easy for questions to fly out of your mind. The vet or vet tech will give you plenty of information at the time of discharge, but take a moment to check that all your questions have been answered.;
, Read the labels to be clear of any instructions, such as if the pills should be given with or without food and if they need to be given at a certain time of day

, However, just because he is up on his feet, doesn't mean he should walk home (indeed, the veterinarian will not release an animal who is incapable of moderate exertion).This is because exercise may rub or chafe the fresh wound and cause unnecessary pain and discomfort.

, Plan to carry him in your arms or drive him home. It is best to take a friend along when you collect the pet, and have the friend drive so you can focus your attention on the dog (and not get distracted on the road!)


It is also useful to have an extra pair of ears to listen to all those instructions at the clinic.

, If the dog has a wound or an incision, you need to avoid stretching that area. If possible, lift the dog into the car rather than have him jump in. For a large dog this might mean asking for assistance to lift him onto the back seat, or using a ramp to walk him into the trunk.Likewise, back home, assist him out of the car so that he doesn't jump out and stretch his stitches.
If he does jump out, don't panic! Stretching the wound will cause temporary discomfort but is unlikely to do permanent harm.

, Unless the dog has been on intravenous fluids during his procedure, he will be thirsty. Once home, offer him some fresh drinking water so that he can freshen his mouth and quench his thirst.


If he chugs lots of water at once, the water may hit his stomach and make him vomit.This is because his system has been empty for nearly 24 hours and a sudden impact of a bowl of cold water may make the stomach spasm.
If the dog seems intent on drinking a whole bowlful, ration the water and allow him a teacup full every half an hour for two hours, after which time he can drink freely.

, After an anesthetic it is common for the dog's stomach to be sensitive and feeding his regular food may make him vomit. To avoid this, the first meal after an anesthetic should be bland food that is easy to digest.


The clinic may send your dog home with a tin of a prescription diet such as Hills ID or Purina EN. These foods are formulated to be gentle on the stomach and are ideal after surgery, even surgery on the bowel itself.
If your dog doesn't like the prescription diet, then the next best option is a bland meal of white meat, such as chicken, turkey, cod, or coley fish, with the addition of boiled white rice or pasta.
If the dog refuses to eat the chicken and rice, then skip that evening's meal, and the following morning offer his regular food (unless given different instructions by the vet).

, After a day spent in the unfamiliar surroundings, many dogs are tired when they come home. Once safely home he may allow himself to relax and go into a deep sleep. This is a good thing, so make sure he is in a warm, draft free place and leave him undisturbed. Sleep is a good sign that he is not in discomfort, because a dog in pain may well be restless.

, Modern anesthetics are short acting and are rapidly metabolized out of the dog's system over the course of a few hours. At this point some dogs then become restless when the lingering pain-numbing effect from anesthesia is lost.


How sore he is depends on what other pain-relief (analgesia) the dog has received, but most clinics cover the patient for a 24 hour period with an injection of an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as meloxicam.

, How well the dog deals with discomfort depends on his pain threshold. Some dogs are stoical and never complain, whilst others whimper and whine with the slightest discomfort.


It helps if you have some idea of how your dog is likely to behave, since this helps interpret his behaviour after surgery.

, The night after surgery, it is helpful to know the signs of a problem, and when to contact the vet. If you notice the following, contact your vet.Excessive seepage from the wound: Some seepage from a wound is normal, but usually limited to a few spots of blood-stained straw coloured fluid. If the discharge is pure blood, or if fluid drips from the incision then phone the vet. This may well just be ooze from tissue beneath the skin, but do not hesitate to seek professional advice.
Whining or vocalization, signs of distress: Signs of distress include crying, whining, howling, and an inability to settle. This needs to be interpreted with a view to how stoic your dog is (ie. a hardy Rottweiler whining is more significant than a Chihuahua who is distressed more easily). If in doubt contact the vet. They may be able to advise about bringing forward the next dose of pain relief.
Unresponsive or collapsed: Being deeply asleep is one thing, but being collapsed and non-responsive is another. If the dog is conscious (ie not asleep) but is not able to stand when roused, or cannot lift his head up, phone for urgent advice.
Repeated vomiting: If the dog is repeatedly sick, phone for advice. Anesthetic agents can irritate a dog's stomach, and make it difficult for him to keep fluid down. If vomiting continues, the dog may need an anti-sickness injection to settle his tummy or risk becoming dehydrated.

, There is no denying that even with modern pain relief, your pet may feel uncomfortable after surgery. It is to be expected that he will not be his normal self, especially the first night home. To help prepare you for what to expect, the following are often ""normal"" after surgery.Sleeping deeply: In the unfamiliar surroundings of a vet surgery, the pet is likely to stay awake more than he would in the peace of his own home. Once home, he may well relax and catch up on his rest by going into a deep sleep.
Unable to settle: Some pets come home and want to thoroughly check out their territory, to sniff out who has been intruding in their absence. The pet may wander from room to room and seem unable to settle. Once fully assured that everything is in the right place, he is likely to relax.
Being growled at by other pets: A dog or cat that spends a day at the vet clinic is going to smell strange to his companions. Animals use their sense of smell much more than we do, and may hiss or growl at a pet that looks like one they know but smells different. If this happens, simply keep the pet in a separate room overnight so that he picks up ""homely"" smells.
Refusing food: A combination of being out of routine and being sore is sufficient to make some pets refuse their first meal once home. Don't be overly concerned by this; the chances are the pet will chow down in the morning.
Decreased need to go to the toilet: In preparation for the anesthetic, the pet will have been starved from the previous evening, and his gut is not as full as usual. It may well be that he skips a bowel movement or two. He is not constipated, but just does not need to pass a stool. Likewise, anesthetics are slightly dehydrating so the pet may not urinate as frequently (during the first 24 hours post surgery) or produces a smaller puddle.
Tenderness near the incision: Sensitivity around a surgical incision is to be expected. Depending on the animal’s temperament, some may even growl or hiss to warn you away from the site. Respect this warning.

, It is a myth that dog saliva has healing properties. Licking is likely to either colonize the incision with bacteria from his mouth or pull the stitches out. To prevent him from licking the wound, you will either have to use a buster collar, a dressing, or a covering such as a T-shirt., The idea is to provide a barrier between the tongue and the wound. The collar is best left on at all times. The dog may not like wearing it but he will get used to it.


Many dogs are secretive lickers and if you remove the collar thinking he can be trusted, it is likely he will wait until alone and then lick.

, Areas such as a paw or leg are amenable to bandaging, which keeps the wound clean and protected.


If your dog is a chewer, he may still need to wear a buster collar so that he doesn't chew the bandage off.

, Incisions on the trunk can be covered with a T-shirt. Choose a T-shirt that is large enough to cover the necessary area, and put the dog's head through the T-shirt neck, and forelegs through the arm holes. Tie the hem of the T-shirt in a knot to secure the lower end.


Do not use safety pins since these pose a swallowing hazard.
T-shirts are especially useful if you have a couple of dogs, and the companion licks his friend.

, When possible cover the wound (as described in the previous steps) when the dog goes out to relieve himself. If the incision gets splashed with mud or dirt, clean it gently.Clean the wound with diluted salt water. Boil the kettle and allow the water to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt into 1 US-pint (470 ml) of previously boiled water, and keep this as your stock solution.
Soak a clean pad of cotton wool in the salt solution and squeeze out the excess moisture. Use the moist pad to gently wipe away contamination.
Pat the area dry with a clean towel.

, After surgery, strict rest is essential during the convalescent period until the stitches are removed. The timing of suture removal depends on the nature of the surgery but is usually 10 to 14 days after the operation.


The principle of strict rest is to not stretch to incision or overexert the animal. Thus going up and down stairs is forbidden, as is jumping on and off furniture. The consequences of not preventing these actions include pain, stitches slicing the skin, swelling at the op site, and the worst case scenario of wound breakdown (the stitches bursting and the incision opening up).

, The first two to three days after surgery are most critical with regards to rest because in these early stages the wound is healing rapidly. The dog should not be taken for walks. He should be put on a collar and lead when he goes out to relieve himself (just in case he sees a cat and wants to give chase!).If your dog is boisterous then speak to your vet about sedation.

, Most patients have a post-operative exam two to three days after surgery. If the wound is healing well, the veterinarian may sanction gentle 5 minute lead walks, but this should not be assumed.

, It is not unusual for a dog's bowel habits to be out of routine for a few days. This is because he was starved prior to surgery and skipped a couple of meals, so his system will be empty for a day or so. Monitor him to check when he passes feces and make sure it is not diarrhea.


Diarrhea is not uncommon after an anesthetic, and if he has diarrhea, stick with the bland diet and let your veterinarian know. Do not give a NSAID medication such as meloxicam if the dog has diarrhea because this medication can impair blood circulation to the bowel wall and worsen existing diarrhea.

, If the dog has abdominal sutures it may be sore to strain and move his bowel. Do not worry if he takes longer than usual to manoeuvre for that first post-surgery bowel movement. Things will get easier.


If he has not moved his bowel by the third day after surgery, let the vet know at the post-operative check. The vet will feel your dog's tummy to check if he is truly constipated and will determine gentle enema is necessary, or if he just needs more time for things to move along.

, After that initial bland meal, (unless the dog had bowel surgery) he can go back onto his normal food. If there are sutures in the bowel then continuing with the prescription diet is ideal, or failing that a white meat diet.


These foods are gentler on the bowel and less likely to either inflame the lining, or pop the intestinal sutures. The bland diet should be continued until the veterinarian tells you it is safe to resume normal feeding.

, After surgery your dog will be seen back for routine checks three days and ten days after surgery. This check ups will make sure that he is healing well, and that the stitches can be removed.


However, if you are worried, never hesitate to contact the clinic for advice. Signs to be alert for which may indicate a complication are listed in the following steps.

, It is not unusual for a dog to refuse to eat for 24 hours after an anesthetic, but if it is longer than this, alert your vet.

, If the dog is unusually quiet or subdued, and especially if they refuse to move 24 hours after surgery, let the clinic know.

, Whilst it is not unusual for a dog to vomit bile once or twice after an anesthetic, vomiting more frequently than this may indicate a complication so you should let the vet know.


Do not give further doses of pain relief until you have spoken to the clinic and made sure it is safe to do so.

, The area beneath the sutures may swell because of suture reaction, which is where the body activates the immune system to try to reject the ""foreign"" suture material. This is not dangerous in itself, but it is difficult for a non-veterinary professional to differentiate this from a hernia (a hole in the body wall) which is potentially serious. If the wound is swollen or hot, then alert the clinic.

, In the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery you may notice spots of blood-stained serum from the incision. Monitor the amount produced and if it increases from the odd spot to a steady drip, contact the vet.


Likewise, if the discharge is purulent (creamy, yellow, or green colored) then contact the vet.

, If stitches are missing, especially if there is a gap along the line of the incision, contact the surgery. It is not always necessary to replace one or two missing sutures, but additional antibiosis may be required to protect against infection if tissue beneath the skin is exposed.

Stay calm.,
Remove objects that could injure your dog.,
Use cushions to protect your dog.,
Don't put your hand in or near the dog's mouth.,
Move your dog only if he is in danger.,
Take a video.,
Switch off the lights and draw the curtains.,
Make the room silent.,
Get rid of any smells.,
Don't be tempted to pet your dog.,
If applicable, use a tranquilizer from a previous seizure.,
Use a rectal suppository.,
Administer the tranquilizer as quickly as possible.,
Give your dog a snack.,
Let your dog take things at his own pace.,
If this is your dog's first seizure, phone your veterinarian.",How to Help Your Dog During a Seizure," During a seizure your dog will be disorientated and scared. You don't want to add to his stress by getting hysterical, shouting, or otherwise reinforcing the impression that he is right to be fearful. Alarming him only heightens his arousal and can prolong the episode. This is ultimately detrimental to a swift recovery.


During a seizure, your dog is in a highly sensitized state; noise, light, and sometimes even touch, can trigger a new stream of electrical impulses in the brain that fuel the fit. By staying calm you can assess the situation for trigger flashpoints, and act to make the environment calm and quiet.
Make a note of the time. As soon as your dog starts to seizure, make a note of the time, and record when the fit ends. This is useful information for the veterinarian to build up a picture of how serious (or not) the seizure was.
Also, when a pet is in the grip of a seizure, time seems to stand still; it can be reassuring to know what felt like a lifetime was actually only a minute or two.;
, During a seizure, your dog will thrash around. Look around for nearby objects he might knock against and injure himself by, such as chair legs or electric fires. Where possible, move objects out of the way, rather than moving your dog – the latter will stimulate him.


You may also wish to remove objects that you don't want broken or moved, whether they're a hazard to your dog or not. In his thrashing,

, It's easy to remove objects from the room that are light enough to pick up, but for heavier objects like tables, rest a pillow against the offending areas to provide cushioning. Blankets and towels work, too, in a pinch.


If your dog is in danger of banging against a large object, a useful alternative is a duvet placed gently over your dog, leaving his head free.
If he is banging his head on the floor, it is fine to slide a cushion beneath him to soften the knocks.

, It is an old wives' tale that a dog can swallow his tongue during a seizure. On no account should you put your hand in the mouth of a seizuring dog. He will not know what he is doing and bite down and not release your hand until the fit is over. It is both unnecessary and unwise to take this risk.

, The only situation you should touch your dog in (apart from giving him a tranquilizer, as discussed below) is if he is in danger and his fit will lead to physical injury. If he is seizuring at the top of a flight of stairs, for example, then it is best to risk moving him and quietly slide him along the ground to a place of safety.


""Sliding"" your pup is key here. You do not want a seizuring dog thrashing in your arms, risking you dropping him and both of you getting injured. If you can, push, slide, or otherwise move him in a manner that doesn't involve lifting him up to keep both of you safe.

, Once you have done everything you can do to aid your dog's recovery, shoot a short video film of the seizure event on your smart phone. This is helpful to your vet because not everything that looks like a seizure is actually a true seizure. It is immensely helpful to the veterinarian to witness the attack first hand.


If you're too agitated to do so, have another person do this. Just make sure they stay a reasonable distance away so as to not exacerbate your dog's condition.

, A room in semi-darkness provides much less stimulation for your pup, possibly bettering and shortening the seizure. Take a look around and see what you can do to make the room as peaceful and dim as possible. At night, leave a dim light to watch the dog by.


In simple terms, a seizure is an electrical storm in the brain. Anything that stimulates the brain, such as light, noise, smell, or touch has the potential to worsen, or even lengthen, the fit., This electrical storm in your dog's brain will only be heightened by outside noises. To help him get through this, turn off the TV and radio. Likewise, get everybody else to leave the room. The last thing your dog needs is an audience of shocked people gasping and talking, so get them out of the room to give the dog space and peace.


You will need to watch your dog for your own peace of mind and to time the seizure and make sure he's okay. Stay as silent and unmoving as possible during this time to make this episode easier on him.

, A dog's olfactory stimulation (his sniffer) can be quite potent, so if you have scented candles burning or a roast in the oven, takes steps to get rid of the smells. Blow out and remove the candles and open a door to improve ventilation.


A large dog during a seizure will not be easily moved. A small dog during a seizure, while easier to handle, may still not be a good idea since touch is also stimulating and can agitate his delicate condition. It will be much easier to get rid of the odors than to move your dog.

, This is a controversial topic for some owners because they feel compelled to stroke their pet to soothe his anxiety. The risk is that touch is a form of stimulation, therefore it is probably best to leave him alone. His fit will pass quicker if you do not try to get involved.


During a fit, at best he won't be aware you are there, and at worst, you could prolong the attack. While touching him may be soothing to you, it will unlikely be soothing to him.

, If your pet has had seizures before, your veterinarian may have prescribed tubes of rectal Diazepam for use during or after a fit. Diazepam is a tranquilizer and good at calming brain activity sufficiently to bring some dogs out of a fit.


Because your dog cannot swallow oral medications during a seizure, a convenient method of delivery is rectal administration. Diazepam is well absorbed across the rectal mucosa and swiftly enters the blood stream.A 20 kg dog requires one 10 mg rectal syringe of diazepam, as soon after the seizure starts if possible. The dose can be repeated three times during a 24 hour period.

, To instill the rectal diazepam, remove the cap from the dosing syringe and squeeze a blob of the Diazepam onto the nozzle tip in order to lubricate it. Here's how to gently and safely administer it to your dog:


Gently hold your dog's tail away from the anus so that you can see the rectal opening.
Place the nozzle against the central opening and with a gentle twisting motion push the neck of the treatment syringe into the rectum up to the depth of the syringes shoulders.
With the suppository firmly seated in the rectal lumen, squeeze the tube to empty the contents into the rectum.
Withdrawal the nozzle and throw the spent suppository away.

, The sooner you give your dog the diazepam, the sooner his symptoms will likely fade. However, do not compromise your sense of calm in your haste. Though time is important, it's more important that you do not aggravate your dog any further.


You can also give your dog the medication after a fit to help him stay calm and prevent future episodes, especially if he is prone to cluster seizures.

, Once he recovers, your dog is likely to be hungry and thirsty. Small dogs in particular are prone to low blood glucose after a seizure, and so it is a good sign if he asks for a snack. Even if he doesn't, make food and water easily accessible.


If he doesn't eat automatically, don't fret. Give him a minute to readjust to his environment. Rest is necessary, too.

, He is bound to feel strange and disorientated for a while afterwards, so if he wants to rest quietly, let him do so. Being worn out is completely understandable and not at all a symptom that should worry you.


Also, some dogs suffer from cluster activity, which means he is more likely to have more seizures within a 24 hour period. If this is so for your dog, then keep him quiet, calm, and rested.

, She will want to examine your animal and run blood tests to investigate if there is an underlying illness or problem that triggered the seizure in the first instance. Your questions will be answered, too, so you can be given peace of mind.


Your vet will have a better grip on the situation the more detailed you are. Let her know the duration of the episode, what your dog's behavior was like, and what your pup was like immediately after the seizure, too, if you don't have a video to provide.

Trim your dog’s feet.,
Find a groomer if you need help.",How to Trim the Coat of a Long Hair Dog," There are affordable clippers marketed for general customers, but you’ll find these won’t be able to handle the challenge of a thick coat. While fine for a Yorkshire Terrier or Shih Tzu, a cheaper set won’t be up to the task of a Labrador, Collie, or Akita. Go with a professional-grade set from your local pet store.Ask a store employee for help finding the best set for your dog’s breed. A professional set will typically cost between 130 and 160 US dollars.
Professional clippers use interchangeable blades that can be removed and inexpensively resharpened, preserving their longevity.;
, Many professional clippers come with a #10 blade, which trims too short for most long-haired dog breeds. When it comes to blade numbers, the higher the number, the shorter the cut.Note that a #7 will risk pulling the skin between teeth, causing tearing and cuts. For the same reason, unless you are very experienced, you should make sure your blade is marked FC, or finish cut. The alternative, a skip-tooth blade, can pull and tear at skin if you aren’t experienced.   

, You won’t be able to use clippers on more sensitive areas, like around your dog’s eyes, private parts, and feet. Choosing blunted-edge shears is best for inexperienced groomers.If the dog jerks or moves unexpectedly, a sharper edged shear might cause an injury.
Thinning shears are a good choice, too. They only trim a specific area instead of the entire run of the shear blade, so you’re less likely to unintentionally cut out a chunk of fur.
If you’re just giving your dog a quick trim, skip the clipper cut and just use shears on the detailed areas. If your dog’s full coat needs a trim, don’t use shears on the entire body. This is time consuming and you’ll have a higher risk of making a mistake or hurting your dog with the shears.

, Even during the summer, you should never shave your long-haired dog’s coat down completely. You can trim down for a summer cut, but still leave around an inch of fur, depending on the breed.It’s always best to ask your vet or professional groomer for advice before attempting to trim, especially if you’re inexperienced.

, Your best bet is to groom your dog just after it’s expended some energy, like when it’s calm after a walk or playtime. Train your dog to love grooming time by giving it a small food treat each time you bathe, brush, or trim it. Give it extra treats to reward calm behavior.Just before you start grooming, pet your dog all over to get prepare it for all the handling that will come with trimming.
Try to keep grooming sessions positive and happy. Start with shorter grooming sessions at first, and give your dog a break if it gets too antsy.

, Before you trim the coat, make sure it’s free of matting and debris. Thoroughly work through it with your dog’s favorite brush.If you’ve just bathed your dog, give it a blow dry and make sure the coat is completely dry before trimming. Be sure to use a cool or warm setting so you don’t burn your dog.

, Turn the clippers on, and run the blade down your dog’s body, starting with its back. Periodically check the blade’s temperature with the back of your hand to make sure it’s not too hot. Always move with the lay of the hair, or from the neck down the rear, for best results.If your dog isn’t trained to calmly sit still as you run the clippers through its coat, try to keep it still by gently holding it in place with your other hand.
Remove and set aside or discard tufts of trimmed hair as necessary.

, Proceed to clip its belly, areas where its legs meet the belly, and upper portions on the legs. Gently guide your dog’s legs where you need to clip as needed, and lift it up with your other hand to access its belly areas.Continue to work with the lay of the fur, from neck to rear on the belly and from upper leg down.
Areas on the lower legs will probably be too short for the blade you’re using on the body, so they’ll need more detailed trimming using thinning shears. You can most likely skip over clipping them for now.

, Continue to trim its back legs, once again working from the upper leg down. Its rear is one area that will require a little special attention. You’ll want to carefully trim the area with shears later to avoid anything getting stuck in the fur when your dog goes to the bathroom.Use the clippers on the haunches and thighs, but save the fur around the lower legs, private areas, and tail for the shears.

, Use a comb to gather hair away from your dog’s eyes. Gently pull away the hair, and use your fingers to hold it as you use shears to trim above and below the eyes. Do your best to give a straight, even cut, so the hair around one eye is even with the other.Trim around its muzzle, especially where food gets trapped. Again, pull hair away with a comb and use straight, even lines.
Be cautious with the blade around your dog’s face, especially if you’re not using blunt-edged shears. If your dog is calm while you trim around its face, be sure to reward it with a treat!

, Trim fur away from where your dog goes to the bathroom to make sure feces won’t get stuck in excess fur. Continue along the tail. If desired, trim closer to the skin where the tail begins, and leave more fur the further up the tail you go., With the dog standing straight, use the shears and comb to trim the lower legs. Look for tufts of hair that bunch from between the toes, and trim them down so they’re level with the tops of the dog’s feet. Do the same for tufts of hair protruding below the feet.Make sure to only trim the tops and bottoms of your dog’s feet, or the hair that sticks out from these areas. Don’t cut between your dog’s toes or paw pads.

, If you're planning on showing your dog, your dog's fur has lots of mats, or if you are unsure about your clipping skills, find a good groomer. Ask your family and friends for a recommendation. Your dog's vet or trainer can also refer you to a good groomer.When you have a couple of good choices, check their reviews online or with the Better Business Bureau to see if they have a history of complaints.
Ask about cost. Generally, grooming costs between 40 and 60 US dollars, but can be more for larger breeds with longer coats.

Fill your dog’s water bowl daily.,
Clean their water bowl regularly.,
Place water bowls for your dog throughout your home.,
Keep the toilet seat down in your home.,
Switch your dog to wet food.",How to Keep a Dog Hydrated2," Make sure you keep your dog’s water bowl filled with fresh water on a daily basis. Fill it up first thing in the morning when you give your dog their breakfast. Then, check their water bowl throughout the day to make sure it is full. Fill it up again at dinner time, if it needs refilling.Make sure you toss out any old water from the previous day before you fill it up with fresh water. This will ensure the water tastes good to your dog and is free of bacteria.

, Bacteria can end up sitting on the rim of the water bowl and in any water still in the water bowl. Get in the habit of cleaning your dog’s water bowl on a daily basis. Use soap and water to remove any grime or dirt in the bowl or on the rim. Dry the bowl well before you fill it up with fresh water and set it down for your pup.For example, you may clean the bowl first thing in the morning before filling it up with fresh water. This way, it will stay clean for the rest of the day until you clean it again the following morning.

, If your dog likes to roam through your home, make sure you have water sources located throughout the space for them. Put water bowls on each floor of your home. Set up water fountains in several spots in your house so your dog always has access to fresh water. Doing this will ensure your dog never gets dehydrated.Make sure you clean all of your dog’s water sources in your home on a daily basis. This will ensure they do not get dirty or contract any bacteria.

, Prevent your dog from drinking from the toilet bowl by keeping the seat down at all times. The water in your toilet bowl likely contains bacteria and other pathogens that are harmful to dogs. Keeping the seat down will make it difficult for your dog to access the toilet bowl water. It will also encourage them to drink the fresh, clean water from their water bowl instead.If your dog really enjoys drinking from the toilet, consider purchasing a ceramic bowl for them that will mimic the type of “bowl” your toilet is.

, To encourage your dog to stay hydrated, consider switching from dry dog food to wet dog food. Wet dog food contains more water and can help your dog stay hydrated. Add water to their wet food at a 1:1 ratio to help your dog drink more water.You can also try giving your dog two wet food meals and one dry food meal a day. Wet dog food can be more expensive than dry food and requires more preparation time, so this may be a good option if you’re short on time and money.
If your dog will eat all of their dry food at one time, you can try adding water to the dry food. Many dogs will consume all of the dog food as well as the water.

Bring bottled water on walks or long trips.,
Give your dog ice cubes as treats.,
Do not keep your dog tied up outside.",How to Keep a Dog Hydrated3," Dogs can often get dehydrated when they are out for a long walk or running around outside during a play session. Long car trips can also make your dog thirsty, especially if it is a hot day. Pack bottled water or water jugs and your dog’s water bowl so you can provide fresh water for them on the go.Some dogs can be trained to drink from a squirt bottle. Try to get your dog used to drinking from a squirt bottle so you can bring it with you when you go on a walk or to a dog park. This will make it easier for you to squirt water into your dog’s mouth if they start to get dehydrated.
You can also purchase a portable, collapsible dog bowl to take with you on the go.

, Ice cubes are often a fun treat for dogs and can help them stay hydrated. Use ice cubes as a reward when your dog does a trick or follows an obedience command. Pack a cooler of ice cubes on a long trips and give them to your dog periodically to ensure they stay hydrated.To make the ice cubes more appetizing, you can try putting a dog treat in water in the ice cube tray and freeze it overnight. This way, your dog can lick the water, working their way to the treat inside the ice cube.

, Try not to keep your dog chained or tied up outside, especially on hot days. Dogs can end up wrapping their chain or leash around poles or trees, make it impossible for them to access their water bowls. Do not leave your dog tied up unattended for prolonged periods of time.If you do need to keep your dog contained, put them in their crate or kennel with access to a water bottle or a water bowl. This way, they will still be able to access fresh water.

Discuss at-home physical therapy options with your vet.,
Perform PROM exercises on your dog.,
Massage your dog.",How to Help Your Dog Through Physical Therapy1," Physical therapy may be hard for your dog, so you will need to help your dog through its therapy. Performing at-home physical therapy can help your dog feel better and get back to its normal activities. When your vet prescribes physical therapy, they will give you different at-home exercises to perform on your dog.


At-home physical therapy includes passive range-of-motion (PROM) exercises and massage therapy.
For PROM exercises, you are doing the exercises for your dog.;
, PROM exercises involve gently and slowly moving joints (ankle, knee, hips) through their natural ranges of motion. They can help reduce pain, improve blood flow, and increase flexibility.Your vet will recommend specific exercises according to which of your dog’s joints need physical therapy:


With your dog laying on the floor, place a pillow between your dog’s legs. The pillow will ensure your dog’s body is properly aligned before beginning the exercises.Repeat each exercise 5 to 10 times, two to three times a day (or, as your vet prescribed).Consider giving your dog a treat at the end of each physical therapy session as a reward for good behavior.
Do not move your dog's joints outside of their natural ranges of motion. For example, if you need to work on your dog's elbow, only flex and extend it, rather than trying to rotate it., Massage therapy may sound like nothing more than pampering. However, massage therapy can give your dog just what it needs to get through its physical therapy. It has many benefits, including pain reduction and improved blood flow.Many types of massage therapy are available to help your dog, such as direct pressure and petrissage (kneading or rolling).Depending on your dog’s overall physical therapy needs, your vet will recommend the ideal type of massage therapy for your dog.
Create a comfortable, quiet massage area in your home: play some soft music and place a few layers of blankets on the floor.Always use gentle movements when massaging your dog. If your dog is really stiff or has a lot of pain, you do not want to make the stiffness or pain worse by making forceful massage movements with your hands.

Check to see if your dog is coughing.,
Check for signs of choking.,
Encourage your dog to swallow.,
Look inside the dog’s mouth.,
Call the vet.,
Seek out someone else to help.,
Rule out other causes.,
Grasp the obstruction with pliers or tweezers.,
Help your dog to dislodge the obstruction.,
Use back blows.,
Consider performing the Heimlich maneuver.,
Check to see that your dog is breathing normally once you've removed the object.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Save a Choking Dog," Initially, if your dog is capable of coughing, wait a few moments to see if your dog can manage to cough up the obstruction on their own.


Only wait for this possibility if your dog seems to be able to breathe well.
If your dog is also wheezing, struggling, or gasping for breath, call your vet immediately.;
, Dogs may show several telling behaviors if they aren’t able to breathe. When trying to determine if your dog is choking, begin by first attempting to calm them — the more panicked the dog becomes, the greater their demand for oxygen and the worse the situation. Signs that a dog is choking include:Gagging or drooling excessively — this is one of the most obvious ways to tell if your dog is choking. If they are drooling heavily and unable to swallow, choking is more likely.
Unable to swallow
Standing in the “air hunger position” with their head and neck held low and in a straight line
Acting unusually agitated or frantic, pawing at their mouth, and whimpering
Coughing forcefully, wheezing, or gasping for breath
Having grey or blue gums
Having a visible object in the back of their throat
Displaying exaggerated chest movements
Collapsing
Losing consciousness

, This is a useful strategy to help you determine if your dog is truly choking.


You can do so by offering your dog a treat, gently rubbing their throat, or by pinching their nostrils together. If your dog eats a treat, then they are not choking.
Once the dog swallows, if the sound stops, they aren't choking.

, By visually checking the dog’s mouth, you can find out if an object is obstructing its airway and act accordingly.


Gently open its mouth by squeezing its upper lip inwards over the big molars at the back of the mouth. At the same time, apply downward pressure on the point of its jaw to further open the mouth.
Look as far back towards its throat as possible — it helps to have a flashlight and someone else to hold the dog for this. You are looking for any obstructions such as a piece of bone or a stick.
Restrain a larger dog before opening its mouth wide. Do this by grabbing the scruff of hair between the ears and holding the dog's head steady.If you can see something in the throat, try to grip it with pliers and remove it. Take extreme care not to accidentally force the object further back.

, If your dog is choking, showing signs of choking, or indeed having breathing difficulties, always phone your vet for advice. The exception to this rule is if your dog has completely collapsed or has lost consciousness. In that instance, begin administering what first-aid you can.


You may be talked through first aid procedures while waiting for emergency help and likely you will be asked to bring your pet in immediately.
If you cannot reach your vet, look for emergency 24-hour veterinarians. Their number will usually be in the phone book, or you can call a local animal welfare or rescue agency for details. Emergency vets or animal hospitals are usually available in major towns and cities.
Your local emergency number will be able to give you the ASPCA or the Humane Society emergency number. They will have an emergency vet to give you help on the phone.

, Whether you take your dog to the vet or try to administer first-aid, it’s best to have another person present to help you.


If you need to drive your pet to an emergency vet, it is best to have one person with the dog to help immediately if the situation worsens.
If the vet has you try to dislodge the object yourself, it’s advisable to do so with someone else's help.

, Because you can do more harm than good by executing certain maneuvers on a dog that doesn't need them, it is important to be as certain as possible that the dog is actually choking and in danger, rather than merely appearing to choke. The following are conditions that may cause a dog to behave similarly to a dog that’s choking.



A Long Soft Palate: A common anatomical quirk found in many dogs is having a tongue and a soft palate that are too big for their mouth. This is especially common in brachycephalic dogs (those with shortened noses and baby-like faces) such as the Pug, Pekingese, Lhasa Apso, and Shih Tzu, though it also occurs in small breeds such as the Poodle, West Highland White Terrier, Dachshund, Spitz, and Pomeranian. The result is that when the dog breathes in sharply, it physically sucks the end of the soft palate into the entrance of the windpipe. This temporarily narrows or blocks the windpipe, and the dog makes a series of dramatic snorting or gasping sounds, as if choking. This is only a temporary crisis because when the dog swallows, the soft palate flips away from the windpipe and the dog can breathe again. If you’re unsure, give the dog food or a treat. If it takes and swallows the food, it isn’t choking.

Kennel Cough: Kennel cough is an infection that causes the airway to become sore, inflamed, and irritable. Even the simple act of breathing in cool air can tickle the throat and trigger coughing episodes. This cough can be dramatic and is commonly mistaken for the dog having something stuck in its throat. Again, check to see if the dog is able to swallow by offering it something to eat. If it can swallow, it is extremely unlikely the dog is choking. Do, however, contact your vet to see if he or she would recommend an examination for the kennel cough.

Heart Disease: An enlarged heart pressing on the airways or a heart in failure can sometimes mimic choking. The dog may breathe in a distressed manner, cough, and may even have blue-tinged gums. This condition is harder to differentiate from choking, but in general the signs are slow to develop, with the dog becoming less energetic and more lethargic for a day or two beforehand. Choking, on the other hand, is far more common in active, inquisitive dogs and comes on suddenly.

, If you are able to see the object blocking the airway and the vet advises you to do so, attempt to remove the obstruction gently.


Only attempt to remove the obstruction if you can clearly see and grasp it and your dog is not frantic. You risk lodging the object in even deeper if you accidentally push it without being able to see it.If the dog is frantic, you risk being bitten badly. Go immediately to an emergency vet or animal hospital instead.

, Gravity can help your dog dislodge an obstruction. To help, you will have to hold the dog upside down and try to shake the object loose.


Pick up a small or medium dog by its hind legs. Hold the dog upside down and try to shake the object out of its mouth with the benefit of gravity.You won't be able to hold a larger dog upside down, so instead keep the front paws on the ground and lift up its hind legs (in the same manner as holding a wheelbarrow) and tilt the dog forward.

, If you can't help your dog dislodge the object by tilting your dog forward, you can forcefully strike its back to help dislodge the choking hazard.


Using the heel of your hand, deliver 4-5 sharp blows on the dog between the shoulder blades. Take care not to use excessive force with small dogs, as there is a risk of fracturing ribs, which itself can be life-threatening if a broken rib punctures a lung.If this does not work initially, try once more.

, Because you can easily injure your dog using this maneuver, use it ONLY when all other options have been exhausted.


Only start the Heimlich maneuver if you can be sure your dog is choking on an object. Place your arm around the dog's waist. Ensure that your dog's head points down, as gravity will help the object dislodge as you perform the procedure.
Make sure your hold on the dog is firm, but not too tight.
It is a good idea to have someone help you scruff the dog while you do this. It will help keep the dog steady and can restrain a frantic animal. Form a fist and bring your other hand around and cover your fist with it. Your two-handed fist should be placed on the soft spot just under the ribcage. The size of the dog will affect the exact positioning of your hands.
If you have a small- to medium-sized dog, you will want to use 2 fingers rather than a fist (still using the same amount of force) so you do not damage your dog's ribcage. Quickly and firmly give 3-5 thrusts inwards and upwards. Repeat in sets of 3-5 thrusts up to 3-4 times.
Take care not to use excessive force as you could crack ribs or rupture the spleen.

, If not, then start artificial respiration on it immediately.


If your dog has no pulse, commence CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) on your dog.If your dog needs resuscitative measures, do what you can immediately and have someone else call the vet to get further instructions.

, Even if you manage to dislodge an object, it is a good idea to get your pet to the vet to be checked for any further problems or injuries. Keep your pet calm and get your dog to the vet as quickly and as safely as possible.
Pay close attention to your dog to make sure it is able to maintain normal breathing.

Check for bright red eyelids and gums.",How to Help Your Dog Through a Stroke," This may take a few minutes to several hours, but it is important to be with the dog to keep them safe and reassured. People are frequently not present when the actual stroke occurs, but if you notice rapid eye movement, loss of balance, or vomiting, your dog may be having a stroke. Try to stay close to your dog, and don’t move them until the symptoms have stopped., Talk to the dog in hushed tones, and do whatever you can to make your dog feel more at ease. Even though the situation can be frightening or stressful for you, try not to demonstrate that stress to your dog. Remain as calm as possible. Let your dog move around if they want to without stopping them, but if they come to you crying or seeking attention, take time to speak to them softly and pet them.

, Some dogs develop an unquenchable thirst following an acute stroke. It is important that they have water, but you might need to limit the amount. Your dog may not stop drinking as long as the water is in front of them, so allow them to drink a few swallows at a time and remove the water. Monitor your dog’s behavior and react accordingly.


The vet will be able to carefully monitor your dog's hydration and provide appropriate and safe levels of fluids. If you're unsure how much water to offer, call your vet or local emergency animal hospital., Keep your dog's head free of excess pressure. Make sure your pet is elevated so the blood flows away from the brain if they are laying down. If the dog is sitting or walking around, try to gently move their head upwards to relieve pressure. Stroke is caused by excess pressure between the brain and skull bone, so preventing additional pressure is essential., If there’s an emergency animal clinic nearby, go there right away. The sooner a pet doctor is able to evaluate and assist your dog, the better. They can help you keep your dog safe, and professional care will increase your pet’s chances for a full, healthy recovery. However, if you believe your dog is currently having a stroke, wait to move the dog until they are calm.


In most cases, your dog will need to remain hospitalized for several days, so your veterinarian can monitor their health at regular intervals., Make sure your pup has a warm spot where they'll feel safe, during recovery. Dogs recovering from stroke can be confused or stressed. If they already have a regular spot, add some extra padding, blankets, or cushions to the area to make them more comfortable. It's especially important to keep them warm without overheating. Your veterinarian will be an excellent resource to help you provide optimal comfort for your pup, once they return home., If they are unable to move freely, your pup may develop sores or body aches when they rest too long in the same spot. Gently shift them to another side or onto their stomach periodically to avoid this. If your dog is unable to move well enough to go outside to dispose of waste, you may want to position them in hay, wood chips, or other disposable, absorbent materials., Depending on the cause or resultant medical concerns of your dog's stroke, you may need to provide them with a variety of prescription medicines. Sedatives may be prescribed for anxious or disoriented dogs, especially those who demonstrate aggressive behaviors. Antinausea medication may be prescribed if your pup is dizzy and unable to keep down foods. Anti-inflammatories are prescribed for dogs who still have swelling concerns, and anticonvulsants may be used to prevent seizures., More frequent preventive doctor visits are important for dogs who've suffered a stroke. Going to the vet at least twice a year gives your vet the opportunity to screen for early indicators of stroke as well as numerous other canine illnesses that you may not recognize yourself. Your vet can then guide you through providing the best care for your dog at home., It’s important to know what type of stroke your dog has experienced. Strokes can be caused by a blood clot or bleeding in the brain. This may occur with little or no warning or as the result of prolonged poor health caused by high blood pressure, infection, cancer, kidney disease, or heart health issues. It’s important to work with the vet to understand the root cause of the stroke in order to develop a treatment plan to prevent recurrence.


For instance, a dog whose stroke is the result of high blood pressure may need to take regular medication to reduce blood pressure., Heat stroke occurs when your dog’s body temperature is elevated above 103° F or 39° C for an extended period of time. This can lead to brain and other organ damage or failure. The symptoms are very similar to strokes caused by vestibular disease, but the causes are much different and easier to prevent by making sure you’re helping the dog stay cool and providing plenty of water on hot days.


Dogs can also suffer heat stroke caused by prolonged temperature as a result of illness or infection. Make sure to take your pet to the vet, if they show signs of sickness or infection like vomiting or lethargy.
Rarely, dogs experience a genetic malformation that causes them to be incapable of regulating body temperature. This is much more difficult to treat and will require ongoing maintenance performed by your vet., Check your pet food for the inclusion of common natural antioxidants like vitamins C and E and citric acid. You may also find synthetic antioxidants like BHA and BHT on the ingredient list. Antioxidants are essential to prevent the negative effects of oxidation, which causes degeneration of healthy cells in the brain and other organs. Thus, the risk of stroke and other health concerns increases.


Dogs often eat herbs like rosemary in the wild that boost their antioxidant intake, so consider including some fresh rosemary in your dog’s daily meals., Omega 3s are thought to help dog's recovering from a stroke because the Omega 3 fatty acids are concentrated in the brain where they create connections between the various parts of the brain. They also reduce inflammation and increase the flow of oxygen through the body, which is essential for the healthy function of every part of the body.


You can look for store-bought foods that include Omega 3s, or you can give your dog Omega 3 supplements. Check with your vet before beginning this course of treatment., You may not be present when your dog has a stroke, so it's important to know the warning signs that one has occurred. Your pup may become imbalanced, lean to the side, or be completely incapable of walking. Other pets begin walking in circles because they are disoriented. If you notice any of these telltale signs, proceed to your nearest emergency pet hospital or your veterinarian’s office if possible., If their eyes are moving rapidly from side to side, they may be having a stroke or they may have had one previously. This is called nystagmus, and it may also cause your dog to be unable to focus their eyes. Nystagmus may not happen constantly, but following a stroke or during a stroke, you will likely see some indicator that your dog’s eyes are unfocused, rapidly moving, or irregularly positioned (cross-eyed)., Rapid breathing is another early indicator your dog is experiencing a stroke, may have a stroke, or has already had a stroke. Many dogs pant as though they are too warm, but in others, you will simply see their sides rising and falling very quickly. Other dogs may seem to struggle to breathe in at all and look and act as though they are gasping for air.Typically, dogs breathe between ten and thirty-five times each minute. To check your dog’s rate of respiration, set a timer for fifteen seconds. Count your dog’s heart beats and multiply by four. If your dog’s resting heartbeat is above thirty-five, seek medical assistance., Stroke affects some dogs the way carsickness does. It causes dizziness and nausea which may lead to vomiting and loss of appetite. If your dog seems suddenly unwilling or unable to eat or vomits frequently following meals, this may be a warning sign of stroke., This discoloration indicates your pup has had a decrease in the amount of oxygen circulation. Dark red coloring inside the eyelids and mouth is one of the most noticeable changes that occurs when dogs have recently suffered a stroke.

Take a deep breath.,
Observe and record symptoms.,
Consider inducing your dog to vomit.,
Induce vomiting.,
Seek veterinary care in most cases.",How to Help a Dog That May Have Been Poisoned1," When your dog is suffering, it can be extremely frightening. Further, you need to act quickly to determine the cause of your dog’s symptoms and act accordingly. If you need to, take a moment to center yourself and keep yourself from panicking, as you will be better able to help your dog if you remain calm., If it is not immediately apparent whether your dog has been poisoned or what may have poisoned them, carefully observe any symptoms they are exhibiting. Write them down, and include the frequency and degree of each symptom.For instance, if your dog is vomiting, note how many times they throw up, how much they throw up, and the color and consistency of their vomit.
This information can help you and your vet determine what the cause of any symptoms are, and take the appropriate steps to treat your dog.
If you suspect that your dog ingested something in particular, note what time you believe they ate it.

, If you catch your dog in the act of eating a bar of chocolate or your seasonal flower arrangement, you may want to induce vomiting to ensure these potentially poisonous items don't hurt them. As a rule of thumb, it's likely worth inducing vomiting if your dog has just eaten potentially dangerous human foods or plants. However, you should not automatically induce vomiting when you suspect poisoning.Do not induce vomiting when your dog has eaten something caustic (like bleach or drain de-clogger), something acidic (like battery acid), something pointy or sharp, or any petroleum-based product. Further, do not induce vomiting is your dog is having trouble breathing, has a slow heart rate, is experiencing seizures or convulsions, or is visibility depressed, shocked, or unconscious.
When unsure, call your vet and ask what to do. There are also several animal poison control hotlines to call, though there is a fee for doing so.

, If you are sure that vomiting will not pose further risk to your dog or you are directed by veterinary or poison control personnel to do so, you can easily and safely cause your dog to vomit. A 1:1 solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide and water will do the trick.One teaspoon (5mls) of this solution per 10lbs of his body weight is ideal. Using a turkey baster can make measuring and administering the solution easier.
Provide another dose of the mixture every 15 minutes or so, up to three times, until the dog throws up.
Use unexpired hydrogen peroxide from an unopened bottle for maximum effectiveness. If you do not have hydrogen peroxide, drop a teaspoon of table salt into the back of the dog's throat.
Save the vomit to bring with you to the vet. Depending on what your dog ate, the vet may still need to see your dog.

, Unless you are able to establish that your dog’s symptoms are unrelated to poisoning, you should bring them to the vet immediately. If you vet is not open, bring your dog to a 24hr emergency animal care facility.If you know or suspect that your dog has ingested something poisonous but is not yet showing symptoms, seek veterinary care immediately. While some poisons do not lead to short term symptoms, it may be too late to save your dog once symptoms become apparent.

Create a physical therapy schedule with the physical therapist.,
Discuss your dog’s limitations for certain exercises.,
Stay with your dog.",How to Help Your Dog Through Physical Therapy2," Helping your dog through physical therapy may also involve taking your dog to a canine rehabilitation center. At the initial appointment, the physical therapist will do a thorough evaluation of your dog’s condition and recommend a physical therapy treatment plan.


The treatment plan involve several physical therapy sessions a week, so create a schedule that will work best for you.
At a canine rehabilitation center, your dog will probably do some active range-of-motion exercises. These are exercises where your dog will be doing the work, rather than having the work done for it.

, Many types of equipment are available at canine rehabilitation centers, including treadmills, stairs, and even pools. However, even the best equipment won’t help your dog if your dog is unable or unwilling to use them. For example, if your dog doesn’t like the water, then water exercises could be a challenge.


During the evaluation, the physical therapist will assess your dog’s pain level.If your dog is in extreme pain, some exercises or pieces of equipment will be off limits until your dog’s pain improves.
Let the physical therapist know if your dog has any fears or dislikes, such as water or stairs. The therapist can tailor the treatment plan according to what your dog is most comfortable with.

, Ask the physical therapist if you can stay with your dog during physical therapy sessions. Having you there may help your dog feel more at ease with going through physical therapy. If you can stay, give your dog lots of positive encouragement, such as:


Verbal praise: “Good dog!” “You’re doing great!”
Treats when your dog successfully performs a physical therapy exercise.
Petting.

Call your vet as you head in their direction.,
Call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center.,
Follow the vet's instruction for follow-up care.",How to Help a Dog That May Have Been Poisoned2," If you think your dog is suffering from poisoning, they will likely need veterinary attention. Call ahead when you’re on your way, so that they can prepare for your arrival. (This will also ensure they are open.)If your vet is closed, bring your dog to a 24hr emergency animal care facility.
Bring evidence to the vet with you. Bring the packing and remnants of any poisonous item your dog may have eaten with you. This will help the vet determine treatment.

, The APCC is only a call away, everyday, year round. Aside from your vet, it is the best resource for any animal poison-related emergency. The center’s number is (888) 426-4435, and they charge a $65 consultation fee for the phone call., Your dog may continue to vomit and have diarrhea, even after seeing the vet. Try to make your dog as comfortable as possible, and keep them somewhere it will be easy to clean up any messes. Provide ample water and feed them according to your vet's recommendations. Most importantly, administer medication exactly as directed.

Visit the veterinarian at least once a year.,
Recognize signs of potential problems that should be examined by your vet.,
Put together a pet first aid kit.,
Spay or neuter your dog.,
Feed your dog healthy meals.,
Include nutritional supplements with meals.,
Provide your pup with their own space.,
Give your dog regular exercise.",How to Help Your Dog Live Longer1," Dogs and all pets need professional healthcare to maintain their optimal level of health. Take your pup to the vet once or twice a year for checkups and vaccinations. This gives your vet an opportunity to check for signs of common health concerns, answer health or nutrition questions you may have, and offer recommendations for improving your dog’s health., Common indicators include bad breath or drooling; changes in appetite, activity levels, or sleep patterns; breathing troubles or congestion; digestive issues; and others. Also talk to your vet about common illnesses and symptoms for your dog’s breed., This should include Neosporin, latex gloves, cotton balls, peroxide or rubbing alcohol, gauze, and a list of phone numbers of local veterinary and emergency clinics you can call. This ensures you’re prepared to help your pup if it’s injured or sick. Always let your vet know if your pup is hurt or unwell. You may think the concern is no big deal, but the smallest issues can develop into serious canine health concerns.Keep a dog first aid guidebook handy, or bookmark a website such as http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/pet_first_aid_kit.html.

, Unless you plan to breed your pet intentionally, you should consider sterilization for their safety and to control the canine population. Spaying and neutering at a young age will not dramatically impact your pet’s health, and once they’re healed, they will not experience any of the common hormonal fluctuations and stressful bodily changes that accompany canine reproduction. Removing this bodily stress allows them to remain healthier longer.Some experts believe spaying or neutering reduces cancer risks, but there are also studies that indicate the opposite. It may be that “fixed” dogs live longer and therefore have greater odds of eventually developing cancer., You can purchase nutritionally complete dog foods that contain appropriate amounts of protein, fat, and vitamins based on your dog’s breed, size, and age. Talk to your vet about what foods are available to promote your dog’s health, and always read your pet food ingredients to ensure real, whole foods are listed rather than unrecognizable, chemical additives. You may also want to consider preparing meals for your dog at home. Again, the best place to start is with a visit to your vet for recommendations.


Always have fresh water available to your dog to ensure they are hydrated.
Don’t give too many treats. They are often high in sugar, and over time, too many treats will lead to weight gain. A number of canine health concerns such as hip dysplasia and diabetes are exacerbated by excess weight., There are a number of products made specifically for dogs, and you can also use those intended for human consumption in some cases. Talk to a vet before giving your pup any vitamins, minerals, or other supplemental health products. These supplements are typically available in liquid, chews, and pills.


Include glucosamine and chondroitin for dogs with joint trouble.
Provide fiber supplements for pets who have digestive concerns.
Calcium is essential for puppies who are still developing strong bones.
Use prebiotics to improve your dog’s digestive system and immune health.
Omega fatty acids improve joint health, promote memory, and provide necessary calories to keep your dog active., Dogs feel safest when they are enclosed, so giving them a dog house or crate that is comfortable and includes toys and treats that they like makes them feel secure. You can also give your dog their own bed. While it’s not enclosed, having a place of their own where they feel comfortable is a great way to keep your dog happy.


Crates or dog houses should not be used just for transportation or as a punishment.
Make sure crates and beds provide adequate padding to protect your dog from putting too much pressure or strain on joints., It's important to maintain your pup's healthy weight, muscles, and longevity. The stronger your pup is, the easier their movement will be, and the longer they'll live. Your dog doesn't need to do a special canine yoga class to stay in shape. A daily walk or a game of fetch is just as effective. However, Doga (dog yoga) can be fun too!


Keeping larger dogs moving is essential to prevent common concerns like dysplasia in these big breeds.
If weight is a concern, ask your vet about using weighted backpacks to assist your dog in losing extra pounds, or to make the most out of shorter walks."
"
Speak softly to the dog.,
Turn your body slightly away from the dog.,
Move slowly.,
Extend a closed hand toward the dog.,
Determine if the dog is too aggressive to approach.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident1," Start talking to the dog before moving toward it. Use a soft, soothing voice that will be comforting to the dog. Shouting or using a loud, firm voice could intimidate the dog, making it uncomfortable or scared.


Keep talking to the dog in this manner the whole time you are trying to help it.;
, As you approach, keep your body turned slightly away from the dog so that you are not towering over it. Towering above the dog can be scary for it and may cause it to act aggressively in defense.If possible, stay low to the ground as you approach so that you appear as less of a threat to the dog.

, Do not run up to the dog, as this might frighten it and cause it to try to run away. Instead, make slow, steady movements. Stop when you are about one foot away from the injured dog., Make a loose fist with one of your hands. Keeping your knuckles pointed up, slowly extend your closed hand toward the dog. Depending on the dog’s reaction to your hand, do one of the following:


If the dog struggles, growls, or makes another act of aggression, retract your hand. Continue to talk softly to the dog for another minute or so, then reach your hand out again. You may need to do this several times before the dog begins to trust you.
If the dog shows no signs of aggression, pet it gently with your closed hand. Continue talking softly to the dog while you pet it., If you’ve tried to approach the dog by following the steps above, but the dog is still being very aggressive, it may not be safe for you to try and help the dog. If you feel the dog will bite you if you continue to approach, slowly back away. Call animal control to assist in rescuing the dog.


You should also call animal control if the dog has run away from the scene. They can help track down and safely capture the dog."

Antifreeze, if your dog swallowed it in the past two hoursChocolateGrapes or raisinsTylenol or AspirinPlants, such as azaleas and daffodils;
, If your dog is laying on its bed or on the carpet, you’ll want to move your dog somewhere else before inducing vomiting. For example, take your dog outside or move your dog to an area where cleaning up vomit will be easy, like a room with linoleum flooring.If your dog is weak, it may not be able to walk easily on its own. You may need to carry your dog or at least help it walk to where you want it to go.

, At first, it may seem strange to feed your dog to get it to vomit. However, feeding your dog a little food can actually increase the chances of vomiting. A small portion of canned food or a slice of plain bread are good food choices.Canned food will be easy for your dog to eat and is tastier than dry food.
Your dog may not want to eat on its own. If this happens, try putting the food directly in your dog’s mouth to get it to eat.
Do not spend a lot of time trying to get your dog to eat.

, This is very important! Do not try to get your dog to vomit before calling your vet or animal poison control center.When you call, provide as much information as possible so they can instruct you on what to do (and what not to do) next. Important information includes:


What you think your dog ingested (toxic plant, house cleaning product, chocolate)
How long you think it’s been since your dog ingested the toxin
Your dog’s symptoms
Your dog’s size

, If your vet or poison control center says it’s okay to induce vomiting, give your dog 3% hydrogen peroxide, which is available at your local pharmacy. It is the preferred vomit-inducing product for dogs.Give your dog one teaspoon hydrogen peroxide per 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of body weight.Use a measuring spoon to measure the right amount of hydrogen peroxide.

, Draw up the hydrogen peroxide into an ear or eye dropper.Drop the measured amount of hydrogen peroxide as far back on your dog’s tongue as you can.Do not mix hydrogen peroxide into your dog’s food or water before drawing it up in the dropper., Walking can stimulate vomiting by letting your dog’s stomach contents mix with the hydrogen peroxide.Walk your dog for a few minutes. If your dog isn’t up to walking, gently shake or move its belly., After being given hydrogen peroxide, dogs usually vomit within a few minutes. If your dog does not vomit after 10 minutes, give it another dose of hydrogen peroxide.Some sources say not to give a dog more than two doses of hydrogen peroxide.Others say up to three doses is acceptable.Before giving a third dose, call your vet.

, Your dog will need to be treated by your vet, even if you got your dog to vomit. Vomiting is just a quick fix and will not get rid of all the toxin in your dog’s stomach.Veterinary care is essential if your dog didn't vomit—this means your dog will need something stronger than hydrogen peroxide to vomit.Do not get delay in getting your dog to your vet.
If your dog vomited, take a picture of it to show to your vet.

, Even if you already spoke to your vet before giving your dog hydrogen peroxide, it will be helpful to repeat what happened while your vet examines your dog. You should also tell your vet how much hydrogen peroxide you gave your dog and how many times you gave the hydrogen peroxide.


If your dog vomited, describe what the vomit looked like, or show the picture of the vomit.

, Your vet has access to medications that can induce vomiting, as well as substances that can prevent toxin absorption. For example, your vet can give your dog activated charcoal, which will bind to the toxin in the digestive system and prevent absorption.Apomorphine is an opioid medication that can induce vomiting. It usually works within five to ten minutes.A drug called xylazine can also induce vomiting in dogs.Your vet will determine the best way to treat your dog’s ingestion of a toxic substance.

, Some substances, after being ingested, can cause a lot of damage if vomited back up. If you know your dog swallowed one of the following substances, do not induce vomiting:Bleach
Drain cleaner
Petroleum-containing substance, such as gasoline

, Getting a dog to vomit can be dangerous if the dog is extremely sick or unresponsive. If your dog is showing signs of severe poisoning, do not induce vomiting. Take your dog to your vet right away. Look for the following signs indicating severe poisoning:Difficulty breathing
Looking depressed
Having seizures
Slow heart rate
Unconscious

, Syrup of ipecac used to be recommended for inducing vomiting in dogs. However, it can linger in the stomach and cause a lot of stomach irritation if a dog doesn’t vomit. Salt is also no longer recommended because it can become toxic if a dog is given too much of it., If possible, get your dog to vomit within about two hours after it has ingested something toxic.After two hours, the toxin will have moved into the intestines, making induction of vomiting no longer effective."

Chances are good the dog will not bleed too severely. Also, dogs feed off the emotional energy of their humans. If you are upset or panicked, your dog will get excited. Excitement raises the blood pressure, which leads to more bleeding.;
, You want to remove the dog from other sources or excitement such as other dogs or noisy people. Provide a couple of treats and get the dog to sit or lay down, so you can tend to the injury.

, Use a dry, clean paper towel, washcloth, pieces of sterile gauze, or any other clean cloth to apply direct pressure to the cut. Keep firm pressure on the cut for up to five minutes.At two minutes, you can gently lift the towel or cloth to see if the bleeding has slowed.
After five minutes of pressure, most bleeding should have slowed considerably or stopped.

, If you have a commercial clotting aid—the kind you can purchase in the store—pour an ample amount of powder into the palm of one of your hands. Using a clean fingertip, apply the clotting aid to the wound using gentle pressure.Repeat until the bleeding stops completely.


If you don’t have a clotting aid, cornstarch, flour, or baby powder will work.
Do not use baking soda or baking powder as they can lead to an infection in the cut.

, You can use diluted hydrogen peroxide to remove any dried blood from your dog. However, do not use this or anything else directly on the wound. That might disturb the clot and cause bleeding again.

, Though you can handle most small ear cuts at home, there are some situations where you should allow your vet to treat the dog. In these situations, continue to apply pressure to the wound as you transport your dog to the clinic. The ear may need sutures or other measures to stop the blood flow and ensure the ear heals properly. Seek a vet’s assistance if:There is profuse bleeding
The wound goes through the ear
The bleeding doesn’t stop after 10 minutes of home treatment
The bleeding keeps restarting
The wound is larger than a simple cut

, Keep the dog in the quiet spot, so he can rest and you can keep a close eye on him. Make sure that the dog does not participate in any activity such as running or playing.

,


Another potential complication from vigorous head shaking or scratching is the formation of an aural hematoma, which is a blood clot between the layers of the ear. This happens when a blood vessel beneath the skin and cartilage breaks and bleeds into the ear cartilage. The ear will swell like a pillow. These need to be treated by a veterinarian., To minimize complications, you can use an Elizabethian collar (also known as an e-collar, cone or recovery collar) for two or three days.This will prevent the dog from reaching the ear with a foot.

, You can minimize the dog’s desire to shake its head by carefully cleaning the ear and ear canal. Remove any bothersome blood or debris in the canal or inside the ear.

, Another option is to create a head bandage for the dog. This is especially helpful if the dog keeps flapping its ears. You will need to sacrifice a stocking for this option. Cut the toe off the stocking to form a tube. Fold the ears back over the head, using a piece of gauze on the wound. Carefully slide the stocking over the head. The nose and eyes should remain open with the stocking placed just beyond the eyes.


Make sure the fit is snug but not too tight. You should easily be able to fit a finger under the stocking both on the head and the neck.
Leave the bandage on for a day, then remove it and check the ear wound. If needed, you can replace it for another day as long as it remains clean and dry.

Watch out for symptoms of potential poisoning.,
Make sure human medications or other drugs were not the cause.,
Check your bathroom.,
Take the dog to the vet if they’ve consumed any tobacco products.,
Look in the garage and shed.,
Check whether they got into household products.,
Identify any plants they may have eaten.,
Look to see if the dog got into human food.",How to Help a Dog That May Have Been Poisoned3," There are many symptoms that may indicate that your dog has ingested or inhaled something poisonous. Unfortunately, these symptoms vary widely. Do not assume that the presence of some of these symptoms indicates poisoning for sure, but do take steps to ensure your dog is safe if any of these symptoms occur.Symptoms may include, but are not limited to, vomiting, trouble breathing, excessive coughing or sneezing, swollen tissue, hyperactivity, tremors and seizures, fever, abnormal heart rate and rhythm, and coma.
If any of these symptoms are present and you suspect poisoning, call your vet and explain the circumstances.

, Many human medications can be seriously harmful, if not fatal to your dog. For instance amphetamines, including Adderall and cocaine, can be very dangerous to your dog. Consult your vet immediately if your dog has consumed human medication.Human pain medication, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen are all dangerous to dogs. Aspirin, though it is occasionally prescribed to dogs in small amounts, can be dangerous in large amounts.
Anti-upset stomach medications for people can be dangerous to dogs. These include products like Kaopectate and Pepto Bismol.
Decongestants are especially dangerous. These include cold & flu products that contain pseudoephedrine, as well as anything with antihistamines.
Ointments and creams containing baclofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, ketamine, lidocaine, dibucaine, 5-fluorouracil, and calcipotriene can cause serious harm to your dog - even if consumed in small amounts by licking your skin after you’ve applied the product.
Anti-cancer drugs, anti-depressants, and weight-loss drugs, as well as vitamins - especially iron tablets - are all also dangerous to dogs.

, There are several things your dog might have gotten into in the bathroom that may lead to poisoning. The ingestion of soap of any kind, for that matter, is likely to cause vomiting and diarrhea.Ingesting petroleum jelly will also likely cause your dog to have diarrhea. Mouthwash can also be dangerous to your dog.
Artificial aromatics, including scented candles, can also be toxic for dogs.
Beware of uncured grout consumption. The materials used to seal bathroom fixtures or tiles in place vary widely in toxicity. Many can cause drooling, vomiting, and ulcers. Once dried, these materials will usually only cause a brief upset stomach.
Keep your dog out of the toilet. If your dog drinks from a toilet that has recently been treated with a cleaning tablet, it is unlikely to cause more than mild stomach discomfort. However, stagnant toilet water can lead to bacterial infections.

, Cigarettes, nicotine patches, and the liquid used in electronic cigarettes can all prove extremely harmful to your dog. Do not hesitate to bring them in for veterinary care if you believe they’ve eaten any of these items., If you dog may have gotten into something stored in another area of your property, be sure to check for evidence of anything poisonous. Antifreeze is especially dangerous, as the scent and flavor appeals to some dog, though ingestion is often fatal.Other items that may poison your dog include ice-melt, chemicals for the pool or water softener, rat or mouse poison, insect bait/poison, fertilizers, and citronella products.

, There are likely many substances in your home that can pose a poisoning risk to your dog. Many cleaning products, for instance, may cause skin irritation and/or vomiting. Though most household products will not seriously harm your dog if used correctly or consumed in minor amounts, it can be helpful to identify the exact source of any potential poisoning.If you believe your dog may have eaten some carpet deodorizer or carpet shampoo, you can expect them to experience a mildly upset stomach, but otherwise be okay.
Bleach can lead to poisoning if spilled in a poorly ventilated area where the dog is confined, or is somehow ingested.
Inhalation or ingestion of essential oils can be toxic to your dog.
Take your dog to the vet if they’ve eaten unused fabric softener sheets. The chemicals contained in these sheets can lead to drooling, vomiting, ulcers, and fever. Used sheets can also be dangerous is eaten in a large quantity.

, Several plants that are commonly planted in people’s homes and yards can be poisonous to dogs. These include poinsettias, holly, aloe-vera plants, daffodils, chrysanthemums, azaleas, lilies, tulips, begonias, and more.Mistletoe and pine needles can also poison your dog.
Further, some weeds can be poisonous to your dog as well. If you notice a plant that seems to have been chewed or eaten, or your dog throws up plant matter, bring some with you to the vet.

, You likely already know that chocolate is dangerous for dogs to eat. Even a small amount can seriously harm your dog. Other foods that may be present in your kitchen may also poison your dog.In particular, hard candies, chewing gum or candy with Xylitol, raisins, grapes, avocados, and macadamia nuts are all poisonous to dogs.

Call your vet to attend to your injured dog.,
Move your dog to safe place.,
Notice if your dog’s leg moves or wobbles in the wrong direction.,
Look to see if the bone has penetrated the skin.,

Apply another layer of Soffban.,
Apply a protective layer such as Co-flex to keep the bandage clean and rigid.,
Use Elastoplast to prevent the splint from sliding off.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Splint a Dog's Leg," If you can avoid moving your dog or if he is injured in a low traffic area, call your vet to help you assess your dog’s injury.


If your dog appears to be okay to walk or move without a splint, it may not be necessary to make one. But, if his injury is pretty bad, the splint will support the bone and minimize any further damage en route to a vet clinic.;
, It’s important to get your dog to lay still to assess the injury, so you will need to move him to a safe place to examine his leg. If he has been hit by a vehicle and is lying in the middle of the highway and is small and light enough, pick him up and carry him to a safe area.


If your dog is too large for you to carry on your own, get a passerby to help you lift him to safety.
As a last resort, you can encourage your dog to stand and limp to a safe area.

, Signs of obvious instability in your dog’s leg includes the leg moving in a direction it is not meant to.


For example, if your dog has a shin bone fracture, the shin bone may bend or bow when it should be straight, or the bone may angle in the wrong direction, such as pointing outwards when it should rest parallel to your dog’s body.

, If your dog’s injured bone is sticking out through his skin, a splint will help to stop the bone from moving any further.

, If you determine that your dog’s injury needs a splint, you need to prevent your dog from standing or walking on his damaged leg by tying him to a piece of furniture or a post.


You can also get your neighbor to help you watch him to make sure he does not put weight on his damaged leg.

, You don’t want to get the first few layers of the splint on only to find you are missing a length of bandage so get all your materials together in one place before you make the splint. Pausing to search for more materials will also allow your dog to shake or move his leg while he is unsupervised, and potential undo all your hard work on the splint.


Get four to five rolls of cotton padding bandage (such as Soffban) and four to five rolls of cotton bandage.
A roll of zinc oxide tape.
A roll of crepe bandage (preferably a self-adhesive bandage such as Co-flex).
A roll of adhesive bandage (such as Elastoplast).
A splint. You want a splint that is a similar width and as long as the injured limb bone. A ruler or a wooden spatula can be acceptable splints in a pinch.
Scissors to cut the bandage material.

, If your dog is conscious, it is helpful to a friend or neighbor assist you in holding your dog still. This will also prevent him from shaking off the dressing halfway through and if he gets snappy because of the pain, your assistant can help to calm him down while you work on the splint.

, Use a rug or a towel to create a soft, padded surface as your dog will be less likely to wiggle around if he is comfortable.

, Your assistant should stand with your dog’s back against their tummy, so that your dog’s legs are pointing away from them and towards you.

, If your dog is wiggling around, your assistant can gently rest their forearm over your dog’s neck to push your dog’s head to the floor. Your assistant can then use their free hand to grasp your dog’s leg, which should be resting on the ground.


Pinning down your dog’s head and holding his leg will stop him from getting up.

, To do this, cut two strips of zinc oxide tape so they are four-inches wider than the swab. Open the sterile swab packaging and place the swab on top of the open wound. Wrap the zinc oxide tape over the swab and wind it around your dog’s leg to anchor the swab in place.


Avoid stretching the tape because this could restrict the blood circulation to your dog’s leg.
If you do not have access to sterile swabs, use a piece of clean linen or cotton to cover the wound; a clean handkerchief would work just fine. Choose a material that is not fluffy and will not leave fibers in the wound. Do not use wool or fleece.

, Applying the splint directly to the skin can cause rubbing and discomfort so begin with a single layer of padding around your dog’s leg. You want to prevent the splint from resting against your dog’s skin, rather than pad the injury, so do not put lots of layers of padding at this stage. Too much padding can cause the splint to slip out of place.


Remove the wrapper from the sterile Soffban. If you are right-handed, hold the roll in your right hand with the tongue rolling down and under the roll, and facing away from you.
Start at the toes, and rest the tongue of the roll over the top of your dog’s paw. Hold it in place with the left hand and then wind the Soffban around the limb in a circular motion, with each wrap overlapping the previous by half the width of the Soffban.
Apply a little bit of tension to the Soffban as you wind, so that it stretches slightly but does not tear. Soffban will not cut off circulation on the limb because the fibers part and the bandage shears before that amount of tension can be applied.
Continue winding the Soffban until you have encased the limb. Tear off the Soffban and tuck the free end under the previous wrap to secure it.
If you do not have access to medical supplies like Soffban, you can use regular cotton wool to form a soft layer around the leg, or cut a T-shirt into strips and wrap them around your dog’s leg.

, Each strip should be twice the diameter of the bone being splinted.

, Make sure you line up the splint to properly fit the injured area.

, Wind the tape around the splint and Soffban, so the splint is secured firmly against the limb.


If you don't have access to zinc oxide tape, improvise with what you have on hand. Zinc oxide tape is a fabric tape with adhesive, so you could use alternatives like sticky tape, duct tape, or even shoelaces tied around the splint and leg to secure it in place. The goal is to anchor the splint against the leg so it is comfortable for your dog.

, Do this the same way you applied the initial layer of Soffban. Then, open the sterile packaging on the cotton bandage and wind a layer over the top of the Soffban, using the same technique.


Repeat this for approximately three layers.
Applying further layers of padding and bandage helps to hold the splint in place and further immobilizes any fractures.

, Open the sterile wrapper and apply a layer of Co-flex using the same technique as you did for the Soffban.


Co-flex is stretchy so if it is applied in its stretched state, it will contract on the damaged limb and impair the limb’s blood circulation. Always release the tension on the roll as you bandage so the Co-flex is unstretched as you wrap it around your dog’s leg.
If you do not have access to Co-flex, don't worry about this step. The bandage will be fine without an outer layer in the short term (about a day), while you take your dog to the vet. The outer layer will help to keep the inner layers clean, which becomes more of a priority if the dressing has to stay in place for several days.

, No matter how well you apply the splint, most limb dressings have a habit of sliding off. So to ensure this doesn’t happen, cut a length of adhesive dressing, such as Elastoplast, to secure the top of the dressing to the limb.


Cut a length of Elastoplast that is long enough to pass twice around the top of the dressing. Overlap the width so that half overlaps the dressing and the other half overlaps the fur on your dog’s leg. Then, wind the Elastoplast around like a garter.

, Now that your pup’s damaged limb is supported in a splint, make your way to the vet.

Tag or microchip your dog.,
Keep your dog on a leash or behind a fence when outside.,
Protect your dog from extreme weather conditions.,
Watch out for aggressive dogs and fighting.",How to Help Your Dog Live Longer2," Whether it is required where you live or not, take the time to attach or inject identifying information so that your dog can be returned to you if lost. A tag should be made of a durable material, attached securely to a sturdy collar, and include the dog’s name and your name and contact information. Microchips are implanted under the dog’s skin and can be scanned to provide identifying information; have your veterinarian do the implantation., Dogs who are allowed to roam free may run into traffic, encounter a wild animal or aggressive dog, or simply run away. If possible, start leash-training your dog as a puppy, and only let it loose if you are in an enclosed yard or dog park. Install home fencing that cannot be easily knocked over, dug under, or jumped over; electric (or “invisible”) fencing is another option, with proper training., If it is too hot or cold for you to be comfortable outdoors, you should limit the amount of time your pup spends out there as well. In hot weather, make sure your dog has constant access to shade and fresh water. When it’s cold outside, make sure to provide a warm shelter and protective clothing and footwear., Dogs can be seriously or even fatally injured during a fight. Reduce your own dog’s aggression through desensitization training, and use a leash — and, if necessary, a muzzle — when walking your dog. Learn to recognize signs of aggression in other dogs, and try to avoid them whenever possible. If a fight does occur, try not to intervene directly, but rather distract the combatants. Treat any injuries immediately, and see your vet if needed."

Detangle pet fur.,
Brush your dog.,
Bathe your dog regularly.,
Keep nails trimmed.,
Care for your dog's teeth and gums.",How to Help Your Dog Live Longer3," If your pet has long or thick fur, check daily for any debris stuck in the coat, tangles, or mats and remove these carefully. If your pet has shorter hair, you’re likely to see these items and be able to easily pluck them from the coat. Take a few minutes to run your hands through your dog's coat from head to tail. You're looking for burs, matted hair, sticks or debris, bugs and ticks, or any other foreign item your dog's coat has acquired.

, You should do this for dogs of any coat length at least once each week. While this may not seem like a significant way to improve your dog’s health and longevity, foreign debris caught in the fur can lead to a number of health concerns. For instance, an irritating substance in the fur like a bur can rub against the skin, causing rashes or sores that may lead to more serious issues, infections, or skin conditions.


Use a slicker brush that has numerous, close together bristles to detangle long dog hair. These bristles are able to slip between hairs, detangling without pulling.
Use detangling solution or mineral oil to soften stubborn tangles., Cleaning dogs about once a month or every other month will help you keep their fur and skin clean and free of irritants. Dogs are susceptible to illness that can occur due to the presence of bugs, mites, ticks, and other irritants that access your pup through their skin. Bathing helps to prevent these issues, and gives you the opportunity to check your pup’s fur and skin for potential issues., When they’re too long, nails may get stuck, chip, or break. This can be extremely painful for your pup. There’s also a large vein in pet nails called the quick, and when this vein is accessed, the result could be heavy bleeding, which can be very dangerous for your dog.


To trim the nails, use baby nail clippers or clippers that are made for animals. If your pup has white nails, you’ll be able to see the quick. It is the dark pink part of the nail. If your dog has darker nails, you will need to remove a small sliver of nail at a time.
After each snip, look at the newly revealed part of the nail checking for a gray-colored area. This is the quick. Stop clipping when you can see the quick.Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding if you nick the quick.

, Brushing your dog's teeth is very important. Many dog breeds suffer from oral health issues just like humans. Taking a few minutes a day or at least once a week to remove plaque is an important way to avoid these health risks. Simply apply pet toothpaste to a dog toothbrush. Then, lift your dog's lip to reveal the teeth. Carefully brush the outside and inside of each tooth.


Purchase toothpaste that is made for pets. Rather than mint, these pastes are typically flavored like foods your pet enjoys. Do not use human toothpaste, as it may be harmful to your dog.
Allow your pet to get used to the toothbrush and toothpaste. Let them smell or taste the paste. Start by simply brushing one or two teeth, and seeing how your pup reacts.
Start brushing when your dog is young, so they're used to the activity when they reach adult maturity."

Spend time with your pup.,
Train your dog.,
Take your dog on trips.,
Keep your pup busy while you're away.",How to Help Your Dog Live Longer4," Go for daily walks and let the dog meet and greet with other dogs and people. You can even take your dog to new places like the beach, the park, or maybe even a pet spa for a special treat. There’s no need to plan a special day though, just spend some time petting your dog, playing fetch or tug of war, or even just taking a nap with your pup. The most important thing is to give your pup plenty of love and attention that will relieve stress and make your dog happier, which can improve quality of life., Start early, and focus training on making sure your pup is safe and free from stress. For instance, train your dog to walk on a leash. This will prevent them from running away, which could lead to injury caused by cars or other dogs. You should also house train your pet. It’s important to your health and your dog’s that waste be excreted outside, so train your dog to use a dog door, ring bells to alert you they need to go outside, or use any other house training system that works for your unique needs., Most dogs love riding in the car, so bring them along next time you run an errand. You can also plan a more extensive trip with your pup. For instance, you can take your dog camping or hiking. These types of outings increase your dog’s overall happiness, and camping and hiking may even give your pet some extra exercise.Prioritize safety and comfort in the car. Practice with short trips first, and tire your dog out beforehand; provide familiar comforts like blankets and toys; plan lots of breaks; and use either a familiar crate, a dog guard, or a seat restraint for safety., If you are out of the house for more than a few hours at a time, you'll need to give your dog something to do, and keep them in an area where they are safe. Bored dogs can become destructive, so make sure your pup has plenty of toys to play with. Consider puzzle toys that challenge your dog to get treats out or untangle them to keep your pet busy. You can also hide specials treats, toys or food around the home. Puppy proof a specific area for your pet where they will be unlikely to injure themselves or damage your belongings. Remove access to anything fragile, that your dog may rip up, or that may be harmful like sharp objects.


Always allow your pet access to water.
If your dog does not have a pet door or other access to the outdoors, make sure to have someone walk them regularly.
Some puppy parents keep their pets in crates while they're at work. As long as your dog has been properly trained and is comfortable, this may be a valid solution."

If you were in a lane near a median when you struck the animal, then you might need to pull onto a soft patch on the median. Make sure you are completely out of any lanes of traffic, but relatively close to the pet you hit.Ideally, you won’t have to cross the road to reach the stricken animal.;
, If you have reflective triangles or flares then place them at 10 feet, 100 feet, and 200 feet intervals towards approaching traffic. If this has occurred at night, then you should also put on your 4-way emergency flashers by activating the button on your dashboard., If you are injured dial 9-1-1 immediately. Otherwise you need to call the police within 24 hours to report the details of the accident regardless if you have found the owners.If you don’t have a working cell phone, and no call box is nearby, tend to the animal first. Do not leave the scene unattended.

, If you have a first aid kit, then this is the time to take it out. Take out anything you can use as a blanket, and as a bandage too. You may also need something you can bind the animal’s mouth with if it’s overly aggressive.


Some animals will become aggressive when injured.

, Swaddle the dog or cat in a blanket or similar large cloth with both arms. If you have a thick piece of wood or similar object that can be used as a stretcher under the blanket and pet, then this is a good way to lessen the chance for injury. Pick them up with as little jostling as possible and move them either to your car’s back seat or a safer part of the roadside for further care.If the animal looks to be severely bleeding and/or have broken bones you will need to apply first aid before moving them. Should the animal prove aggressive you need to use some cloth (a t-shirt or similar will do) to wrap around their muzzle and prevent biting.

, Look particularly for bleeding, fractures, burns, signs of shock (shallow breathing, nervousness, dazed eyes, erratic pulse if you can take it), and problems with breathing. Phone ahead to an emergency veterinarian or have a helper do it while you tend to the pet., Except for the case of a pet that is not breathing you need to keep the animal restrained at the muzzle and body to apply other kinds of first aid. You can use simple, but tough fabrics like a t-shirt or rags to wrap around the dogs snout or cat’s head for a muzzle. Wrap them around enough times to restrict motion, but not cut off breathing. Tie a simple knot to secure the wrapping. Do the same for the legs if they are not broken.Try to use clean rags to avoid infection.

, For external bleeding, apply clean gauze from a first aid kit by pressing a pad of it on the wound and holding it in place for 3 minutes until a clot forms.If you see bleeding from internal areas such as the mouth, rectum, or urine then all you can do is keep the dog or cat calm until you get it to a veterinarian.
For more severe external bleeding you will need to use a tourniquet.

, If the dog or cat has extensive external bleeding on a limb, then you need to apply a tourniquet and bandage. Use gauze from the first aid kit or an elastic material you have on hand to tie a knot between the wound and the body. Press a gauze or clean cloth bandage onto the wound. Remove the tourniquet for 20 seconds every 15-20 minutes and reapply it if necessary.A pet losing this much blood will require a veterinarian’s attention immediately.

, If you notice burns from either your car’s or road chemicals on the dog or cat, then you need to apply cold water and/or ice. Flush the wound thoroughly with water and apply and ice compress until you can get the pet to a veterinarian., If the fracture isn’t too severe you can try to create a makeshift splint from cloth and a solid piece of wood. Align the wood on both sides of the broken dog’s or cat’s fractured limb, wrap both tightly with the cloth or blanket. Tie off the cloth.Bad splints can’t make the fracture worse. If you are unsure about the splint you are making then leave it up to the veterinarian. Just make sure you are transporting the pet with as little jostling as possible.

, If you’ve observed the stricken dog or cat acting nervous, breathing shallow, or the eyes darting about then it may be in shock. If the animal is unconscious this is also possible. In any case you need to keep the dog or cat warm and restrained so it does not hurt itself. Keep the animal’s head level with the body. Get it to the veterinarian immediately., If the dog or cat is not breathing you can perform a procedure similar to that used on humans. Open the dog’s or cat’s mouth. Pull out the tongue gently until it is flat. Make sure there are no foreign objects. Close your pet’s mouth again. Breath directly into it’s nose until the pet’s chest expands. Repeat this every 4-5 seconds.If there are any foreign objects in the throat, then you should remove them with pliers or tweezers first.

, In the event the stricken dog or cat has no heartbeat you should lay your dog or cat gently on its right side. Hearts of these pets are in the lower left side of the chest area. For a dog, press in on the heart area one-inch deep (adjust harder or softer for the size of the animal). For a cat, hold your hand around the animal's chest so your thumb is on the left side and your fingers are on the right side of the chest. Compress the chest by squeezing between your thumb and fingers. Press 80-120 times/minute for large animals, and 100-150 times/minute for small ones.Do not do this simultaneously with rescue breathing.

, See if the pet you struck has owner’s information on the collar, matches any posters or ads in the area, or has a radio frequency identification chip (RFID). Call the owner and inform them of what has occurred, where you are taking the pet, and ask for any special instructions that might be necessary for the care of the pet., Once you’ve administered first aid to the pet you should keep it warm and secured in your back seat if your car is still drivable. Call, locate, and drive to the nearest emergency veterinary clinic or animal hospital so the dog or cat can get more complete care. If your car is immobilized then you should call 9-1-1 and the police may be able to transport the pet for you.

, Take photos of the car from all angles if possible. Ask a family member or friend with a camera to come and take photos if you can’t.Take photos of damage and area before you leave the scene or your car is moved for any reason other than clearing traffic.

, You need to file a claim that includes the photos of the damage to your car, the police report, and any information you collected on the pet (including its owner). You can call your insurance company’s claims representative or file online.The company will evaluate your car’s damage values and recommend one or more repair shops to use. This will require comprehensive coverage on most policies.

, Use one of the shops your insurance company covers so you get properly reimbursed.This most likely will mean body work if you hit a dog or a cat.

Muzzle the dog.,
Look for a back injury.,
Shift the dog onto a blanket, coat, or tarp.,
Move the dog to a safe place.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident2," Whether the dog seems aggressive or not, you need to muzzle it before moving it or examining it for injuries. Even a gentle, mild-tempered dog will bite when it is scared or in pain. If you don’t have a muzzle available, lay a piece of cloth across the dog’s nose, as close to the eyes as possible. Next, wrap both ends of the cloth around the dog’s nose and tie the ends in a knot underneath its jaw. Finally, tie the loose ends of the cloth behind the dog’s neck.


Some things you can use for a muzzle include a leash, sock, piece of gauze, neck tie, or strip of sheet.If the dog is vomiting, do not muzzle it. This could cause it to choke., Before moving the dog in any way, look to see if it appears to have a back injury. If it does, do not attempt to move it. Instead, call animal control or a veterinarian to assist you.Look for the following to identify a possible back injury:


Observe whether or not the dog is willing and able to turn or raise its head. If it isn’t, it might have a back injury.
Additionally, look for any areas of visible trauma around the back or spine, like bruises or discoloration. If the spine looks abnormally aligned, curving upward for instance, this can also indicate a back injury.
Finally, if the dog yelps or moans when its back or neck is touched, there is a good chance it has a back injury., If you feel confident the dog does not have a back injury, find a blanket, tarp, coat, or shirt you can place the dog on to carry it. Lay the item flat on the ground behind the dog’s back. Using slow, careful movements, shift or slide the dog back onto the blanket, tarp, or coat.


If there are other people at the scene, get someone to help you shift the dog onto the blanket., Once you have the dog securely on the blanket, get someone to help you lift the dog. You’ll want to move the dog as little as possible, so if you can, go ahead and place the dog in the back seat of your car. If you cannot place it in your car, find a soft piece of ground where you can administer first aid.If you are alone at the accident, you can try pulling the dog out of the street once you have it on the blanket. Make sure you can do this without aggravating any current injuries or creating any new cuts or abrasions.

Check to see if the dog is breathing.,
Lay the dog on its side.,
Clear any debris from inside the dog’s mouth.,
Breath into the dog’s nose.,
Remove your mouth.,
Check for a pulse.,
Start chest compressions if there is no heart beat.,
Repeat this process.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident3," As soon as the dog is moved to safety, check to see if it is breathing. To do so, watch its chest to see if it is rising and falling. If there is no movement, it is not breathing and you should perform artificial respiration, which is where you assist the dog in breathing.You may also need to perform artificial respiration if the dog has labored breathing, is unconscious, or shows other signs of respiratory suppression, like blue or pale-colored gums, or a staring expression., To perform artificial respiration, first lay the dog on its side on a flat surface, pulling the neck and head forward (as long as the dog has no neck or back injuries)., Next, open the dog’s mouth and pull its tongue forward with your fingers. Clear any debris from the dog’s mouth that may be preventing it from breathing or causing it to choke. Once you have removed any debris, close the dog’s mouth.


You may need to remove the muzzle for this step. Be careful even if the dog is unconscious, as it could wake up at any moment. Put the muzzle back on once you have cleared its mouth of debris., After reapplying the muzzle, inhale and place your mouth over the dog’s nose, forming an airtight seal around it. Exhale into the dog’s nose.Exhale just enough so that the chest expands. You will have to exhale harder for larger dogs and more gently for smaller dogs. Lift the dog’s chin while you are doing this so its throat is straight., Remove your mouth from the dog’s nose after you exhale and allow the dog’s chest to deflate., After the dog’s chest deflates, check to see if it has a pulse. The dog’s heart can still be beating even if it is not breathing. If you cannot find a pulse, you should start chest compressions immediately.Check for a pulse by placing two fingers on the inside of the dog’s rear thigh., If there is another person present, have them help you resuscitate the dog—one of you will perform chest compressions while the other continues artificial respiration. Have one person perform three chest compressions after every time you exhale into the dog’s nose. If you are alone, do five chest compressions for every breath. Use the following procedures to perform chest compressions:


For small dogs (30 pounds or less): Lay the dog on its side on a flat surface. Place one hand on top of the other, interlocking your fingers. Place the palm of the bottom hand on the rib cage, over the dog’s heart. Press down, compressing the chest about one inch. Squeeze and release this hold steadily at a rate of 80 to 100 compressions per minute.
For large dogs (over 30 pounds): Lay the dog on its side on a flat surface. Place one hand on top of the other, interlocking your fingers. Place the bottom hand over the widest part of the dog’s rib cage (not necessarily over the heart). Push down on the rib cage, keeping your arms straight. Compress the chest about one quarter of its width. Continue to squeeze and release rhythmically at a rate of around 80 compressions per minute., You may need to repeat this process 15 to 20 times per minute (or one breath every three seconds, on average) to get the dog breathing normally. When the dog starts to fight the process or you notice its gums are returning to their normal color, the dog’s breathing is improving and you can stop artificial respiration."
"
Check the dog for signs of shock.,
Clear the dog’s airways.,
Cover the dog with a coat or blanket.,
Keep the dog’s head below its body.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident4," Shock occurs when the circulatory system collapses after a traumatic injury. If it is not properly treated, shock can result in death. Check to see if the dog’s body is cool to the touch, if its pulse is weak and rapid, its breathing is shallow and rapid, and if its gums are pale or muddy in color. If the dog has any of these symptoms, it may be in shock., If the dog is showing signs of shock, you should try to get it to a vet as soon as possible. In the meantime, however, make sure all of its airways are clear. To do so, open the dog’s mouth, pull out the tongue with your fingers, and make sure there is no debris blocking its throat. If there are, use your fingers or a pair of tweezers or pliers to remove the debris., A dog that is in shock may have a drop in body temperature. To keep it warm, cover the dog with a coat, blanket, or a similar item. If you have the dog in your car, you can also turn the heat up to keep it warm., Another symptom of shock is unconsciousness. If the dog is unconscious, keep its head below its body to help blood flow. You can also try massaging the legs and body to help increase blood flow."
"
Look for injuries that are bleeding profusely.,
Apply firm pressure to the wound.,
Apply pressure to the arteries that supply blood.,
Apply a tourniquet.,
Check for signs of internal bleeding.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident5," Take a thorough look at the dog’s body to determine if it has any injuries that are bleeding excessively. Look for areas in which the fur is saturated with blood or visible wounds from which blood is coming out., If the dog is bleeding severely, apply pressure to the wound with a clean piece of gauze or cloth. If the blood seeps through the first piece of gauze, apply another clean piece over it. Do not remove the soiled gauze because you could remove a blood clot that is forming and cause more bleeding., If the bleeding does not slow or stop after applying pressure for several minutes, try to slow the bleeding by applying pressure to the arteries that supply blood to the extremities. These pressure points are located on the inside of the front and back legs and the underside of the base of the tail. Use your fingers to apply pressure to these areas to help slow the bleeding., If the bleeding still does not slow, you may need to apply a tourniquet. This should be done only as a last resort. To do so, wrap a strip of cloth or gauze, a belt, leash, or something similar around the wound. You should wrap the item between the wound and the body, about two inches away from the injury. Tie a knot in the cloth and place a strong stick through the loop in the knot. Twist the stick, tightening the cloth around the dog’s leg, until the bleeding slows down or stops. Secure the stick in place with tape or by tying the cloth around it again. Once the tourniquet is in place, cover the wound with a clean piece of gauze or cloth.


Never leave the tourniquet on for more than ten minutes at a time. After ten minutes, release the tourniquet for several seconds to allow for some circulation, and then reapply the tourniquet.
Never apply a tourniquet around a dog’s neck or over a joint or fracture.
Do not use a rope or piece of wire as a tourniquet, as these can cut or irritate the area., Internal bleeding can be hard to identify and treat. However, if the dog is bleeding from its mouth or anus, is vomiting blood, has blood in its stool, is in a coma, or in shock, there could be internal bleeding. It is important you get the dog to a vet as quickly as possible if you suspect internal bleeding."
"
Check for bone injuries.,
Don’t try to reset the injury.,
Transport the dog with as little movement as possible.,
Make a splint.,
Use caution if you suspect a broken neck or back.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident6," Spotting a broken or fractured bone can be difficult. To do so, look for areas that are swollen, particularly on the dog’s legs. There is often swelling around the break. If the dog is moving around or walking, observe it to determine whether or not it is moving any part of its body unusually. For example, is the dog holding one leg at an odd angle? Or is one of its legs shaped differently than the others? These can all be signs of a bone injury., If the dog has a broken bone from the accident, it is important that you touch it as little as possible. Don’t ever try to reset the bone—this should only be done by a professional., Depending on the severity of the break and the size of the dog, you may be able to get the dog to a vet without splinting the injury first. If the dog is small enough, you can hold it, allowing the injured extremity to hang free. If the dog is larger and will not lay still, however, you may need to make a splint for the injury before taking it to the vet., Most bone injuries are not life threatening, but immobilizing the injury can help prevent complications. To create a splint, find a solid, straight object, like a stick or piece of wood that is long enough to extend past the joints above and below the break. Place one of the sticks or pieces of wood on each side of the broken bone and secure them in place by wrapping or tying a cloth or rope around them., If you think the dog might have a broken neck or back, it is best to wait for animal control to arrive and assist you in treating the dog. If you have to move the dog, however, do so with as little movement as possible. Try to find a flat, hard surface, like a large board, to transport the dog on."
"
Call the vet on your way.,
Relay as much information as you can.,
Drive carefully.",How to Help a Dog Hurt in a Traffic Accident7," Let the vet know you are coming so they can be prepared to take care of the dog as soon as you arrive. Also, let them know if you will need help getting the dog inside to prevent any further injuries., Tell the vet everything you can about the condition of the dog. For instance, relay any measures you have already taken, like splinting a bone injury or applying a tourniquet. In addition, give them a general assessment of the dog’s vital signs. Is it breathing on its own? Is its body cool to the touch? Does the dog appear to be unconscious? The more information you can give the vet before you get there, the better they will be able to take care of the dog., You will, no doubt, want to get to the vet’s office as quickly as possible, but you should be careful to drive cautiously so you do not end up in a second accident. Observe all traffic laws and stay calm while you are driving."

Understand the causes of periodontal disease.,
Brush your dog's teeth.,
Consider using an oral hygiene product that contains chlorhexidine.,
Give your dog dental chew toys or dental chews.,
Feed your dog food that fights periodontal disease.",How to Treat Canine Periodontal Disease," One sign of periodontal disease is bad breath, which comes from the raised level of bacteria in the mouth. If you notice an increase in your dog's bad breath, it's a good idea to have its teeth checked for periodontal disease by a veterinarian., For example, the dog may ask for food but then refuse to eat. Additionally, it may have become a very messy eater and drop food out of the mouth onto the floor. Some dogs may also paw at the mouth or rub their muzzle along the ground.


Some dogs with mouth pain may drool saliva more heavily than is usual. That saliva may also be blood-stained., A severe infection will affect the dog's mood, making it lethargic or moody, and it may have physical implications as well. For instance, if wobbly teeth are partially dislodged, the dog may have difficulty fully closing its mouth. Additionally, a tooth root abscess can cause facial swelling of the face or jaw bone, depending which tooth is affected.

, ""Peri"" means ""around"", and ""dontal"" means ""teeth."" Thus, periodontal disease is a process affecting the tissue surrounding the teeth. This includes the gums, the boney socket the tooth root sits in, and the fibrous ligaments that anchor the root into the socket.If you neglected to brush your teeth, you too would rapidly develop periodontal disease. This problem is not a ""dog"" problem as such, but related to poor oral hygiene because of a lack of tooth brushing.Periodontal disease exists on a sliding scale from mild to severe. The earliest stages are associated with a weakening of the attachment of the gum to the tooth, while the severe forms include tooth root infections, inflamed bleeding gums, and loose teeth., The vet will lift your dog's lips and visually inspect the teeth to get an idea of the severity of the problem. If tartar deposits are present, then this needs to be dislodged and the depth of the gingival pockets assessed.In the earliest stages of periodontal disease, you'd need to use a disclosing solution (just like for our teeth) to visualize the sticky plaque deposits. Only once the plaque is mineralized does it become evident to the naked eye. Thus, a dog can have periodontal disease without showing any obvious outward signs.
It is not possible to do a detailed examination with the dog awake, so the vet will schedule another examination, which will include an anesthetic to fully assess the extent of the problem., With the dog under anesthetic, the vet uses a gingival probe to measure the depth of the pockets around all the teeth. The goal is to identify any that are dangerously deep. It may also be necessary to x-ray the tooth roots to check if the infection has tracked down the roots and identify teeth damaged below the gum line which need extraction.Tartar is cleaned from the surface enamel using an ultrasonic descaling device. The enamel is then polished with a very fine grinding paste, which removes any micro scratches on the enamel surface. This makes it more difficult for bacteria to reattach.

, This treatment will vary depending on what the vet finds, so you need to rely on their expertise and agree to whatever treatment they deem necessary. This allows the dog to only be put under anesthesia once.Unless a tooth is grossly wobbly, and can be easily pulled, the vet surgically extracts any problem teeth. This means using a sterile surgical kit to lift a flap of gum to expose the bone in which the tooth sits. The vet then gently burrs some of the bone away to give improved access to the root, and breaks down the ligaments holding the tooth in place using a sharp instrument called a dental elevator. Only once the tooth is loose, does the vet use dental forceps to remove the tooth. The gum is then sutured back in place to cover the hole left by the tooth., Your dog may be sluggish and nauseous while recovering from anesthesia. In addition, it takes around 2 weeks for the gums to heal after extractions, so your dog's mouth will be sensitive during that time.


Overall, follow your veterinary surgeon's suggestions for post-surgical care.
Only once your dog's mouth is healed can you instigate home strategies to clean the teeth and prevent plaque and tartar from reforming.

, Periodontal disease is caused by a buildup of food deposits and the action of bacteria, which cause hard mineralized tartar to form on the teeth, which then causes gum recession. The first stage is food deposits forming a sticky layer over the tooth enamel. This layer is called plaque. Bacteria from the mouth then colonize the plaque. The bacteria react with minerals in saliva and the hard, yellow-brown deposit known as tartar is laid down on the tooth's surface.As well as the tartar you can see on the crown, there are also small deposits laid down in the tiny pocket where the gums meet the tooth. This pocket is known as the gingival sulcus.
Unfortunately, the bacteria also release toxins, which cause tissue inflammation, so the gum margin becomes red and inflamed. This swelling pushes the gun away from the tooth and leads to deepening of the gingival sulcus. The tartar is then able to track further down the tooth root. In a vicious circle inflammation causes further separation, until eventually the periodontal ligaments which anchor the root in the socket are damaged and the tooth becomes wobbly and may fall out.
In addition, the bacteria may set up a full scale infection in the gums or tracking downwards to cause a tooth root abscess.

, To brush your dog's teeth, use a soft toothbrush or a dog toothbrush, plus pet toothpaste. Gradually introduce your dog to the toothpaste by putting a little on your finger and letting your dog lick it off. After the dog is used to this, this could be a few days, move your finger with the toothpaste toward your dog's teeth and rub the teeth. Once the dog is used to this procedure, switch to using the dog toothbrush instead of your finger.In an ideal world you would brush your dog's teeth at least twice a day. However, do what you can. Even if you brush once a week, this is better than nothing.
Never use human toothpaste, as the fluoride content is too high for dogs. This can cause an upset stomach when swallowed.

, These comes as gels or liquids, which you rub over the outer surface of the teeth, twice a day. These work by decreasing the number of bacteria in the mouth and reducing the rate of tartar formation.Liquid forms can be squirted into the cheek pouch, so that the dog's tongue smears the solution over the teeth.
These pet products are safe if swallowed, and some are pleasantly flavored to make them attractive to dogs.

, These have a mechanical action to scrub the surface of the tooth as the dog chews up and down. These work best on the molars, which are the large crushing teeth at the back of the mouth.They are often less effective on the canines at the front, as these teeth are used for grasping and manipulation, rather than chewing.

, Dental foods that are certified by the VOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council) can go some way to slowing the rate of plaque formation. Look for a dental food with the VOHC seal of approval on the bag.These foods typically contain fibers which are arranged in such a way that they have a scrubbing action on the tooth enamel as the dog chews on them.

Watch for excessive panting.,
Look for vomiting and diarrhea.,
Take your dog’s temperature.,
Remove your dog from a hot environment.,
Keep your home at a cool temperature.,
Provide access to water for your dog.,
Bring your dog inside.,
Splash water on your dog.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.",How to Prevent an Older Dog from Overheating," Since dogs do not have sweat glands on their body, which would allow them to cool off via sweat evaporation, they cool themselves primarily by panting. If your dog has been panting for a long period of time (over 30 minutes) or panting with excessive force, they may be overheating.Dogs often do not stop physical activity when they become overheated. Your aging dog may not realize it’s too hot; it’s up to you to monitor the animal if it’s at risk for overheating.;
, These are common symptoms of overheating which, when coupled with panting or heaving breathing, almost certainly indicate that your dog is overheating and may be approaching heat exhaustion. Other symptoms include bright blue or red gums and, in severe cases, collapsing or convulsing.As a result of the diarrhea and vomiting, overheated dogs often become dehydrated as well, which worsens their condition. Prevent this by giving your dog access to cool drinking water.

, A dog’s natural temperature is slightly warmer than that of humans: around 101°F.If your dog’s temperature rises above 103°F, it is overheating, and brain damage can occur if the animals temperature rises above 106°F.


To take your dog’s temperature, you’ll need to use a sanitary rectal thermometer.Oral thermometers are not an effective instrument to take a dog’s temperature.
To use the thermometer, first coat the tip of the instrument in petroleum jelly, to act as a lubricant. Then insert the tip of the thermometer about an inch into your dog’s anus; the thermometer will display a result within 60 seconds.Wash the thermometer after each use.

, Older dogs are likely to overheat they spend hours in a hot environment, and lack the presence of mind to leave a hot environment. To help your dog cool down, remove it from the hot environment—this could be a hot car, a field in which the dog has been running, or the outdoors on a sunny day.You’ll also need to stop your dog from engaging in activities that raise its body temperature, including running and playing. Have your dog sit or lay down in a cool environment for at least 20 minutes.
Avoid careless mistakes which may lead to overheating, like leaving your dog in the car or forgetting to provide shade for your dog if it’s left outside on a hot day., As dogs age, they lose the ability to regulate their own body temperature as easily as they could when they were younger. You may need to accommodate for this by keeping your home at a slightly cooler temperature than you’re used to, to prevent your dog from overheating.Turning down the thermostat by a degree or two could make senior dogs more comfortable—especially if your dog is already prone to overheating.

, Drinking water is an important way for your dog to lower their body temperature and stay hydrated during hot conditions. Your dog should always have access to clean drinking water, but if you suspect that the aging dog is overheating, you may need to place a bowl of water in front of it and encourage the dog to drink.If you can, make sure that the dog’s drinking water is not hot. If you leave a bowl of water outside for your dog, position it in the shade. Water left in direct sunlight will quickly heat and may raise your elderly dog’s body temperature.

, If your dog is overheating outdoors, you should bring it inside to cool down. If it’s a hot day, your basement or pantry may be the coolest room in your house.Lead the dog here, and have it sit or lay down in the room. If you have a small house fan, you can put this in front of your dog to help it cool off.


If you are away from your home and cannot quickly bring your dog indoors, you’ll need to provide your dog with access to shade. Lead your dog under a large tree, or into the shade of a building. This will help prevent your dog from overheating more.

, Cup your hand and fill it with water, then rub the water on your dog’s head, ears, and belly. This will help your dog cool down quickly. If you’re near a natural body of water—such as a lake or stream—gently submerge your dog’s body into the water. If you’re at home, fill the bathtub with cool water and place your dog in the tub.If you have the supplies, rather than splashing or fully immersing your dog, you can wet towels and apply these to the dog’s back and abdomen.

, If your dog is unconscious or if its temperature does not drop below 103°F, take it to a vet immediately. This is an emergency situation; heat stroke can be deadly to pets, and elderly dogs are already more susceptible. Even if the dog is conscious and its temperature has gone down to normal, it’s still important to take the dog to the vet. Heat stroke can cause problems you may not notice, including blood clots and kidney or brain swelling.Explain the situation to the vet. Say something like, “My dog was running in a field near our house, when she started panting excessively and began to vomit. I ran water over her in the bathtub and took her temperature. She was at 104 degrees, so I brought her in immediately.”
Also ask something like, “My dog often plays outside; how can I prevent her from overheating again?”
Consider asking: “Is it likely that this heat exhaustion caused any permanent mental or physical damage to my dog?”

Make an appointment with your vet.,
Don’t give your pet food or water for at least eight hours before the appointment.,
Be prepared for an initial dental exam.,
Prepare for anesthesia.,
Know what to expect during the teeth cleaning.,
Consider the costs.",How to Get Professional Teeth Cleaning for Your Dog1," In order to get your dog’s teeth professionally cleaned, you will need to make an appointment with your vet. Call your vet’s office and ask to schedule an appointment for a professional cleaning of your dog’s teeth.;
, Since your dog will be undergoing anesthesia, you should not feed your dog for at least eight hours before visiting the vet. This is an important precaution you must take before your dog gets its teeth cleaned professionally.If your dog needs food or medication due to a health issue, please consult with your vet about these concerns well in advance of the appointment.

, Prior to the cleaning, your vet will first check your dog’s mouth for odor, which can be a sign of gum disease. The vet will also check for gum abnormalities such as swollen, red, or bleeding gums. This part of the exam will happen while your dog is awake., Be aware that the full oral exam will be completed while your dog is under anesthesia. The vet will administer general anesthesia so that your dog’s mouth can be examined for periodontal pockets. While your dog is under anesthesia, the vet will also check the surfaces of your dog’s teeth and conduct X-rays. These procedures are necessary for the vet to diagnose gum disease and are mostly safe for dogs. If you have specific concerns about your dog going under anesthesia, ask your vet to explain the procedure to you in detail.Ask your vet questions about how long your dog will be under anesthesia, how long it will take your dog to wake up, and if there are any risks specific to your dog’s health or breed.

, While your dog is under anesthesia, the vet will manually remove plaque and tartar, polish your dog’s teeth, rinse the dog’s mouth, and then apply fluoride to prevent tooth decay., While dental care for dogs is necessary, it can also be expensive. A cleaning usually costs several hundred dollars. X-rays can cost anywhere from several hundred to one thousand dollars or more. Extractions and dental surgery can run anywhere from two to three thousand dollars. Consult your vet’s office about specific pricing in your region, as it can vary significantly from location to location.Inquire with your pet insurance, if you have one, about whether they cover dental cleanings.

Give your dog chew toys.",How to Prevent Canine Periodontal Disease1," One important step in preventing periodontal disease is taking your dog to get oral checkups and cleaning by the vet.Depending on the state of your dog’s mouth, you may want to schedule quarterly or half-yearly checks.Oral cleanings help reduce bacteria that can lead to periodontal disease.;
, Examine your dog’s mouth by lifting his lips.If you see any tartar build up, gingivitis, or any other sign of periodontal disease, make an appointment with your veterinarian to have the mouth examined and to schedule a tooth cleaning.


You cannot remove the tartar from the teeth on your own. Your dog will need to be anesthetized and special tools will be used to remove this concrete hard substance from the teeth and below the gum line.

, One of the best ways to prevent periodontal disease is to brush your dog’s teeth. This process is simpler than it may seem. You will need to purchase a dog toothbrush, which can be either an actual brush or a finger brush, or a child’s soft toothbrush. You also need a dog toothpaste.To get your dog used to having their teeth brush, start by putting a dab of the toothpaste on your finger to let the dog taste it. Then you can put another dab on your finger and rub it in a circular motion along the outside of the teeth.
It may take a few days for the dog to let you rub your fingers along his teeth. Once he does, you can over a few days slowly introduce the brush with toothpaste into the dog’s mouth.
The process of brushing should only take less than a minute since you will mainly concentrate on the outer tooth surfaces.
Do not use human toothpaste because the fluoride in it can be toxic to dogs, and do not use baking soda because dog's shouldn't swallow that either. Anything you brush your dog's teeth with will be swallowed. Buy dog toothpaste that is made so it can be safely swallowed., Oral rinses and gels contain chlorhexidine or zinc. You can place the rinse or gel in your dog’s water bowl. You can also wipe them on your dog’s teeth to help control plaque.Since the rinse or gel can be added to the dog's water or wiped on the teeth, the products are safe to swallow.These are best used in conjunction with tooth brushing and regular dental cleanings by your veterinarian.
Do not use these products if your dog has medical conditions unless you consult your veterinarian first.

, You can start feeding your dog food specifically designed to help with dental care. These specialty foods have built in product or particle sizes which either mechanically or chemically remove plaque. These feeds can be kibble or rawhide type chews. They will be labeled specifically as dental food or designed to clean dog's teeth and prevent plaque on the bag.Examples of dental food include the Science Diet Oral Care by Hill's Pet Nutrition, Iams Chunk Dental Defense Diet, and Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets Canine dry dog food. Check the Veterinary Oral Health Council's list of accepted products for further options.Look for dental foods that have the VOHC seal. This means the food has been tested by the Veterinary Oral Health Council for its effectiveness in cleaning teeth and preventing plaque.If your dog has a medical condition, do not use unless your veterinarian okay’s it for your dog.

, If your dog loves to chew, you can purchase toys that are specifically designed to help rub the plaque off your dog’s teeth. You can also give your dog dental treats to help clean his teeth. Many of these dental treats and toys are labeled on the bag to specifically treat tartar build up and plaque.Dental treats and toys are sold at all pet stores and most supercenters. Examples include Greenies band, Tartar Shield Soft Rawhide Chews, and Purina Busy HeartyHide Chew Treats.If you use chewing toys, make sure to wash them frequently to remove any bacteria.
Never let your dog chew bones, hooves, antlers, ice cubes, or any other item that may break his teeth.

For example, a painful medical condition can make an older display aggressive behavior to avoid being touched or handled.Arthritis and dental disease can be very painful for dogs.Signs of arthritis include a reluctance to move and trouble standing up.If your dog has painful dental disease, you may notice bleeding gums, missing teeth, and lots of plaque on the teeth.;
, If a dog loses its sight as it ages, it can become easily startled because it can’t see things very well (or at all) in its environment. When a dog becomes startled, it can react with aggression.Look for signs of vision loss in your dog:Reluctance to enter dark rooms
General clumsiness
Enlarged eyeballs
Difficulty finding familiar items (toys, bed, food bowl)

, Just like with vision loss, hearing loss can cause a dog to become easily startled.If your aging dog is losing its hearing, it may take longer to respond to being called. Your dog may not respond even when it’s looking at you as you call its name.If your dog isn't responding to you, or responds aggressively because it feels startled, you may think your dog is behaving badly.
It can be hard to detect hearing loss in dogs until it is severe., House soiling can be due to medical conditions causing increased drinking and urination. Dogs with diabetes or Cushing’s disease (excess cortisol production) tend to drink a lot of water, leading to increased urination.


Dogs with kidney disease urinate a lot because their kidneys no longer work very well.However, they may not drink much water because the disease can make them feel pretty sick.

Dementia can make a dog forget its house training. Also, it may forget where the door is to go outside. Dementia doesn’t cause increased drinking in dogs.

, Digestive problems can also lead to house soiling in aging dogs. Diseases that cause the intestines to become inflamed can cause diarrhea. Examples of these diseases are colitis (inflammation of the colon) and inflammatory bowel disease (general inflammation of the intestines)., Even if you don’t think medical problems are causing your aging dog’s bad behavior, it’s still a good idea to take your dog to your vet’s office. Your vet can examine your dog and run diagnostic tests to rule out possible medical causes.


At the beginning of the appointment, give your vet a full history of your aging dog’s bad behavior, including when it started, if it’s gotten worse, and when it happens (being touched, after drinking a lot of water, etc.)
Don’t wait until you feel like you’re at your wits end with the bad behavior. Schedule the appointment soon after you start noticing the bad behavior.

, Before running any diagnostic tests, your vet will perform a physical exam to detect signs of medical problems. Among other physical exam tasks, they will test the range of motion of your dog’s joints, touch its abdomen, and take a close listen to its heart and lungs.


The physical exam findings will help your vet determine which diagnostic tests to perform.
Even if your dog looks fine on the outside, your vet may still want to perform additional testing to help rule out medical causes of the bad behavior.
If you think your dog has lost its sight or hearing, your vet will perform hearing and vision tests during the physical exam.

, Urine and blood samples can provide a lot of information about your dog’s health and can indicate underlying medical problems. For example, kidney disease can cause abnormalities in the blood (low or high levels of certain nutrients) and urine (diluted urine).Diabetes leads to glucose in the urine, which is abnormal.Abnormalities in your dog’s blood and/or urine won’t necessarily indicate that a medical problem is causing your dog’s bad behavior. Your vet will consider the results along with the physical exam findings and other diagnostic test results.

, If your dog is in pain, your vet will probably want to take x-rays to determine what’s causing the pain. X-rays can reveal various causes of pain, including joint swelling, dental problems (loose teeth), and digestive problems (thickened loops of intestine, intestinal blockages).

, As dogs gets older, their brain function can decrease. This decrease can lead to bad behavior. Dementia is a common neurologic cause of bad behavior in aging dogs.A neurologic exam will help your vet determine if a decrease in brain function is causing your aging dog’s bad behavior.

, If your vet ruled out medical causes of your dog’s bad behavior, further testing will be needed to identify the behavioral cause. Animal behavior experts, such as board-certified veterinary behaviorists and Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists, can perform a detailed behavioral assessment of your dog.Your vet can refer you to an animal behavior expert. You can also visit the website http://iaabc.org/consultants to find animal behaviorists in your area.

Follow any after-care instructions your vet gives you.,
Schedule a follow-up appointment.,
Feed your dog high quality food.,
Allow your dog to chew on pet-safe chew toys, chew treats, or rawhide.,
Brush your dog's teeth regularly.",How to Get Professional Teeth Cleaning for Your Dog2," After your vet finishes cleaning your dog’s teeth, they will give you special instructions for follow-up care. This can include nutritional recommendations, an additional visit if your dog is suffering from issues that could not be addressed during the cleaning and oral exam, or the administration of medication or oral rinses. Make sure you follow the vet’s instructions to ensure your dog maintains optimal dental health., Most dogs will need a follow-up exam and cleaning about twelve months later. Some dogs, however, may need more frequent exams and procedures due to ongoing dental concerns. Make sure you schedule a follow-up for your dog within the timeline requested by your veterinarian.

, Feeding your dog a diet of high quality food is essential for your dog's long term dental health. Your vet can help you choose a dog food that is right for your dog's breed and dental needs.Consider choosing a food approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council. You can find their seal on approved dog foods.

, Giving your dog safe toys or rawhide to chew on regularly is an important part of your dog's regular dental care. This can increase saliva production, keep plaque at bay, and help decrease the buildup of tartar., Regular brushing of your dog's teeth can prevent health problems down the road. While some dogs may resist regular brushing at home, others will allow it with some practice. Opt for a peanut or meat flavored toothpaste, a toothbrush formulated specifically for dogs, and a gentle approach. Ask your vet for tips and approaches that are specific to your individual dog."

Educate yourself about regular dental care for your dog.,
Learn about gum disease in dogs.,
Be aware that your dog could be in pain.,
Create an individualized dental plan for your dog.",How to Get Professional Teeth Cleaning for Your Dog3," Pets, like people, need regular dental care. Your dog should get regular brushings, eat quality food, and enjoy teeth-cleaning treats. It should also get regular oral X-rays, dental exams, and professional dental cleanings to prevent serious medical conditions like periodontal disease.Dogs should get a professional check up at least once per year, and weekly brushings at home if your pet will tolerate it.

, Dogs, like people, can also develop periodontal, or gum, disease. In fact, gum disease is five times more likely to occur in pets than in humans. Plaque forms on your dog’s teeth and, if left untreated, can lead to gum inflammation. Chronic inflammation of the gums can destroy bone and result in tooth loss.Regular dental cleanings can help prevent gum disease in dogs.

, Periodontal disease can cause extreme pain in dogs, but it is not the only culprit. Some dogs are also prone to broken teeth, which is often only discovered when a dog undergoes a dental exam. Your dog could also be suffering from bleeding gums or abscessed teeth, which also cause pain. More often than not these conditions are not readily apparent to the average dog owner., Every dog is different, which means that maintaining a dog’s dental health will be different for each dog. While your Fido may only need to have his teeth cleaned periodically, Fluffy may need more regular care. Consult your veterinarian about an individualized dental health plan for your dog.Most dogs will need oral exams and professional cleanings once a year beginning at six months of age.

Check for bad breath.,
Look for gum abnormalities.,
Monitor for any mouth pain.",How to Prevent Canine Periodontal Disease2," One of the most common signs of periodontal disease is bad breath. Your dog should not have bad breath. Dog breath is not normal for your pet.This may be an early warning sign for periodontal disease.

, Another sign of periodontal disease is problems with the gums. Check your dog’s gums carefully, looking for anything out of the ordinary. Your dog’s gums should be a healthy pink color.Your dog’s gums may bleed if he has periodontal disease.
Look for red, swollen gums. This may mean your dog has gingivitis.
Check for any yellow-brown crust near the gums. This is tartar build up.
Notice any thick dark brown crust near the gums. This is calculus, a concrete hard substance.

, If your dog has periodontal disease, he may exhibit signs of mouth pain. This may include whining or other noises of pain when eating or when someone touches his mouth.Your dog may have difficulty chewing food, especially hard food. This may lead to a decrease in his appetite.
Look for any loose or missing teeth that might be causing pain.
Your dog may lose weight due to mouth pain or a decreased appetite.

Diagnose periodontal disease.,
Treat periodontal disease.,
Learn what periodontal disease is.",How to Prevent Canine Periodontal Disease3," You need to take your dog to the vet to get an oral checkup. The vet will check the gums, looking for abnormalities. The vet will probably perform an x-ray to try to help diagnose the disease because the majority of periodontal symptoms are beneath the gum line.


Your vet may do other kinds of imaging tests to look for tooth density and bone support. Your vet will also check the health of the root., Treatment for the periodontal disease depends on the stage your dog’s periodontal disease is at. There are four stages of periodontal disease.Your vet will look at your dog’s particular care and suggest a treatment plan tailored to his periodontal disease.Early stages of gum disease can be treated by a thorough cleaning by the vet. Your dog will be put under anesthesia for this.
For moderate periodontal disease, a cleaning may be combined with a gel treatment. The vet will focus on cleaning between the gum and tooth and reducing the size of the pocket along the gumline. Treatment may require removal of the affected tissue that surrounds the tooth root and bone.The worst stage of periodontal disease requires removal of the tooth.

, Periodontal disease is the process that happens when bacteria and leftover food bits in the mouth mix with saliva to form plaque, which adheres to the surface of the teeth.If this plaque is not removed, within 24 hours it mixes with minerals in the saliva to form tartar.The body responds to this by sending inflammatory cells to fight the bacteria, which in turn causes gum inflammation. The gums become reddened and swollen in response.
As the process continues, the bacteria in the plaque sends out enzymes which damage the gums and destroy tooth supporting structures. This will cause infections deep in the tooth roots and eventually lead to tooth loss."

Decide which medication to use.,
Follow prescription instructions.,
Watch for bad side effects.,
Wait for symptom improvement.,
Schedule follow-up visits.",How to Treat Endocrine Disorders in Older Dogs1," Common endocrine disorders in older dogs are diabetes, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid glands), and Cushing’s Disease (overactive adrenal or pituitary glands). Medication can be used to manage, but not cure, endocrine disorders. Your vet will recommend a medication for your dog’s specific endocrine disorder:Insulin for diabetes.
Soloxine for hypothyroidism.
Mitotane or trilostane for Cushing’s disease.;
, To effectively manage your dog’s endocrine disorder, you will need to follow your vet’s prescription instructions. If you are unsure how to administer the medication, ask your vet to show you how. For example, if your dog has diabetes, learn how to inject insulin under your dog’s skin.

To administer insulin, create a skin tent with the skin just behind your dog’s neck and inject the insulin just under the skin.Pills can be a challenge to administer if your dog doesn’t like taking pills. Tasty pill pockets are available at your local pet store if hiding the pill in your dog’s food doesn’t work, or you don’t feel comfortable placing the pill directly in your dog’s mouth.
Realize that medical treatment for endocrine disorders in dogs is usually lifelong., Medications that treat endocrine disorders in dogs can sometimes make a dog feel bad. Soloxine, which treats hypothyroidism, can cause drowsiness, rash, and dry mouth.Trilostane, which treats Cushing’s disease, can cause nausea and vomiting.If your dog doesn’t seem to be doing well on the medication, contact your vet. They may need to lower the medication’s dosage or try a different medication with fewer bad side effects.

, With medication, your dog’s endocrine disorder will improve. However, the improvements may not be immediate because it can take time to make hormone levels normal again. For example, soloxine can take up to six weeks to restore normal thyroid hormone levels.Contact your vet if your dog doesn’t seem to be getting any better. It may be that the medication’s dosage is too low.

, Your vet will want to test your dog’s blood regularly to check hormone levels. These levels will indicate if the medication is working properly. If your dog has Cushing’s disease, your vet will want to perform an ACTH stimulation test, which will indicate if the adrenal glands are working normally.Do not miss any follow-up appointments. These appointments are an important part of treating your dog’s endocrine disorder.

Determine if surgery is right for your dog.,
Have your vet perform surgery.,
Care for your dog after surgery.,
Let your vet reexamine your dog.",How to Treat Endocrine Disorders in Older Dogs2," Surgery is the treatment of choice for some endocrine disorders. For Cushing’s disease caused by an adrenal gland tumor, surgery is the preferred treatment method.Surgery is also recommended for primary hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands).The parathyroid glands are located next to the thyroid glands and release parathyroid hormone. Primary hyperparathyroidism, which is fairly rare in dogs, is usually caused a parathyroid tumor.Your vet will consider different factors (age, overall health status, spread of the tumor) to determine if surgery is right for your dog.

, Surgical treatment for endocrine disorders involves removal of the tumor and the diseased endocrine gland. If surgery is right for your dog, allow your vet to perform surgery. Soon after the surgery, your dog’s symptoms should start to improve.

Adrenal gland removal can be challenging, especially since the right adrenal gland is located close to a major vein called the vena cava.Your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon if your dog’s right adrenal gland has a tumor., Proper at-home care is always important after surgery to help a dog recover. When you pick up your dog after surgery, your vet will give you instructions for at-home care. They will also give you a few days’ worth of pain medication to relieve your dog's pain. Proper at-home care includes:Putting an Elizabethan collar around your dog’s neck to keep it from licking or bothering the incision site. Your vet will probably give you an E-collar.
Making sure the incision looks healthy (clean, pink skin, incision edges are touching each other). Contact your vet if the incision doesn’t look healthy (discharge, swelling, blood seepage for more than one day).
Limiting your dog’s physical activity for up to two weeks to allow the incision to heal.
Not bathing your dog.

, After surgery, your vet will want to see your dog again to take a blood sample and see how its symptoms are improving. Also, if your dog has stitches, your vet may need to remove them one to two weeks after surgery.

Primary hyperparathyroidism causes calcium levels to increase in a dog’s body. After surgery, your vet will measure your dog’s calcium levels. If they are too low, your vet will prescribe a calcium supplement for your dog."

Discuss radiotherapy with your vet.,
Consider palliative radiation therapy.,
Take your dog to a specialty center.,
Care for your dog after treatment sessions.",How to Treat Endocrine Disorders in Older Dogs3," Radiation therapy is a treatment option for thyroid cancer, an endocrine disorder in older dogs. This type of therapy uses radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA inside the cells.Radiation therapy is recommended for thyroid cancers because they are hard to remove surgically.Ask your vet questions about radiation therapy:

How long will my dog need radiation therapy?
How much will radiation therapy cost?
Can I touch my dog after treatment sessions?
When will my dog start feeling better after radiation therapy?
Is the radiation dangerous to my dog?

, Palliation is the relief of pain and discomfort, without the goal of a cure. As opposed to radiation therapy for long-term cancer control, palliative radiation therapy is less intense and is recommended for dogs that are not healthy enough to undergo full-course radiation therapy.Palliative radiation therapy treatment sessions are usually once a week for several weeks.Talk with your vet to decide if treating the cancer or relieving your dog’s discomfort is your main goal.

, If radiation therapy is right for your dog, your vet will refer you to a specialty center or veterinary teaching hospital for the treatment. To perform the therapy, the staff will anesthetize your dog, position it on a table, and use a machine to direct a beam of radiation at the cancer. The treatment will take only a few minutes.Radiation therapy usually involves a series of treatments., Fortunately, your dog will not feel any discomfort during radiation treatment sessions.Radiation therapy can cause side effects, though, such as hair loss at the site of irradiation.It can also cause uncomfortable side effects, like skin peeling. Uncomfortable side effects may require pain medication so your dog can feel a little better.Your vet will discuss potential side effects and how to care for them.

Treat hot spots at home.",How to Prevent Older Dogs from Creating Lick or Scratch Sores," This cone, also colloquially known as the ""cone of shame,"" is a cone that wraps around your dog's neck. It physically stops the dog from licking its body. However, the cone may not work well as a long-term solution, so make sure you talk to your vet about what may be wrong with your senior dog.You may need to take the cone off so the dog can eat and drink.
You can find alternatives to the hard plastic cones, such as collars designed to keep them from biting (which look like soft neck braces), inflatable ""cones,"" and soft cones.Remember your dog will still be itchy but is now unable to scratch that itch. This is frustrating for the dog, so a cone should only be used if the dog is on treatment and has not yet stopped itching, or if there is no other option and he's in danger of seriously damaging the skin.;
, You can find pet-safe sprays that you can apply to your dog's coat, such as bitter apple. These sprays taste bad to your dog, so they discourage your dog from licking the area. You can find such sprays in your local pet store.If you need to spray bitter apple directly on a wound, choose one without alcohol in it so it doesn't sting.On the other hand, if your dog has a hot spot, which needs to be kept moisture-free, an alcohol-based product may work better.

, Aloe can soothe irritated skin, so apply where you see your dog itching.In addition, it tastes bad, so it may deter you dog from licking the area. However, if you use a plant at home, make sure to only put the clear green gel from the center of the leaf on your dog. The white sap around the edge of the plant can be toxic.Make sure to use 100% pure aloe vera gel. Look for one without additives.

, If your dog won't leave a certain area alone, try wrapping it in a bandage. The bandage will provide a physical barrier, keeping your dog from licking and scratching it. However, if your dog is licking and scratching all over, that may not work., Older dogs are more susceptible to having a dry coat and skin, which can lead to itchiness. Try keeping your dog indoors more in the winter, as the cold outdoor air can increase dryness and itchiness., Some shampoos can be drying, especially to older dogs, so try skipping shampoos altogether. Alternatively, use a moisturizing shampoo meant specifically for dogs that has humectants in it, followed by a dog conditioner. Also, skip the blow drying, as that can dry out your dog's skin and coat., One way to help moisturize your dog's skin is to brush your dog's coat every few days with a general grooming brush (such as a pinhead brush), as that will help increase oil production.With a senior dog, its coat might still be dry, in which case, you can use oils like olive oil, coconut oil, and sweet almond oil. Start with massaging it in about once a week, but you can apply it more often if you need to.You can also add olive or coconut oil to your dog's diet. Start with 1/4 teaspoon per 10 pounds of your dog a day, though you can go up to as much as a teaspoon per day (per 10 pounds). So a 30 pound dog could have 3/4 teaspoon to 3 teaspoons per day.

, Sometimes, an elderly dog may have dry skin and coat because it's not getting enough of some essential nutrient. You may need to add an essential oil supplement, for instance, which you can find at the pet store or your vet's office.Another option is flaxseed oil. You can give your dog 1/2 a teaspoon of oil a day for every 15 pounds of your dog's weight.You could also add supplements like nutritional yeast, kelp powder, or alfalfa, at a rate of a teaspoon or so a day.
Talk to your vet before adding supplements.

, Sometimes, itchiness on your dog's body is caused by allergies, and allergies (or the effects of allergies) can worsen as your dog ages. Try switching your dog's food, as sometimes foods can be causing your dog's allergies. Common food allergens include corn, wheat, and beef, so try picking a food without those allergens in it., Your dog can take antihistamines to help deal with its allergies. However, you need to discuss giving an antihistamine with your vet before giving it to your dog. This treatment is effective, but it can take months to start working., Fleas can make your dog itch like crazy, particularly if your dog has an allergy to the bites. Getting rid of fleas can help relieve your dog's itchiness. You can use topical treatments that you buy from a pet store or internal treatments that you get from your vet. Just make sure that the treatment is meant for dogs.You can also use flea prevention medicine to prevent your dog from getting fleas in the future.

, Sometimes, when an older dog is licking its skin repeatedly in certain spots, that could indicate the dog has hot spots. Hot spots develop from a bacterial infection, which the dog proceeds to lick and scratch into a sore. One sign of hot spots is dry, scaly skin that your dog won't leave alone.Other symptoms can include aggression (because of the pain) and lethargy or sadness.
You might also notice crusty areas (scabs) or places where the skin is oozing, as well as hair loss and matted areas of fur.

, Hot spots can appear after your dog has been around water. It can be as simple as being in the rain, having a bath, or swimming. Any moisture left behind can lead to a bacterial infection if something breaks the skin, which can happen with something as simple as your dog scratching itself.Even something like flea bites can lead to hot spots, particularly if your dog has an allergy to fleas.
Matted fur can also lead to hot spots, as it can trap moisture close to the skin.
Objects caught in the dog's fur, like stickers or thorns, can break the skin., If you suspect your dog has hot spots, taking it to the vet may be best. Your vet knows how to best treat the condition without harming your dog further. If you treat the condition yourself, you may make it worse., Cut back the hair near the hot spot, as that exposes it to air, letting it dry out. Use an astringent or antiseptic spray; pick one that is fairly mild, meant for use on dogs, and water-based. To prevent your dog from licking it further, you can use a cone around the dog's neck. Keep watching the area to see how it's faring. If it doesn't seem to to be healing, take your dog to the vet.You can also use a hydrocortisone cream on the area to help with itching, but you should consult your vet first before applying one.

Take your dog to your vet.,
Exercise with your dog.,
Play with your dog.,
Give your dog anti-anxiety medication.,
Do not punish your dog.",How to Treat Pica in Older Dogs1," Pica in older dogs can be caused by behavioral or medical problems. Before making changes at home, have your vet rule out possible medical causes. Your vet will perform diagnostic tests to determine if your dog has an underlying health problem:Digestive problems, like stomach pain or stomach tumors
Anemia (low iron)

Cushing’s Disease (overactive adrenal or pituitary glands)
Diabetes
If your vet finds a health problem, then treating that problem could help stop the pica behavior.;
, If your dog is otherwise healthy, then its pica is likely a behavioral issue. Separation anxiety is a behavioral issue that commonly causes dogs to engage in unhealthy activities, such as pica, to relieve that anxiety.Exercising can help your dog relieve its anxiety in a healthy way without it resorting to eating something inedible.


Exercise is also a great way to relieve boredom, which is another common cause of pica in older dogs.
Take your dog for long walks twice a day.If you and your dog are athletic, take your dog out for a run.
If your dog has arthritis or cannot move around as much as it used to, do not push your dog to exercise beyond what it can comfortably do.

, Some older dogs eat inedible items to get attention, even if it’s negative attention (trying to pull the inedible object out of the dog’s mouth). Playing with your dog can give it the attention it wants from you.Play with your dog in different ways:


Play fetch.
Practice basic obedience commands (sit, lie down).
Teach advanced tricks, like playing dead and grabbing paw.
Give your dog plenty of toys, especially puzzle toys.Having a constant rotation of toys will keep your dog from eating inedible objects when it’s bored and you’re not home to play with it.

, Sometimes, exercise and playtime are not enough to relieve a dog’s anxiety.If your dog’s pica behavior continues, take your dog back to your vet. They can prescribe anti-anxiety medication for your dog.


Use the medication along with exercise and playtime to relieve your dog’s anxiety and treat its pica.

, If your dog’s pica behavior is caused by anxiety, punishing your dog will increase its anxiety instead of stopping the pica. In addition, if you scold and yell, your dog may start fearing you and hiding the pica behavior.Relieving your dog’s anxiety through behavioral changes and medication will be much more effective at treating pica.

Keep inedible items out of reach.,
Make inedible items undesirable.,
Feed your dog a high-fiber diet.",How to Treat Pica in Older Dogs2," If you know what types of inedible items your dog likes to eat, put them out of its reach.For example, if your dog likes eating toilet paper, close the bathroom doors. If your dog prefers eating your shoes, keep them in your closet and keep your closet doors closed.


If your dog likes eating empty food wrappers, stay diligent about throwing away all food wrappers.

, If you make the inedible items less desirable, your dog will lose interest in eating them. Consider sprinkling a bitter-tasting substance, like cayenne pepper or Bitter Apple®, on those items., Changing your dog’s diet could help stop the pica behavior. High-fiber diets promote a feeling of fullness. If your dog feels full, it may not want to eat inedible items. Talk with your vet before changing your dog’s diet."
"
Teach your dog the ’drop it’ command.,
Train your dog to come when called.,
Practice daily.",How to Treat Pica in Older Dogs3," If you see your dog with something inedible in its mouth, the ‘drop it’ command will train your dog to drop that object. This is especially important if your dog has something sharp, like a rock or stick, in its mouth that could cause major damage to its GI tract. To help your dog learn this command:Practice the command in a quiet area.
Give your dog a toy to play with.
Give the ‘drop it’ command and a hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose. When your dog drops the toy, immediately reward it with a treat.
To increase the difficulty, practice the command in a place with more distractions, such as a dog park.

, When your dog drops what’s in its mouth, it should leave the object on the ground and come to you. That way, your dog won’t be tempted to put the pica object right back in its mouth. Also, if you see your dog approaching something inedible, calling your dog to you will prevent it from eating that object. Follow some helpful tips when teaching this command:Reward your dog with a treat and verbal praise each time it comes when called.
Have your dog sit before it receives its reward.

, As with any type of dog training, teaching your dog the “drop it” and “come” commands will take daily practice. Keep the training sessions short (10-15 minutes) to keep your dog from getting bored. If your schedule allows, have multiple training sessions in a day until your dog learns the commands.End training sessions on a happy note, with lots of praise (petting, verbal praise).Pica can be a problem in puppies as well. If your puppy develops pica, try teaching the “leave it” command and find ways to distract your puppy from non-food items that he wants to eat, such as by offering a favorite toy instead.

Monitor your dog’s food and water consumption.,
Watch for any irregularities with excretion.,
Check your dog’s weight.",How to Watch for Signs of Illness in Senior Dogs1," As your dog ages, you should monitor how much food and water they consume. Watch to see if they eat and drink more or less than they used to. You should also notice the food they are eating. Some dogs may start eating only soft food instead of hard food.Watch your dog as they eat. Notice if they have difficulty chewing or swallowing.
If your dog vomits after eating or drinking, this is a sign of a problem.;
, Abnormalities with urination and defecation may point to problems in older dogs. Constipation or diarrhea is a common concern, but in addition to that, you should notice any changes in color, consistency, or frequency of the stools. You should also be alert to any difference in the color or amount of urine.If your dog has any pain or difficulties defecating or urinating, this could point to a problem.
Messing in the house is another sign that something may be wrong with your older dog.

, Weight changes in senior dogs may point to problems. This is especially true if your dog’s appetite has remained the same and they are gaining or losing weight. You should try to weigh your dog every two months.Small dogs can be weighed on infant scales. You can weigh a medium size dog with yourself and then subtract your weight from the total. Large dogs may need to be weighed at the vet.

Look for hearing problems.",How to Watch for Signs of Illness in Senior Dogs2," As your pet or groom your dog, you should check for any skin problems. These include lumps and bumps, which may be nothing but may also be a symptom of a serious condition. You can also check for skin sores, especially ones that won’t heal.Check the dog’s abdomen to see if it has changed in size. For example, it may be distended.
Look for things like increased hair loss or weird odors.

, Senior dogs often experience mobility issues. This is usually seen when they are unable to walk up stairs or jump like they used to. They may have a wobbly gait, making them bump into things. They also may experience lameness in their legs.The dog may have problems with balance, their legs may start to cross as they walk, and they may have trouble getting up and down.

, Your dog shouldn’t be experiencing respiratory problems, even if they are getting older. Panting is normal in dogs, but excessive panting, or panting when the dog hasn’t been active or shouldn’t be hot may be a sign of a problem.Coughing, sneezing, wheezing, or discharge from the nose should be seen about by the vet.

, To make sure your senior dog doesn’t develop any dental problems, you should check their mouth. Look for any sores, swollen gums, or broken teeth. Look for gum discoloration, where the gum is yellow, purple, or pale pink.Check for bad breath. Dog breath is a sign of periodontal disease.
Excessive drooling may point to a mouth or dental problem.

, Your senior pet’s hearing may decrease as they age, but problems with hearing or sounds could point to an underlying condition. Your pet may not respond to aural stimuli, or they may overreact to sounds.Your pet may not notice things are happening around them because they aren’t reacting to sounds.

Watch your dog’s sleep patterns.,
Notice behavior changes.,
Monitor for disorientation.,
Notice changes in activity level.,
Watch for aggressive behavior.",How to Watch for Signs of Illness in Senior Dogs3," Sleep disturbances may be a sign of problems in older dogs. The dog may sleep during the day and stay up all night. They may end up walking around the house all night or disturbing you. The dog may sleep excessively.Sleep aggression sometimes occurs in older dogs. When you wake them or they are startled from sleep, they snap or act aggressively.

, Sometimes, older dogs will exhibit different behavior when they are older than when they are younger. They may stop being as social and prefer to to sleep or be alone. They may get separation anxiety when they are not with you.Older pets may startle easier than they used to.

, Some senior dogs may experience cognitive problems, resulting in disorientation and confusion. Signs of this may include the dog getting off their routine, like wanting to eat or go for a walk at night. The dog also may stop following commands.The dog may mess in the house and may even lose their way around familiar places, like the house or yard. They may walk around in a confused state, or just wander around the house.

, It’s common for senior dogs to slow down as they age. They may be unable to exercise for the same duration or intensity as before. However, loss of interest in any activity or a sudden significant decrease in ability may be a cause for concern.The dog may collapse during activity, or they may experience seizures.
Notice any loss of balance or abnormal gait while they are playing.

, Some older dogs get more irritable and aggressive as they age. This can also be a reaction to stimuli due to their failing senses. If your dog has become more irritable, more protective, or more aggressive, there may be something wrong.Your pet may not like people anymore, especially strangers. They may also be irritable or aggressive towards family members.

Follow prescription instructions carefully.,
Give Anipryl once a day by mouth.,
Remember to give each dose.,
Wait for symptom improvement.,
Monitor your dog for negative side effects.,
Tell your vet about your dog’s medications.,
Let your vet know if your dog has aggression.,
Visit your vet every six months.",How to Treat Dog Dementia with Anipryl," When your vet diagnoses your dog with dementia, they will explain how you can manage this condition. If you decide to treat your dog with Anipryl, you will need to follow your vet’s prescription instructions carefully.Doing so will help your dog get the most benefit from the drug. Ask your vet questions about Anipryl:


How does it work?
How do I give it?
How much does it cost?
Are there any bad side effects?
When will my dog start to improve?
How long will my dog need to be on it?;
, Anipryl is an oral drug that is available as pills or chewable tablets.It is best to give Anipryl in the morning.Although it's not necessary to give Anipryl with food, you can give your dog its Anipryl dose with its morning meal.Anipryl comes in a range of doses, from 2 to 30 milligrams per pill or tablet.Your vet may start your dog on a mild dose, then make dosage adjustments as needed.If you choose the pill form, you can give your dog the pill by hiding it in its food or using a pill pocket.

, Anipryl is a daily medication. If you forget a dose, though, don't panic. Simply give the missed dose once you remember. However, if you don’t remember until it’s nearly time for your dog’s next dose, give only the scheduled dose and skip the missed dose.Do not give your dog a double dose of Anipryl. This can lead to an overdose, which can cause serious side effects like seizures and insomnia (inability to sleep)., Anipryl works by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain.Medications that change brain activity can take a long time to have a noticeable effect. For Anipryl, it will probably take four to eight weeks before you see improvement in your dog’s dementia symptoms.Contact your vet if your dog’s symptoms do not start improving after about a month. Your vet may double your dog’s current dosage of Anipryl for another month. If there’s still no improvement, your vet may recommend another medication., Your dog may experience some negative side effects while on Anipryl. Contact your vet if your dog doesn’t seem to be doing well on the drug:Vomiting
Diarrhea
Tiredness
Decreased appetite

Include fruits and vegetables in your dog’s diet.,
Give your dog antioxidant supplements.,
Supplement your dog’s diet with omega-3 fatty acids.,
Add herbs to your dog’s diet.",How to Support a Dog with Dementia1," A chemical process called oxidation produces substances called free radicals in the brain. Free radicals accumulate in the brains of dogs with dementia and can cause damage. Antioxidants are substances that decrease free radicals’ damaging effects.Fruits and vegetables, such as spinach, citrus pulp, carrots, and tomato pomace, are rich in antioxidants.Tomato pomace is what’s left over (tomato skin, pulp, seeds) after the tomato’s juice is pressed out.Beta-carotene, which is found in carrots, is also an antioxidant.Although fruits and vegetables are very healthy, you do not want to overfeed your dog. Talk with your vet about how much extra fresh produce to add to your dog’s diet.;
, Vitamins A and E are also antioxidants.You can find these vitamin supplements at your local pet store. If you’re not sure which brand of supplements to choose, ask your vet for recommendations on high-quality brands.


Follow the product label instructions when giving your dog any type of supplement.

, Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and improve cell membrane health.They can be a beneficial part of your dog’s diet.

, Herbs are also good for dogs with dementia. Herbs such as lemon balm, gingko biloba, and bacopa can help lessen dementia’s effects.

Exercise your dog each day.,
Engage in daily play with your dog.,
Teach your dog new tricks.",How to Support a Dog with Dementia2," Physical activity is a great way to support a dog with dementia. It helps keep a dog’s mind and body active.Because dogs with dementia are senior dogs, strenuous activity (running and jumping) is not recommended. Low-key exercises, such as walks, would be better for your dog.


Keep exercise sessions short—about 10 to 15 minutes.Your dog may not be able to exercise for long stretches of time.
If your dog has arthritis or other orthopedic problems, consider having your dog swim. Swimming is easier on the joints than walking on concrete.Doggie day care facilities may have swimming pools. Contact your local doggie day cares to see if they provide swimming services.

, Playing with your dog will help improve its brain health by providing a fun mental challenge. For example, play ‘hide and go seek’ with your dog. Hide in a place where your dog can easily find you and reward your dog when it finds you. You could also hide your dog’s favorite toys or treats.Be aware that dogs with dementia get disoriented. This disorientation can make them feel anxious.If your dog gets disoriented and anxious when playing 'hide and go seek,' play with your dog in different ways.
If your dog has favorite games, play those games with it., An old dog can still learn new tricks. Teaching your dog new tricks will keep it mentally alert and improve its brain function.Challenging tricks for you to teach your dog include playing dead and grabbing paw.

Give your dog toys.,
Create an obstacle course for your dog.,
Increase your dog’s interaction with other people and dogs.,
Take your dog to new places.",How to Support a Dog with Dementia3," The goal of environment enrichment is to make an environment interesting and engaging. Environmental enrichment is another way to support a dog with dementia, since it will help keep a dog’s mind engaged and busy. Puzzle toys, such as Kong® toys, are great for dogs with dementia. They will challenge your dog to play until it gets what’s inside the toy (peanut butter, treats).Encourage your dog to play with its toys each day.If your dog has favorite toys that are looking worn out or damaged, replace these toys with new ones.
Provide your dog with a steady supply of toys so it can continue experiencing something new and different.Rotate the toys regularly.

, An obstacle course will give your dog a physical and mental challenge. It can be easy to make a homemade obstacle course. For example, purchase some PVC pipes from your local hardware store and place them in the ground outside so you and your dog can safely walk or run through them. You can also use sturdy children’s play tunnels that won’t move when your dog goes through them.Have your dog follow you through the course.This will allow your dog to know where to go, reducing the chances of it feeling lost or anxious from disorientation.
If you don’t have a yard, set up an obstacle course in your home with pieces of furniture.

, Dogs with dementia usually stop greeting family members and don’t seek affection as much as they used to.Therefore, increased social interaction is important for supporting a dog with dementia. If your dog has other doggie friends, set up a play date so they can play together. To increase human interaction, you and your family members can spend more quality time with your dog.


Quality time can be as simple as quietly petting and talking to your dog.
If your dog is friendly with some of your friends, invite them over to spend time with your dog.
Do not introduce a new pet to your dog.This could be distressing to a dog with dementia.

, Experiencing new sights, sounds, and smells is a good activity for dogs with dementia.To help your dog experience new things, go for a ride to a new location, such as a park, where you’ve never taken your dog. You could also walk your dog along a new route so your dog can see and sniff different things.

Reassure your dog.,
Treat your dog’s dementia with medication.,
Provide an indoor litter box for your dog.",How to Support a Dog with Dementia4," In addition to disorientation and decreased social interaction, dogs with dementia have sleep disturbances (pacing at night, waking up at the wrong time), bladder problems, and anxiety.These problems can be distressing to your dog. To support your dog, give it reassurance that you will be there to comfort it when it feels anxious.Simple activities like petting your dog and quietly talking to it can be reassuring to your dog.

, Dementia is not curable. However, there are medications that can help lessen dementia’s effects. For example, a medication called Anipryl reduces free radicals in the brain and prolongs dopamine activity.Dopamine, which helps nerve cells communicate, is usually reduced in dogs with dementia.Because dementia can make a dog feel anxious, anti-anxiety medications are helpful for supporting a dog with dementia.Schedule an appointment with your vet to discuss medication options for your dog.

, Because your dog may not be to control its bladder muscles very well, an indoor litter box will help prevent bathroom accidents.Litter boxes are practical for small dogs, but won’t be so convenient if you have a large breed dog. Below are some tips to litter train your dog:Select a litter box with a low entry point so your dog can easily climb into and out of it.
Line the litter box with pee pads or newspaper.
Take your dog to the litter box when it’s showing signs of needing to eliminate (sniffing, circling).

Discuss medication options with your vet.,
Administer medication to treat the disease.,
Monitor your dog for bad side effects.,
Follow-up with your vet.",How to Treat Metabolic Disease in Older Dogs1," Other than diabetes and hypothyroidism, common metabolic diseases in older dogs include Cushing’s disease (overactive adrenal glands) and Addison’s disease (underactive adrenal glands). Because the problem causing each metabolic disease is different, the medical treatment for each disease will also be different.


Talk with your vet about which medication will be most effective to treat your dog’s specific metabolic disease.
Many metabolic diseases, like diabetes, are not curable. Medications can help manage the disease and allow your dog to have a good quality of life.
Other metabolic diseases, like Cushing’s disease, can be treated with medication and/or surgery. Your vet will help you determine which type of treatment will be best for your dog.;
, If you and your vet decide on medical treatment of your dog’s metabolic disease, administer the medication as prescribed by your vet. For example, if your dog has pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, you will give your dog either trilostane or mitotane, which are oral drugs.You can give your dog a pill in several different ways, such as crushing the pill and mixing it in with its food or hiding the pill in a tasty treat or pill pocket.
Medical treatment for diabetes is injectable insulin. If your dog has diabetes, inject the insulin by creating a tent with the skin on your dog’s back and injecting the prescribed insulin dose just under the skin.Prescription instructions vary according to the type of disease. Your vet will give you instructions for your dog’s specific disease.
To manage your dog’s metabolic disease, you may need to administer medication for the rest of its life.

, Although medications can effectively treat and manage metabolic diseases, they can also cause negative side effects. For example, levothyroxine, which treats hypothyroidism in dogs, can cause agitation and diarrhea if given at too high of a dose.Mitotane can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness if cortisol (adrenal gland hormone) levels become too low.If your dog seems unwell after being on the medication, contact your vet. Your vet may need to adjust the medication’s dose, or find a different medication that can treat the metabolic disease with fewer bad side effects.

, With metabolic disease, the blood levels of a substance (glucose, cortisol, thyroid hormone) become too high or too low. While your dog is taking medication, your vet will want to monitor your dog’s blood work to ensure the medication is keeping blood levels of the affected substance within a normal range.


Your vet will recommend a schedule for follow-up appointments. Do not miss these appointments. They will help ensure your dog’s medication is working as it should.

"
"
Decide whether surgery is right for your dog.,
Have your vet perform surgery.,
Schedule a follow-up appointment with your vet.",How to Treat Metabolic Disease in Older Dogs2," Most metabolic diseases in older dogs can be managed without surgery. However, for some metabolic diseases, like primary hyperparathyroidism (cancerous parathyroid gland) and adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease (cancerous adrenal gland), surgery is the treatment of choice.Surgical treatment involves removal of the entire affected gland, not just the tumor.
Your vet will consider different factors, such as your dog’s age and overall health status, as well as whether the tumor has spread, to determine if surgery is a good choice for your dog.
As you make your decision, ask the vet questions: How long will the surgery take? How much will the surgery cost? How soon after surgery will my dog start feeling better? Are there any risks with the surgery?

, If you decide to move forward with surgery, schedule the surgical appointment. Your vet will give you pre-surgical instructions to prepare your dog for surgery. Usually, a dog should stop eating 12 hours before surgery and stop drinking water 8 hours before surgery.Either the vet or one of the vet’s staff members will contact you after the surgery to give you an update and let you know when you can pick up your dog.
When you take your dog home after surgery, you will need to perform some at-home care, such as administering pain medication and making sure the surgical incision site looks normal (no swelling or discharge).

, Your vet will want to see your dog after surgery to ensure it’s making a good recovery and its metabolic disease is under control. For example, with primary hyperparathyroidism, which causes elevated calcium levels, your vet will want to measure your dog’s calcium levels. If the calcium is too low, your dog will need calcium supplements.With adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, the cancerous adrenal glands produce too much of the cortisol hormone. After surgery, your vet may want to measure your dog’s cortisol levels.

Feed your dog a healthy diet.,
Exercise with your dog.,
Reduce stress.",How to Treat Metabolic Disease in Older Dogs3," When your older dog has a metabolic disease, it may have a harder time obtaining nutrients from its food. As you treat your dog for its metabolic disease, feed it a healthy diet. A healthy diet will provide your dog with the nutrients it needs in the right proportions.


Important nutrients in dog food are carbohydrates, fat, high-quality proteins, and vitamins and minerals.
Nutritional needs vary with the different metabolic diseases.
As you choose between diets, look for the ones that have an Association of American Feed Control Officials label. This label ensures the diet is nutritionally complete and balanced.Work with your vet to determine how much food your dog needs each day. Do not give your dog more and more food simply because it begs for it!

, Daily exercise is important for any dog. If your dog has a metabolic disease, exercise can help it stay as healthy as possible. The exercise does not have to be strenuous, though. A few leisurely walks each day would be adequate, especially if your dog’s metabolic disease makes it feel tired or weak.


Addison’s disease causes low levels of cortisol, which means a dog cannot handle stress very well.Intense exercise can be stressful, so engage in low-intensity exercises if your dog has Addison’s disease.
Exercise can also help with weight control, which is important for older, overweight dogs with diabetes or hypothyroidism.

, Stress is a big problem for dogs with Addison’s disease because their cortisol levels are so low. Along with giving medication to increase your dog’s cortisol levels, you will need to keep its stress at a minimum.Identify stressful situations for your dog and try to keep your dog out of those situations:Changes in daily routine: keep your dog’s routine predictable from day to day
House guests: put your dog in a quiet, calm area away from house guests
Boarding: consider having a pet sitter come to the house, rather than boarding your dog

Some senior dogs with diabetes may do well with a senior blend of dog food, while others may do well with a diet full of food prepared at home.

, Your senior dog should have a diet of hard, dry foods instead of soft foods. Soft foods can cause complications for diabetes because it causes more glucose to build in the body. It is also important to make sure that your dog eats before insulin injections, to help lower risk of hypoglycemia. If your dog is unable to chew hard foods, talk to your vet about other food options. You may be able to feed your dog a diet of people food instead.
Time the food and insulin by offering your dog a small snack. Once they eat it, give them their insulin injection. Then, give them their meal immediately afterwards.
If your dog won't eat the snack or their regular food, only give them half their insulin dose for that day, and if they refuse to eat for two or more meals in a row, contact your vet immediately for advice and treatment.

, Another way diabetes can be managed in older dogs is to make sure your dog gets exercise. Older dogs can still exercise, though they may be slower, have to exercise for a shorter duration, or be unable to exercise at such a strenuous level.For example, you can still take your dog for a walk or play fetch with them. They just may not be able to do the activity for as long as they used to.

"
"
Give your dog insulin.,
Monitor your dog’s glucose level.,
Monitor for symptoms of too much insulin.",How to Manage Diabetes in Senior Dogs3," Many older dogs with diabetes need daily insulin injections. Insulin shots are usually given in the dog’s back by folding the dog’s skin and using a special syringe or a VetPen. You should hold the needle at a 45 degree angle in your dominant hand. Push the plunger down with your thumb as quickly as possible so as not to prolong your dog’s discomfort.When your vet prescribes insulin, they will show you the proper way to give your dog insulin injections. Use only the syringes supplied by your vet, and use them only as directed. Do not repeat an injection if you cannot tell whether the injection went in.
Rather than injecting the same spot repeatedly, which may cause pain for your dog, vary the injection site a little every day.

, Often, vets will instruct you to check your dog’s glucose levels so you can monitor their condition. This is generally done using a glucose meter or a dipstick provided by your vet. You should use the meter or dipstick to check your dog's urine on a daily basis.When you check your dog’s glucose level using the provided meter, you will have to prick the dog’s skin on a hairless area to get a drop of blood.
The urine dipstick helps monitor your dog for glucose levels as well as conditions like ketosis. If ketones appear on the dipstick after testing, consult your vet immediately for advice.
Log the dog’s glucose level so you can discuss it with your vet, and schedule an immediate vet visit if your dog shows any signs of an illness that can destabilize a diabetic pet, such as a stomach ache, a sore mouth, or an ear infection.

, Dogs with diabetes can get too much insulin, which can lead to complications. If your dog’s insulin levels are too high, your vet may need to adjust the injections. If you notice any signs of too much insulin, take you dog to the vet. Symptoms include:Shaking

They can do x-rays and other imaging tests to look deeper into the gums for problems.;
, When your dog ages, the health of their teeth often declines, too. This often leads to teeth that become loose or infected near the root. Instead of getting the tooth cleaned or fixed, you should consider having bad or decayed teeth removed. Dogs can easily live with missing or no teeth.This helps protect the health of your senior dog. Infections from decaying teeth can spread throughout their bodies, causing problems with their organs.
Teeth cleanings cause the dog to be put under anesthesia, which can be problematic for older dogs.

, Many times, dental disease in older dogs can cause pain. It can also lead to infections in the gum tissue. If your dog has an infection or is experiencing extreme pain, your vet may prescribe medication for them to take to help.If your dog has an infection in their gum, your vet may give your dog medication to get rid of the infection before they can extract the tooth.

Talk with your veterinarian.,
Select a high quality dog food.,
Try making your own dog food.",How to Strengthen an Older Dog's Immune System1," One way to strengthen your dog's immune system is to make sure that your dog is eating a well balanced diet. Before changing your dog’s diet, talk with your veterinarian about the changes you will be making. For instance, you may want to ask your veterinarian to provide you with suggested foods to help boost your older dog’s immune system. They may be able to give you a list of dog foods that are suitable for older dogs, or they may suggest making your own food.Ask your vet if a dog food designed for ""senior"" dogs is suitable.
If your dog has any pre-existing health conditions, for example liver or kidney problems, your vet may suggest a special food to help with these conditions.;
, It is important that senior dogs eat a well-balanced and healthy diet in order to help maintain their immune systems.There are several things you can look for to help you select a good quality pet food.Look for the manufacturer’s name and contact information. This can make it easy for you or your veterinarian to get more information about the diet, like caloric information. If this information is not readily available to you, you should be wary about choosing this diet for your dog.
Look for dog food that is AAFCO certified because it means that the diet is complete and balanced for your dog's life stage. Some foods have the AAFCO statement printed on their label, but you may need to go to the manufacturer's website or call them to get confirmation.
Higher quality dog foods will have the protein source listed as one of the first two ingredients.
Also avoid any foods that contain artificial flavouring.

, If you decide to feed your senior dog homemade food, it is important that you ensure they get all of the vitamins and minerals necessary for proper nutrition. In general dog food needs to contain a protein source such as chicken, beef, fish, or liver; a fat source such as canola, olive, or fish oil; a high fiber carbohydrate such as brown rice, sweet potato, barley, or whole grain pasta; and fruits or vegetables.Homemade foods can be great for dogs, but they require considerable planning and attention to detail because you need to make sure that your dog gets all the nutrition that it needs.
Your veterinarian will be able to direct you to good sources for homemade dog food recipes and ingredients, so ask about their recommendations.

"
Walk your dog daily.,
Provide gentle play.,
Try swimming with your senior dog.",How to Strengthen an Older Dog's Immune System3," Exercise helps to keep your dog relaxed, fit, and healthy. Stress can have a negative impact on the immune system. As a result regular exercise is important. Some older dogs do not get adequate exercise because many owners feel it is too hard on them physically. Instead, you should adjust the type of exercise you give older dogs.For example, take your dog for a shorter walk daily. Instead of walking your dog for an hour, try two half hour walks each day.

, Another way to give your older dog exercise is by playing with them. Again, you may need to modify the type of play so that you do not injure your older dog. For example, if your dog likes to play fetch, throw the toy a shorter distance. Alternately, if your dog enjoys playing tug of war, purchase softer toys and play in a less vigorous manner.


Always play in a carpeted area so that your senior dog has enough traction., Swimming is an excellent way to provide your older dog with exercise. It is a low impact activity that is easy on the joints, and still helps to develop muscle strength. You can let your senior dog swim in your pool or take them to a water therapy clinic in the area.

Talk to your vet about prescription diet foods.,
Work on portion control.,
Avoid feeding your dog outside of mealtimes.,
Increase the amount your dog exercises.,
Try using environmental enrichment strategies for appetite control.",How to Manage Obesity in Senior Dogs1," Simply switching your dog to a lower-calorie dog food might seem like an easy fix, but if your dog does not feel satisfied with their meal, this may result in begging or behavioral issues. Your vet can instead recommend a food that will keep your dog feeling full and satiated, but on fewer calories — such as a food that is high in fiber, or one that increases your dog's metabolism. Your dog's needs will vary depending on their activity level, size, and age, so speak with your vet to ensure you choose a food that meets all their dietary needs.


Talk to your vet about how much your dog needs to eat to attain a healthy weight.
Once your dog attains a healthy weight, your vet will advise you as to what its new daily caloric intake should be. Feed your dog the proper amount and no more.;
, Instead of leaving a bowl full of dog food out all day and allowing your dog to help themselves when they feel hungry, carefully portion and distribute food to your dog. Start every morning by measuring out the amount of food your dog can eat for the entire day and put it in a sealed container. Portion out the food from this container into two or three meals so you can ensure the dog is not being overfed. Use your knowledge of how many calories your dog should be eating each day to measure out an appropriate amount of dog food.In order to determine how much dog food your dog needs, you need to know its activity level, its ideal weight, and the calories per serving size of your dog food.
With this information in hand, use the dog food calculator — online at http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-feeding-tips/dog-food-calculator/ — to serve your dog two or three appropriately-sized servings of food each day. Usually, you can serve your dog some food in the morning, some in the early afternoon, and some in the evening.
Make sure everyone in the household understands the system, and that when the container is empty, the dog has had their food for the day. This will remove any confusion about whether or not the dog has been fed and someone mistakenly giving them two meals, etc.
Check back in with your vet regularly to ensure that your pet is on track to lose weight. Your vet will let you know when your dog can increase or stabilize its caloric intake.
Always measure your dog's food carefully and accurately.

, Your dog’s caloric intake needs to be carefully managed if it is older and obese. Reduce treats or little snacks throughout the day (talk to your vet about how many are appropriate). Don’t allow your dog to beg at the table while you or your family sit down to eat. These extra calories add up quickly and can prolong your dog’s obesity.Instead of giving treats and snacks for being a good dog or performing a trick, give your dog hugs, pats to the head, and other physical affection. You should also give your dog verbal praise. For instance, say, ""Good dog!"" when they perform a trick or does something good.

, Obesity in dogs, like obesity in people, is best managed not only by a decrease in caloric intake, but also by an increase in physical activity. You will first need to check with your vet to make sure it is safe to increase your dog's activity level and discuss which activities are appropriate for your dog. For instance, you could:Go for a walk at the park or around the block with your older, obese dog.
Talk to your vet before engaging in a new or more intense exercise regimen with your dog.Older dogs might have creaky bones and stiffness, but these problems, too, can be managed by moderate levels of regular exercise.
Slow down if your dog is lagging, drooling or panting excessively, or coughing frequently.

, Consider trying a food puzzle to encourage natural foraging behaviors, can increase their energy, and can slow down their eating if they tend to gobble down their food. Try a puzzle feeder or even just spread your dog's kibble in the grass so they must hunt for it using their sense of smell."

Touch your dog’s ribs.,
Look for a waist.",How to Manage Obesity in Senior Dogs2," The backbone — or spine — is a long central series of bones that run in a straight line from your dog’s neck to their tail. If you rub your hand along your dog’s back, you should be able to feel their spine. But if your dog is obese, their spine will be layered with fat, and not readily detectable., Your dog’s ribs, like their backbone, should be easy to detect with light touch. If you drag your hand gently across your dog’s flank, you should be able to feel several long bones running vertically up the dog’s side. These are your dog’s ribs. If you cannot feel the ribs without pushing into your dog’s flesh, your dog is obese., View your dog from above. Your dog’s body should taper inward slightly toward a point near their back legs before widening out at the rump. If your dog’s body, as viewed from above, is one consistent width from front to back, or if your dog’s body gets even wider as it proceeds from front to back, your dog is obese."

Look for osteoarthritis.,
Monitor for cardiovascular disorders.,
Check for diabetes.,
Keep an eye out for respiratory diseases.,
Get your dog screened for cancer.",How to Manage Obesity in Senior Dogs3," Osteoarthritis is common in obese dogs, mainly because an obese dog is unable to spend as much time exercising and moving about as they need to in order to stay healthy. As a result, the dog might demonstrate stiffness, especially in the morning, and have trouble getting up and down the stairs or jumping onto furniture.Osteoarthritis also leads to lameness or limping, which might begin only occasionally, then become more frequent as the arthritis accelerates.
Other signs include whimpering, especially when the dog rises from a prone position.

, If your older, obese dog has heart disease, they might not have any symptoms; however, if they do have symptoms, the earliest signs will be detected by the vet in the form of an irregular heartbeat. More visible symptoms include hacking or coughing (especially early in the morning or after exercising), laziness, excess sleeping, or generally low stamina during exercise., Obese dogs often have diabetes, too. If your dog drinks a lot, urinates excessively, and eats more than they should, they might have diabetes.Your dog might also start to lose weight, even if their diet remains stable.More serious cases of diabetes might result in cataracts (a cloudiness in the eyes) or blindness in your obese dog.
If you know your dog is obese, you probably won’t allow them the opportunity to eat excessively. Check for other symptoms instead.

, There are a variety of respiratory conditions that could negatively affect your obese dog. These include pneumonia, fungal infections, and bacterial respiratory infections. These conditions tend to manifest similar symptoms, including shallow breathing, noisy breathing (including grunting or snorting while trying to breathe), rapid breathing or panting (especially when not associated with exercise), or coughing (especially with blood, phlegm, or other discharge)., Dogs who are obese tend to have higher rates of cancer. For this reason — among others — it is important to have your older, obese dog visit the vet regularly. Your vet will be able to check for cancer using X-rays and other medical tests.You should already have a vet for your dog. If you do not, check the American Animal Hospital Association’s vet database at https://www.aaha.org/pet_owner/about_aaha/hospital_search/default.aspx to find a vet near you.

Adjust your dog’s medication over time.",How to Treat Cardiac Disease in Older Dogs1," If your vet has diagnosed your dog with cardiac disease, you will need to decide how you want to treat it. Medications are effective at treating cardiac disease in older dogs. As you discuss the treatment options with your vet, ask some questions:


How long will my dog need to take medication?
Will the medications have bad side effects?
How much will the medications cost?
Will my dog’s heart get better?
How often will my dog need to come back to the vet’s office?;
, Your vet will likely prescribe several medications for you to give your dog. Each medication will have its own set of instructions. Follow these instructions carefully. If you have any questions about how to give each medication, ask your vet.


You will likely give the medications by mouth.

, In older dogs with cardiac disease, a valve on the left side of the heart (mitral valve) is most commonly affected. When the mitral valve stops working well, fluid can buildup in a dog’s lungs. To get rid of this excess fluid, your vet will prescribe a medication called a diuretic.Diuretics cause a dog to urinate more frequently. Increased urination will remove the excess fluid., Cardiac disease often leads to high blood pressure in older dogs. Several types of medication, including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure.By lowering the blood pressure, blood is able to move through the heart more easily.

, Other medications, called positive inotropes, help the heart muscles contract more strongly to move blood through the heart more efficiently.They also slow the heart rate so the heart doesn’t have to beat so fast to pump blood., Once your dog’s blood leaves the heart, it needs to flow properly through the body’s blood vessels. Medications called vasodilators will help blood flow more easily through these vessels.Vasodilators also help blood flow through the heart more easily., Along with coughing, breathing problems are a common sign of cardiac disease in older dogs. With medication, you should notice your older dog breathing more easily and slowly.With less fluid buildup in the lungs, your dog will also start coughing less.

, Cardiac disease gradually gets worse. As your dog’s mitral valve function worsens, your vet will need to make changes to your dog’s medications.For example, your vet may need to increase the dose of certain medications.

Test your dog’s cognitive functioning.",How to Perform a Weekly Health Check on Your Aging Dog," Make sure that your aging dog is physically fit and doesn’t have any scrapes or injuries by examining their body weekly. Run your hands along the dog’s body from head to tail, and check for any lumps, sores or wounds, rough areas, or any tender spots that cause your dog to show discomfort.You can also check your dog’s weight. Run your hands over your dog’s ribs: you should be able to feel the ribs, but not see them through the skin and fur. Similarly, you should be able to feel your dog’s spine, but it should not protrude or be visible.;
, Many aging dogs suffer from arthritis, which is caused by the breakdown of cartilage in a joint and the subsequent inflammation of the joint. Arthritis is a painful condition, which causes swelling and stiffness, and will decrease your dog’s mobility and quality of life.Throw a ball for your dog as part of the weekly checkup; make sure it runs smoothly and without favoring a joint or showing pain.


Arthritic dogs may also lick or chew at a painful joint. If you notice your dog exhibiting signs of arthritis, take it to the veterinarian, who can prescribe medication and other diet-based treatments.

, Older animals are liable to develop gastrointestinal problems, ranging from relatively mild issues such as an upset stomach or constipation to more serious medical concerns.Lightly palpate your dog’s stomach—the dog should show no signs of discomfort, and its stomach should not feel bloated or distended.


A distended stomach may be a sign of Cushing’s disease, a serious hormonal disorder that can afflict older dogs. Other symptoms include increased urination, hair loss, and lethargy. Cushing’s disease can be fixed with medication, if you bring the dog to your veterinarian.Aging male dogs may experience an enlarged prostate. During a regular vet checkup, ask the vet to check your dog’s prostate and make sure it’s healthy., Aging animals are at risk of developing gingivitis (gum inflammation) and periodontitis (gum disease) through lifelong poor dental health and hygiene. Gum disease is a serious medical condition which can result in the loss of one or more teeth. If your dog is suffering from gingivitis, its gums will appear swollen and tender, and may be red and bleeding.While checking your dog’s mouth, make sure that its tongue is moist and its breath is not excessively bad. These symptoms indicate good health in dogs.

, Many older pets suffer from vision-related problems, and are especially susceptible to contract cataracts, which may lead to blindness. As part of your weekly checkup, open your dog’s eyelids and examine the eyes: if your dog’s eyes seem clouded or covered by a white layer, they may have cataracts.Ask your vet about the best way to proceed; they may recommend surgery to prevent blindness.


You can also evaluate your dog’s vision by watching its day-to-day behavior. If your dog frequently runs into clearly visible objects or often falls down, this may indicate vision problems.

, As dogs age, they may develop ear infections. Check your dog’s ears weekly: look inside the ear, and make sure that there is not excessive buildup of wax, dirt, or other debris. The interior of the ear canal should be a light shade of pink, and should not have any odor or unexpected bumps.If your dog’s ears are dirty, you can clean them out with cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol.
Older dogs can also develop hearing loss. If you notice your dog becoming less responsive to your voice or other stimulating sounds (other dogs barking or birds chirping), ask your veterinarian if your dog may be losing its hearing.

, Conspicuous urination habits can indicate a number of serious health conditions in an older dog. If your dog’s attempts to urinate are frequent and seem painful to the dog, this could indicate a urinary tract infection or, more seriously, urinary tract disease. Painful urination could also indicate the presence of bladder stones, which aging dogs commonly contract.Many aging dogs also experience urinary incontinence, and are unable to control their urination. While this can be an annoyance, urinary incontinence can also indicate a more serious problem: kidney disease.Older dogs are at risk for kidney disease—which, left unchecked, will develop into kidney failure, which is an often deadly health risk.
For either of these urination-related symptoms, take your dog to your veterinarian. He or she will be able to prescribe a medication to fix a UTI, or help your dog pass bladder stones. Your vet can also check your dog for kidney disease.

, Older dogs are susceptible to weight gains, usually due to an increasingly lethargic lifestyle and a slowing metabolism. Weigh your dog weekly to track any substantial weight gains or losses. Obesity is a common health problem for old dogs, and can lead to health conditions including hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.Conversely, excessive weight loss can also signal serious health problems. If your dog loses a substantial amount of weight, even if it also exhibits an increase in appetite and thirst, this could indicate an onset of diabetes. Serious weight loss can also be an early warning of congestive heart failure, kidney disease, or Cushing’s disease.

, Cancer is the leading cause of death among older dogs, and afflicts dogs at roughly the same rate as humans.In its early stages, cancer can be difficult to detect through regular blood tests, so you’ll need to check your aging dog for lumps and tumors. You can do this while checking your dog’s body—run your hands over their body, including neck, legs, and groin, and feel for developing tumors.


Cancer can also manifest through dramatic weight changes, slowly healing sores (or open sores that don’t heal), and bleeding from the nose, mouth, or ears.If you notice any of these symptoms, or feel any new or quickly-growing lumps on your dog’s body, have them screened for cancer immediately.

, Older dogs are at risk for a mental deterioration known as “cognitive dysfunction,” similar to Alzheimer’s in humans.Make sure that your aging dog is staying healthy mentally; you can do this as part of a weekly checkup by giving your dog commands it has been trained to obey. Play fetch with the dog, or place a treat in the room and make sure your dog has the mental focus to find it.


You can also evaluate your dog’s cognitive function throughout the week by watching its behavior. If your dog often seems confused or disoriented, or if it forgets its training or goes to the bathroom in the house, the dog may be suffering from cognitive dysfunction.If you suspect your dog may be declining cognitively, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian, who may be able to provide medication.

Feed your dog a low-salt diet.,
Limit your dog’s exercise.,
Decrease your dog’s stress.,
Get your dog to an ideal weight.",How to Treat Cardiac Disease in Older Dogs2," In addition to treating cardiac disease with medication, you will need to make changes to your older dog’s lifestyle. For example, your vet will recommend switching your dog to a low-salt diet, which will help prevent fluid buildup in your dog’s body.Low-salt prescription diets are available through your vet.Switch your dog to the new diet gradually. Over one to two weeks, mix more of the new diet in with the old diet until your dog is eating only the new diet.
Let your vet know if your dog does not like the new diet. Your vet may recommend another diet for your dog.

, Dogs with cardiac disease can’t tolerate much exercise because their hearts don’t work very well.To manage your older dog’s cardiac disease, limit your dog’s exercise. Rather than taking your dog for a run or playing fetch, take your dog for easy, leisurely walks.


Your older dog’s heart shouldn’t have to work any harder than it has to.

, Like exercise, stress can make a dog’s heart beat faster and work harder. Without a well-functioning heart, your dog won’t be able to handle stress very well.Keep your dog’s life as stress free as possible:


Keep your dog’s daily routine the same.
If you have young children, do not let them play roughly with your dog.
Limit your dog’s interactions with unfamiliar pets or people.

, Excess weight can put stress on a dog’s body and make the heart work harder. If your dog is overweight, help it lose weight.Because you won’t be able to increase your dog’s physical activity by very much, you may need to make adjustments to your dog’s diet.


Talk with your vet about ways to get your dog to its ideal weight.
If your dog is already at an ideal weight, try to maintain this ideal weight by not overfeeding your dog or giving it table foods.

Recognize the symptoms of canine acne.,
Bring the dog to the vet for testing.,
Understand how canine acne is treated.,
Use a medicated shampoo to keep the skin clean.,
Apply some tea tree oil to the affected skin.,
Watch out for signs of tea tree toxicity.,
Get a prescription for oral antibiotics in more severe cases.,
Take measures to prevent the acne from recurring.",How to Treat Canine Acne," In the early stages, you may notice pink raised spots on the chin or lips. When you run a finger over the spots they feel bumpy, like local roughening on the skin surface. Sometimes the pup experiences mild irritation and rubs his chin along the ground.


If the spots become infected, the lumps may burst and exude a sticky discharge. This is usually ""seropurulent"", which means it is straw-colored and slightly tacky to the touch, and may be stained with creamy or yellow colored pus.
If the dog rubs the spot repeatedly he will inflame the skin and may cause it to bleed, in which case blood may also weep from the spots.;
, When a veterinarian is first presented with a puppy showing signs of canine acne, it can be difficult to predict if this is acne or if it is the earlier stages of a more serious infection.


Hair plucks or skin scrapes to check for the presence of the demodectic mange mite, can help rule out demodectic mange, which in the early stages of infection can masquerade as acne. However, many cases of demodectic mange do not need specific treatment and it is something the puppy will ""grow out of"".
Another similar condition is severe generalised folliculitis or ""puppy strangles"". This is a much more aggressive skin condition than acne in that the puppy becomes unwell with a fever and swollen glands in throat, as well as a sticky skin infection.
Puppy strangles also affects most of the face, rather than just the chin, and whereas acne pups are otherwise healthy, pups with strangles tend to feel poorly.

, Treatment of canine acne involves keeping the skin clean and eliminating secondary bacterial infections.


This is a condition that dog's usually grow out of by the age of 12 months, by which time their immune systems are sufficiently strong to fight of infection.
However, if left untreated the secondary infections can cause scar tissue to form as part of the healing process, which is cosmetically displeasing.

, If skin bumps are present but have not yet formed spots, keeping the chin clean decreases the numbers of bacteria that could potentially cause a secondary infection. Cleaning is achieved with the daily use of a shampoo or gel.


Benzoyl peroxide is a medicated shampoo which has a ""follicular flushing"" action, which is highly desirable for keeping the hair follicles clean. This means that the product penetrates deep into the hair follicles and washes away grease, loose skin cells, and bacteria.A veterinary product containing less than 5% benzyl peroxide should be used (most veterinary products contain around 3%).
To use the benzoyl peroxide shampoo, wet the dog's chin with water. Apply a spot of shampoo to a wet flannel and rub it gently against the damp skin. Rinse the flannel well and then soak it with water to rinse away the shampoo until all residue has been removed.

, Tea tree oil is a traditional remedy for skin infections due to its antiseptic properties.This natural remedy has both antibacterial and antiseptic qualities, but needs to be used with caution in dogs.Tea tree oil belongs to group of chemicals called terpenes. It works by breaking down the bacterial membrane and allowing leakage of potassium ions out and sodium ions in, resulting in bacterial lysis.
Low concentrations of tea tree oil - around 0.1-1% are safe for use in the dog. Unfortunately, many preparations are much higher than this (some even 100% tea tree oil) and this concentration should never be used on a dog because it is toxic. Only use products that are labelled as being below a 1% concentration.
Use tea tree oil in a similar way to the benzoyl peroxide. Dampen the skin then apply to a damp flannel and work into the skin. Rinse well with clean water and pat dry.

, Signs of tea tree toxicity can range from drooling and vomiting, through to difficulty walking, partial paralysis, tremors, and even seizures. These signs usually develop 2 tp 12 hours after exposure.


The severe symptoms are associated with oral dosing of tea tree oil (for example, if the dog licks neat oil off his coat). If severe symptoms occur, bring the dog to the vet immediately.
If the dog experiences mild symptoms of toxicity, such as drooling, then decontamination of the skin with soapy water should be sufficient to prevent the toxicity, but only if a tea tree solution of less than 1% was used. Oils stronger than 1% are not recommended for use in dogs., If the skin bumps become infected and rupture, oozing purulent (pus-like) or sero-sanguinous (watery straw-colored fluid stained with blood) material, then oral antibiotics will be necessary to bring the infection under control. These are often given in conjunction with skin cleansing.


Oral antibiotics are more effective than antibiotic creams or ointments, because the latter tend to clog or plug the follicles and may seal grease and infection into the skin.
An effective antibiotic is amoxycillin potentiated with clavulonic acid. This is given twice a day at a dose of 12.5mg/kg per dose. A 20kg dog requires 1 x 250mg amoxy-clav tablet twice a day. Treatment often needs to be given for 4-6 weeks, and extended for at least 2 weeks once the symptoms have cleared.Amoxycillin with clavulonic acid acts by disrupting the bacterial cell wall, causing it to become fragile and rupture, killing the bacteria.

, If a puppy has suffered from an episode of acne which responded well to treatment, ongoing skin hygiene can help prevent recurrence. A once daily washing of the chin with benzoyl peroxide, up until the age of 12 months, should help to decrease the likelihood of a flare-up.

Rule out other conditions.,
Evaluate the quality of life of your dog.",How to Manage Cognitive Dysfunction in Senior Dogs1," There is one medication that veterinarians use to treat cognitive dysfunction. This medication is called deprenyl (Anipryl), and it has been shown to help with symptoms and increase brain concentration in dogs.However, it does not work with all dogs. Some dogs will see no to minimal improvement.
The medication can take a couple of weeks to work.;
, When you take your dog to the vet, you should talk with them about how to make a care plan for your dog. The vet can give you suggestions on activities and foods to give your dog to help slow the advancement of CCD.For example, your vet will give you an exercise plan for your dog and suggest toys to help with mental stimulation.

, The symptoms of canine cognitive dysfunction are similar to other conditions that may afflict senior dogs. This means you need to take your dog to the vet to get checked out. While there is no official test for CDS, your vet can rule out any other condition.Your vet may do blood tests, fluid analysis, or imaging tests. Based on test results, your dog’s age, and the symptoms, your vet may settle on a diagnosis of CCD.

, Cognitive dysfunction can have a poor prognosis. Generally, a dog’s condition will deteriorate as they continue to age. While your dog may live a happy life for awhile, there may get to be a time when the dog’s mind is not functioning enough for them to live a happy life.Talk to your veterinarian about pet hospice care or euthanasia options for when your dog’s condition gets too bad for them.

They will appear as the same size as flakes of dandruff, so it’s easy to mistake this parasite for dandruff.;
, Use a magnifying glass or the zoom option on your cellphone to see if any of the dandruff moves. If the white flakes walk, your dog likely has a cheyletiella infestation.If your dog has this parasite, he will also likely be very itchy, as dandruff does not normally cause skin irritation but this parasite does.

, The steps to treat walking dandruff are different than treating normal dandruff. Use the spray formula of Frontline or Effipro and follow the manufacturer's directions to spray your dog's coat.Repeat the treatment again at two week intervals for three treatments.
In addition, wash your dog's bedding so he doesn't get infected again, and spray household soft furnishings with a spray designed to kill flea eggs and larvae, such as Nuvan Staykill or RIP Fleas.

, If your dog is suffering from a skin disorder, this can cause excessive dandruff. Anti-dandruff shampoo helps to gently lift the top layers of flaky skin away.Repeat this treatment regularly. Exactly how often depends on how scruffy your dog is, but anywhere from weekly to monthly is appropriate.
Always follow the directions specified on the shampoo. Some shampoos advise leaving the product in contact with the skin for 10 minutes, before rinsing, for maximum effectiveness.

, These are too harsh for delicate canine skin.

, You can also use this spray to treat dry skin caused by central heating.You can purchase a spray called Humilac by Virbac. It is widely available without a prescription and is an oil-free moisturizing spray.
Avoid using human moisturizing sprays or products. These often contain perfumes which irritate canine skin and cause allergic reactions resulting in redness and itchiness.

, You can also add two capfuls of Humilac to water and rinse it into your dog’s coat after you have used anti-dandruff shampoo on him.Humilac can be used daily, depending on the severity of your dog’s dandruff, but applying to your dog’s coat twice a week should be sufficient.
Use one pump of spray at a time, and move onto a different patch of his coat for the next application.
Avoid over-wetting your dog’s coat with the spray. Applying an excessive amount of the spray is not harmful but may give your dog’s coat a slightly greasy feel.

, Dogs with dry skin often lack a ""greasy"" feel to their coat, making it appear harsh and dull. If this is the case try weekly shampooing with a moisturizing oatmeal shampoo.Moisturizing shampoos are widely available from pet stores without a prescription and are used like any other standard pet shampoo.

, This will encourage good blood supply and circulation to his skin.Commit to a consistent, daily schedule of brushing to increase your dog's skin health and prevent the development of dandruff.
The stiffness of the brush used will depend on your dog’s coat. A short haired breed such as a Staffordshire bull terrier needs a softer brush than a coarse coated breed such as a Cairn terrier.

, Pay particular attention to his flanks and back.

, This will facilitate good air circulation on your dog’s skin and make your daily coat brushing more effective., This is as long as it takes for healthier skin germ cells to travel from the basal layers up to the surface of your dog’s skin.Keep in mind the scruff may actually get worse before it gets better as you loosen up the top layers of dry skin on your dog’s coat.

, A knotted, matted, and dirty coat holds bacteria against the surface of the skin, weakens the skin's immunity and predisposes dogs to dandruff. The groomer will be able to trim and clip your dog’s coat without damaging his skin.If your dog’s coat is only slightly tangled, you can clip the knots away with scissors. But be careful not to snip your dog’s skin.

, You can use products such as unscented baby shampoo to clean the surface of your dog’s skin, and improve its health.Be sure to use warm water as it will be more comfortable for your dog and he will be more likely to co-operate with his bath.
To shampoo your dog, work the shampoo in well and then rinse it out with clean water until the water runs clear and all the shampoo has been washed out of his coat.

, The intense heat along with the moving air can easily dry out the surface of his skin and cause dandruff.


If it is necessary to use a dryer to dry your dog after a shampoo or cleaning, keep the dryer setting on cool, and use a low blow setting.

, Dogs have a coat to protect them from the extremes of cold weather. But if your dog spends a lot of time indoors, especially in a centrally heated room, the natural oils in his coat may dry out, leading to flakes of dry skin and dandruff.


Reduce the room temperature so your dog doesn't get overheated. A comfortable temperature for a dog is around 18 degrees Celsius or 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
Avoid taking your dog out for walks in the cold when the room becomes too hot, as this will only make the difference in temperature worse and make him hotter when he goes back inside.

, Most dogs groom themselves, which helps to condition their coat by increasing blood supply to their skin and spreading the natural oils. But a large tummy area or significant weight gain can prevent him from being able to physically bend and groom hard to reach places on his coat.

, This should be a part of any treatment for his dandruff if he is overweight.

, The key to preventing dandruff and controlling it in the long term is to condition the baby skin cells at the bottom layers of your dog’s skin. Essential fatty acids, such as those found in evening primrose supplements, are vital to keeping your dog’s skin hydrated and healthy.The dose of evening primrose is based on weight, so use 250 mg for a 30 kg dog, once daily.

, The optimum balance for your dog's skin health is a ratio of 5:1 of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids. Achieve this balance by giving your dog supplements designed to nourish his skin from the inside out, such as Complederm (Virbac) which is available without a prescription.


Add Complederm to your dog’s food by the capful, according to the manufacturer’s instructions."

To help, refrain from rearranging your furniture.Try not to add new furniture to the house, especially if that means replacing furniture that your dog spends time on.

, To help your dog with confusion, try to establish a routine for them. This can help avoid surprises and help you know when your dog will eat, drink, and perhaps even need the bathroom.A routine can also help give your dog a sense of security.

, Your vet may suggest that you feed your dog a special diet for seniors and their cognitive function. These foods aim to help with the dog’s memory and learning. Some brands you can find at pet stores and supercenters are marketed just for senior cognitive function.Sometimes, a vet may suggest that you give your dog supplements, like vitamin E and C, selenium, beta carotene, Omega-3, and even coconut oil.
Don’t give your dog any supplements or change their diet before talking to your vet.

, Dogs with CCD need mental stimulation. This can be achieved through exercise. You may walk your dog around your neighborhood or even your yard. You may play fetch or tug of war with them. Try to get your dog active at their particular level.Always talk to your vet about an exercise program that is appropriate for your dog.

, Your dog can get mental stimulation from puzzle toys and games. You may try to give your dog food toys that help keep them mentally engaged. You can also try rotating toys each week to keep your dog interested and engaged.Just spending time with you and a toy can provide some mental stimulation for your dog.

, Because of your dog’s cognitive state, they may have trouble finding their food or water bowl. You should place the dog’s bowls in an open area where it can be easily found.You may have to make arrangements to place the bowls in front of your dog during food time, or lead your dog to the bowls.

, Many senior dogs have accidents in the house. This can occur when they don’t realize they haven’t gone outside or don’t remember to go outside to use the bathroom. To help with this, you may want to place your dog in a bathroom area you have made in your house just for them.You can place puppy pads or newspaper on the floor for your dog to mess on.
You may want to take your dog out often to avoid any unnecessary accidents.

Unlike warts, though, skin tags have a narrow stalk that is attached loosely to the skin.They may be flat or teardrop-shaped and can move or dangle, and they have the same color as the dog’s skin., If there is hair around the skin tag, clip it. Clean up any stray hairs that remain after clipping. This will help you ensure that the area is clean., Disinfect the area around the skin tag with 70% isopropyl alcohol or 10% povidone-iodine. Soak a cotton ball with at least 5 milliliters (a spoonful) of either substance, then swipe the tag itself and the area around it., You need the dog to be still so that you can cut carefully. Enlist someone else to help you that the dog likes, so that the person can effectively keep the dog calm.

, Sterilize a pair of curved mayo scissors if you are going to cut the skin tag. Sterilize a piece of string or floss if you want to tie off the skin tag instead. You can use any shallow plastic pan (or even a lunch box!) for this purpose. Place 250 milliliters of water in the pan, plus 10 milliliters of 10% povidone-iodine. Immerse the scissors in the pan for a full minute to sterilize them.


Using curved scissors is important, as they will help ensure that the skin tag’s stalk is cut as close to the skin as possible.

, Using the curved mayo scissors cut the stalk at its base as close to the skin as you can. It will bleed, so be prepared with clean gauze bandages.

, Using the clean string, thread, or dental floss, tie around the base of the stalk as tightly as possible and as close to the skin as you can. This will be a bit painful at first, but after a few minutes your dog will not feel it anymore.


Check the area daily. The tag will swell for approximately three days, then it should begin to shrivel. It should turn dark and fall off within a week.

, While a veterinarian may cauterize the wound if this procedure was done in a vet's office, most people don't have the ability to do that sterilely at home. Instead, apply direct pressure for a few minutes, until you are relatively sure that bleeding has stopped. This may be even more effective than cauterizing., Without removing the first gauze bandage, use another piece of gauze or a bandage to cover the area. It will heal in three to five days, but it’s important to keep the dog from licking or playing with the wound.

, Make sure that no infection sets in. If it does, take your dog to the veterinarian to get the infection treated., You may need to put a cone on your dog if it repeatedly tries to lick the wound. Cone shaped E-collars keep your dog from biting or licking the tied tag or the wound.

Dog toothbrushes are made using soft materials which are angled to facilitate brushing, making the structure of their teeth easier to get to.


PetroDex, Nylabone and Petco likely have quality toothbrushes for your dog.
Please do not use a human toothbrush to brush your dog's teeth as it is irritating to his gums.;
, A variety of toothpaste products that are safe for pets are commonly available in pet stores and through veterinary clinics. Pet toothpastes come in flavors that are appealing for dogs, such as poultry and seafood.


Avoid using human toothpastes on your dog as they often contain abrasives and high-foaming detergents that should not be swallowed or inhaled by dogs.

, You can make your pup homemade toothpaste using bouillon or chicken cubes, baking powder and coconut oil. To make the toothpaste:


Dissolve the chicken cube in a bowl, add some baking soda, cinnamon and solid coconut oil (not melted). The baking soda and cinnamon will act as an abrasive to remove the plaque and tartar from your dog’s teeth while coconut oil helps to combine all of the ingredients together.
Spread some on your toothbrush for immediate application and keep the rest in a resealable container. It should keep for around a week.

Don’t allow your dog to eat this toothpaste however, as it may cause adverse effects.



, Most dogs aren’t big fans of having their teeth brushed at first, but hopefully with practice you can make it a reasonably pleasant experience for both of you. Try to choose a time when your dog has had a decent amount of exercise, so he’s tired out and more inclined to sit still for the procedure.


You may, at least initially, need to give your dog incentive to make him cooperate with you. Train him to associate teeth brushing with rewards, like a treat or play time.

, Speak pleasantly and soothingly to your dog as you brush his teeth, as this will help to keep him calm.


Don’t overdo it on the brushing the first couple of times - only bush for a minute or two and stop if your dog gets agitated.
As your dog gets used to having his teeth brushed, you can slowly build up the brushing time and brush more frequently.

, Oral rinses and gels will help to prevent plaque build-up and bacteria. Chlorhexidine is the most effective anti-plaque antiseptic, as it binds to the oral tissues and tooth surfaces and is gradually released into the oral cavity.


Chlorhexidine is safe for pets and rarely causes problems, though it does have a bitter taste if additional ingredients are not added to make the taste more pleasant for dogs.
A chlorhexidine rinse is applied by squirting a small amount inside the cheek on each side of the mouth. The gel is applied by smearing it onto the teeth. The dog’s tongue and lips will then spread the rinse or gel around the mouth naturally.

, Rawhide chew treats can be helpful if chewed daily, especially if they contain an anti-tartar ingredient. It won't be hard to convince him to chew on it either as it's an activity most dogs enjoy.


These treats are inexpensive and widely available at most pet supply stores.

, There are many synthetic bones and chew toys that are specially designed to strengthen your dog’s gums and teeth. Just make sure you’re providing safe objects for your dog to chew on. Hard objects can cause broken teeth.


Talk to your vet about what kind of toys are best for your dog's teeth. Different breeds and sizes of dogs will require different sized and shaped toys.

, Dogs are carnivores – they chew on bones in the wild. However it is not recommended that you give your dog cow hooves, dried natural bones or hard nylon products to chew, because they are too hard and do not mimic the natural effect of a dog tearing meat off a carcass. These hard products are associated with broken teeth or damaged gums.


If you're unsure what to buy your pup, look into reviews of products, talk to the staff at your favorite pet store, and ask your veterinarian specific questions about the products you're looking to buy.

, Remember that chew toys are only of benefit if they are played with frequently and over the long haul – you can increase the dog’s willingness to chew by smearing palatable peanut butter or soft cheese on the product.


A tablespoon or two, depending on your dog's size, should be more than enough.

, Dogs should be monitored while chewing a chew treat or toy, as they may swallow large pieces, leading to a variety of digestive system disorders.


If you notice your dog's toy falling apart, it's best just to buy another one. Have your dog regularly chew on two or three to keep them lasting longer.

, Avoid feeding your dog chicken bones and long bones that splinter. They provide no benefit and may cause constipation and other problems.


Talk to your vet about a diet that balances your dog's nutritional needs, weight, and oral hygiene. Tackling one isn't enough – you'll want to tackle all three.

, It’s important to be able to recognize the signs of dental decay in your dog, so you can consult with a veterinarian as soon as possible. The main signs of dental decay include:


Bad breath
Loosely fitting, discolored teeth covered by dental tartar.
Bleeding gums.
Poor appetite and a reluctance to eat hard food.

, Even with healthy teeth, your dog should have his teeth checked by a professional every six to twelve months, just like you. Your vet should include a dental examination with a normal checkup, but ask for it if they don’t.


Though cavities are less likely for your pup than you, many dogs still suffer from oral and dental issues like bad breath, loose teeth, sore and infected gums, and rotting tooth sockets. It is very important to realize that maintaining dog dental health and oral hygienic is necessary to keep your dog healthy and friendly!

, If your dog has a lot of plaque or tartar build-up, you may need to schedule a cleaning with the vet to have the plaque removed. The vet will use specialized instruments to clean your dog’s teeth.


If a dental cleaning is necessary, it is advisable to do pre-anesthesia blood work to make sure your pet does not have any underlying problems. This is a quick procedure that you can likely do the same day.

Notice any behavioral changes.",How to Manage Cognitive Dysfunction in Senior Dogs3," Canine cognitive dysfunction occurs in older pets. Depending on the breed of your dog, this may mean around age eight. When diagnosing CCD, your vet will look at the other symptoms alongside the age of your pet.Larger breed dogs age at a quicker rate than smaller breeds. A large breed may be considered senior at age seven, while a small breed may not be senior until 10 to 12.

, When your dog has cognitive dysfunction, they may exhibit signs of confusion. They may become lost around the house or in the yard. They may not respond if you call their name or give them a command.The dog may get confused and stand in the corner of a room. They may get disoriented and end up behind the couch or chairs and not be able to get out.
Your dog may be unable to find doors or stairs they’ve used many times before.

, When your dog has CCD, their mental state will be weak. The dog may not be able to learn new things, such as new tasks or routes to places. They may not be able to recognize members of the family or their toys.Your dog may just stare off into space.
The dog may be startled by people, noises, or lighting.

, Your dog may display a change in behavior due to their condition. They may stop doing activities they used to enjoy, like going for walks or playing. They may spend less time with you and your family.The dog may sleep during the day and be awake at night. They may walk aimlessly around the house at night.
The dog may not want to eat or drink as much as they used to.

Get rid of your dog’s fleas once you have removed the fleas from your dog’s indoor and outdoor environment.",How to Treat Allergic Dermatitis in Dogs," There are two standard tests that are used to test the blood. The first is called a RAST test (radioallergosorbent). The other is an ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Both of these tests are very similar, but many practitioners feel that the ELISA test gives more accurate results than the RAST test.;
, The other type of testing is intradermal skin testing. In this test, a small amount of antigen is injected into the skin of the animal and after a short period of time, the area around the injection site is observed to determine if the animal is allergic to the agent.

, Dogs, like their owners, can experience a variety of allergies. Allergens in their food or in their environment are responsible for more than 30 percent of the skin irritations that dogs experience. Allergy testing can be expensive and does require some dedication on the part of the dog’s owner. However, testing your dog for allergies can result in a significantly improved quality of life if an allergy is identified and treated.

, If you know which substances your dog is allergic to, avoidance is the best method of control. Even if you are desensitizing the dog with allergy shots, it is best to avoid the allergen altogether.

Molds can be reduced by using a dehumidifier or placing activated charcoal on top of the exposed dirt in your house plants. Dusts and pollens are best controlled by using an air cleaner with a HEPA filter. Air conditioning can also reduce circulating amounts of airborne allergens because windows are then kept closed.






The identification and removal of allergenic is the primary and most effective way to eliminate the AD in your dog. The recognized source of flares includes fleas, food, house dust, mites and pollens.







, Many medicated shampoos have compounds in them that are aimed at soothing injured skin and calming inflammation. In addition, frequent bathing (weekly to every other week) of the dog can remove allergens from the hair coat, which may contribute to skin allergy flare-ups.


The medicated baths vets recommend are those that actually contain antimicrobial and antifungal agents as well as ingredients that allow the skin to be bathed on a more frequent basis without drying it out. Application of a rinse afterwards also helps to prevent drying out of the skin and hair coat.

, Antihistamines can be used with good safety in dogs. These medications tend to have a variable effect between dogs. For some allergic dogs, antihistamines work very well in controlling symptoms of allergic skin disease. For other dogs, very little effect is seen. Therefore, a minimum of three different types of antihistamines should be tried before owners give up on this therapy. Examples of antihistamines commonly used for dogs are as follows:


Hydroxyzine 2.2 mg/kg orally at 8 hours interval
Diphenhydramine 2.0 mg/kg orally at 8 hours interval






Clemastine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg orally at 12 hours interval






Chlorpheniramine 0.4-0.8 mg/kg orally at 8 hours interval (max dose 8 mg)






Prednisolone and Methylprednisolone can also used in case of severe skin lesion @0.5 mg/kg once/ twice daily until recovery.






Antihistamines are considered to be worth trying in most cases since the side effects associated with antihistamines is low, and they are typically inexpensive medications.

, Secondary staphylococcal infections are common in atopic dogs. Oral cephalexin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin and clavulanate, or sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim are often effective as initial empirical therapies.

Secondary bacterial infection in ear and skin are very common condition that causes worst effect on your dog. Through cytology or cultural sensitivity test, it is recommended to use antimicrobials therapy. Topical, oral or combination of both methods is often recommended by your veterinarian.






Antibacterial solutions and shampoos have proved to be beneficial in case of secondary infection. Commonly used antibacterial solutions are chlorhexidine, ethyle lactate and triclosum while Ketoconazole and Miconazole are referred as antifungal drug. There are many shampoo available in marketplace containing Ketoconazole which often recommended by your veterinarian for bathing of your dog.







, Allergy shots are very safe, and many people have great success with them; however, they are very slow to work. It may be six to twelve months before improvement is seen.

Once the allergens for the dog are identified, an appropriate immunotherapy is manufactured for that specific dog, and treatment can begin. After the offending antigens are identified, then a mixture of these antigens can be formulated into a hyposensitizing injection.






Depending on the type of agents used, these injections will be given over a period of weeks to months until the dog or cat develops immunity to the agents. After initial protection, an occasional booster may have to be given.







, Many people don’t suspect food allergies as the cause of their dog’s itching because their pet has been fed the same food all its life and has just recently started having symptoms. However, animals can develop allergies to a substance over time, so this fact does not rule out food allergies.

Another common misconception is that dogs are only sensitive to poor quality food. If the dog is allergic to an ingredient, it doesn’t matter whether it is in premium food or the most inexpensive brand on the market.






One advantage to premium foods is that some avoid common fillers that are often implicated in allergic reactions.







, Allergies develop through exposure, so most hypoallergenic diets incorporate proteins and carbohydrates that your dog has never had before. As mentioned previously, the quickest and best way to determine which foods your dog may or may not be allergic to is through diagnostic allergy testing.

As dairy, beef, and wheat are responsible for 80% of food allergies in dogs, these items should be avoided.






Novel protein sources used in hypoallergenic diets include venison, egg, duck, kangaroo, and types of fish not usually found in pet food.






Carbohydrate sources include potatoes, peas, yams, sweet potatoes, and canned pumpkin.







, Hydrolyzed protein diets are diets in which the protein source has been synthetically reduced to small fragments. The theory behind feeding a hydrolyzed protein source is that the proteins in the food should be small enough that the allergic dog’s immune system will not recognize the protein fragments and will not mount an immune response resulting in an allergy.

, Most pets with food allergies respond well when switched to a store-bought hypoallergenic diet, but occasionally an animal suffers from such extreme allergies that a homemade diet is the only option. In this case, the diet should be customized with the aid of a veterinarian.

, Start by vacuuming thoroughly, especially below drapes, under furniture edges, and where your pet sleeps. It is estimated that vacuuming can remove up to 50% of flea eggs. Vacuum daily in high traffic areas, weekly in others. Each time, seal your vacuum bag in a plastic bag and discard it immediately. Do not place mothballs or flea collars in the vacuum, since toxic fumes could result.

, Use a product that will kill any remaining adult fleas and also stop the development of eggs and larvae. You will need a product that contains both an adulticide and an insect growth regulator (IGR), such as Nylar (pyriproxyfen) or methoprene. This can be in the form of carpet powders, foggers, or sprays.

Foggers are especially good for large open areas. Surface sprays can reach areas such as baseboards, moldings, cracks, and under furniture where foggers cannot reach. Choose the product(s) you use with care, taking into account the presence of children, fish, birds, persons with asthma, etc. Your veterinarian can help you choose the appropriate products for your situation. In severe infestations, you may need the help of a professional exterminator.






Commercially available different IGR and insecticides are proved to control the flea. The fipronil, imidacloprid, lufenuron, selamectin, and spinosad are often recommended by veterinarian for removal of environmental infestation. Monthly regular and systematic approaches should be taken to eliminate the flea infestation from environment. Please remember that if everything goes well as recommended doses it will require 2-3 months for complete control of flea from the infestation.







, Wash your pet's bedding weekly and treat the bed and surrounding area with a product that contains both an adulticide and an insect growth regulator.

, Do not forget to also clean and treat your automobile, pet carrier, garage, basement, or any other place your pet spends much time.

, Flea control in the outdoor environment generally involves eliminating the habitat in the yard and kennel areas where fleas are most likely to occur. Fleas tend to like it where it is moist, warm, shady, and where there is organic debris. They will also tend to be where pets spend more of their outdoor time. So be sure to concentrate on areas such as patios, under porches, dog houses, etc.

Rake away any organic debris such as leaves, straw, grass clippings, etc., to disturb flea habitat.






Wild animals such as opossums, raccoons, chipmunks and other small rodents can carry fleas. Try to discourage these animals from entering your yard, e.g., do not feed them.







, Now that we've taken care of the fleas in your home and the ""hot spots"" in your yard, it's time to eliminate the fleas that are on your pet.

There are a number of flea control products for use on pets, including once-a-month topical products, sprays, dips, shampoos, collars, powders, oral, and injectable products. With any product applied directly to the pet, please remember that you may see some live fleas on your pet for a short time after spraying, shampooing, dipping, etc. In order for the fleas to die, they must come into contact with the insecticide, and absorb it.






Keep in mind that until all of the fleas in your home have died, you will probably still see some fleas, even on a treated pet, since some immature forms may continue to develop. This is especially true if you had a big flea problem to start with. Persistence is the key here. It is essential to keep following an effective flea control program for a long enough time to get rid of all of the fleas, in all life stages. This may take several weeks to 6 months or more, depending on your particular situation.

Treat your dog even if you have not seen any fleas. Fleas are small and easy to miss.


Your dog may be suffering from a flea allergy even if you haven't noticed fleas.Your dog may be allergic to flea saliva and severe skin disease can develop after only one or two bites.;
, Bathing is effective in relieving itching in dogs with a number of skin problems. Don't worry about drying out your dog's skin with bathing. This is unlikely to happen as long as you use a mild shampoo designed for dogs — use a dog shampoo designed to work with the pH of canine skin. Look for a product that's soothing and follow with an oatmeal-based conditioner, for the most effective moisturizer.Comb or brush your dog before bathing, since wet hair mats more easily.Thoroughly massage the shampoo into the dog's skin for about 10 minutes, and make sure the lather has contact with the skin.Rinse thoroughly with cool water and dry the dog completely using a towel.


Some of the benefits of bathing an itchy dog include the following:Unclogging hair follicles by removing dirt, oil and other debris.
Decreasing yeast and bacteria on the surface of the skin, which are frequently cause skin itching.
Removing potential allergens from the coat.
Moisturizing the skin.
Improving the health of the skin.


If you have applied a topical flea preventative or plan to apply one, read the medication's label directions with regard to bathing. Some products require that the dog has not been bathed for 24 to 48 hours before application, and most recommend waiting to bathe a dog for a specific period of time after application.

, Bacterial or yeast infections of the skin are usually diagnosed by the veterinarian. The vet will most likely prescribe topical medications that you'll need to apply. You'll also need to give antibiotics to completely treat the infection.


Your vet will probably also prescribe medications to treat the itchiness caused by the infection. These may include corticosteroids or antifungal medications.Look for special pet wet wipes that are designed to combat dog yeast infections. There are several available without prescription. Wipe the areas most affected by the infection (such as paws or armpits) with the wipes twice daily.

, You may be tempted to give an over-the-counter antihistamine to your itchy dog, but this may not be particularly effective. There are no antihistamines currently licensed for use in small animals in the United States,so all use is off label. If you do want to try an antihistamine, you should check with your veterinarian first, especially if you have a dog with a chronic illness or one that is on other medications. If you do choose to give one of these drugs, make sure to give only the recommended dose and check that formulation you are using is safe for dogs. Do not use these drugs long-term or use more than one at a time without specific instructions from a veterinarian.


In studies, antihistamines helped less than 30 percent of treated dogs with itchy skin caused by environmental allergies.Antihistamines may or may not be less effective at treating other causes of itching. They're best used as preventatives for dogs with known allergies and in combination with other therapies.Here are the current dose recommendations for OTC antihistamines:Diphenhydramine (Benadryl): 1 mg/ lb twice a day.
Chlorpheniramine in dogs less than 45 lbs: 4 mg three times per day.
Chlorpheniramine in dogs over 45 lbs: 8 mg three times per day.
Fexofenadine (Allegra): 1 mg/ lb once or twice a day.



, If you suspect your dog is allergic to something in his diet, you need to figure out what's causing the problem. Dogs most commonly react to a protein source. Talk to your vet about switching your dog onto a limited ingredient food that does not contain the proteins your dog regularly eats. For example, if your dog eats a lot of chicken or lamb, look for a salmon- or venison-based diet. Don't expect to see results straight away, it can take several weeks for food allergens to clear the system.Make sure you don't feed anything but the specific diet during this period of time, no treats, no table scraps.
Take care when re-introducing food to your dog. Once you have determined what your dog is allergic to, reintroduce the food and watch for symptoms to reappear, confirming your diagnosis., Some potential causes of itching in dogs include the following:Parasites, including lice, mites and fleas.
Bacterial and yeast infections. These only occur when the skin is damaged or made vulnerable by some underlying disease or allergy.
Food allergies.
Environmental allergies.
Hypersensitivity to tick or insect bites.Less common causes include autoimmune diseases, endocrine diseases, certain cancers and others., While any dog breed can be allergic to something, certain breeds are prone to specific types of allergies. Do your research about what allergies or health conditions may be more likely with your dog's breed. This may give you a clue about what's bothering your pet.For example, if you have a cocker spaniel, you may learn that he is likely to get food allergies at some point in his life. You'll most likely notice itching on his ears and feet if he does have a food allergy., If you've practiced good flea control and give your dog a thorough bath, but he has been itching for more than seven days, your dog needs to see a vet. You should also take him to the vet if the scratching is so severe that you cannot distract him from scratching, or it stops it from eating or sleeping.


Itchy skin in a dog may be a symptom of any number of health problems. This means that diagnosing and treating your dog's specific problem requires a step-wise approach. This will rule out causes of itching starting with the most common and progressing to rarer potential causes.

, Generally, veterinarians start examining an itchy dog by getting a thorough history and doing a physical examination. To help your veterinarian get an accurate picture of your dog's condition, consider writing out a history before the visit so that you don't forget to mention any critical facts. Some important facts to share include the following:How long the dog has lived with you.
Where you got the dog.
How long the dog has been itchy and whether the problem has improved, gotten worse, remained constant or tended to wax and wane.
Where on the body the dog seems to be itchy.
The dog's current and past diets and any treats, table food or other food you give the pet.
Where the dog spends its time (in the house, in the yard, roaming the woods, swimming in pools or natural bodies of water, etc.)
Contact the dog has with other animals, including other household pets, wild animals in the yard or the woods and other dogs at the kennel, the groomer, the dog park or other places.
Whether or not other pets or people in the household are itchy.
Whether or not the dog has had problems with itching in the past.
Whether or not the itching seems to be seasonal.
The dog's medications, including flea and heartworm preventatives, prescription medications, topical ointments and shampoos, over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
Any symptoms other than itching.
Any steps, including bathing, supplements, diet, drugs, topical therapy, clipping and others, you have taken to try to control the itching and the dog's response to these interventions.

, The vet may recommend further tests, such as a microscopic examination of some plucked hairs, skin scrapings, ear swabs, blood tests or others to rule out the most likely causes of your dog's itching based on the pet's symptoms. These tests will help the veterinarian decide on a plan for treating your dog's skin issues.While some vets discourage it, other vets will recommend allergy testing for your dog. Testing is very expensive and may not be accurate since the tests were initially designed for humans.For this reason, elimination diets are usually used to determine allergies., Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms and the cause or suspected cause of the itching. Common treatments include anti-parasitic medications, regular bathing with medicated shampoos, antibiotics, oral or topical steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, dietary supplements, diet changes and others.When dealing with an itchy dog, it is important to be patient and follow your veterinarian's plan, including giving the dog all prescribed treatments.In the long-run, your dog will have the best chance of making a full recovery if you follow a careful plan and rule out causes of itching in a logical order.

, If your pet has long hair, consider having his coat clipped. Experts recommend that dogs with itching problems have hair that is less than 5 centimeters or 2 inches in length.Hair can irritate itchy skin. Dogs with short hair are easier to keep clean and treat for skin disease.

, Some dogs are allergic to grass, dust, or pollen. Once you or your veterinarian has identified what environmental condition your dog is allergic to, try to remove your dog from the problem. For example, if your dog is allergic to grass, you may want to keep him inside until the reaction clears up, and have him avoid any freshly-cut grass. When you do let him out again, put him in a t-shirt or something that comes between his skin and the grass.


If your dog is allergic to dust, be sure to vacuum the rugs, curtains, and upholstery in your house at least twice a week using a vacuum with a HEPA filter. You should also wash your dog's bedding once a week.If your dog has a pollen or airborne allergy, your vet might give an allergy injection. This will help build your dog's resistance to the allergen. Bathe your dog every two to three days to remove the allergens from his coat.

, If your dog is allergic to flea or bug bites, you'll need to preventatively treat him from future bites. You'll need to start a flea control problem. Talk to your veterinarian about giving your dog preventative medication.You may need to give your pet medication once or twice a month.


In the meantime, try washing and grooming your dog at least once a week. Ask your vet if you should use a flea shampoo.

Keep your dog healthy.",How to Treat a Yeast Skin Infection in a Dog," This will help you identify the problem as a yeast infection. Dogs with a skin yeast infection will scratch relentlessly, so patches of hair loss and weepy, sticky skin within those patches is common. Look for:


Scaly skin.
Reddening or blackening of the skin.
Loss of hair in the afflicted area.
Strong odor coming from the skin.;
, In addition to showing specific dermatological symptoms, your dog may also exhibit strange behaviors; these are often caused by Malassezia. Look for these symptoms:Constant itching and scratching.
Shaking or tilting of the head (if the infection is on your dog’s skin or ears).
Loss of balance or hearing (if the infection is on your dog’s skin or ears).
Frequent walking around in circles (if the infection is on your dog’s skin or ears).

, The symptoms of a skin allergy and a yeast skin infection can appear similar: both involve your dog frequently scratching, dry skin, etc.The easiest way to rule out an allergy is to have your vet administer an allergy test to your dog.
If you have recently switched your dog’s food or shampoo, this could be causing an allergic reaction. Try switching back to the previous food or shampoo and, if the symptoms disappear, you’ll know that your dog did not have Malassezia.

, Because yeast infection can be mistaken for other health problems (such as skin allergies), it’s important to have your veterinarian’s opinion. Keep a list of all of your dog’s skin symptoms to give to your vet.Your vet may want to have a full medical history of your dog on file.
With this information in hand, your vet can conduct medical testing on your dog, including urine, blood, and skin analyses.

, Shampoo treatment is often all that is needed to get a yeast infection under control.These shampoos are very common; you should be able to find medicated pet shampoos at any pet store or vet’s office. As long as there is no secondary infection present, follow these steps:


Bathe your dog in an antifungal shampoo. The shampoo should contain the ingredients chlorhexidine, miconazole or ketoconazole.When bathing your dog, make sure that the shampoo is on its skin for a full 10 minutes before you rinse it off.
For full effectivity, give medicated baths for every 3-5 days, for 2-12 weeks (as long as symptoms last).

, If your dog’s yeast skin infection is in a small area, you can apply a medical cream directly to the fungal infection. You should be able to purchase an antifungal topical cream from your veterinarian’s office, or from a pet-supply store.


Apply a miconazole yeast infection cream to the affected areas a couple of times each day for 7-10 days.
Only apply enough of the cream to thoroughly cover the infected area. The cream packaging will likely include instructions for applying the cream to your dog’s skin—follow these instructions closely.

, In cases where the yeast skin infection is chronic or does not respond to topical-cream treatment, you may need to administer an oral treatment. Oral treatments are typically an anti-fungal medication prescribed by your veterinarian.Oral medications often include prescriptions which contain ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.These medications often need to be administered for a long period of time: from 5 weeks to several months.Oral antifungal medications can have unpleasant side effects. These can affect your dog’s liver, and may need to be monitored by your vet.

, Ears are one of the most common locations for yeast skin infections, and it’s important to keep your dog’s ears clear and disinfected.Dog ear-cleaning solutions are not given by prescription. There are many retail brands available; check your local pet store or vet’s office. There are also home-made recipes online—most of these use safe substances (such as apple cider vinegar).
Apply an ear cleaner designed to lower pH levels, clean the ear gently with a soft tissue, and apply yeast infection cream inside the ear as directed.
If the yeast infection is deeper in your dog’s middle ear, it will need to be treated with oral medication, and perhaps even with surgery.
Serious yeast ear infections can take up to six weeks to heal., If your pet’s yeast skin infection worsens or is not better at the end of either topical-cream or oral treatment, contact your veterinarian. Plan ahead to ask your vet questions, such as:


“Is there anything I can do to keep my dog from scratching the infected area?”
“What’s the best way to figure out if my dog has an allergy that caused this infection?”
“Is it likely that this disease is congenital (present from birth) or genetic?”

, Although these infections are, to some degree, unpredictable, there are certain common stressors that may prompt Malassezia yeast to grow abnormally.These stressors include:


Excess heat and humidity (keep your dog indoors during these conditions).
Food and flea allergies.

, Certain breeds of dog are more susceptible to yeast skin infections, often due to their excess skin folds.Breeds such as pugs and bulldogs fall into this category. Other breeds that are genetically predisposed towards Malassezia infections are:Poodles and basset hounds,
Cocker spaniels,
Dachshunds.

, Malassezia yeast is commonly present on your dog’s skin, but usually only becomes pathogenic and causes harmful inflammation when your dog’s immune system is already compromised.Keep your dog up to date on all of their immunizations.
Check your dog for any injuries or cuts after she has spent time outside. These can become infected.

Reexamine your senior dog’s diet.,
Monitor your senior dog’s weight.,
Take special care from the age of seven onward.,
Watch your dog for signs of arthritis or other joint issues.,
Maintain a regular exercise regimen to preserve your dog’s strength and mobility.,
Be prepared for accidents.",How to Help Your Senior Dog Stay Healthy," Better quality foods deliver better nutrients, which is very important as your dog’s body changes. There are many senior formula dog foods available that cater specifically to an aging dog’s dietary needs. When it comes time to reconsider your pet’s diet, meet with a veterinarian for its recommendations.  There are also special dental specific formulas to accommodate dogs that have lost many teeth or have other mouth or gum problems.


Don't economize: Feed your dog high quality food formulated for older dogs. Pay attention to the ingredients, avoiding by-products and opting for premium proteins.
Choose food that your dog can easily chew if it has problems with dentition.;
, Weight can be a good indicator of underlying problems and can be a cause of them. Obesity will put unnecessary stress on your dog’s body or could be a symptom of another issue. Dieting and gentle exercise can easily improve a dog’s weight. Your veterinarian may want to run blood work to consider other treatments as well. On the other hand, senior dogs can become too thin as they age. Your vet may recommend special formula food or dietary supplements to be certain that your pet is getting the proper calories and nutrition it needs. Discuss with your veterinarian what an ideal weight range might be for your pet and weigh it regularly.


Keep your dog lean. Look for signs of obesity, using the dog's ribs as a yardstick, making sure that you can feel them through his coat.
Keep the percentage of fat in your dog's diet low, and choose lean, healthy snacks to help control its hunger: zucchini, cucumber, fresh green beans and seedless apple slices are excellent examples., While various breeds and individual dogs age differently, a general rule of thumb considers most dogs to be senior at seven years old.By this age. you should start to bring your dog to the vet for biannual checkups. The dog's body changes faster from this age, and by increasing the frequency of visitations, your veterinarian will be better able to recognize changes in health and diagnose late-in-life illnesses while still potentially treatable.


Twice annual trips to the vet are recommended for older dogs. Ask for a geriatric blood panel, urinalysis and have your dog's teeth cleaned. Ask your vet to evaluate your older dog for symptoms of arthritis and dementia and to suggest a course of treatment if necessary.

, Make small adjustments to your household to accommodate your dog’s limited mobility. Relocate your dog’s bed, toys, or food and water dishes to make movement through your home easier on its body. Speak with your veterinarian about medication, supplements, and joint formula dog foods. It may be time to invest in orthopedic dog beds, portable staircases, or pet ramps. There are also physical therapy and holistic treatments that may be of benefit to an arthritic dog. Research hydrotherapy or canine acupuncture facilities in your area.


If your dog is arthritic, consult your vet about pain medications. Consider dietary supplements to reduce inflammation. Provide your dog with an orthopedic dog bed and other products to help keep it stable and comfortably mobile. Don't ask the dog to navigate stairs if it cannot do so.

, As your dog ages, you may need to adjust exercise and play to suit its changing abilities, but continue to find ways to keep your dog appropriately active. As your dog’s hearing, vision and coordination dulls, organize exercise activities in safe, contained environments. That may mean moving furniture, finding areas with non-slip flooring, or limiting activity to fenced, familiar areas rather than venturing to public spaces.


Include a daily regimen of gentle exercise. Adjust the intensity to match the dog's physical tolerance. Use food puzzle toys to stimulate him mentally and help control his weight. Be aware of potential hearing and vision loss and always keep the dog leashed when outdoors.

, As a dog ages, its bladder control will not be what it might have once been. Use puppy pads or old blankets to line the bedding or crates of senior dogs that begin to show signs of incontinence. Find a waterproof dog bed liner so that accidents do not absorb into the padding. Keep a second cover on hand so that you can easily swap them out for washing. Take your dog on frequent bathroom breaks to allow it to relieve itself before a full bladder causes problems.


Give your dog many opportunities to go outside during the day. Schedule a sitter to take the dog outside if you cannot, as the dog can't hold it. If the dog leaks during naps or overnight, be prepared with clean dog bedding. Be kind if the dog leaves a mess; it's as emotionally distressing for him as it is bothersome for you.

Treat the tumors directly.",How to Treat Benign Fatty Skin Tumors on Dogs," It is important for dog owners to assess the state of their dog's body regularly in order to find problems as soon as possible. A great way to do this is during regular brushing or grooming. Go over your dog's body with your hand and feel for any changes or lumps.A lipoma usually feels soft and can be moved around under the skin a bit with no discomfort to the dog.Lipomas can be found anywhere on the dog but do show up on the belly frequently. Most lipomas are benign, but those located under the armpit or near joints may cause some discomfort, especially if they are pressed inward by legs.
Lipomas on the neck may be a threat even if benign as they can press into the larger neck veins. Consult a veterinarian to determine whether these should be removed or observed.;
, If you identify any lumps or bumps on your dog you should have them looked at by a veterinarian. While they may not be a problem, as is the case with most lipomas, they should be assessed by a veterinary professional. Your veterinarian will ask you about the lump and when you noticed it, in addition to doing a physical examination.


Do not just avoid dealing with the issue and assume it will go away. Lipomas that are not assessed and treated can grow and become problematic and reduce the dog's comfort. Measure the size of the lump and monitor to see if it grows or shrinks at all.

, In order to assess the type and severity of the lump, your veterinarian may want to do a needle aspiration. This is a procedure in which the veterinarian inserts a needle into the tumor and extracts cells to inspect under a microscope. This will allow the veterinarian to determine what is going on with the growth.This test will allow your veterinarian to see if the cells inside the lump are benign or malignant. The vet may request a sample be sent to a diagnostic lab for further review of the lump.
If you are concerned that your dog might experience discomfort during the procedure, speak with your veterinarian.

, There are a variety of things that can be done to treat lipomas depending on the type and severity of the lump. It is important that you discuss all options with your veterinarian and make an educated decision that takes your dog's comfort and your financial situation into consideration. However, it is likely that your veterinarian will have a treatment option in mind that he or she thinks is most appropriate and helpful to your pet.


If the lump is not benign, then the need for treatment will be more serious and time sensitive. However, you should still be presented with a few options and ultimately the treatment decision is yours.
Failing to treat a malignant lipoma may put your dog's health at risk and could lead to a shortened lifespan and a lower quality of life.

, In many cases, if the lump is benign, then the veterinarian will suggest monitoring the lump for changes. If it does not change and it causes your dog no discomfort, then your dog may not require treatment. If the lump does change or causes discomfort, then surgical treatment options can be explored.


If your decide to wait and see if the lipoma changes, then you will need to actively keep an eye on it. Chart its size and shape by putting a piece of thin paper (wax or tracing paper) over the growth, tracing it, and then writing the date on the paper. Do this every month and you will have a good record of the growth's shape and size.If the lump grows rapidly or changes shape, take your dog back to the veterinarian to get it assessed.

, If the veterinarian finds that the lump is malignant, that the lump can't be identified for certain, or that the lump is causing your dog discomfort, then he or she may suggest removal. The seriousness of the procedure to remove a lipoma will depend on its size and location. However, it usually requires anesthesia but is a quick procedure otherwise.If the lump is actually malignant then more tissue will need to be removed to make sure all malignant cells are removed.

, If your dog has a lipoma removed, it may have a small wound that needs to be cared for until it heals. Make sure your dog does not excessively lick the surgical wound or chew at any stitches that are holding it closed. Also make sure to keep the wound clean and change any bandages as directed.Larger lipomas may create a larger wound that will need to be drained to prevent blood from pooling. If this is necessary, your vet should walk you through this step of aftercare.
You may need to put a cone on your dog for a few days after surgery to make sure that it doesn't mess with the surgical wound.

, There are a wide variety of treatments that can be done for your dog's condition that use non-traditional forms of medicine. These include traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and herbal supplements. Consult with a practitioner for one of these types of veterinary treatment to get a consultation and to discuss treatment.It may be hard to find a practitioner of alternative medicine for dogs in your area. You may need to travel for treatment or consult with an expert that lives elsewhere and give treatment yourself.

, There are some dietary changes that may help a dog that is having recurring benign tumors, as overweight dogs can develop larger lipomas. First, make sure that your dog is eating high quality food that does not contain unnecessary chemicals and additives. Giving your dog quality food will help its overall health, potentially improving the dog's immune system and ability to suppress more tumors.Discuss your dog's diet with its veterinarian. Make sure that any changes you make to your dog's diet will fulfill its nutritional needs.

, There are some alternative medicine veterinarians that advocate for the use of supplements to boost the dog's immune system and to eliminate toxins from the body. These supplements could include a variety of things, including bovine colostrum and fatty acid supplements., There are some natural medicine products that can be used on benign fatty tumors. For example, there are skin detox tinctures, such as Tumoxil, that are applied directly to the growths and are purported to eliminate toxins under the skin.There is some evidence that injecting lipomas with steroids can be an effective treatment for small growths. However, this would need to be done by a veterinary professional."

Talk to your vet.,
Limit sodium consumption.,
Feed your dog enough protein.,
Add dietary supplements to your dog’s diet.,
Don’t assume that senior dog foods are appropriate.",How to Feed an Older Dog with Heart Disease1," After your vet identifies symptoms of heart disease in your older dog, they should recommend treatment options, including how to best feed your dog. Listen closely to your vet’s advice and follow it closely.Depending on the severity of your pet’s heart disease, your vet might prescribe a regular diet of commercial dog food or a more limited diet of prescription dog food.
Ask your vet questions if anything is unclear.;
, Look for dog foods that are labeled “low sodium.” If you can’t find such a dog food, consider ordering it online, or ask your local pet store to place a special order for you. Check the nutrition labels on the back of doggie snacks and bags of food to ensure your dog isn’t getting too much sodium.The specific sodium limits your dog can tolerate depend on its health and how much it eats. Consult your vet for more information.

, Dogs need fewer calories as they age, but it is important to maintain stable levels of protein intake even as your dog gets older. Protein deficiencies are linked to the development and acceleration of heart disease.At least 25% of your older dog’s calories should be from protein. For instance, if your dog eats 1,000 calories per day, 250 of those calories should be protein.Adequate protein levels will also prevent your older dog’s muscles from atrophying.

, Supplements add needed vitamins and minerals to your dog’s diet. These supplements are available at your local pet store. Always consult a vet before adding supplements to your dog’s diet. Supplements might come in capsule or liquid form. Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to best administer your supplements. Popular supplements include:Vitamin B, which helps strengthen the the heart so it can pump more efficiently
Taurine and carnitine, likewise, strengthen the heart and also relieve edema (the buildup of fluid in the body, usually in the lungs or elsewhere).
Coenzyme Q. This antioxidant can improve gum health and strengthen the immune system. Poor dental health often causes infections which can lead to or exacerbate heart disease.
Omega 3 fatty acids. These supplements provide anti-inflammatory and inti-arrhythmic properties that will keep your dog’s heart healthy., There are a number of commercially available dog foods that are intended specifically for older dogs. But these dog foods may not be right for your dog. They often have higher levels of fiber and lower levels of protein than normal. If your dog is already getting an adequate amount of fiber and/or needs more protein in its diet, you should not purchase senior dog foods.Follow your vet’s recommendations to decide which type of dog food you should provide your older dog with heart disease.

"
"
Don’t feed your dog too much.,
Give your dog plenty of exercise.,
Adopt changes to your feeding habits.",How to Feed an Older Dog with Heart Disease2," Older dogs tend to need fewer calories than they did in their younger years. Dogs gain body fat as they get older, even if they decrease their caloric intake. Feeding your dog too much will only accelerate the amount of body fat it accumulates.The specific calorie needs for your dog depend on its health, activity level, and weight. For instance, if your dog has a high activity level, it will need more calories. Overweight dogs will require fewer calories than a dog that is already at its ideal weight.
Getting your dog’s weight down to a healthy level should be one of the first steps you take toward managing its heart disease.

, Like people, dogs can limit their chances of developing and worsening heart disease if they receive regular exercise. There are many options for keeping your dog fit and trim. For instance:Take your dog for a walk daily. You could walk at the park or just around the block.
Play fetch with your dog. To play fetch, throw a soft ball or chew toy away from your dog in your backyard or other open space. Your dog will run to recover the ball and bring it back to you. Repeat several times until your dog is no longer interested in playing.
Exercise will reduce your dog’s chances of developing arthritis, improve its immune system, and contribute to good overall health.
If your dog is panting heavily, lagging behind or slowing its pace, or starts hacking or coughing, you should call it a day. Take your dog home and go for another round of exercise tomorrow.

, Even if your dog is eating modest meals, you might be encouraging obesity through a number of bad habits. For instance, perhaps your dog begs at the table when you eat with your family and gets table scraps. Maybe your older dog receives a number of small treats throughout the day for doing tricks or just being a good dog. The total calorie count on these small snacks can add up quickly, especially if everyone in the house is giving your dog a little extra.Communicate to your family that your dog is elderly and has heart disease, and therefore can’t get snacks and treats at the same level it used to.
Instead of treats and snacks, give your dog extra verbal praise and physical affection.
Place all treats that you do give in your dog’s bowl. This will reduce the likelihood that it begs for food from you directly.

"

Take your dog to the vet regularly.,
Take care of your dog’s teeth.,
Try medication.,
Make plans for end-of-life care.",How to Feed an Older Dog with Heart Disease3," As your dog ages, the more likely it becomes that it will develop heart disease or other maladies. If you can get an early diagnosis, your pet has a better chance of minimizing the negative effects of heart disease and other undesirable medical conditions.You should already have a vet for your older dog. If you do not, check the American Animal Hospital Association’s database at https://www.aaha.org/pet_owner/about_aaha/hospital_search/default.aspx for a vet near you.
Heart disease in dogs often has no observable symptoms, so it is important to get your dog checked out regularly.

, Heart valves are often damaged by infections which start in the mouth. Buy a doggie toothbrush and toothpaste at your local pet store. Brushing your dog’s teeth is not unlike brushing your own teeth. Simply apply a dab of toothpaste to the brush and scrub gently across the surface of the tooth using circular motions.Do not use human toothpaste.
Follow manufacturer directions when using doggie toothpaste.

, There are several medications available to help your older dog manage its heart disease. Your vet will be able to determine which medication your dog would best respond to.Furosemide (available commercially as Lasix) is one of the most common treatment options. This medication causes excess bodily fluid that gets stored in the lungs due to heart failure to excrete as urine.
Enalapril and benazepril are also commonly used. These medications allow the heart to pump blood more effectively.
Do not administer human medication to your older dog., If you were fortunate enough to catch your dog’s heart disease in its early stages, you might be able to give your dog a high quality of life right up to its final days. But if your dog’s heart disease went untreated until it manifested serious symptoms like heart failure or heart attack, you should think about what kind of life your dog will have afterward.For dogs that seem to be in a lot of pain or discomfort, have difficulty breathing, or demonstrate near-constant anxiety, the most merciful thing might be to choose euthanization. Euthanization is a process in which the dog receives an injection that ends its life.
In other cases, even dogs that have survived heart attacks can live healthy lives but will need extra care and medication.
Consider your options and weigh the decision carefully in consultation with your vet.

Determine whether your dog responds to treatment.",How to Diagnose Cognitive Dysfunction in Senior Dogs," Clinical signs of canine cognitive dysfunction are grouped into four categories, known as ‘DISH’: disorientation, changes in social interaction, sleep cycle changes, and house training accidents. Signs of disorientation include staring into space, getting stuck in corners, and getting lost inside or in the yard.You might notice some other signs of disorientation in your dog:Aimless wandering
Can’t find the door, or stands at the wrong door to go outside
Staring at the walls
Not recognizing familiar faces;
, A senior dog with cognitive dysfunction will not interact with people like it used to. For example, if your dog has cognitive dysfunction, it may not greet family members at the door anymore, walk away when someone is petting it, or not try to get your attention as much.Your dog may start begging for food even when its food bowl is full.You may also notice your dog following people around the house more (or less) than it used to., Normally, a dog will nap occasionally during the day and sleep well at night. However, the substances in the brain regulating your dog’s sleep cycle stop working properly with cognitive dysfunction. When your dog's sleep cycle changes, you may notice your dog sleeping much more than usual.Other signs of an altered sleep cycle include waking up at the wrong time and pacing the floor in the middle of the night.When your dog paces at night, it may start howling, which will probably disrupt your own sleep cycle!, If your senior dog has cognitive dysfunction, it may forget its house training and start going to the bathroom in your home.Your dog may also stop letting you know when it needs to go outside.Your dog may even start having accidents in front of people at home.If your senior dog is having accidents, don’t punish it. Your dog is not having bathroom accidents on purpose. Rather, the cognitive dysfunction has affected your dog’s ability to know the proper place to go to the bathroom.

, Some signs of cognitive dysfunction don’t necessarily fit into the ‘DISH’ categories. For example, cognitive dysfunction can cause a dog to drool, pant, or lick excessively. It can also cause restlessness, indicated by a dog’s inability to get comfortable and stay in one place for long periods of time.Your dog may have a hard time dealing with new situations, such as a new pet or a change in routine., Usually, the signs of canine cognitive dysfunction start gradually and worsen over time.You may think your dog is just getting old, but those signs may indicate cognitive dysfunction.The only way to know for sure is to take your dog to your vet for further examination.

, Your vet will make a diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction based on your dog’s history, physical exam findings, and diagnostic test results.Provide your vet with as much information as you can about your dog’s symptoms:


What symptoms you’ve noticed
When the symptoms started and if they’ve gotten worse
Your dog’s behavior before you noticed the signs

, If your dog’s signs of cognitive dysfunction are subtle, they may not be easily detectable on a physical exam. Other than looking for signs of the disease, your vet will perform other basic tasks of a physical exam, such as taking your dog’s temperature and listening to its heart and lungs. Your vet will also ask you questions about your dog’s symptoms:Can you describe the symptoms in detail?
How have your dog’s symptoms affected you? Are you upset or distressed?
Have you noticed signs of physical illness, such as changes in appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea?

, To get a better idea of your dog’s brain function, your vet may want to do a neurological examination. For this exam, your vet will evaluate the function of the cranial nerves, determine how well the anal sphincter is working (this could explain the bathroom accidents), and test if your dog recognizes where its legs are without seeing them.Magnetic resonance imaging is a great way to visualize the brain. However, this diagnostic method is usually not available in veterinary clinics., The signs of cognitive dysfunction can also be seen with other diseases, such as hepatic encephalopathy, pancreatic tumors, and kidney failure. Therefore, your vet will need to perform some diagnostic tests to rule out these other diseases as causes of your dog’s symptoms.Blood work can provide clues of other diseases.


Hepatic encephalopathy occurs when problems in the liver ultimately end up affecting the brain., Analyzing your dog’s urine can also help your vet rule out other diseases.A dog with kidney or pancreatic disease could have abnormal urine results.

, Your vet may recommend diagnosing your dog according to how it responds to treatment.Your vet will prescribe a medication commonly used to treat cognitive dysfunction, and determine whether it improved your dog’s symptoms. This diagnostic option can be useful if all other diagnostic tests are normal.


Anipryl is the medication used to treat canine cognitive dysfunction.Your vet will instruct you on how long to give the medication, and recommend a follow-up appointment to assess symptom improvement.

Continue to monitor the cataract.,
Consider surgical treatment.,
Know the dangers of untreated cataracts.",How to Help a Dog with Cataracts1," Cataracts develop over time and the key is to treat them early. As a dog owner, make sure to inspect your dog’s eyes on a regular basis. Look for any indications of a cloudy appearance or a color change. If your dog already has cataracts, watch to see if the impacted area grows or changes in shape.You may also notice other physical signs of cataract growth, such as loss of balance. Your dog may appear a bit clumsier and could run into furniture.
If your dog has diabetes mellitus, then keep an eye on their diabetes-related symptoms. If you notice that your dog is losing weight or experiencing more frequent urination, then take them to a vet.;
, A vet is the only person who can truly diagnose a dog with cataracts. Your vet will likely inspect your dog’s history. They will also ask you about the symptoms that you’ve observed thus far. They will perform an extensive physical exam on your dog as well, focusing on the ocular region.Depending on what the vet sees, they may also order a series of tests and bloodwork. Before a surgery is scheduled, your dog may get an ultrasound of its eye area too., Talk with your vet before giving your dog anything. But, it may be helpful to offer your dog some additional nutritional support to help it fight off the development of cataracts. You can add oral antioxidants to your dog’s food. You can also mix in healthy oils, such as cod liver oil. Under your vet’s supervision, you can also add in herbs, such as bilberry.Bilberry is believed to assist in eye strength by developing a link between the eyes and the liver. Human pilots have been known to take bilberry supplements.Making healthy changes to your dog’s diet in general may slow the process of cataract growth as well. For example, use a food processor to liquefy green vegetables and mix them into your dog’s food., Once your dog’s been diagnosed with cataracts, you may want to start experimenting with canine massage and acupuncture therapy. Your vet may be able to suggest a reputable therapist. Ask the acupuncturist to focus specifically on the areas of the body associated with vision problems.This type of touch-therapy is not a good option for dogs that suffer from anxiety. The process of massage may be more stressful to them than soothing.

, Once you’ve noticed the cataract and taken your dog to the vet, then you’ll need to consider how to proceed. Your vet may ask you to observe your dog’s eyes for a certain period of time and to write down any noticeable changes. Also, whether you choose surgery or not, you will want to get used to paying attention to the condition of your dog’s eyes., Surgery is currently the main treatment option for dogs suffering from cataracts. However, the surgery is invasive and requires an extensive recovery. Most vets will only recommend that healthy and young dogs go through the surgery. The surgery can also be costly, starting at around $1,000 and going upwards depending on the care that is needed.The ultrasound tests that the vet performs will also need to show that your dog is a good candidate for surgery in the ocular region. Your dog’s retina (rear eye area) must be healthy. In dogs with good health, around 90 percent recover their vision post-surgery., If you leave your dog’s cataracts untreated, then it is likely that their vision will continue to deteriorate. They may lose their vision entirely due to the development of glaucoma. The cataract may also start to shift position in the eye, causing a great deal of pain. Whether you choose surgery or not, it is important to develop an observation and treatment plan for cataracts.Part of the treatment plan may be discussing the eventual need for pain medications with your vet. It is good to plan ahead and keep these in stock in your house in case your dog goes through a particularly bad spell.

Stick with the same routines.,
Use aromas to teach navigation.,
Keep the home environment the same.,
Place foam on any sharp edges.",How to Help a Dog with Cataracts2," Whether your dog is recovering from surgery or is facing deteriorating vision without surgery as an option, make a habit of following the same basic routine of care every day. Feed your dog at the same time. Try to play with them at around the same time. This will help your vision-impaired pet know what to expect., A dog who suffers from impaired vision will naturally come to rely more on their sense of smell. Play into this by using two signal aromas in your household-one for “good” and one for “bad.” Vanilla, for example, can be your good aroma. Wipe a few drops of vanilla scent on their food area and around the door frames to help with navigation.Bitter apple or peppermint could be your bad scent. Use this to warn against hazard areas, such as the edges of a fireplace.

, Avoid moving furniture around or making any major changes to the outlines of your living space. Make sure to keep your dog’s personal area the same as well by not moving their crate or food and water bowls around.

, Get down on your dog’s level and try to navigate around the house. Look for potential hazards in the form of sharp, low edges. Cover these edges with roll-out foam pieces. These foam barrier protectors are available online and in stores for babyproofing, but can also be used for pet proofing and safety.

Help your dog get adjusted to wearing a cone or plastic collar.,
Practice confining your dog to help them prepare for after the surgery.,
Schedule a physical exam for your dog at least four weeks before the surgery.,
Talk to your vet about pre-op preparations.",How to Help a Dog with Cataracts3," After your dog’s surgery, they will have to wear a protective cone or collar. In order to make your dog’s postoperative life easier, get them adjusted to wearing a cone by having them wear the cone a bit before surgery.


Ask your vet for a protective cone that you can put on your dog for a portion of time each day (you can decide the amount of time). That way, your dog won’t be frightened by the cone when it is placed on them after surgery.

, Like wearing the cone, confining your dog to a small space where they can heal is a necessary part of the post-op process. After the surgery, they will have to rest so that they do not injure themselves further. Introduce your dog to their crate before the surgery so that they are not confused or scared by it after the surgery has occurred.


To get your dog used to the crate, try placing their food bowl in the crate. You can also put a treat in there to increase their desire to go in. When your dog is used to going into the crate for food, try closing the door for a short period of time.

, Because the surgery will require your dog to be put under anesthesia, you should set up an appointment to have your dog physically checked out. Doing this will help to make sure that your dog is physically fit for the surgery. The check-up should include a blood examination, blood pressure monitoring, and an evaluation of your dog’s clinical history.If your dog is diabetic, it is especially important to have blood work done before the operation. You should also consider having a urinalysis done.

, Some veterinarians recommend a preoperative treatment that involves anti-inflammatory eye drops. These drops may be given to your dog two weeks before the surgery, and may increase in frequency in the days before your dog’s operation. Your dog will also need to fast for at least 12 hours prior to surgery.


If your dog is diabetic, you should feed your dog their normal amount of food and insulin doses on the morning of the surgery. Talk to your vet about the steps you should take for your specific dog.

"
Restrain your dog using a harness.,
Limit the amount of exercise your dog gets.,
Give your dog the medications prescribed by your vet.,
Be aware of the potential complications.",How to Help a Dog with Cataracts4," During your dog’s recovery period, you will want them to wear a harness, not a collar. A harness will even out the pressure from your control movement, whereas a collar will add pressure to the head and eye area, potentially interfering with recovery. Also, remember to be extra gentle when maneuvering your dog via their harness., Just like a human recovering from surgery, your dog should take it easy in the days following their procedure. Rest is the most important thing so that their body can heal. Encourage your dog to relax by laying down on the floor beside them. Build up to taking slow walks around the neighborhood.


To limit your dog’s movement, you may also want to place them in a crate. However, make sure to only do this for short periods of time or your dog’s muscles could cramp, slowing recovery even more.

, Make to keep all of the hospital paperwork nearby, showing exactly how much medication to give your dog and when. Give your dog the complete course of medication, even if they look better after a few doses. Your vet will most likely prescribe topical antibiotic eye drops that your dog should take for three to four weeks. This will help to keep your dog’s eye from getting infected.


Make sure to wash your hands before applying a medication to your dog’s eye area. This will help to prevent the spread of germs.
Carefully watch your dog’s reactions to their post-op medications. For example, if your dog tries to furiously rub its eyes after the drops, then talk with your vet about other options.
You can expect to see some mild swelling around the eye area. A limited amount of clear discharge from the eye is also normal. If you notice anything concerning, contact your vet.

, It is a good idea to know the warning signs to watch for in the post-surgery period. Keep an eye on your dog over time to make sure that they do not exhibit any signs of infection, such as smelly eye discharge. Your dog may also respond poorly to anesthesia, so make sure that your dog becomes more clear-headed over time."

Check out your dog's feces.",How to Treat Nosebleeds in Dogs," If you notice a nosebleed, don't become frantic. Doing so will only make your dog upset and frightened. Instead, try to stay calm and collected. You can help your dog. You just need to stay cool-headed, so you can get it to the vet and get it treated., Your dog primarily breathes through its nose, so when it gets a nosebleed, it may have trouble breathing. Make sure the dog is breathing okay before doing anything else. If it's not, it's time to go to the vet now.If your dog is having trouble breathing, you should be able to hear wheezing. Your dog may also be panting more, as well as breathing more rapidly., To stop the nosebleed in the moment, use an ice pack. Wrap ice in a cloth or washcloth so it isn't too cold, then hold it up to your dog's nose, on the bridge. Apply light pressure in the area. The cold should help the blood vessels narrow, making the blood stop flowing.You should apply pressure until the bleeding stops. If it hasn't stopped after about 20 minutes, consider taking your dog to the vet.

, You don't want your dog to move around too much. Moving around increases blood flow, which makes the nosebleed worse. Instead, try to keep it still by petting it and talking soothingly to it while you apply the ice pack.Continue calming your dog even once the blood as stopped flowing, as moving around too much could cause the clot to blow, creating a new nosebleed.

, A nosebleed is often a symptom of an underlying condition. Therefore, if you notice a nosebleed in your dog, you need to take it to the vet as soon as possible to get a diagnosis. Often, your dog will continue to get nosebleeds if the underlying condition isn't treated.Expect tests. Because a nosebleed can indicate a wide variety of conditions, your doctor will need to do a full examination, plus a range of tests. The tests will likely include taking both a blood sample and a urine sample for analysis. Your vet may also order x-rays or a CAT scan to help to determine what is wrong.Nosebleeds in dogs can be caused by more minor issues such as high blood pressure, dental disease, a fungal infection, or mild trauma (including having something stuck in the nose). Your dog may also have a problem with blood clotting. Some more serious possibilities include the chance of a tumor or cancer, problems from eating rat poison, and diseases passed from ticks.The most common causes for nosebleeds are infections, trauma, and tumors.A few other possibilities include Rocky Mountain spotted fever or a thyroid issue., It can help your vet if you think about possible connections to the nose bleed. For instance, if you know your dog got into rat poison (which can also happen if they eat a rodent contaminated with poison), that's a connection. Another connection is if the dog experienced any trauma recently, such as running into something. Foxtails, a type of grass with a spiky end, can also be a problem if your dog has had a run-in with it recently, as the end can go up the dog's nose and get stuck.Medications can also cause nosebleeds, particularly NSAIDs (like ibuprofen).

, If your dog's nose won't stop bleeding, your doctor may need to employ some other tactics than you used. They may use epinephrine drops on the nose, for instance, or they may put your dog under anesthesia and pack its nose with gauze.Your vet may also have to cauterize the end of the blood vessels to stop the nosebleeds.
If your dog has lost a lot of blood, it may need a blood transfusion, which your vet can provide.
Ask about antibiotics or antifungals for infections. If your dog has an infection, a round of antibiotics or antifungals may be needed to treat the infection. Once the infection has been banished by the medications, the nosebleeds should go away, too., If your dog has von Willebrand's disease, it may need a plasma transfusion to help treat it.Von Willebrand's disease, often inherited, is found in both dogs and humans. Basically, the blood doesn't clot as well as it should, causing excessive bleeding.After the bleeding has stopped and your dog has had a plasma transfusion, your doctor may recommend that it begin taking a round of drugs intended to treat the disease.

, If your dog ran into something that become lodged in its nose, the vet will need to remove the object. Doing so may cause more bleeding for a bit, but the nosebleeds should clear up eventually.Your vet may be able to remove the object with tweezers. If they can't remove the object, they may need to move on to surgery.

, If the problem is a tumor, a build-up from a fungal infection, or a badly lodged object, surgery will likely need to be performed on your dog. Of course, your vet will need to make this call, and they will provide you with the options you have for your dog's care.Depending on what's causing the problem, your dog may need other treatments, such as immunosuppressive therapy. Prednisone may be prescribed if the problem has to do with the platelets in the blood. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be needed if the cause is cancer. Your dog may also need to stay in the hospital for a period of time for treatment., Once your dog comes home, you'll need to follow all of your vet's instructions. Your dog will need to be kept calm. A crate can help in severe cases. You'll also likely need to give your dog medications, either pills or a spray for the nostrils, which your vet will show you how to apply., Obviously, the main symptom of a nosebleed is a slow, steady flow of blood dripping from your dog's nose. However, you may not notice the flow right away. Watch for the skin around the nose changing color (turning darker because of the blood).You may also see swelling around the mouth and nose., Even if you don't notice the blood right away, your dog is likely to know something is wrong or different. It will likely paw at its nose as a nosebleed starts because it can feel the blood starting to come out., As a dog owner, you know dog breath is rarely pleasant. However, nosebleeds can cause even worse breath, particularly if they are chronic. If you notice your dog's breath suddenly getting worse, it could be because of nosebleeds or the underlying cause., If your dog suddenly stops eating, that could also be a sign of nosebleeds. More likely, it's a sign of the underlying condition causing the nosebleed. Either way, if your dog stops eating, it needs to see a vet.While your dog may still be eating, you should also note if it's losing weight over time.

, This job is definitely not a fun one. However, you don't need to dig around in your dog's feces. Rather, you just need to note the color. If it's especially dark and sticky, that could mean your dog has been swallowing blood from a nosebleed."

Look for physical symptoms.,
Observe eating and bathroom habits.,
Identify symptoms associated with the dog’s behavior.,
Know which breeds are more prone to metabolic disorders.,
Understand how old age impacts your dog.",How to Diagnose Metabolic Disease in Older Dogs1," Unfortunately, many owners confuse the symptoms of metabolic disorders with the natural signs of age. In the end, vigilance to any changes your dog is going through may result in a better quality of life and a longer life in general.


Look for weight loss. While you should pay special attention to rapid weight loss, weight loss over time may also be cause for concern.
Be wary of weight gain.
Watch for skin problems.;
, Eating and bathroom habits reflect how your dog’s metabolic system is breaking down and processing food. Thus, these are some of the best signs of metabolic disorder in older dogs.


Watch for excessive urination. This might be problematic in older dogs, as many owners might dismiss this as a sign of old age. However, excessive urination is much different than your dog messing the house every couple of days. Be aware and be vigilant.
Look for increased appetite or thirst. The owners of overweight older dogs might dismiss this as usual behavior; however, they should not. To avoid this, have regular conversations with your vet about the amount of food your dog should be eating. In addition, monitor their eating habits closely.
Be wary of decreased appetite or thirst. Some owners might dismiss decreased appetite as “Sally is just getting old.” However, older dogs do not stop eating for no reason., A dog’s behavior can also tell you a lot about their general health and if they are suffering from a metabolic disorder. Ultimately, though, like with eating and bathroom habits, some owners may see changes in a dog’s behavior as owing to their advanced age. Certain symptoms, though, are important indications of metabolic problems. Watch for:


Nausea.
Muscular or general weakness.
Lethargy., Certain dog breeds are more prone to metabolic disorders than others. Thus, older dogs of certain breeds have high risks of developing life-threatening conditions.


Generally, mixed breed dogs have a lower risk of developing metabolic disorders.
German shepherds, boxers, spaniels, and certain types of terriers are prone to a variety of metabolic disorders.
Talk to your vet about conditions your dog may be prone to. The more you know, the earlier on, the easier it will be to diagnose certain conditions., You need to make sure to differentiate the symptoms of old age from symptoms of metabolic disorders. Without being able to tell the difference, you may ignore tell-tale signs of life-threatening conditions.


Older dogs usually lose energy over time.
Many older dogs may lose muscle mass and may appear more frail.
The signs of old age manifest gradually, over the course of years, rather than in a short period. "

You can use a notebook, computer, or take notes on your smartphone. Every week, write down your observations with regards to your senior dog’s mobility, appetite, eliminations, and any signs of pain. This journal will help you monitor and keep records of your dog’s medical history.If you notice a limp, you might write: “Since our walk on Saturday, I’ve noticed a slight limp. Sam seems to favor his right leg over his left leg. I’ve checked the paw but there are no obvious causes. I need to follow up with the veterinarian.”
If you notice a loss of appetite, you might write: “Sam ate half his usual portion on Monday. We’ll see what his appetite looks like tomorrow, but this is a worrying sign.”;
, Watch for behavioral changes in your older dog. Take detailed notes of any behavioral changes, since such changes can be signs of underlying medical conditions.


If your dog looks really exhausted, it may just be a result of a tiring walk. However, it may also be a sign of a serious illness such as heartworm, diabetes, hypoglycemia, heart disease, or other illnesses.If your dog starts to bark in unexpected situations, it could be a sign of anxiety or even a cognitive dysfunction syndrome.See your veterinarian if you see this behavior.
If your dog has difficulty getting up or gets picky about food, it could be a sign of pain. You should see your veterinarian to figure out what the problem may be.If your dog becomes withdrawn, it could be a sign of depression., Senior dogs sometimes suffer from immobility, such as trouble getting up the stairs or into the car. There are things you can do to address mobility issues, including dog stairs and ramps.However, such mobility issues may be a sign of an underlying condition so you should take detailed notes and tell your veterinarian.

, Keep detailed notes about any fluctuations in their appetite. If you see any difficulty eating, it could be a sign of pain and oral health issues.Take note of any changes in their appetite in your health journal.


If you witness a loss of appetite, it may be a result of stress or picky eating. However, it could also be a symptom of more serious conditions such as kidney failure, cancer, infection, or an oral disease.If you see vomiting, it could just be because they ate too quickly but, more seriously, it may be a sign of an infection, liver failure, kidney failure, parasites, gastric ulcers, or gastrointestinal illness.Pay attention to how much your dog drinks as well. Increasing thirst and needing to go toilet more often can be a sign of diabetes or kidney disease.

, If you dog is soiling inside the house, there may be an underlying health problem. Your senior dog may be unable to control elimination for some reason, so you should take detailed notes in your health journal. Communicate your observations to your veterinarian.If you see diarrhea, it may be because of food sensitivities or stress. However, it may also be a symptom of serious conditions such as gastrointestinal illnesses, bacterial or viral infection, amongst other possible causes., If your dog has trouble getting up, walking up the stairs, or getting into the car, they may be experiencing pain and associated joint inflammation. If you see them panting excessively, acting withdrawn, or grooming themselves rather excessively, these could also be signs of pain. Take notes of any behavioral changes that you think may be associated with pain and tell your veterinarian., Schedule your annual veterinarian check-up for your senior dog. It is important to get a physical exam for your dog at least once a year, although your veterinarian may recommend semi-annual check-ups depending on their health. By getting a regular check-up, you can be proactive about conditions that commonly impact older dogs such as the following:Chronic kidney disease.
Hypothyroidism.
Cancer.
Cognitive disorders.
Arthritis.
Organ failure.
Diabetes mellitus.

, Bring your health journal to the check-up and use it to tell your veterinarian about any observations you have noted with regards to your senior dog’s behavior, mobility, appetite, eliminations, or signs of pain. These notes will be invaluable for your veterinarian, since one of their key tools in evaluation is the dog’s medical history.You might say: “I’ve noticed a limp on his left side. I can’t see anything stuck to his paw, but he’s definitely been favoring his right side lately. What do you think this could be?”
If you have observed a loss of appetite, you might say: “In my journal, I’ve noted Sam ate half his usual portion for three days in a row at the beginning of last week. He ate fine for the next couple days, and then started eating less again. Do you think this is a sign of something?”

, During the physical exam, make sure your veterinarian does a complete examination of your senior dog’s mouth, teeth, gums, tongue, and throat. Although puppies have a hard time opening their mouths for the oral exam, it typically gets easier for adult dogs.Also, make sure the physical exam includes an examination of your senior dog’s inner pelvic area, colon, and, if your dog is male, the prostate.Tell your veterinarian: “I think we should do an oral exam this time. I’ve noticed Sam (insert dog’s name) has been eating less, so I’m worried about his teeth and gums.”
Ask your veterinarian: What do you think about Sam’s oral health?
Request a rectal exam: “I am worried about Sam’s prostate health, can you check it out?”

, By keeping a watchful eye on your dog’s vision, you can be proactive and avoid possible blindness in later life.Cataracts make your senior dog’s eyes opaque and cloudy. They can be associated with other diseases like diabetes. If your senior dog has cataracts, your veterinarian may need to perform surgery.
Glaucoma involves a fluid build-up and pressure in the eye. It is a very common disease for old dogs. If your senior dog has very red eyes, they may be experiencing glaucoma. If your dog has glaucoma, your veterinarian may need to administer drugs and perform surgery to save your dog’s eyes.

, They will look at the health of the fur and the skin, including in relation to hair loss and inflammation., Your veterinarian should check for signs of external parasites such as fleas or ticks as well as internal parasites in the gut. To do so, your veterinarian will have to check the fur and the stools. Make sure parasites are addressed as part of their physical exam.External parasites include ticks, lice, flies, and fleas.Internal parasites include roundworms, whipworms, tracheal worms, tapeworms, heartworms, salmon flukes, giardia, and coccidia., Vaccines help the immune system fight diseases.Older dogs have weaker immune systems, so it becomes very important to stay regular with all vaccinations. Make sure your veterinarian has completed all of the necessary vaccinations for your older dog.Ask your veterinarian if they have followed the guidelines of the American Animal Hospital Association's task force on vaccines, which recommends core vaccines alongside non-core vaccines that depend on risk exposure:Core vaccines include canine hepatitis, rabies, parvovirus, and distemper.
Non-core vaccines will sometimes be given, depending on risk analysis. These vaccines include those that fight against Borrelia burgdorferi, leptospira bacteria, and bordetella bronchiseptica.

, By getting screening tests done on your older dog, you can catch any potential illnesses in the early stages. Similar to screening tests in older humans, screening tests for geriatric dogs are designed to identify specific conditions in the early stages. Ask your veterinarian: “What screening tests might be appropriate at this point?”

, You should ask your veterinarian about the cost of screening tests, as well as the potential costs of treatment. Use the estimates they give you to budget for veterinarian care. Generally, screening tests costs in the range of $85 - $110. If an illness is identified in the screening process, there will be additional costs associated with treatment. If there is surgery or complicated treatment required, you could be spending well over a thousand dollars.So, you should budget for the screening and set aside some money for potential treatment costs.


You could also ask about costs: “How much would it cost to get all of the necessary screening tests?”
Inquire into treatment costs and options: “What will the costs of treatment look like, if the screening identifies one of these diseases?”

, A complete blood count test will analyse red blood count, white blood count, platelets, and morphology.This test will give your veterinarian an understanding of the number, size, and health of your senior dog’s blood cells. It helps to understand immune function and overall health in older dogs., Urinalysis involves an analysis of the chemical makeup of the sample. It allows for an understanding of any problems in the kidneys, which is common in older dogs. It also allows for analysis of the health of the urinary tract and screens for diseases like diabetes., By getting the biochemistry profile test, you will know about any possible metabolic diseases and see if your older dog’s organs are working properly., Your older dog’s thyroid should be tested in order to screen for hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland is responsible for maintaining a healthy metabolic rate. Many older dogs experience a disease called hypothyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid gland fails to make enough of a certain hormone. To test for this disease, you should get a thyroid test."
"
Stay calm.,
Protect yourself and your pet from infection.,
Decide whether the wound is immediately life threatening and needs emergency treatment.,
Assess whether the laceration needs veterinary treatment.,
Gather supplies.,
Protect yourself.,
Remove the fur around the wound.,
Clean the wound.,
Dry the wound.,
Monitor the laceration.,
Seek veterinary help, if needed.",How to Treat Lacerations on Dogs," Just like people, dogs can sense fear. If your dog becomes anxious or distressed, his blood pressure may rise and this can cause more blood to be expelled from a wound. Keep yourself and your pet calm.;
, After making your dog calm and comfortable, you should take the proper precautions to prevent infection to either you or your pet. Start by washing your hands thoroughly and donning gloves when available. Once gloved and clean, you can look at the dog's wound.


If your dog is bleeding profusely you may not have time to do this. Apply a pressure bandage to stem the flow of blood. Once the bleeding is under control and your dog is not in danger of bleeding out, get her to the vet immediately.

, If there's excessive bleeding, or the cut looks very deep or long, you should get your dog to a vet immediately. To help slow the bleeding on the way, apply a clean towel or cloth to the wound and apply gentle pressure.


If in doubt, take your dog to a veterinarian immediately. Blood loss is serious and can lead to illness or death. Don't risk your pet's life in order to avoid a veterinary bill.
If possible, contact a friend to drive you and your dog to the vet. You can apply direct pressure to the wound using pressure applied to a clean gauze swab while your friend transports you. This is especially important if the vet isn't near by — your dog may bleed out if you don't slow the bleeding first.

, Simple lacerations are those that don’t involve the full thickness of the skin, the deep tissues under the skin, and that don't involve an arterial blood supply.While there is not a concrete consensus on classification of lacerations, if it was discovered less than six hours after the injury and it isn’t heavily contaminated, the laceration can be treated at home. Lacerations that need the attention of the veterinarian include:Eyelid wounds.
Most bite wounds.
Footpad injuries deeper than just a superficial scraping of the pad.
Lacerations that will not stop bleeding or that are spurting blood (indicating damage to an artery).
Large lacerations.
Deep penetrating wounds.
Lacerations that involve muscle, tendons, or ligaments.
Wounds that are heavily contaminated with mud, dirt, debris, manure.
Painful lacerations: even if it looks like a simple laceration, sometimes there is damage underneath the skin that may need the attention of a veterinarian.

, You will need some medical supplies to treat your dog's wound. Items needed include:Warm water: placing a small dog in a sink or a large dog in the bathtub works great for this, plus it makes cleanup easy.
Scissors or clippers (do not use electric clippers around water though).
Clean, dry towels.
Antiseptic cleaner.
Optional supplies: Triple antibiotic ointment, water-based lubricant (for protecting the wound from hair while clipping), and a muzzle (if your dog bites).

, Put on gloves to protect your hands. Also, if you think your dog may bite you, put a muzzle on him.


If you don’t own one, a simple one can be made by using a three foot length of gauze. Make a loop near the center. Place the loop over the muzzle and around the mouth. Tighten the loop and loop the two free ends behind the ears and tie in a snug bow tie.

, Place the dog in the bathtub or sink without running any water. Use a towel or bath mat on the sink or bath bottom to provide secure footing if needed. You may want to have a second person hold your dog steady while you work at carefully clipping the hair away from the wound edges. Remove an inch of hair around the wound.


You can place the lubricant in the wound prior to doing so to keep the hair out of the wound. It will wash away when you wash the wound.
The hair is clipped away to allow the wound to be seen easily, to keep hair from covering the wound, and to help when you need to wash away any drainage.

, After you are finished removing the surrounding fur, set the scissors or clippers aside and run the water until it is warm to the touch. Hot water or cold water will be painful, so avoid these temperature extremes. Run water over the wound for two to three minutes to remove any visible and invisible contaminants, and then gently wash with antiseptic for a minute. Too strong antiseptic can be damaging to tissue, so always following the directions on the label for the correct dilution


Rinse again for two to three minutes and then turn the water off.

, Blot the wound and surrounding skin dry. Be sure to use a clean towel, so that the wound does not get infected.


Generally the wound will be left open to heal, as it is hard to get bandages to adhere to the dog’s skin and they tend to chew them off.
You can place a thin layer of the antibiotic ointment on the wound, but dogs are likely to lick this off unless you keep a constant careful eye on them.

, With timely and proper wound care most simple lacerations will heal just fine. Look at the wound every couple of hours the first day, and then check it four to five times a day for the next couple of days. Look for any sign of infection, which include:Redness to the surrounding skin.
Failure to heal.
Swelling or puffy appearance to skin and wound.
Drainage beyond day one.
Pain.

, If in doubt, please seek veterinary help. Your pet may require antibiotics for any infection, or possibly stitches to close the wound.

Pay attention to unusually bad breath.,
Look for signs that your dog is having oral pain.,
Assess your dog's oral health.,
Have the dog's teeth assessed by a veterinarian.,
Get your dog a professional dental cleaning.,
Have teeth extracted.,
Approve surgical treatment.,
Be aware of risk factors.,
Start dental hygiene practices early.,
Clean your dog's teeth regularly.,
Give your dog dental chews or dental diets.,
Have your dog's teeth professionally cleaned.",How to Diagnose Dental Disease in Dogs," If your dog's breath is worse than usual, it could be a sign that your dog has dental disease. With dental disease, bacteria and infected tissue can exude a putrid smell once it has developed quite a bit.Dogs can have bad breath for a wide variety of reasons. The key is to identify when the smell changes or becomes markedly worse.;
, If your dog is pawing at its mouth or jaw, that is a sign that it may have a dental infection. If it is having a hard time eating, that may also be a sign that there is a problem in its mouth. These are behavioral clues that you need to do some investigation in your dog's mouth.Do not let your dog suffer by ignoring signs it is in pain. If a dog is showing its pain outwardly, it usually means that the dog is in pretty bad pain. Most dogs are good at hiding pain, so when you can actually see that it is in pain, that means it is serious., Look in the dog's mouth for signs of inflammation and infection. This can include red and puffy gums or discolored teeth. It can also include pus or discharge coming from the gums.If you see any problems in your dog's mouth, then you should take the dog to a veterinarian for evaluation.

, Call your veterinarian and make an appointment to get your dog's teeth looked at. At the appointment your veterinarian is likely to first ask you a variety of questions about your dog's symptoms and when they began. He or she will then proceed to look at your dog's teeth and assess their condition.


Many dogs are resistant to letting a stranger, or even their owners, look in their mouths. Because of this, your veterinarian may need to give your dog a sedative or have you help restrain the dog while they look in its mouth.

, If your veterinarian thinks that there may be a problem with your dog's teeth, then they will probably suggest a dental cleaning exam that will allow them to get a better look at the dental problems. A professional dental cleaning includes a thorough examination and x-rays of the teeth and jaw. This will allow the veterinary dentist to understand the extent of the disease and how best he or she should proceed with treatment.Your dog will need to be put under anesthesia to have their teeth completely assessed and cleaned.
If the dental disease is mild, treatment will only require the removal of buildup and polishing of the teeth.Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary dentist if he or she thinks the condition needs a specialist for treatment.

, In some cases of periodontal disease, the tooth cannot be saved and the best treatment is to have the diseased tooth taken out. In cases where the infection is just in the tooth, and not down in the jaw, this will eliminate the infection.Tooth extraction requires that your dog be put under anesthesia.

, If the dental disease is so advanced that the infection is in the dog's jaw, then removal of the teeth may not be enough to eliminate the infection. If the infection goes into the jaw, a veterinary surgeon will need to go down into the jaw to remove diseased tissue and debris.If the tooth can be saved, then the surgeon will do a process called ""open root planing"" in order to get down into the infected area without removing the tooth.

, There are some risk factors that may increase the chance of your dog getting dental disease. These include:Age: Older dogs are more likely to get dental disease.
Chewing habits: Eating soft food instead of hard kibble can increase the chance of gingivitis build up
Tooth alignment: Small breeds and short-muzzled breeds often have teeth that are tightly together, promoting food and bacteria to stay in the teeth.

, The earlier in life you start cleaning your dog's teeth, the more your dog will be used to it and the healthier its teeth will be. Even a puppy that has baby teeth can have its teeth cleaned, if only to get it used to the process.Start the process by getting your puppy used to having your hands near it mouth.

, Dental disease is entirely preventable if you clean your dog's teeth regularly. Take the time to brush your dog's teeth so that your dog does not have to go through the pain and discomfort of dental disease.It is recommended that you brush your dog's teeth daily.However, any amount that you can do to help to eliminate plaque and gingivitis is better than nothing.

, If you are concerned about dental disease, or your dog has a history of dental disease, then you may want to consider feeding it a diet that is specially formulated to help with dental health. You can also give special treats that are chews that help clean the teeth.While neither of these options should be used as your dog's only dental care, they have been shown to benefit a dog's dental health.

, If you are unable to clean your dog's teeth regularly, perhaps due to your dog's resistance to the process, then you should get its teeth professionally cleaned. Have your dog's teeth assessed when it gets veterinary treatment or a check up and discuss whether and when teeth cleaning should occur.Your veterinarian should be able to do this process or can refer you to a veterinary dentist who specializes in this kind of treatment.

Make an appointment with your vet.,
See a specialist.,
Test for specific disorders.,
Get treatment.",How to Diagnose Metabolic Disease in Older Dogs2," Your first step is to consult your vet and have them examine your dog and run basic diagnostics. By examining your dog, your vet will be able to rule out a variety of conditions and better narrow down potential problems.


Allow your vet to physically examine your dog.
Tell your vet about any symptoms you’ve observed. Symptoms might include increased urination and increased thirst.
Have your vet do first-step diagnostics. Such diagnostics include blood work, a urinalysis, and possibly a fecal test., If your vet suspects a metabolic disorder, they may refer you to a veterinary specialist or a specialty group. Veterinary specialists often have more training and experience dealing with diseases and disorders that are somewhat uncommon.


Not all vets will refer you to a specialist. Your vet may feel comfortable treating your dog. However, you should request a referral if you feel your vet may not have the experience or ability needed to treat your dog.
Most major metropolitan areas have veterinary specialty groups that may be able to help you.
Depending on your region, your vet may refer you to a veterinary school at a major university. Depending on the school, it will likely have a specialist who focuses on canine metabolic disorders., After meeting with your vet or a specialist, they might recommend advanced diagnostic tests to gather more information about your dog’s medical problem. This testing will help pinpoint whether your dog has a metabolic disorder and what type of disorder it may be. They may recommend:


Imaging tests. Your vet or a specialist may recommend imaging testing on your dog. Imaging will allow the vet to see potential growths on organs like the kidney or liver.
an A1C test. Your vet will run this if they suspect your dog has diabetes. It measures the long-term blood sugar levels in your dog.
an ACTH stimulation test. Your vet will run this test if they suspect your dog has Cushing’s disorder. It measures the cortisol levels in a dog’s blood., Depending on the type of metabolic disorder, your vet will recommend a course of treatment for your dog.


Your vet might treat diabetes with insulin injections and a specific diet.
Your vet might treat liver disease with medication and a special diet.
Your vet might treat kidney disease with fluid therapy and possibly antibiotics.
Your vet might treat pancreatic disease with fluid therapy and a special diet."

Loss of appetite.
Weight loss.
Confusion.
Signs of weakness.
Jaundiced eyes, tongue, or gums., Kidney disease is one of the more common metabolic disorders that afflict older dogs. About one in ten dogs will be struck by kidney diseases during their life. The symptoms of kidney disease include:


Loss of appetite.
Vomiting.
Weight loss.
Weakness.
Inability to hold their urine., Diabetes is a condition in which a dog's body has a shortage of insulin or is unable to process insulin that is produced. Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic disorders in dogs. Signs of diabetes include:


Increased urination.
Hunger.
Weight loss.
Thirst., There are a wide variety of metabolic disorders that may strike older dogs. Some less common diseases include:


Addison’s disease. Dogs with Addison’s disease do not have enough cortisol or steroid in their body.
Cushing’s disease. Dogs with Cushing’s have an excess amount of cortisol or steroid in their body.
Pancreatic disease."

Monitor your dog’s breath.,
Check for any buildup on the teeth.,
Watch for mouth pain.,
Look for a swollen jaw.,
Monitor for any sinus problems.",How to Check for Signs of Dental Disease in Dogs1," One of the most common signs of dental disease in dogs is bad breath or “doggy breath.” Your dog should not have bad breath. Bad breath can mean an infection of the gums or teeth. Bacteria from tartar build up can also cause an odor.If your dog has a healthy mouth, their breath will not smell.;
, Any kind of substance buildup on your dog’s teeth is not normal. Look along the gum line for any kind of hard buildup. If the teeth has yellow-brownish crust along the gums, your dog has tartar.If there is a thick dark brownish crust near the gums, your dog’s teeth has calculus, which is a concrete hard substance., Dental disease can lead to mouth pain. Your dog may start whining or making other noises of pain or discomfort. This may occur when the dog is eating or when someone touches their mouth.The dental disease may lead to a decreased appetite. This may be due to the food being too difficult or painful to eat. This may lead to weight loss.
Check for loose or missing teeth.

, A swollen jaw may be easily seen by looking at your dog’s face. A swollen jaw may mean that there is an infection in the gums or around a tooth root. If the jaw is swollen, there may be a lump around the eye socket or around the neck.Abscesses that cause swollen jaws can get so bad that they break through the skin and leak pus onto the fur.

, If the gums or teeth become infected in the upper jaw, this can cause problems for the dog’s sinuses. When the tooth root abscesses or gets infected, it may create a pus pocket and that infection can get into the sinuses and nasal cavities.If this occurs, your dog may start sneezing or have a runny nose.

Buy a hard rubber ball or Kong toy.,
Let your dog play with the ball or toy.,
Check your dog’s teeth alignment.",How to Adjust Abnormally Positioned Canine Teeth1," The canine teeth (long, curved teeth by the incisors) are commonly misaligned in dogs. If your dog's teeth are only mildly misaligned, a hard rubber ball or rubber chew toy (Kong toy) may be all that’s needed to correct the misalignment.Kong toys and balls are available at most pet shops and online. However, since there are so many options, talk to your vet about which option would be best for your dog.


Choose a toy size that is appropriate for your dog’s size.;
, The rubber ball or toy will be most effective when your dog plays with it for at least 15 minutes, three times a day.To encourage your dog to play with the ball or toy, give it to your dog as a special treat for good behavior. You could also put some tasty treats in the Kong toy and use it as a food puzzle.


It’s perfectly fine for your dog to play with the toy for more than 45 minutes a day. The longer your dog plays with the toy, the more likely the toy will correct the teeth alignment issues.

, After your dog has had a week or two of playing with the ball or toy, look at your dog’s teeth. If you do not notice any improvements in the teeth alignment, you may need to consider other treatment options. Contact your vet to discuss these options.


Consider taking a picture of your dog’s teeth before your dog starts playing with the hard rubber toy. Then, take another picture a week or two later. Compare the two pictures to determine if there’s been any improvement in teeth alignment.

Observe changes in the dog’s eating or bathroom habits.,
Meet with your vet.,
Talk to a specialist.,
Have advanced tests run.,
Inform yourself about conditions that impact older dogs.,
Take your dog to the vet twice a year.,
Know about different types of liver disease.",How to Diagnose Liver Disease in Older Dogs," Changes in your dog’s physical appearance can give you a lot of information about chronic conditions like liver disease. However, identifying changes in an older dog’s physical appearance is challenging as you may confuse them with natural changes due to old age.


Look for decreased weight.
See if the dog has yellowing of gums, tongue, and eyes.
Observe to see if the dog has a bloated belly.
Any noticeable change in your dog's appearance over the course of several months could be indicative of liver disease or another serious illness.
Evidence of changes in a dog’s physical appearance should be assessed with other symptoms to help come to a proper diagnosis.
If you suspect your dog may be ill, keep a daily journal in which you record observations of the dog's appearance and behavior.;
, Identifying behavior changes is problematic, as changes in a dog’s behavior can also be dismissed as the natural outcome of old age. As a result, you should focus on several symptoms that, when combined with other signs, may indicate liver disease in older dogs.


Weakness is a common symptom of liver disease in old dogs. This symptom is complicated as older dogs also lose strength and have less energy than they once did.
Lethargy may be an indication of liver disease.
Confusion, while possibly indicating other problems, is a relatively common symptom of liver disease., Changes in the way your dog eats or goes to the bathroom may be signs of liver disease. But like other symptoms, these signs are often dismissed as signs of old age. Look for:


Loss of appetite.
Increased thirst.
Frequent urination.
Blood in urine or fecal matter.
Diarrhea., The first thing you need to do after observing symptoms that could indicate liver disease in older dogs is to make an appointment with your vet. Your vet will take into account the symptoms you observed, examine your dog, and run basic diagnostic tests.


The doctor will conduct a thorough examination of the dog, looking at their coat, abdomen, gums, and more.
The vet will run basic blood work.
They may also conduct a urinalysis and run a fecal test. , After talking with your vet, they may refer you to a specialist. Veterinary specialists often have more education and experience with uncommon conditions like liver disease. Thus, they may be your best bet if you are concerned about your dog’s health.


Some vets may have substantial experience treating certain liver conditions and may not refer you to a specialist.
Most metropolitan areas have veterinary specialists that are trained and experienced with treating liver disease in older dogs.
Your vet might also refer you to the veterinary school of a local college or university. Very often, these institutions will have specialists who are active in the field any may be participating in studies focused on liver disease or on issues associated with older dogs., After seeing your vet or specialist, they may recommend running advanced diagnostic tests. These tests will focus on gathering more information about your pet’s condition and will ultimately help the vet or specialist arrive at a diagnosis for your dog. Some tests they may recommend include:


X-rays, ultrasounds, or an MRI.
Advanced blood tests that measure liver enzyme levels, blood proteins, or ammonia levels.
Biopsy of the liver., Central in diagnosing liver disease is being able to differentiate its symptoms from common symptoms and conditions that impact older dogs. By learning about the canine aging process, you’ll be better prepared to understand and deal with liver disease.


Older dogs lose energy and are less vibrant than they once were.
Many older dogs will become frail and lose muscle mass.
Some older dogs may become incontinent and/or lose appetite.
These changes usually occur in aging dogs over many years, not over a period of months., Regular visits are important as they establish benchmarks for your pet’s health. As a result, any changes in your dog’s appearance or behavior will be much more evident than if they do not have regular checkups.


Your vet will run a special blood panel for older dogs. Bloodwork may be able to catch liver disease in its early stages.
Older dogs should visit the vet at least twice a year. By visiting the vet twice a year, you may be able to catch liver disease in its early stages, potentially increasing the life of your dog., There are an array of liver diseases that can impact older dogs. Common types of liver disease include:


Liver cancer or tumorous growths on the liver.
Cirrhosis.
Canine Hepatitis.
Chronic liver disease caused by the consumption of toxic food or plants."

Know which breeds are more susceptible to the condition.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Have the doctor rule out uveodermatological syndrome.,
Understand it isn't usually a health threat.,
Learn about the treatments.",How to Diagnose Vitiligo in Dogs," Often, vitiligo will present in the dog's nose, causing it to go white. If you notice a change in the color of your dog's nose, that could indicate that your dog has vitiligo.Vitiligo is an immune disease that affects the pigmentation, meaning it turns areas of your dog's coat, skin, and nose white instead of their standard color.
However, some dogs do have noses that change colors in winter and summer, particularly as they become middle aged. Either way, talk to your vet to be sure if you notice your dog's nose changing color.;
, Another indication your dog has this condition is white patches across its body. While vitiligo often presents in the nose, it can spread throughout the body. Basically, the fur and skin will turn white, rather than its normal color.Often, the condition will affect the face before the body, particularly around the eyes., Often, this condition will appear as your puppy turns into an adult dog. It may not present at all when your dog is young, so pay attention as your dog grows up, looking for the symptoms in it's fur and face.This condition rarely goes away completely, as it is hereditary and usually stays for life. However, you may notice that certain patches return to their normal color, as your dog develops patches in other places., Inflammation in the eyes can indicate that your dog has an underlying condition called uveodermatological syndrome. This condition can harm your dog's eyes, so it's especially important to take your dog to the vet if you notice problems with its eyes., Because the condition is hereditary, certain breeds are more likely to have vitiligo. In particular, Afghan hounds, Dachshunds, dobermans, German shepherds, Irish setters, pointers, poodles, and Samoyeds are more likely to have this condition., If your suspect your dog has this disease, you should take it to the vet because the color changes could indicate other conditions instead. Your vet will perform a physical examination, as well as do a simple biopsy on your dog to determine if it has the condition.Usually, all the doctor will do is scrape a bit of skin to be tested. The vet will use the skin to also rule out other causes.
For instance, some dogs can have their noses change color if they haven't felt well. Also, sometimes trauma to the nose can cause the problem.

, While vitiligo is usually from an inherited condition, it can develop from uveodermatological syndrome. With this syndrome, your dog's immune system basically fights against the pigmentation cells. The main issue with this disease is that it can also affect the eyes, leading to blindness.If your dog has this condition, you'll usually notice redness and inflammation in the eyes.

, While the condition changes the look of your dog, it doesn't actually affect the dog's health. Therefore, try not to worry if your vet has diagnosed your dog with this condition. It should still live a long and healthy life.However, if the underlying condition is uveodermatological syndrome, you should get that treated, as it can lead to blindness., If your dog has basic vitiligo, you usually do not have any options for treatments, though some people have had luck giving their dogs nutritional supplements,such as a vitamin E supplement. Talk to your vet about natural supplements.For uveodermatological syndrome, your dog will need both immunosuppressive drugs and topical eye treatments to deal with the eye problems."

Smell your dog's breath.,
Check for red gums.,
Look for tartar.,
See if there are any wobbly or missing teeth.,
Check for pus.,
Pay attention to signs of pain.",How to Diagnose Canine Periodontal Disease1," Along with other symptoms, a dog who has periodontal disease may have bad breath because of the bacteria in his mouth. In some cases, bad breath may be the only noticeable symptom of periodontal disease.Smell your dog's breath to see if it smells foul or fresh. If your dog has noticeable bad breath, then take him to your veterinarian for an oral exam.;
, Gums that are red and inflamed are often a sign of mild periodontal disease in dogs. Red, inflamed gums are also known as gingivitis, which is a gum disease.In gingivitis, gums may also look raw or bleed when your dog eats. Sometimes gums will also have pulled away from the teeth.

, Tartar often present in dogs with periodontal disease. Tartar is a hard build-up on teeth that looks brownish, yellowish, or cream-colored. Dogs with periodontal disease may have tartar along the gum line or in between the teeth as well.


In severe cases, you may notice a solid block of tartar that goes across several of your dog’s teeth., Your dog’s teeth should be solid and there should not be any loose or wobbly teeth. Wobbly teeth indicate that there may be damage to the supporting bone and/or to the root of the teeth, which is common in late stage periodontal disease.Your dog may also lose teeth if the periodontal disease progresses. Make sure that you check for missing teeth and report this to your dog’s veterinarian as well., In advanced periodontal disease, you may also notice pus coming out of the spaces between your dog's teeth and gums.Pus may look yellowish or whitish and have a bad smell.


If you see any kind of discharge coming from one of your dog’s teeth, then seek veterinary attention for your dog right away.

, If your dog stops eating or seems to be having trouble chewing his food, then he may be in pain from the periodontal disease. Watch your dog when he eats to see if his face seems twisted in pain or if he is favoring one side of his mouth over another.These signs may indicate that chewing is painful for your dog.


In severe cases, your dog may stop eating altogether and this can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.

Understand the structure and organization of your dog's teeth.,
Understand how your dog's teeth grow in.,
Understand how and why dog teeth wear down and decay.,
Evaluate a puppy's age by assessing its tooth growth.,
Evaluate the condition of your adult dog's teeth to estimate its age.,
Consult your vet if you would like a more accurate estimation of your dog's age.",How to Determine Your Dog's Age By Its Teeth," All dogs have four basic types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. These are found on the upper and low jaws, on both the left and right sides.


The incisors are the small teeth running along the front of the mouth. Adult dogs have six incisors on the top and six on the bottom jaw. The two side incisors (next to the canine teeth) are a bit bigger than the middle incisors; on the top these also tend to stick out to the side a bit more.
The canine teeth are located behind the incisors, one on each side for a total of four. These are the large, pointed teeth.
Premolars come in behind the canines. There are four premolars both on the upper and lower jaw. The fourth premolar on the top is very large.
Finally behind the premolars are the molars. On the top of your dog's mouth there are two molars. On the bottom jaw there are three molars. The first one is larger than the other two.;
, Puppies generally have around 28 teeth. For the first two to four weeks, there are no noticeable teeth. Baby canines start coming in after three to four weeks. Baby incisors and premolars start after four to six weeks. By eight weeks, all baby teeth are grown in. For the next three months, there will be no noticeable changes.


After five months, permanent teeth will start coming in, usually canines and molars first. By seven months, all permanent teeth will have grown in. If your puppy has all of its permanent teeth, then it is most likely more that 7 months old. Adult dogs will have around 42 teeth.
After the puppy stage, age is marked by tooth wear. At one year, teeth are white and clean. By the end of the second year, the white will have dulled and tartar will begin building up. This will cause yellowing on the back teeth. After three to five years the yellowing will increase and be visible on all teeth. There will be noticeable tooth wear.

, Tooth wear is a natural occurrence, but it can be accelerated by certain habits such as aggressively chewing on hard objects (bones, rocks, sticks) or in small dog’s without good dental care. On the other hand, some chewing is great for a dog’s dental health. Rawhides or “dental” chews can help dogs break down plaque and material on the teeth.


Also understand how disease manifests. By age three, nearly 80% of dogs will exhibit signs of gum disease. This can be seen in the buildup of yellow and brown tartar, inflamed gums, and bad breath. Gum disease is more prevalent in small dog breeds.
Food also plays a role in dog dental health. Dry food in strong chewers can help remove some plaque from the teeth slowing tooth decay and loss. There are specially formulated foods specifically for dental health. Your veterinarian can advise you on the proper diet for your dog if you are worried about its teeth. Water additives can also be used to combat teeth destroying and aging bacteria.
Worn teeth can look fractured, though regular wear poses little health risk. Excessive wear can damage the root of the tooth, which can require a root canal.

, Teeth grow fast at the early puppy stage. Because the change is so rapid, this is the most accurate time to be able to tell a dog's age. Count the type and position of your puppy's teeth to estimate their age.


Newborn puppies are born without their teeth erupted from the gums. At certain intervals teeth will erupt. The first baby teeth to appear will generally be the canine teeth at 3-4 weeks of age. At 4-5 weeks of age the two middle incisors erupt. At 4-6 weeks the first two molars erupt. At 5-6 weeks the third incisors erupt. And at 6-8 weeks of age the third molar erupts. The premolars do not appear until much later.
At eight weeks and older puppies will have 28 baby teeth. At around 4 months of age the puppy will begin to lose its baby teeth as the adult teeth will erupt. Most times, puppies swallow these teeth but occasionally the owner will find a shed baby tooth or see the gum line is bleeding where a tooth has erupted. Just as with baby humans, puppies at this stage will love to chew on things!
At 4-5 months the adult incisors, first premolar, and first molar will erupt. At 5-6 months the adult canine, premolars 2-4, and second molars erupt. Finally, at 6-7 months the adult third molar will erupt. All together there will be 42 adult teeth.

, In the first two years of adult life, the teeth are generally white with very little wear. By the end of the second year the white will have dulled and tartar will begin building up. This will cause yellowing on the back teeth. Eventually wear and tear and accumulation of plaque and bacteria will begin to age the teeth. This is how we estimate an adult dog’s age.


By age three, most dogs will have some signs of tooth disease: accumulation of yellow and brown tartar, reddened gums, bad breath. Of course, dogs with owners who brush their teeth daily and who take their dog to the dog dentist regularly will not have these signs of wear and tear and disease.
After three to five years the yellowing will increase and be visible on all teeth. There will be noticeable tooth wear. As the dog ages, teeth will continue to show increase wear. The gums may recede from the teeth leaving roots exposed which may lead to tooth loss. The teeth staining will become more pronounced turning the yellow to brown color.
From 5 to 10 years, teeth will continue to show increased wear. Signs of disease will likely appear. By 10 to 15 years, some teeth may be missing and decay will be widespread.

, All told, it can be difficult to determine a dog’s age by merely looking at it’s teeth. Food, habits, dental care (or lack of it) can all play a role in hastening or slowing teeth wear in all dogs.

Look for any change to the gum lines.,
Check for black spots along the gum line.,
Look for red gums.",How to Check for Signs of Dental Disease in Dogs2," If there is dental disease, the gum lines will change. The gum line should not be a straight line, but a wave-like edge where the gum meets the tooth. If the gum line is straight, there is some kind of dental disease present.Each tooth should have a bulge where the tooth and gums meet.

, Black spots along the gum line point to dental disease. These black spots allow exposed roots and tooth parts to be vulnerable to plaque and tartar, which can lead to tooth loss.Gum loss can cause exposed areas that can eventually lead to serious periodontal disease.

, Dental disease can be detected by looking at the state of the gums. Your dog’s gums should be pink and healthy looking. If they have gum disease, the gums may be red or swollen.


Red, swollen gums may mean that your dog has gingivitis.
If your dog’s gums start bleeding, they may have periodontal disease.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Think about your dog’s age, health, and dental habits.,
Prevent problems through healthy habits.",How to Check for Signs of Dental Disease in Dogs3," Some signs of dental disease are not visible to the eye. You should take your dog to get oral checkups by the vet. This should occur at least every six to nine months. Your vet can do an examination, and if they suspect serious problems, they can do dental X-rays to look for bone decay or problems under the gums.While at the vet, your dog can get their teeth cleaned to help prevent or reduce the chances of any problems.

, The state of your dog may determine whether or not they have dental disease. Dental disease is more common in older dogs than younger ones. The breed of your dog may also make the dog more prone to dental diseases. Smaller breeds like dachshunds, or brachycephalic breeds, like bulldogs or pugs, are more likely to develop dental disease.If you don’t brush your dog’s teeth regularly, your dog has a higher likelihood of dental disease. Dogs who don’t chew a lot are less likely to remove tartar and plaque.

, Taking care of your dog's teeth can help reduce the risk of dental disease. Regular oral check ups at the vet and brushing the dog's teeth are two ways to help prevent disease. You can also use dental chews and other chew toys to help keep your dog's teeth healthy.


Some people think feeding your dog kibble instead of soft food can help protect their teeth.
You may also want to try oral rinses or gels to help clean and strengthen teeth.

Talk to your vet about orthodontic devices.,
Allow your vet to make an inclined plane for your dog.,
Keep the inclined plane clean.,
Let your vet remove the inclined plane.,
Use the inclined plane as a retainer.",How to Adjust Abnormally Positioned Canine Teeth2," Your vet may recommend putting a device to put in your dog’s mouth to realign the abnormally positioned teeth. A popular orthodontic device for dogs is the inclined plane, also known as a bite plate. It is commonly recommended when the lower canine teeth point straight up into the mouth, rather than being angled slightly outward (‘base narrow canine teeth’).Vets recommend placing an inclined plate in a dog’s mouth between 7 and 9 months of age. It fits over a dog’s upper teeth and works by directing the lower canines into their proper positions., Your vet will anesthetize your dog to make the acrylic composite (basic shape) of your dog’s upper teeth to make the inclined plane. They will clean the teeth first to make sure the composite is accurate.Your vet may make what’s called a telescoping inclined plane so it does not stop your dog’s jaw from growing., Just like human bite plates, canine inclined planes need to be kept clean. Your vet may recommend sedating or anesthetizing your dog to clean its inclined plane. If necessary, your vet will make adjustments to the inclined plane, since your dog could have dislodged it when biting down on something hard.If you regularly brush your dog’s teeth, it may be a little more challenging to do so with the inclined plane. Talk to your vet about how to brush your dog’s teeth while the inclined plane is in place.

, The inclined plane will not stay in your dog’s mouth throughout your dog’s life. Your vet will remove the inclined plane when your dog’s teeth are in proper alignment., Once your dog’s teeth are properly aligned, the inclined plane could be used as a retainer for several months to maintain the proper alignment.Talk to your vet about this option.

Talk with your vet about crown reduction.,
Have your vet perform crown reduction.,
Get dental radiographs.",How to Adjust Abnormally Positioned Canine Teeth3," The crown is the visible part of a tooth. Damage to crowns on the canine teeth can be painful and possibly damage the roof of the mouth.Crown reduction is useful for different types of malocclusion, such as base narrow canine teeth., Crown reduction is a surgical procedure. Your vet will remove a section of the crown. This will expose the pulp, the sensitive material inside the tooth. Your vet will remove some of this pulp and apply some medication to the remaining pulp to promote healing and prevent infection. Finally, your vet will cover the pulp with a protective barrier (like filling a human cavity).If your dog’s lower canine teeth are misaligned, your vet will remove enough of the crown so the teeth no longer touch the roof of your dog’s mouth.Removing some of the exposed pulp and applying the medication and protective barrier is called vital pulp therapy., About 6–9 months after the crown reduction and vital pulp therapy, your vet will want to take dental radiographs. This is because vital pulp therapy is not always successful. The dental radiographs will help your vet determine whether the entire procedure was successful.If the vital pulp therapy was not successful, your vet may need to perform the procedure again.

Take your dog to the veterinarian for an oral exam.,
Request X-rays.,
Ask about treatment options.,
Follow up with home dental care for your dog.",How to Diagnose Canine Periodontal Disease2," To diagnose periodontal disease, a veterinarian will examine your dog’s teeth and measure the gingival pockets (spaces between the gums and teeth) using a dental probe. A dental probe is a fine metal probe marked in millimeters that can show whether the gingival pockets are normal or too deep.If the gingival pockets are more than two millimeters deep, then your dog's veterinarian may make a diagnosis of periodontal disease., Since much of the damage caused by periodontal disease may be beneath the gum line, your dog's veterinarian may x-ray your dog’s mouth to help make a diagnosis of periodontal disease. X-rays will reveal whether the alveolar bone (bone connected to the teeth) is healthy, or if it has become soft and brittle., Treatment options will depend on the severity of your dog’s periodontal disease. In some cases, your dog’s veterinarian will recommend cleaning your dog’s teeth while your dog is under sedation, but other cases may require tooth extraction (pulling out teeth).


Keep in mind that multiple professional cleanings may be necessary to save your dog’s teeth.Talk to your dog’s veterinarian about the best course of treatment for your dog.

, After your dog has been treated for his periodontal disease, you will need to provide good dental care for your dog at home. This will include daily tooth brushing with a special dog toothbrush and dog-friendly toothpaste.


Never use human toothpaste on your dog because it can make him sick."

Pay attention to which parts of your dog's body are itchy.,
Look for hot spots on your dog’s skin.,
Consider the timing.,
Check on your dog’s overall health.,
Take notes when you notice the itching.",How to Diagnose and Treat Your Dog's Itchy Skin Problems1," Is there a certain area on the body that is itchier than others? Does your pet lick his feet, under his tail or along his belly?


The most common areas of irritation for allergic dogs are around the back and tail, the abdomen, and the legs and paws.;
, It can be common that your dog’s itching is so severe that he chews his skin to the point of creating a “hot spot”. This skin lesion can develop overnight and can get very large very quickly. The skin is pink, moist, hot and painful. You may even see sticky material oozing from the wound created. These are infected open wounds and need veterinary intervention to give your pet relief.


Chronic cases of itching might result in the thickening and roughening of the skin so that it looks like elephant hide.
Hot spots are often the symptom of allergies to fleas, foods, grass, mold or other environmental substances. There may be more complicated underlying conditions such as low thyroid (hypothyroidism) levels or Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism). Secondary bacterial and yeast (malassezia) infections are not uncommon and will require specially tailored treatment., There might be a particular time of year that your dog is itchier. Perhaps he is itchy after being on the lawn or after eating a certain food. By noticing patterns, you will help to narrow the focus of your pet’s treatment to help with the itching., If your dog has a really strong body odor, seems excessively thirsty or does not seem as lively as usual, you should take your pet to the veterinarian. Your veterinarian will need to do blood tests and evaluate swabs from the skin surface to get more information to help define appropriate treatment.

, Whenever you notice your dog itching, write down the circumstances, including where your dog has been, what he’s been eating and what part of his body is itchy. This will be extremely useful for your veterinarian, who will rely on this information to narrow down the possible causes for your pet’s itching and skin lesions.

Watch for itching, signs of irritation, or nipping at parts of the body.,
Look closely at your dog's skin.,
Look for bald patches where the hair has been shed.,
Watch any affected areas for a few days.,
Watch the growth of any inflammation.",How to Check a Dog for Ringworm1," These are often the first symptoms of ringworm. Above all, these symptoms certainly provide a good indication that you need to inspect the dog more closely.;
, If you suspect your dog has a skin infection, you must begin by inspecting all areas that you suspect are affected. Part the dog's fur so you can see the skin clearly. Focus your attention on any areas that the dog was itching, as well as on commonly infected regions, such as the head, ears, and forelegs.


To reduce the risk of spreading the possible infection, you also need to wash your hands after handling any animal you suspect has ringworm. , This can commonly occur on the head, ears, paws, and forearms.Are these patches circular? Do they have an bright red rim? If the answer to these two questions is yes, then the likelihood of ringworm increases., If you see areas that appear to be infected or irritated keep an eye on them. You may be unsure if ringworm is the culprit immediately, so continue to observe the situation and see how the dog's condition develops.


It can be wise to isolate the dog whilst you make up your mind. Keep him or her away from other pets and in one room with minimal soft furnishings. This will allow you to more easily vacuum the room and reduce the risk of contamination. If it turns out the dog does have ringworm, then restricting his access to other pets makes a big difference to reducing the spread and risk of infection to others.
Be on the lookout for anything resembling insect bights or a more generalized rash that does not develop a circular shape. These would be indications of an alternative diagnosis--such as an allergic reaction--that would require a very different course of treatment. Ringworm infections are often the result of weakened immune systems, while generalized rashes can be caused in part by over-active immune systems.

, If the lesions become bigger and more inflamed while maintaining a circular shape, it is likely to be ringworm. You will need to get your pet checked out by a vet and obtain anti-fungal medication to treat the condition.

Treat your dog for fleas.,
Make sure your house is flea-free.",How to Help an Itching Dog1," If you see your dog scratching constantly, check its skin for dark brown or black specks. If you are not certain if your dog has fleas, comb it gently with a fine tooth comb, getting very close to the skin. Tap the comb onto a white piece of paper and look for fleas., If you suspect that your dog has fleas, bring it to the vet right away. Let the vet examine it to determine the extent of the infestation, and ask for advice on the best way to treat the fleas. Inquire about topical treatments and medications, and whether they will be harmful to you dog's already itchy skin., Follow your veterinarian's advice with regard to flea treatments. Ask about the most common methods for killing fleas on dogs, which include flea powders, sprays, shampoos, topical treatments, or monthly flea tablets. Alternatively, avoid harsh chemicals by topically applying natural ingredients such as lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, rosemary, and lavender oil.

, While your pet receives treatment for fleas, take the necessary steps to rid your home of fleas. Wash all bedding, clothing, and towels, and vacuum carpets and drapes. Wash the floors, and remove dampness in your home (a condition fleas thrive in) by using a dehumidifier.

For example, rashes on the back, around the tail, on his legs and/or around his abdomen are often (but not always) an indication of an allergic reaction.
You should also look for hot spots, which are lesions on the dog’s skin, often caused by an allergy. The skin will be warm, moist, pink, and painful for your dog. These lesions are infected and need to be treated by a veterinarian.;
, Is your dog lethargic, or is he behaving normally? Is he constantly biting, licking, or scratching the rash, or does he not seem to notice it?


If the rash doesn’t seem to be bothering him, then it is unlikely to be caused by fleas or an allergic reaction. In this case especially, the rash may be caused by an underlying health issue that could be very dangerous.
If the rash does seem to be bothering him, then it may be caused by fleas, ticks, or allergies, which will cause your dog to scratch constantly.
It is important to understand that just because a rash doesn’t seem to be bothering your dog doesn’t mean it is ok to ignore it. A rash could be a sign of a more serious health condition.

, Some rashes may be caused by heat, by fleas, or because the dog rubbed up against a plant that irritated his skin. If it is during the warm summer months, it is more likely that his rash was caused by one of these circumstances.


If it is especially hot out, you should make sure that your dog has plenty of cool water to drink, and enough shade so that he can easily get out of the sun.

, You can give your vet’s office a call to see if they might be able to assist you with your dog’s rash over the phone. If you can describe the rash and any other symptoms, your vet might be willing to give you some advice that way.


If your vet isn’t sure, or doesn’t want to make any diagnoses without seeing the dog in his office, don’t press the issue! Take your dog into the vet so he can be checked out properly.
A vet will cost you money, but many vets are more than willing to work out different payment options. In the end, taking your dog to the vet will save you and your dog time and suffering. If you try treating him yourself, you may end up wasting money on products that aren’t necessary anyway.

, The best thing you can do to treat your dog’s rash is to visit your vet. Only your veterinarian can conduct the proper tests to determine the cause, and the correct course of treatment.


If you are worried about the cost of a visit to the vet, then discuss different payment options with him/her. Many veterinarians will be happy to work out a payment plan with you.

, A skin rash that is caused by an allergy is known as Allergic Dermatitis. If your dog is having an allergic reaction to something, such as his food, a grooming product, or something in the air, he may develop an itchy, red rash.Corticosteroids can help with itchy rashes, but it is more important to determine the allergen, and do your best to limit your dog's exposure to the allergen.
Ask your veterinarian about allergy testing. Because there are many, many different sources of allergens, it will likely be difficult for you to determine the allergen on your own. A vet can help you systematically eliminate different allergens from your dog's diet and lifestyle.

, If your dog has a waxy-looking rash (or scabs) in his ears or around his paws that he licks or scratches continuously, then he may have a yeast infection. You will need to visit a vet in order to have this diagnosed accurately. Fortunately, this type of infection is usually treated easily with a cream you apply to the skin.It is very important that you have a yeast infection treated properly, as untreated infections in the ear can lead to deafness.Adding acidophilus to your dog’s diet may be helpful in preventing these infections, if your dog is prone to them. Acidophilus is a probiotic bacteria that is important for a balanced gastrointestinal tract. You can give this to your dog by adding plain, unsweetened yogurt or an acidophilus supplement directly to your dog’s food.If the infection is in his ear, you may also need to clean the ears with apple cider vinegar.

, Folliculitis is a rash caused by a bacterial infection, which will often consist of sores, bumps, and/or scabs. If you have a longer haired dog, these bumps may be difficult to see, so check carefully. You may also notice that the dog’s coat is dull and that he is shedding more than usual. If you believe your dog is suffering from folliculitis, you will need to visit the vet as this infection can usually only be treated with antibiotics.

, If you find pus-filled blisters on the area of skin where there is less fur, your dog may be suffering from impetigo. This type of bacterial infection is most common in puppies. These blisters typically appear on the abdomen, where there is less hair, and they may break and crust over.A topical solution can usually treat this affliction, but if left untreated, it may spread.

, This is one of the most common reasons that your dog might develop a rash. The saliva in a flea’s bite can irritate the skin, and cause rashes. Not to mention that an untreated flea problem can quickly turn into an infestation.If you believe your dog is suffering from fleas, try giving him a flea bath. Your veterinarian can recommend a good product to mix with water and apply to the skin. You can also find them at high quality pet supply stores. Bathing your dog with a flea killing soap can help alleviate skin irritation, and will kill some of the fleas, but understand that this will only be a temporary solution. You will have to take further steps to get rid of your dog’s flea problem.

, If you find a knot or bump under the skin, take your dog to the vet. Your dog may or may not scratch at these types of bumps, so you should periodically check for them using your fingers.


A bump under the skin might indicate a cancerous tumor, so it should be biopsied by a vet in order to rule anything out., There are two types of mange that might be causing skin problems for your dog. It is important to rule out each type as these will not go away on their own.


Sarcoptic mange is caused by an infestation of a parasitic mite. These mites burrow into the skin where they hatch eggs, and then come to live on the top of the skin. They prefer areas of the body that have little hair, such as the stomach or under the ear flaps. These mites are very irritating and itchy, and may cause red scaly skin.Be aware that this type of mange is contagious to other dogs and humans, so you should see your vet right away if you think this might be the cause.
Demodectic mange is also caused by mites, but these mites are naturally found on many dogs. The mites usually only cause a problem if the dog’s immune system is not functioning properly, so it is important to get your dog checked out for any other underlying problems.This type of mange usually presents as scaly bald patches around the eyes and/or mouth. It is slightly contagious between dogs, but humans cannot contract it.

, Chamomile tea can be good for soothing irritated skin. If you think that your dog may have simply run into an irritating plant, you can try this by brewing some chamomile tea, letting it cool in the fridge, and then spraying it directly onto the skin.If the rash feels warm, and it is also during a hot day, placing the tea in the fridge may provide extra comfort for your dog.

, A bath may help with several types of rashes, especially if he hasn’t had one in quite awhile. If your dog is suffering from fleas or has a rash caused by some kind of skin irritant, a bath can help soothe the skin. There are several different kinds of baths you can give your dog, but if you have determined that your dog’s skin is sensitive, an oatmeal bath can be great for providing relief.


You can make your dog an oatmeal bath by grinding up some oatmeal in a food processor and adding it to some water (how much oatmeal you need depends on the size of your dog, but you will want to use enough so that it creates a very diluted, runny mush). Then let your dog soak in this mixture, which will work well against itchiness. Be sure to rinse all of the oatmeal off of your dog when he is done soaking.It is also possible to buy oatmeal shampoos at your local pet store. These are meant to work in the same way, but come pre-made for your convenience.

, Does your dog only eat the food you give him or does he often get scraps from the table? Are you feeding him high quality dog food, or are you purchasing whatever food is on sale? Having a healthy, balanced diet can play a huge role in your dog’s health, and that includes the health of his skin.


Choose a food that has a protein on the label first, instead of a carbohydrate.
The food should also list essential fatty acids on the label. You can also consider purchasing an essential fatty acid supplement that you can add to his food. For healthy skin, omega 6 fatty acids are essential. These include: linoleic acid, gamma linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid. You can also add evening primrose oil to his food.Make sure that your dog always has a bowl of clean, fresh water to drink! It is important that you change his water out each day.

, You should keep his bedding clean by washing it in hot soapy water, especially if you have discovered fleas. Most beds will have a tag for cleaning instructions, so follow them carefully. Dry it thoroughly by either hanging it to dry or putting it in the dryer, if the tags says it is acceptable.If your dog spends time inside, you should also make sure that you vacuum your rugs every two to three days to get rid of anything that might be harmful or irritating.
Keeping his bedding clean can also be helpful in getting rid of rashes because it may be something in the bedding itself that has irritated his skin in the first place.

, If your dog is prone to dry, flaky, itchy skin, try massaging vitamin E oil into his skin. You can also add the oil to his bath water to help moisturize.It may also be possible to give your dog vitamin E oil orally, but you should check with your vet before doing this in order to determine the correct dosage. You may also be able to add the oil directly to his food.

Understand the risk factors for catching sarcoptic mange.",How to Identify Mange on Dogs," Sarcoptic mange usually causes frantic itching. The dog may relentlessly scratch or chew at its skin to relieve the itch. The dog's skin, irritated from the constant scratching and biting, can easily become infected. The itching can even be so severe that it distracts the dog from necessary behavior like eating, drinking, and resting.


Severe cases of sarcoptic mange that result in secondary infections from bacteria or yeast can cause a white, crusty surface to form on the dog's irritated skin, though this does not occur in all cases.In addition, dogs with severe secondary infections will also often suffer weight loss, run a fever, and/or have enlarged lymph nodes.;
, Localized demodectic mange, the least serious variety, usually results in one or two ""thin"" or bald patches in the dog's hair. Usually, this small patch will not appear inflamed or irritated and will not cause serious itching. , If a case of localized demodectic mange does not go away on its own, it may eventually spread to the rest of the dog's body, resulting in generalized mange. The dog will develop numerous thin or bald patches over its body. Existing patches may grow to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The skin in the patches may become red, scaly, and/or crusty.


This skin irritation can cause the dog to scratch at its skin, which can sometimes lead to more serious infections. These secondary infections will lead to similar symptoms as those in sarcoptic mange cases — fever, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, etc. , Some select cases of demodectic mange cause a condition called demodectic pododermatitis. This occurs when the mites that cause mange become deeply embedded in the dog's feet, where they are very difficult to remove. This condition most often presents itself in the form of swollen, irritated feet. It is usually worst around the nailbeds and often accompanied by a secondary infection., One of the ways to detect a case of mange on your dog is to find mite bites on yourself. When the type of mites that cause sarcoptic mange come into contact with a human, they can cause red bumps similar to mosquito bites.Luckily, these almost never become serious. However, seeing these symptoms after being around a dog that can't stop itching itself is a strong indication of sarcoptic mange.


Note that humans cannot get the type of mites that cause demodectic mange.

, Itching or patchy hair loss are also symptoms of other underlying health issues, such as allergies, hyperadrenocorticism  (Cushing's disease), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and parasite infection. Therefore, it is important to consult your veterinarian about the problem in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment., If your dog appears to be itching itself more than normal but you're unsure whether it has sarcoptic mange, this simple test can help. To start, take one of your dog's ears gently in your hand. Hold the loose, floppy part of the ear between your thumb and index finger.


If you're worried about the possibility of getting bitten by your dog's mange-causing mites, you may want to wear disposable gloves for this test.

, Use your thumb and index finger to rub the dog's ear from both sides. Use slow, steady movements and don't squeeze too tightly. While you do this, keep your eyes on the dog's hind leg on the same side as the ear you're rubbing.

, You're looking for a movement in the dog's hind leg like it's trying to reach up to scratch its ear. If you see this, your dog may have sarcoptic mange. In this case, you should wash your hands and take the dog to a veterinarian at your earliest convenience.


This test (called the pinnal-pedal reflex test) works because, in the vast majority of sarcoptic mange cases, mites are present in and around the dog's ears. When you rub the dog's ear, it feels the irritating itching sensation caused by the mites and tries to scratch itself., While the test does confirm your dog is itchy and sensitized, it does not confirm the cause. Sarcoptic mange can be very difficult to definitively diagnose. The pinnal-pedal test may lead to a presumptive diagnosis of scabies, in which case treatment should begin as soon as possible. If your dog responds to the therapy promptly, that is considered confirmation of the diagnosis., Dogs can contract two forms of mange — sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange. Though both can be serious, the two forms of the disease differ somewhat in the symptoms they present (see Part 1) and have different causes. Sarcoptic mange is an infection by a specific kind of mite that is passed along from other infected animals. Demodectic mange is caused by a different kind of mite that is normally present in a dog's skin. While most dogs live in harmony with these mites, sometimes the mites can proliferate and cause hair loss and irritation. Although both sarcoptic and generalized demodectic mange can lead to itching, it's important to distinguish the two — the mites that cause sarcoptic mange lead to immediate, severe itching, while the mites that cause demodectic mange cause patches of irritated skin to develop, which then may become itchy.While sarcoptic mange itself can't kill a dog, the dog's health can deteriorate quickly if it gets a serious infection or stops eating or sleeping, so, in this case, immediate veterinary care may be needed. This should be obvious — a dog with a bad case of sarcoptic mange will appear profoundly unhealthy.
Sarcoptic mange is sometimes referred to as scabies.Demodectic mange may also be called Demodex., Localized demodectic mange is characterized by hair loss in one or two spots. If unresolved (possibly because of suppressed immunity, allergies, or endocrine issues), the condition may spread, resulting in a proliferation of bald patches that may become irritated and infected, which lead to itching and scabbing.


Localized demodectic mange is most common in puppies. In about 90% of cases, localized demodectic mange disappears on its own without treatment in a month or two.However, in a fraction of cases, the disease may develop into the more serious generalized demodectic mange.
While dogs do not inherit demodectic mange per se, is thought that those that develop generalized demodectic mange usually inherit their weakness to the disease genetically., Pododermatitis is a third type of demodectic mange; in some cases the dog may have the classic symptoms of demodectic mange, while others may have foot infections only. Treatment of pododermatitis can be long and complicated, often involving administering antibiotics and frequently dipping the dog's feet in a medication called Mitaban.Because treatment is difficult, spotting this condition early is critical.

, If you think your dog has any sort of mange, you should consult your veterinarian. Only a trained, experienced vet can run the proper diagnostic tests to determine the type and severity of the mange. Depending on the diagnosis, the vet will then prescribe the proper medication to treat the mange. Because mange is almost always easiest to treat before it becomes severe, seeing your vet as quickly as possible is important to ensure your pet is back to normal as soon as possible.


Cases of sarcoptic mange require a veterinarian more urgently than demodectic mange. Because the severe itching from sarcoptic mange can make a dog miserable (and, more importantly, quickly lead to health problems), early diagnosis and treatment is essential.
The exception to this general rule is for very minor cases of localized demodectic mange. Because these usually clear up on their own, a veterinarian is not always necessary, though you may want to consult with one for peace of mind anyway, and to rule out other conditions.

, In cases of mange (especially sarcoptic mange, which is contagious), any objects that have recently come into contact with the dog's hair or skin should immediately be washed or replaced. This includes its bedding, collar, leash, harness, doghouse, and any brushes or cleaning products. The need for cleaning is especially urgent if you have other pets who don't have mange yet.


For fabric objects, launder with bleach or borax and dry at the highest possible setting. For hard objects and surfaces, use a hospital-grade disinfectant. Repeat daily as needed until the mange subsides.

, As noted above, dogs who get bad cases of demodectic mange sometimes have a weakness in their immune system that they've inherited from their parents. Because of this, owners of dogs that have had long, severe, or difficult-to-treat cases of demodectic mange are usually encouraged not to breed their dogs. For dogs that have had minor, localized cases of demodectic mange, breeding is sometimes considered acceptable, especially if the mange occurred when the dog was young and cleared up on its own.


It's worth noting, however, that some veterinarians will recommend against breeding dogs that have had any sort of demodectic mange.If you're unsure of whether it's wise to breed your dog, talk to a vet who knows you and your dog for advice. Usually, a vet like this will be able to recommend a course of action that takes your needs into account as well as the health of any future puppies.

, Because sarcoptic mange is highly contagious, quarantine is essential for making sure that other pets and animals don't catch the aggravating disease. If your dog has sarcoptic mange, immediately separate it from other animals.Don't let it sleep, feed, or play near them. If you think a neighbor's dog has sarcoptic mange, don't let your own pets go near it. Once the mange has completely disappeared, the dog may be allowed to mingle with other animals as normal.


Note that no form of demodectic mange is thought to be contagious to other animals or humans. In very rare cases, the disease may be contagious to other dogs. However, quarantine measures usually aren't taken even when symptoms are severe., Sarcoptic mange is highly contagious and usually passed from one infected dog to another. Often the infected dog shows few, if any, signs of the disease. Sarcoptic mange may be passed from a mother to her puppies, and is common in overcrowded conditions where dogs are poorly maintained, such as puppy mills, boarding kennels, and shelters.However, a dog might be exposed to mites even if it doesn't come into contact with a mangy animal: mites can survive four to 21 days away from their host in temperatures between 50-59 F (10-15 C), and two to six days in temperatures of 68-77 F (20-25 C).A dog could catch mange from an object that has recently been used on an infected animal, such as a blanket or towel. Likewise, if grooming salons do not practice regular sanitation of clippers, towels, and caging, this could also lead to the spread of the disease.Since wild animals like coyotes and foxes can also get sarcoptic mange,exercising in wildlife areas may also expose your dog to scabies.

Check for fleas.,
Check for sarcoptic mange.,
Check for cheyletiellosis, or walking dandruff.,
Check for lice.,
Check for demodectic mange.,
Check for ringworm.,
Understand what should not be causing itchiness.",How to Diagnose and Treat Your Dog's Itchy Skin Problems2," The most common cause of itchy skin is fleas. They are most active in warm, humid weather (35°C or 95°F). You may see the fleas on your dog, or you may just notice your dog biting or scratching their skin. Fleas are very quick and can jump very high, so you will need to be fast to spot them. Fleas are most likely to be found in the armpit and groin area and are dark (almost black) with flat bodies.Check your dog's ears for signs of scratching, redness, blood, or dirt. See if their belly, groin, or the base of their tail has red bumps.
One way to check for fleas is to stand your dog over a white surface, such as paper towels or pieces of paper, then comb their coat. Flea feces will fall out when you comb the dog and it will be more visible on the white paper.

, Sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) is a parasitic mite infestation. Mites will usually live in areas of the skin that do not have hair such as the ear flaps, elbows or stomach. The dog may have red, scaly skin in these areas.Sarcoptic mange can cause significant skin lesions and distress for the dog because the mite causes severe itching.Sarcoptic mange is contagious and can be transmitted to people and other dogs very easily.
Your veterinarian can diagnose sarcoptic mange by collecting skin scrapings from your dog.

, This is caused by the Cheyletiella mite that feeds on the top layer of skin. In addition to excessive scratching, the dog may have scaling on the skin, hair loss, dandruff, lesions on their back.It is sometimes called ""walking dandruff"" because the mite pushes up scales of skin as it travels, making it appear as though the scales are moving.
You might be able to see the mite, which is yellow.

, Dog lice is different from human lice, so don't worry about infecting each other. Lice survive on either your dog's skin debris or their blood, depending on the species. You should be able to spot adult lice on your dog — they are yellow or tan and about the size of a sesame seed. They can sometimes be mistaken for dandruff, but will not fall off the dog if you shake the hair.Other signs of lice include hair loss (especially around the neck, ears, shoulder, groin, and anus); a rough, dry, or matted coat; small wounds or infections; tapeworms or other parasites that can be spread by lice; and even anemia in severe cases or in small dogs.

, Demodectic (red mange) is caused by small mites found naturally on most dogs. These mites do not generally cause skin problems unless the dog’s immune system is compromised. Demodex is most commonly seen in puppies, because their immune systems are still developing. This mange is most noticeable around the eyes and mouth. It can be diagnosed by your veterinarian collecting skin scrapings from your dog.Demodectic mange is not very contagious and people cannot contract it. It is generally passed on to nursing puppies by the mother.A predisposition for this skin problem may be inherited. It is not uncommon for the puppies to have Demodex if their parents also had Demodex at some point in their lives., Ringworm is not actually a worm; rather, it is a fungus. It causes itching, small circular scabbing (about a centimeter in diameter), and hair loss (alopecia) in one or more areas on your pet. This typically starts on the face or paws. Ringworm is contagious and easily transmittable to humans (a zoonotic disease) and other pets. Your veterinarian will be able to diagnose ringworm and advise you on the treatment protocol, which will require a fungicide.


Some pets with minor infections can be treated topically, whereas other animals will need oral anti-fungal medication.
Treatment of ringworm will also include disinfecting your home. It may take months to control., Your dog may have a condition that resembles a parasite or other condition that might mislead you in determining the cause of his itchiness. Alopecia and Cushing’s disease are two possible conditions.


Alopecia, or hair loss, can be brought on by low thyroid (hypothyroid) conditions and is not typically itchy. Low-thyroid dogs tend to have more skin issues than normal-thyroid dogs.Dogs with Cushing’s disease will drink a lot of water and want to eat all the time. You may notice that the dog’s fur is thinner and has less undercoat. The dog’s belly may even be nearly bald and the skin looks thinner too.

Discuss possible treatments with your vet.,
Use a flea control treatment.,
Treat your dog for parasitic mites.,
Try a prescription shampoo.,
Ask about the steroid Prednisone.,
Ask about an antihistamine.,
Try an antibiotic.,
Talk to your veterinarian about allergy testing.,
Ask about a veterinary dermatologist.,
Avoid over-the-counter itch relief remedies.",How to Diagnose and Treat Your Dog's Itchy Skin Problems3," Due to the variety of possible causes of this serious skin problem, there is a range of possible treatments that could be prescribed by your veterinarian.Unfortunately, antihistamines have a disappointing effect in dogs and most require either short courses of steroids, or one of the modern anti-itch medication now available such at Apoquel or Atopica. There are new products coming on the market all the time.,Use prescribed medication according to your veterinarian's instructions. Medication is used to control the itching and start the healing process.

, Flea allergy dermatitis is one of the most common causes of itching for dogs.Eliminating flea bites on the dog is often the first step to addressing your pet’s itching even if you don’t see any fleas. Dogs can develop an allergic reaction to the flea saliva that causes the dog to overreact with severe itching even if only one flea was involved.Flea control for your dog, all other pets in the household and the immediate environment must be implemented and continued on a monthly basis.

, The treatment for each mite differs. Serious cases of generalized Demodex may take months of treatment, whereas scabies is typically handled within a few weeks., Your vet will prescribe medication for the parasites.


Scabies can easily spread to other animals and humans. Steps must be taken to eradicate the infestation in the dog’s entire environment as well as on the dog and on any other pets that may be exposed to the infestation., Prescription shampoos are available from your veterinarian to manage itching as well as treat yeast and bacterial infections. These products may be used in addition to oral medication.


Over-the-counter flea shampoos such as medicated or coal tar shampoo risk further irritating open skin wounds. Consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter treatment on your dog.
Bathing is good for itchy skin, but don't use human shampoo. A mild oatmeal-based shampoo specially formulated for dogs may temporarily decrease itching. If your dog’s skin is abraded or infected, do not use any shampoo or topical treatment without talking to your veterinarian. You may make the problem worse by using an inappropriate product.
Don't over-wash your dog. A bath once a month is all most healthy dogs really need, and some dogs need even less frequent bathing. Bathing your dog removes oils from the skin. If your veterinarian prescribes a special shampoo, she will discuss with you the recommended bathing frequency for your pet’s condition.

, The first option for treatment for many moderate to severe cases of itching is the steroid, Prednisone, for the temporary relief of the itching. Decreasing the itch and making the dog more comfortable gives the skin a chance to heal.


Steroids do have side effects and need to be used carefully. Long-term use can lead to liver or adrenal gland problems.,, An antihistamine medication may also be used to quell an allergic reaction.There are many antihistamines available to try, and your veterinarian can recommend over-the-counter options as well as prescription ones.


No single product works for every dog, so an “antihistamine trial” will need to be started to find out which medication helps your pet the most.
Be aware that antihistamines may not help the super itchy dog, but they are often used after steroids have taken care of the initial problem so that you continue to manage the allergy symptoms.

, Your vet may use an antibiotic in combination with an anti-itch medication. This is because a secondary bacterial infection is common when the skin is damaged because of scratching.

, You can get a blood test or a skin test for your dog to help narrow down which pollens, trees, grasses, insects or molds trigger your pet’s allergies.Food allergies are best determined through food elimination trials., , If your dog is experiencing an extended bout of itching and scratching to the point of damaging his skin, talk to your vet to get a recommendation for a veterinary dermatologist. This person will specialize in skin ailments.

, Over-the-counter remedies such as medicated or coal tar shampoos, tea-tree and emu oil, and aloe vera are all part of a last ditch approach that owners will often try in the hopes that something will work. Consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter treatment on your dog.


Home remedies such as turpentine, petroleum jelly, mouthwash or vinegar should also be avoided. However, benign topical treatments such as green tea rinses and coconut oil may be effective for mild cases of dry skin with no signs of infection.
Your efforts to help your pet may result in making the problem worse for both you and your pet.

Evaluate your dog’s current diet.,
Try giving fatty acid supplements.,
Ask your vet about a food elimination trial.",How to Diagnose and Treat Your Dog's Itchy Skin Problems4," Improving your dog’s overall nutrition will help their general health whether or not your dog is allergic to food.


If you feed processed foods, look at the ingredient list on your dog’s food. Check to make sure that protein is the first ingredient, not a carbohydrate. Essential fatty acids are good for healthy skin and coat and should be included on the ingredient list.,, Fatty acid supplements such as fish oil, coconut oil or flaxseed oil are helpful with allergic skin disease cases. These are best fed in their pure form (fresh or tinned fish, freshly ground flax seeds), but are also available as capsules or liquids., Follow the product directions or your veterinarian’s instructions for dosage information.

, If a food allergy is suspected, your veterinarian may suggest a food elimination trial with a completely new and different diet for your pet. This new diet will need to consist of ingredients your dog has never eaten before.


For example, if your pet has been eating lamb and rice dog food with treats made of beef and wheat, the new diet cannot contain any of those ingredients.
The food elimination trial will typically last for 2-3 months.
You need to adhere to the strict diet (including treats) in order to get the best information from your experiment.
It may take a few rounds of this food elimination diet to determine which foods your dog is sensitive to.
You may be able to get your dog’s food at a pet store, but often a special diet from your veterinarian may be needed to manage a pet’s food allergy.Once a diet has been found, then you can start challenging the body with small amounts of one ingredient at a time to see if your dog starts itching again after introducing the additional ingredient.

Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Understand what your vet is doing when he or she uses a Wood's Lamp.,
Understand what your vet is looking for when he or she examines hair follicles under a microscope.,
Understand that your vet will do a fungal culture if all else fails.,
Get ringworm treated.",How to Check a Dog for Ringworm2," As a general rule, if you suspect your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet to get checked out. Your veterinarian can confirm the presence of ringworm by a variety of methods and then treat.

, The Wood's Lamp is a special lamp fitted with ultraviolet bulbs and a magnifying lens. The lamp is switched on and the bulbs allowed to warm for 10 minutes. In a dark room, the animal is examined by shining the Woods Lamp onto the suspect areas and examining the response via the magnifying lens.Certain species of ringworm glow a fluorescent apple green in the presence of ultraviolet light. If this happens then ringworm is present.
Your veterinarian may then wish to double check his or her findings by sending a sample away to a lab for species identification.
Be aware that only about 50% of ringworm species fluoresce in this way. So, in other words, a negative on the Wood's Lamp does NOT mean the animal is clear. This is a useful way to get a quick positive, but not a conclusive negative.

, Another way to get a quick result is for the veterinarian to pluck hairs from the edge of the affected area and examine them under the microscope. Under high magnification it can be possible to see the fungal spores entwined around the hair shaft, which gives positive confirmation of ringworm., A fungal culture will give you a definitive answer. To do this the veterinarian uses a sterile brush (such as a sterilized tooth brush) and rubs it over the affected area. The head of the brush is then pressed against a fungal culture medium, the medium container is then sealed, and set aside to see if fungus grows.Many vets use an ""in house"" test where the fungal culture medium changes color if fungus grows. This gives a clear indication that ringworm is present.
It takes an average of 4 - 5 days for the fungus to grow and cause a color change, although the test is not considered negative until a full 2 weeks have passed with a color change.

, If your dog is found to have ringworm your vet will likely prescribe an anti fungal medication. While being treated, keep your dog isolated, as the infection could still spread to other animals and even to humans.To make sure that your dog cannot ingest any topical medication, put a wide cone collar (also known as an Elizabethan Collar) on it during treatment.

Understand that ringworm is a fungal infection.,
Know what ringworm looks like.,
Learn how a dog can get ringworm.",How to Check a Dog for Ringworm3," It is not, as the name might imply, an infestation by worms or bug larvae. Two species of fungus are responsible for ringworm infection, microsporum and trichophyton species.This bit of knowledge will help you understand both how the disease can spread and how to identify it.

, As the name implies, ringworm often leaves circular marks or patches on the surface of the skin. In the early stages of infection, there is little to see other than a patch of hair loss. This is because the fungus grows down the hair shaft, the body then rejects that hair as damaged and it falls out.The skin irritation can result in itching, but even without evident rubbing the condition can contribute to hair loss in the affected region.

, One of the primary factors that contributes to infection is immune health of the animal. Ringworm in dogs is most common in puppies and older animals, though it can also affect animals with suppressed immune systems. Dogs under stress or taking certain medications can thus be especially vulnerable. This is because the immune system keeps the flora and fauna that are normal inhabitants of the skin in check. However, if the immune system is not fighting fit, the fungus can grow unchecked and a full on infection develops.While the fungi that cause ringworm are common, contact with an especially heavy concentration of spores can increase the likelihood of infection. Heavy concentrations are really only found on other infected animals. If your dog is healthy but gets ringworm, it is probably because it was around another animal that had the disease.
Ringworm is highly infectious and the infected hairs that are shed are a major source of infection for people or other pets.In order to prevent the spread of the disease, sequester infected pets and clean up all fur from the infected pet before allowing other animals in the area.

Buy better quality dog food.,
Add whole foods.,
Introduce new food slowly.,
Test for food sensitivities.",How to Help an Itching Dog2," Itching is commonly caused by skin irritations due to dog food allergies or intolerances. Regular, commercial dog food is full of food additives like preservatives, by-products, and food coloring, as well as cheap ingredients like low quality meat, corn, rice and soy. Look for minimally processed dog food with few or no chemical additives and fillers., As an alternative to commercial dog foods, try feeding your dog whole foods to improve its health. Be sure to maintain an omnivorous diet for your dog, and be careful with raw foods, which are safe for dogs to eat but can spread harmful bacteria to you. Try feeding your dog whole foods that offer a lot of nutritional value, such as:Canned fish (e.g. sardines), for omega-3 fatty acids
Eggs, which provide high quality protein and fat
Leafy greens

, Start introducing new kinds of food to your dog’s diet by adding portions to its regular kibble. Reduce the amount of kibble you add to accommodate the new foods that you’re adding. As a regular addition to a regular kibble diet, or as a start to an entirely new diet, new ingredients should make up approximately a quarter of your dog’s meals.For instance, you can start by feeding your dog 3/4 of its normal portion of kibble, and add as much new food as you omitted from the kibble (e.g.better quality dog food, or half a boiled egg, cut into pieces). Do so for 3-4 days while monitoring your dog for digestive upset, skin irritations, or changes in behavior. If no health issues occur, you can change the ratio of old to new food (e.g. 50/50), continue monitoring your dog for a few days, then alter the ratio again.

, If you suspect that your dog suffers from food allergies, consider using a home test for food sensitivities. Data collected from the saliva-based home test kits can isolate intolerances to specific foods such as corn, peanuts, salmon, and pork. Samples are usually mailed in and analyzed by a lab, and the results are sent to you.Nutriscan, for example, is a test which identifies food intolerances within 2-3 weeks after your sample is received by mail. The home test kit is available online at http://www.nutriscan.org/order/order-online.html for approximately $300.

Make a baking soda treatment.,
Bathe it with oatmeal.,
Make a vinegar spray.",How to Help an Itching Dog3," Make a paste out of equal parts baking soda and water. Apply to the itchy areas of your dog's skin (i.e. the spots it scratches the most) and leave for 20 minutes. Gently rinse it off with the shower head on a gentle setting, a cup of water, or a wet cloth.Alternatively, add a cup of baking soda to your dog's bath to relieve the itch all over.

, To relieve your dog's itchy skin, gently wash it with an oatmeal shampoo. You can purchase a colloidal oatmeal shampoo at a pet store, or add ground oatmeal to its regular shampoo. For an intensive soak, add one and a half cups of ground oatmeal to a warm bath to soothe your dog's skin.Grind oatmeal in a food processor or coffee grinder, or buy ground oatmeal baby cereal at a grocery store.

, To quickly soothe itchy skin, make a mixture of half water, half apple cider vinegar. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray the affected areas of your dog's coat. Make sure that your dog does not have any open wounds before you spray, as the vinegar will sting."
"
Only use shampoo made for dogs.,
Brush your dog regularly.,
Bring your dog for regular check ups.",How to Help an Itching Dog4," To prevent itching and irritation, never substitute regular shampoo for dog shampoo when bathing your dog. Shampoo for humans is much harsher than dog shampoo and will disrupt the delicate PH balance of your dog's skin. It can also wash away the essential oils from your dog's coat, which will make your dog vulnerable to bacteria and parasites., Regular brushing can remove dead hair from your dog's coat, as well as dander from its skin, both of which can cause itching. Brushing also distributes essential oils through your dog's coat, which prevents bacterial buildup, and stimulates your dog's skin. Brush your dog from top to bottom at least once a week, but preferably every few days, to keep it healthy., Bring your dog to the vet regularly to screen for or prevent itch-causing ailments. Conditions like ringworm and yeast infections can cause itching, and should be diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian. Vets can also rule out medical problems and suggest environmental changes to help your pet, or prescribe supplements (e.g. mega 3 and omega 6) to treat your dog's symptoms."

Look for signs of dry skin.,
Consider your dog's health.,
Check your dog's coat for parasites.,
Feed your dog a nutritious diet.,
Give your dog dietary supplements.,
Groom your dog on a regular basis.,
Bathe your dog.,
Monitor your home's humidity.,
Be patient.",How to Alleviate Dry Skin in Dogs," The first sign that your dog is experiencing dry skin might be that he begins to scratch violently when you simply touch his skin. If you part his hair, you may notice other signs of dry skin. These include:Dry, flaky skin
Dandruff
Itchiness
A harsh, brittle coat
Cracked or tough skin;
, Ask yourself if your dog seems himself or whether anything has recently changed. For example, has his appetite changed (eating more or less), and what is his thirst like? Have his energy levels changed? If you suspect there are other medical conditions affecting your dog, take him to the veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment. Dry skin may be caused by underlying medical conditions. Once treated, the dry skin may go away.These non-specific behavioral changes could point to medical conditions like hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid glands), Cushing's disease, infections, or diabetes. These conditions can affect skin health and coat condition, especially in older dogs.

, Take a close look at your dog's coat itself. Brush back the hair and look for flakes of dandruff. Be aware that while flakes of dandruff are associated with a dry coat, the flakes could actually be tiny parasites. These parasites, Cheyletiella, have the nickname ""walking dandruff"" because they may simply look like dandruff, but you may spot them moving if you watch carefully.


Your vet can diagnose Cheyletiella by looking at skin flakes under the microscope. The treatment involves medicated sprays (with fipronil) every two weeks to kill the mites., Make sure your dog has a high-quality balanced diet and constant access to fresh water. You should choose a commercial dog food that lists a named meat, like chicken, beef or lamb, at the top of the ingredients list, followed by a named vegetable, like sweet potato or carrot. These quality ingredients are more nutritious than ""meat-by-products"" or ""soya"" and the food is more likely to contain good levels of vitamins and minerals. It's also a good idea to look for a food that has added vitamin E or omega-6 fatty acids, since these can nourish your dog's skin.You should put olive oil on the dogs food to help get rid of the dry skin. It works quite well and it serves as a great treat for the dog. Cheaper or economy foods usually begin with lower quality ingredients and are more heavily processed. This can cause your dog's skin to suffer, especially if you change from a good quality food to a poor quality food. While you won't notice the changes immediately, you will see a difference after about a month.

, Regardless of whether you choose a high or low quality commercial food, some nutrients will be destroyed during processing. If your dog has dry skin, you may need to give additional nutrients in the form of dietary supplements. These can nourish skin cells deep within your dog's tissues, which will lead to healthy skin after about a month of supplementing.Consider adding the following nutrients:


Vitamin E: Give your dog 1.6 to 8 mg / kg per day. Ask your vet for a dosage specific to your dog. Vitamin E is an antioxidant which can improve your dog's skin and promote healing. It does this by combating the damage done to skin cells as a result of environmental factors such as pollution.Omega fatty acids or oils: These are also known as PUFA (poly unsaturated fatty acids). Omega 3 is found in flax, corn, and soy oils, while Omega 6 is found in fish oils. These fatty acids are anti-inflammatory (helpful if your dog has allergies), which can nourish the skin cells, and improve the skin's defensive barrier. The recommended dose is 30mg/kg, but if you accidentally give your dog too much, he can get diarrhea.

, You should brush your dog every day. This will distribute natural oils throughout the coat, keep it shiny and protected, and prevent oil buildup that could cause irritation. Brushing is a simple way to condition your dog's skin and it acts like a massage, increasing the blood supply to the skin. This lets more oxygen reach the skin and remove waste products, which can alleviate dry skin.Remove matting in the fur as soon as you notice it. Mats tighten up against the skin and air from reaching your dog's skin, which can cause dry and flaking skin.

, Not only will bathing your dog prevent dirt and oil buildup, but it will also give you the chance to closely examine your dog's skin and coat for skin problems like parasites. Generally, you should shampoo your dog monthly or up to every two weeks at most if he has normal skin. If your dog with dry skin rolls in mud and needs a bath, use an oatmeal shampoo and avoid over-drying him.


Choose a dog shampoo that is specifically pH balanced for dog skin.Don't use a perfumed shampoo, since it could dry out the skin. A good choice is an oatmeal shampoo which is gently moisturizing but not greasy.

, Low humidity associated with cold weather can cause or aggravate already dry skin. Control your home's humidity levels using humidifiers which will add moisture to the air. Indoor heating can dry out a coat, so be careful about overheating the house. Keep your dog from lying against heaters.


You should also keep your dog indoors during dry, cold weather.

, Moisturizing your dog's skin will take time because the skin is made up of layers of skin cells. The mature skin cells at the top are older and dryer, with a tendency to be flaky. The skin cells at the bottom are called the ""germ"" or baby skin cells. It takes over 28 days for baby skin cells to migrate upwards and become mature skin cells at the top. Keep conditioning your dog's skin for at least a month, so you can begin looking for improvement.


After a month or two of conditioning treatment, you can reevaluate what's effective in treating your dog's dry skin."

Look for skin problems or hair loss.,
Identify changes in weight.,
Pay attention to weakness and lethargy.,
Take note of digestive distress.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Give the veterinarian as much information as possible.,
Approve blood and urine testing, as well as imaging.,
Discuss the diagnosis with your veterinarian.,
Give your dog medication.,
Schedule your dog for surgery.,
Have your dog undergo radiotherapy.",How to Diagnose Endocrine Disorders in Senior Dogs," There are several types of endocrine disorders that can impact your dog's hair and skin. These include disorders of the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and the pituitary gland.Skin and hair problems are also often caused by allergies. If your dog is having issues with its skin and hair, you should consult with a veterinarian about possible causes and solutions.;
, Endocrine disorders can cause both weight loss and weight gain, depending on what type of disorder your dog has. Problems with the thyroid gland and the adrenal gland can cause your dog to either gain or lose weight. Problems in the pancreas can cause your dog to lose weight.In order to assess whether your dog has lost or gained weight, it's a good idea to have an idea of how much your dog weighs normally. If you know how much the dog weighs on an average day you can easily weigh it to see if it has lost weight.

, While weakness and lethargy can be caused by a wide variety of illnesses, they can be associated with endocrine disorders as well. Pay attention to your dog's energy level and take note if its energy level drops.


Lethargy and weakness are associated with endocrine disorders in the pancreas, adrenal gland, and the thyroid gland., Endocrine disorders can also cause problems in your dog's digestive system. This usually means your dog will have repeated episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, or both. It may also mean that your dog has less interest in eating than usual because it is not feeling well.


Digestive distress can be associated with a wide variety of illnesses. In the case of endocrine disorders, it is usually associated with problems in the pancreas, adrenal gland, or the thyroid gland., If your dog has symptoms that you think could be connected to an endocrine disorder then you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office and tell them about your dog's symptoms. They will schedule an appointment for you to bring your dog in.


If your dog is having severe symptoms and you are worried about its survival then you should bring your dog to a veterinarian right away. Call the veterinary office on your way in so that they can prepare for your arrival but don't wait for an open appointment if your dog is gravely ill.

, When you bring your dog in to see a veterinarian, they are likely to ask you a variety of questions about your dog's condition. Give the vet as much information as you can in order to assist them in coming to a thorough diagnosis for your dog.


Keep track of your dog's symptoms, even consider writing them down, so that you can tell your veterinarian exactly when you first noticed them and how they have progressed.

, Once your veterinarian has done a thorough physical exam of your dog and has discussed its symptoms with you, he or she may want to do additional testing to figure out what exactly is wrong with the dog. Approve these tests so that your veterinarian can get to the bottom of what is making your dog ill.


Testing usually begins with a general blood count and urinalysis. If any levels look off during these tests, then the vet can do follow up tests to narrow down the cause.
Once a veterinarian suspects a specific glandular problem, they can do specific tests on that gland's function. For example, if your veterinarian suspects a problem with the thyroid then he or she is likely to do a series of thyroid function tests, testing for T4 and TSH levels., Once your veterinarian figures out what they think is wrong with your dog, they will discuss the problem with you. They will also discuss the treatment and prognosis with you as well. Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand what they are telling you at first.


Take notes if you have a hard time remembering details. This will help you to treat and care for your dog later on.
Make sure that your vet is taking your dog's age into consideration when discussing treatment. You will need to weigh your dog's age and physical stamina against the treatment options your veterinarian presents.

, Medication can often be used to treat endocrine disorders that produce too much hormone. Syndromes that are caused by hormone deficiency are often treated by replacing the missing hormone. The most common example of this type of treatment is insulin injections that are used to treat diabetes. Medications used for endocrine disorders are sometimes injected, as in the case of insulin, but are often given orally. This is the case for steroid and thyroid hormone replacements.
Medications are often a good treatment option for senior dogs, as undergoing more invasive types of treatment could be too much for their aging bodies.

, If your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then surgery to remove the malfunctioning gland may be one of the treatment options.For example, endocrine problems that are caused by tumors or tissue malformation may require surgery to correct.


Surgery can be very hard on senior dogs. You will need to discuss your dog's health and whether or not your vet thinks the dog can physically handle surgery before committing to this treatment. Some senior dogs, depending on their age and condition, are better off living out their days on medication than undergoing surgery even though the surgery could potentially eliminate the problem.

, Radiotherapy is extremely rare as a means of treating endocrine disease in dogs. A medical or surgical intervention is much more likely. However, if your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then it may be able to be treated with radiotherapy. This type of treatment uses radiation to eliminate tissues that are malfunctioning.For example, radioactive iodine can be used to eliminate an overactive thyroid.
In many cases, radiotherapy is used on glands that cannot be surgically removed due to location or other restrictions."

Feel the skin mass.,
Note the size of the skin mass.,
Pay attention to how the skin mass develops.",How to Diagnose Skin Masses on Dogs1," Start by using clean hands to gently feel around the skin mass. The skin mass may be located on your dog’s belly or trunk, though they can appear anywhere on your dog’s body. Note if the skin mass feels soft and moveable under the skin. If this is the case, the skin mass may be a buildup of fatty tissue, known as a lipoma, which is not life threatening. If the skin mass feels hard and does not move with your touch, it may be a tumor.Regardless of how the skin mass feels, you should get it examined by a vet to confirm it is not a tumor. Doing the feel test is not a definitive way to diagnosis the skin mass.;
, If the skin mass is one centimeter or larger in size, you should get it checked by your vet. One centimeter is about the size of a pea.If your dog has multiple skin masses that are the size of a pea or larger, take her to the vet right away.

, If you notice a very small skin mass on your dog, keep an eye on it and pay attention to how it develops over the next month. If the mass appears to be growing or spreading, you should bring your dog to the vet for a diagnosis. You should also note if the mass does not go away after a few weeks, as this could be a sign of a serious medical issue.Pay attention to how the skin mass develops in terms of feel. If the skin mass starts to feel hard or less movable under your dog’s skin, you should bring your pet to the vet for a diagnosis.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Consider allergies.,
Ask about nausea.,
Determine if it is a neurological condition.,
Create a treatment plan.,
Check for cognitive dysfunction.",How to Deal with Excessive Licking in Older Dogs1," If your dog begins excessive licking in old age, or at any time, you should take your dog to the vet. Excessive licking is a possible symptom for a number of different treatable medical conditions. Take your dog to the vet and explain when the licking first began, and what area of the body, or objects the dog is licking. Possible causes for licking include:Allergies.
Boredom.
Dry Skin.
Hormonal imbalance.
Pain.
Parasites.;
, Some excessive licking among dogs is caused by allergies. For example, your dog may have an allergic reaction to their food or something they ate. They could also experience an allergic reaction to environmental triggers, such as pollen or mold in the air. Allergies in dogs typically result in a skin irritation, rather than sneezing or a runny nose, so licking can be a common indicator of an allergic response.For example, your dog may begin licking their paws because they have been exposed to an allergen.
Visit your vet in order to diagnose the problem and treat with antibiotics, steroids, anti-itch products, or by changing their food.

, Excessive licking, typically of the air, can also be a symptom of nausea, which can be associated with more serious illnesses in older dogs. Nausea can trigger the production of excess saliva, which will cause the dog to lick in an attempt to remove the buildup.For example, diseases that cause gastrointestinal discomfort and nausea include: liver disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, inflamed bowels, and intestinal problems.
Take your dog to the vet and have them run tests to determine if the licking is associated with nausea. Tests may include x-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, blood tests, skin allergy testing, or even endoscopy, if necessary., Excessive licking, primarily among older dogs, can be associated with neurological disorders. For instance, the licking could be associated with a brain tumor, epilepsy, or hydrocephalus. These conditions are more common in older dogs and can often be connected to the progressive nature of the condition. The licking may be a result of a neurological disorder if:It is extremely difficult to interrupt the compulsive licking.
If the dog seems disoriented while licking.
Other symptoms such as seizures or circling are observed in context with the licking

, Once your vet has identified the medical issue that has caused the excessive licking by your older dog, you should come up with a treatment plan. Ask your doctor how best to treat the condition. You will likely need to provide your dog with some form of medical treatment, which may include surgery, medicine, or a dietary change. Read and follow the instructions that are provided with all medications and talk with your doctor about post-surgery care.


Talk with your doctor about how to care for your dog now that the condition has been identified.
Ask the following questions: ""How much exercise should my dog get?"" ""Can they eat their regular food?"" ""Is there anything I can do to make them comfortable?""

, Problems including senility and dementia can also cause excess licking behaviors in dogs. Other indicators of cognitive dysfunction may include disorientation, irritability, decreased desire to play, inability to learn new tasks, decreased self-grooming, incontinence, and loss of appetite.Diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction should be made by a vet. They will go through the dog's history an current symptoms with you to see if this may be the cause of your dog's licking.
While there is no cure for cognitive dysfunction, therapy, medication, and support can help your dog maintain a close-to-normal life and may help reduce some symptoms.

Remove the splinter with tweezers.,
Clean the affected area again.,
Determine if the paw needs to be bandaged.,
Apply triple antibiotic ointment to the affected area.,
Secure the gauze pad to your dog’s paw.,
Wrap cotton gauze around your dog’s paw.,
Wrap a self-adhesive bandage over the cotton gauze.,
Prevent your dog from removing the bandage.,
Remove the bandage after one to two days.",How to Treat Dog Splinters," Depending on how deeply embedded they are in the skin, splinters are not always easy to see right away. Your dog will probably let you know with his body language where the splinter is. For example, your dog may continually paw at his mouth to try to remove a splinter in a particular paw. He may also lick and bite at whichever area has the splinter. If your dog is holding up one of his legs or is hesitant to put weight on a certain paw, the splinter is probably in that paw.


Splinters typically do not cause a lot of bleeding, so you may not be able to find the splinter by looking for a wound that’s bleeding.
In addition to using your eyes, use your hands to gently touch his paws to find exactly where the splinter is. Talk gently and softly with your dog while you are doing this to reassure him that he will be okay.;
, Before attempting to remove the splinter, the area around the splinter should be cleaned thoroughly to prevent infection. Use warm, soapy water and a clean towel to clean the area.The area where the splinter is located is probably very painful, so be gentle when you are cleaning the area.
It may be helpful to fill a shallow bucket with the warm, soapy water. In this way, you could let your dog’s paw soak in the water, which may feel very soothing to him. Use a small towel to clean his paw while it is soaking.
Use another clean towel to dry his paw after you have cleaned it.

, Sterilizing your tweezers means that you are destroying microorganisms that could cause disease or infection. If your tweezers are not clean, you could cause a skin infection in the area where you remove the splinter. You can sterilize your tweezers by dipping them in rubbing alcohol.After you sterilize the tweezers, set them on a clean paper towel so that they can dry and remain clean before you use them.

, After you have your dog’s paw in your hand, get as good a grip as you can on the protruding end of the splinter with the tweezers. If the splinter is embedded too deeply into the skin, it will be very difficult to remove the splinter with your tweezers; if this is the case, you can sterilize a small needle and use the needle to pry the splinter up from under the skin. If you still cannot grip the splinter after using the needle, take your dog to your vet so that they can remove the splinter.Just like with cleaning your dog’s paw, be gentle when you are removing the splinter. Your dog is going to be pain while you’re doing this, so talk to him in gentle and soothing tones to reduce his anxiety.
Be careful not to push the splinter further into the skin, or break the splinter, when trying to pull it out.If either of these things happens, take your dog to the vet so that they can remove the splinter for you.

, Just like with cleaning the affected area before removing the splinter, be gentle as you are cleaning the area after you’ve taken the splinter out. This area is still going to be sensitive and painful, so avoid vigorously cleaning the wound.Other than warm and soapy water, you can also use a solution that is 50% water and 50% hydrogen peroxide.Hydrogen peroxide is a clear liquid that can be used to clean wounds and prevent infection.
Dry the affected area with a clean and dry towel.

, Just as when you remove a splinter from your own finger, not all splinter wounds on dogs need to be bandaged after removal. If the puncture wound is tiny, and the dog is now happy to stand on the paw, then do not bandage. Instead, ease back on his exercise for a couple of days, and bathe the paw in salty water after a walk in order to remove road grit.


If after two days the area looks dry and clean, there is no pus or smelly discharge, and he is walking soundly, then you can return to normal.
Bandaging would be needed if the puncture hole is large, there is a smelly discharge from the hole, your dog still isn't fully placing weight on his paw after several minutes, or you are not confident that the whole of the splinter came out., Preventing infection will be very important after you have removed the splinter. To apply the ointment, place a thick coat of triple antibiotic ointment onto a clean, non-stick 2x2 gauze pad and gently press the pad against your dog’s paw.Alternatively, you can apply the ointment directly to the affected area on your dog's paw.


Neosporin is a triple antibiotic ointment for humans, but you can use it on your dog to treat the area from where you removed the splinter.If you choose to apply the ointment directly to the paw, you will still need to press the gauze against the paw to keep the ointment in place.

, To do this, you will need two strips of adhesive tape that are several inches long. Rather than using Scotch tape, use the white adhesive tape that you can find at your local pharmacy.While still holding your dog’s paw up, attach one strip of tape on each side of the gauze and press the tape down on your dog’s leg several inches up from the wound. This should look something like a splint., Cotton gauze is a roll of white, non-stick gauze that is available at your local pharmacy. Keep your dog’s toes uncovered as you wrap the gauze, and continue to wrap it several inches up your dog's leg. Be careful not to wrap too tightly, since this could cut off circulation. Your dog’s toes will feel cold if there is no circulation. Wrapping too tightly could also cause your dog’s toes to swell. If you notice that you have wrapped the gauze too tightly, immediately loosen the gauze and wrap again more loosely.Keeping the toes uncovered will allow you to see if they’re swollen or feel cold.
If the gauze is too difficult to tear, use scissors to cut the gauze.

, The self-adhesive bandage will keep the cotton gauze in place. You can purchase this type of bandage at your local pharmacy. As with the cotton gauze, do not wrap this bandage too tightly.Cut the bandage with scissors if you are not able to tear it.


Cover the bandage with a plastic bag when your dog goes outside to keep the bandage clean and dry., Your dog will probably try to do everything he can to remove the bandage, which could lengthen the wound-healing process. Other than keeping a close eye on him and stopping him when you see him chew at the bandage, you can put an Elizabethan collar (e-collar) around his neck.An e-collar is one of the most effective methods to keep a pet from bothering their bandage.


If he chews off the bandage, take this opportunity to inspect the affected area. If the area looks clean without signs of infection (redness, swelling, discharge), you probably will not need to reapply the bandage. If you are unsure, contact your veterinarian for advice.
If your dog has managed to remove the bandage, he may have also licked the Neosporin. Neosporin can be toxic to dogs, causing signs such as vomiting, drooling, and loss of appetite. If you observe these signs after your dog has removed the bandage, contact the Pet Poison Hotline or your veterinarian immediately., The wound caused by a splinter is typically not very serious, so it is not necessary to keep the bandage on for an extended period of time. However, if you notice that the affected area hasn’t healed after several days, take your dog to your vet for closer examination.When you remove the bandage and clean off the excess triple antibiotic ointment, the affected area should look clean without any swelling. You should not see any redness or any type of discharge coming from the wound.
If you see swelling, redness, or discharge, it is quite possible that the wound has become infected. Take your dog to your vet for further treatment.

Note your dog’s behavior.,
Monitor the mass for changes.,
Notice if your dog appears physically ill. One symptom of a more serious medical issue due to a tumor in your pet is signs of physical illness, such as vomiting or diarrhea.,
Check for blood in your dog’s stool.,
Note if your dog has a loss of appetite and appears lethargic.",How to Diagnose Skin Masses on Dogs2," If your dog has a skin mass and it is causing him discomfort, then he may do things to try and make himself feel better. For example, if you notice that your dog is licking or scratching at the lump, then this could be a sign that it is painful or uncomfortable.

, If a mass on your dog’s body is something to be worried about, then it will probably change in size, shape, or appearance quickly. Monitor the lump by checking it once per day or a few times per week. If you notice that a mass on your dog’s body has grown in size, changed shape, or become red and irritated looking, then take your dog to see a veterinarian right away.


Taking photos of the lump and/or measuring it can help you to track any changes with more accuracy than just looking at it. Try snapping a photo of the mass and write down the diameter to help you see if it is changing or growing.

, Your dog may display these symptoms soon after the skin mass appears or a few days after it appears.If your dog displays these symptoms, you should bring her to the vet right away for a diagnosis. The sooner the skin mass is examined and diagnosed, the quicker your dog can get the treatment she needs.

, Another worrisome symptom in your pet is finding blood in your dog’s urine or feces. You may look at your dog’s stool after she has gone to the bathroom to check for this symptom. If you notice this issue, you should bring your dog to the vet right away., You should also pay attention to your dog’s demeanor and notice any drastic changes, such as a loss of appetite and low energy. Your dog may not eat for a few days in a row or show little interest in foods she usually enjoys.You may also notice your dog appears lethargic and sluggish. She may not want to go for her usual walks or be interested in playing with you like she usually does. These may be signs she has a medical issue due to the skin mass and needs to be examined by your vet.

Provide your dog’s medical history.,
Let your vet do a physical exam of your dog.,
Allow your dog's vet to perform a biopsy.,
Discuss your dog’s treatment options.",How to Diagnose Skin Masses on Dogs3," Once you bring your dog into your vet, your vet will ask you a series of questions about your dog’s medical history. Try to answer these questions to the best of your ability and provide detailed information on your dog’s symptoms. Your answers will help your vet get a better sense of your dog’s condition.For example, your vet may ask: “How long as the growth been on your dog? Has it gotten smaller or larger over time? How fast is it growing? How many skin masses are on your dog? Has your dog experienced any injuries or recent traumas? Have there been any changes in your pet’s behavior or demeanor?”

, Your vet will do a complete physical exam of your pup, paying special attention to examining the skin mass. They will feel the skin mass and look closely at how the skin mass appears on your dog’s skin., A biopsy is when the veterinarian surgically removes a small sample of tissue from the mass. This sample will be sent to the lab to determine what types of cells are present. A biopsy is an important part of the diagnostic process, so this may be your veterinarian's first suggestion for diagnosing a mass. This test may be necessary if the diagnosis of the mass is inconclusive or if the lump is suspected to be cancerous. In this case, removing the lump and having it analyzed is the best option.


In some cases, a fine needle aspirate may be performed. This is when the vet collects a few cells from the lump by putting a needle into it.
If an infection is suspected as the cause of the problem, then the vet will swab any discharge from the mass or send a small piece of tissue away for culture to identify the bugs present.

, The treatment for the skin mass will depend on your dog’s diagnosis. If the skin mass is benign and just a lipoma, or buildup of fatty tissue, you may not need to do anything. Often, lipomas go away on their own. If the lipoma is large and restricting your dog’s movements, your vet may recommend surgery to remove it.If the skin mass is diagnosed as a tumor, your vet may recommend surgery to have it removed as soon as possible. Smaller tumors that are removed right away will increase your dog’s chances of recovery and reduce her risk of developing cancer."

Determine the trigger.,
Create a comforting environment.,
Play with them daily.,
Remain calm while your dog is sick.",How to Deal with Excessive Licking in Older Dogs2," Excessive licking among older dogs can also be associated with compulsive behavioral disorders that are triggered by anxiety or conflict. As your dog ages, they may become more disoriented and anxious. Excessive licking may develop as a compulsive behavior associated with stress. Try and determine what is causing this behavior.For example, does your dog lick while you are out of the house? Perhaps this is a result of separation anxiety.
Maybe they stop and lick themselves when you say “come” because they are unsure if they will be scolded or praised.
Try and determine the pattern associated with the compulsive behavior and treat accordingly.

, If you find your dog’s licking is associated with separation, try to create a comforting environment for them when you leave. There are a number of things you can do to reduce your dog’s stress and anxiety while they are left alone. Try these tips:


Give them a treat to occupy their attention when you leave the house.
Provide music and lighting to stimulate them while they are alone.
Give them their favourite toy or an article of clothing that smells like you to comfort them.

, Some older dogs may begin a compulsive behavior, such as licking, out of boredom. Many pet owners will stop playing with and exercising their dog as they get older. They believe that the animal is unable to exert energy and needs to rest. In reality you should continue to stimulate your dog daily. This can help prevent neurological disorders.


Take your dog for a short walk every day.
Engage in gentle play with your dog for at least 10 minutes twice daily.

, If your dog is suffering from anxiety, it is important that you remain patient and calm. Dogs can feel the energy of their human companions. Try to remain calm and be a comforting source for your dog. Here are a few things that you can do to help relax your dog:


Take deep breaths when you are anxious.
Talk in a soft and gentle tone around your dog.
Make deliberate and predictable movements around your aging dog.

If your dog is bleeding heavily, take him to the vet.,
Use a sterile gauze swab to apply pressure to the wound.,
Check your dog to see if they have rapid, shallow breathing.,
If your dog displays any weakness, pale gums, or loses consciousness, take him to the vet.,
Search for any large wounds or flaps of skin on your dog.,
Use sachets of sterile saline from a first aid kit to flush the wound.,
Clean any wounds as best as you can before heading to the vet.,
If your dog is bright, alert, and the wound is not bleeding, you can clean the wound at home.,
Clip the fur around the wound.,
Bathe the wound in saline solution.,
Ask someone to assist you as you clean your dog’s wound.,
If your dog has puncture wounds, bring him to the vet.,
Ask your vet to assess the extent of the bite and determine if sutures are needed.,
Allow your vet to suture the wound.,
Get pain relief medication from your vet.,
Ask your vet if antibiotics are needed.",How to Treat Dog Bite Wounds on Dogs," Blood pumping from the wound is a sign that an artery or large vein has been damaged. The blood vessel may need to be ligated (tied off) in a surgical procedure done by your vet.;
, Do this as a first aid measure on the way to the vet. You will find sterile gauze swabs in a first aid kit.


If you don’t have a first aid kit handy, you can use an article of clothing like a cotton t-shirt to create a pad and press it against the wound with sufficient pressure to stop the bleeding. After 5 minutes, cautiously lift the pad up. If the bleeding starts again, replace the pad and hold it in place until you arrive at the vet clinic.Use a cotton t-shirt rather than a wool sweater or anything fuzzy, as fibers from these materials can get into the wound.

, This is a possible indication of shock, which can be life-threatening in it's own right, or that a tooth has penetrated into your dog’s chest and is allowing air to enter the thoracic cavity. Take them to the vet clinic as soon as possible.


If you can see a wound over your dog’s ribs, place a pad (a sterile gauze swab or a folded cotton t-shirt) over the wound and either hold it there, or secure it in place with a tie or belt, tied around the dog's chest. You are trying to seal off the hole to prevent air from entering your dog’s chest and causing his lungs to collapse.

, There are all signs of possible shock or internal bleeding. Stop any obvious hemorrhage with sterile gauze or a cotton pad, cover the dog with a coat or blanket to keep him warm, and make your way to the vet clinic., If your dog was shaken in the jaws of their attacker, a large wound or skin flap may have been torn away from the underlying tissues.

, If you do not have access to a first aid kit with saline, you can make a salt water solution.


Use 16 ounces of previously boiled water and stir in one teaspoon of salt. Allow the solution to cool to body temperature and then soak cotton wool in the salt water, and use it to clean your dog's injuries.
If you do not have access to sterile saline or time to make a salt water solution and your dog's wound warrants a trip to the vet, don't worry about this step. Your vet will be sure to thoroughly flush the area.

, To clean the wound, snip the corner off a saline sachet and squirt the fluid over the wound. This flushes away contaminants and reduces the risk of infection setting in. Reserve a small volume of saline and use it to moisten the sterile dressing pad in the first aid kit. Place the moist dressing pad over the wound and bandage it in place. This keeps the exposed tissue moist on the way to the clinic and in optimal condition for suturing., A nip or skin wound is fine to treat at home. Once you clean the wound, you can contact your vet to confirm if the dog should be brought in to be checked.

, To see the full extent of the damage, use a pair of scissors, ideally with curved blades, to trim the hair away from the wound edges. Start trimming at the wound edge and snip around the area until the whole wound is exposed. Repeat this for all the bite wounds you can see.Keep the blades parallel to the dog's skin, and look carefully to make sure you are not about to snip any skin. You may want to keep the scissors a fraction of an inch above the dog's skin to prevent accidental injury.
Curved scissors help you to avoid accidental snips because the blade curves away from the skin. You can improvise with a pair of nail scissors if you do not have curved scissors.
If you use a small pair of regular scissors, work with the tips rather than the whole blade for finer control.

, Saline solution is ideal because it is sympathetic to the exposed tissue and will not dry it out.


If you do not have access to a first aid kit with saline, you can make a salt water solution. Use 16 ounces of previously boiled water and stir in one teaspoon of salt. Allow the solution to cool to body temperature and then soak cotton wool in the salt water, and use it to clean the injuries.

, Your dog will likely wiggle around and get jumpy or cranky as you try to assess and clean the bite, so ask a friend or neighbor to hold his head to steady him.


If you cannot get someone to assist you, use a tie or cord as a muzzle. To do this, wind the tie around and around his muzzle with his mouth shut, and then tie the ends on themselves., Puncture wounds are usually circular and measure less than a quarter of an inch across. These wounds are inflicted by the attacker’s canine teeth and do not always need to be sutured as they may heal on their own. But it’s best to get the puncture wound checked by a vet, because sometimes there is a pocket of dead space beneath the puncture.


Dead Space occurs when the skin is wrenched away from the underlying tissues and is no longer attached. This forms a pocket, into which seepage of serum, or pus, can prevent healing. Dead Space may need surgical attention to tack it down, in order for the wound to heal., If the wound does not need suturing, you can expect it to scab over, and a week or so later the scab will peel away to reveal healed tissue underneath.


Check the scabbed area every day to ensure it is dry and there is no pus present. Daily bathing with a cotton wool ball soaked in saline helps to keep the area clean and reduce the risk of infection. If the area starts to swell, or pus is discharging from the wound, consult with your vet.

, Wounds longer than half an inch may need suturing. This can often be done under sedation and local anesthetic, unless the dog is aggressive or the wound in a difficult to access,in which case general anesthesia is required.


Your veterinarian freshens the wound edges to provide a healthy healing surface and then places sutures. These stay in place for 10-14 days and can be removed without sedation, since it is a non painful procedure to snip the suture and pull it out.
Check the sutures every day to make sure the area is dry, there is no pus discharge and it is not swollen. If the wound gets muddy, keep it clean by gently bathing it with cotton wool soaked in salty water.
Make sure your dog can not lick at the wound, which may mean covering the wound with a T-shirt or putting a buster collar on the dog. If the wound becomes red, swollen, or there is a pus discharge, check in with your vet.

, Your dog is likely to be bruised and sore, and 4- 5 days of pain relief will be a much needed kindness for him. Usually, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are supplied. These act by inhibiting the release of chemical messengers (cyclooxygenases) in the body that encourage inflammation and pain.This medication will come as a liquid and should be given with or after food in order to reduce the risk of gastric ulceration.
The dose is 0.1mg/kg given orally once a day. A typical dose is 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz) of meloxicam (1.5mg/ml strength) for each 15 kg of body weight., Depending on the vet, they may or may not prescribe antibiotics, but dog bites are not sterile so antibiotics are a wise precaution.


A broad spectrum antibiotic like a potentiated amoxycillin can work against the bugs commonly found in a dog's mouth. This antibiotic acts by interfering with the bacterial metabolism and also disrupts their cell membrane.
A typical dose is 12.5mg/kg twice a day orally for 5-7 days. So, for example, a 20 kg dog takes a 250mg tablet twice a day."

Check your dog’s pulse.,
Look for signs of heart failure.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Have your vet listen to your dog’s heart.,
Allow your vet to take chest x-rays.,
Agree to a heart ultrasound.,
Let your vet perform an electrocardiogram.,
Discuss the need for a blood sample.",How to Diagnose Cardiac Disease in Senior Dogs," Coughing is usually the first noticeable sign of cardiac disease in dogs. When the heart isn’t working properly, fluid may build up in the lungs, causing coughing. Also, a diseased heart may enlarge and put pressure on the windpipe, triggering coughing.Your senior dog may have a dry, hacking cough if it has cardiac disease.;
, With cardiac disease, blood can get backed up in the lung’s blood vessels. This can increase the pressure inside these vessels, causing small amounts of fluid to leak out of the vessels and into the airways.This fluid buildup in the airways can make breathing difficult.


If your senior dog has cardiac disease, it may start breathing rapidly or having difficulty breathing.Difficulty breathing would be indicated by increased efforts to inhale and/or exhale.

, Blood coming from the heart carries oxygen, which the muscles and organs need to work efficiently. If your dog has cardiac disease, that oxygen-rich blood coming from the heart can’t get to the rest of the body very well. Therefore, during exercise, your dog’s muscles won’t get enough oxygen, causing your dog to tire out more quickly.Your dog may be able to exercise for only a few minutes before needing to rest.
After a while, your dog may not want to exercise at all because it won’t have enough energy.

, Your dog’s pulse is what you feel when you place your fingers on one of your dog’s major arteries (blood vessels carrying blood away from the heart). In a dog with a healthy heart, the pulse will feel strong (but not bounding) and steady. However, if your dog has cardiac disease, its pulse may be rapid and weak.With cardiac disease, the heart may beat faster to try to get blood out to the rest of the body. However, the blood flow will not be very good, leading to a weak pulse.

, Heart failure is not a disease by itself. Rather, it is the final stage of heart disease, when the heart can no longer meet the body’s blood circulation needs.Signs of heart failure include blue or purple gums, a decreased appetite, weight loss, and an enlarged belly.The gums would be blue or purple because they are not receiving enough oxygen from the blood.
An enlarged belly would be due to a large accumulation of fluid.

, Sometimes, cardiac disease in dogs develops for years before any symptoms of the disease become noticeable. If you start seeing signs of cardiac disease in your dog, the disease may already be fairly advanced.Do not delay in taking your dog to the vet. During your appointment, provide your vet with some history of your dog’s symptoms:


What symptoms you’ve noticed
When you first noticed the symptoms
If the symptoms have gotten worse

, In addition to performing a regular physical exam, your vet will pay extra attention to your dog’s heart. With a stethoscope, your vet will listen to your dog’s heart to detect heart murmurs, which are abnormal heart beats. In senior dogs, a heart murmur usually occurs when the heart’s valves, which control blood flow through the heart’s chambers, aren’t working properly.Your vet will also be able to hear if your dog’s heart beat is too fast or too slow., To make a diagnosis of cardiac disease, your vet will also need to look at your dog’s heart. An easy way to do this is with a chest x-ray. A chest x-ray will also allow your vet to see the size and shape of your dog’s heart, as well as evaluate your dog’s lungs.For one type of cardiac disease in dogs, called dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart’s chambers get bigger and the heart’s muscles get weaker.Your vet would be able to see this enlargement on an x-ray.
If your dog has advanced cardiac disease in which the airways have a buildup of fluids, your vet would be able to see this change in the lungs on an x-ray.

, A heart ultrasound is called an echocardiogram. This procedure allows your vet to see your dog’s heart as it beats.This will help your vet determine which heart valves are not working properly, as well as get a ‘real time’ view of the heart's size and shape.


Mitral valve disease is the most common type of cardiac disease that vets see.The mitral valve controls blood flow from the left atrium (top chamber) to the left ventricle (lower chamber).
The tricuspid valve, which controls blood flow from the right atrium to right ventricle, can also stop working properly., The heart has electrical activity that helps control how blood flows through and out of the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart’s electrical activity.When performing the ECG, your vet will be able to:Analyze the heart rhythm
Detect abnormalities with the heart rhythm
Potentially determine if your dog’s heart is enlarged

, A blood test called pro-BNP can sometimes be helpful in diagnosing cardiac disease in dogs.BNP is a protein found in the heart ventricles. It helps regulate blood pressure. Increased levels of BNP can indicate cardiac disease.This blood test may not be necessary if your vet can diagnose cardiac disease using the other diagnostic tests.

Decide if you want to splint the leg.,
Gather materials.,
Cover the area with gauze.,
Wrap the splint in place.,
Monitor for swelling.",How to Treat Broken Bones in Dogs1," If the leg is obviously broken and no bones are sticking through the skin, you can splint the leg. You should only consider splinting the leg if you cannot get to the vet right away or it is a long journey to the vet. Splinting is a controversial practice because if done incorrectly, it applies pressure to the ends of the broken bone and can cause more pain for your dog. However, if done correctly, it stops the bones moving, gives them further support, and helps ease discomfort.


Be aware that handling the broken leg will be painful, so you may need to muzzle the dog to stop him from biting in self defense.
Splinting works best if the fracture is below the elbow or the knee. The big muscles groups of the shoulder and hip get in the way of bandages and cause them to slip down, which can cause a problem if the break is in the humerus (upper arm) or thigh (femur). Those fractures are best left unsupported and the dog kept caged until you can get help.;
, Make sure you have the proper materials to splint your dog's broken bone before starting. To splint limb, you need a firm straight object that is the same length as the broken bone. Household items such as a wooden spoon, wooden spatula, or ruler can be used, depending on the dog's size.


You also need some gauze and self-adhesive tape.

, Before you place a splint on the dog’s leg, cover the area with gauze. Wrap a layer of gauze bandage firmly around the limb from the paw, up over the fracture site, and up over the joint above the fracture. Wind the gauze in a spiral fashion with each loop overlapping the previous one.Covering the area in gauze helps prevent the splint rubbing the skin and causing sores.

, Hold the splint over the fracture site. Wrap dressing tape around the splint and leg to tape the splint firmly in place. Now apply a spiral layer of bandage over the top of the splint, applied firmly but not tight. Finish with a layer of self-adhesive bandage. This all helps to immobilise the joints above and below the splint and hold the splint in place.Use enough pressure on the tape so that the fit is snug, but not tight.

, After splinting the leg, you should monitor the paw closely for any signs of swelling. Swelling can indicate the dressing is too tight. If the paw is swollen, you should release the dressing immediately. Lack of circulation to the limb can cause tissue death and gangrene.Keep the dressing dry.
Never use a splint in place of professional vet treatment for broken bones. Take your dog to get professional veterinary help as soon as possible.

Ask your vet for health supplement recommendations.,
Get dosage instructions from your vet.,
Schedule three or six monthly check ups with the vet.,
Look for a supplement that addresses joint problems in older dogs.,
Use a supplement to treat your dog’s digestive health.,
Go for a supplement to prevent hair loss.,
Use a supplement to address memory issues.,
Check the label of the supplement.,
Read the ingredients list.,
Note if the supplement has been tested by the FDA.,
Research the seller of the supplement.",How to Choose Health Supplements for Older Dogs," You may ask your vet, “What type of supplement is best for my older dog?” and “Do you recommend a certain brand?” Your vet should know about your dog’s medical history and be able to help you determine the best supplement for their needs.You should also tell your vet if you are feeding your dog specially formulated dog food, as some dog foods already contain supplements for their health. Your vet may recommend certain supplements based on your dog’s diet as well as their medical history.;
, Giving your dog too much of a supplement at a time can lead to health issues. Speak to your vet about the proper dosage for your dog based on their medical history and their medical needs. Always follow the recommended dosage so your dog is not at risk of health issues., Keep an eye on your older dog’s health by scheduling three or six monthly check ups with your vet where you discuss the use of the supplements on your pet. Notice any adverse effects on your dog due to the supplements and let your vet know right away so the type or dosage of the supplement can be adjusted.If you notice your dog is lethargic, has no appetite, or is acting differently than they did before you gave them the supplement, they may be having an adverse reaction to the supplement. Discontinue the use of the supplement and talk to your vet.

, Many older dogs suffer from joint issues like arthritis, back issues, and problems with their knees, elbows, and hips. Your dog may start to show signs of joint problems, such as difficulty walking, a limp, or a leaning to one side when they walk. They may also not be as active as they once were and be less inclined to go on long walks or to play for long periods of time.There are certain health supplements that can help to treat joint issues in older dogs. These supplements will contain glucosamine and chondroitin, which have been found to be useful in treating arthritis in humans and animals., If you notice your dog has issues like irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, allergies to certain foods, or gas and belly rumbling, they may have poor digestive health. You can address these issues by giving your dog prebiotic and probiotic supplements to make sure their intestines are healthy. These types of supplements can also help your dog’s immune system stay strong and reduce their allergies to certain foods.Many prebiotic and probiotic supplements for dogs have been designed that contain the right type of bacteria normally present in the dog's gut, since this is different than the bugs in a human's gut. These supplements use live cultures to help maintain a microbacterial balance in your dog’s intestines.

, Older dogs can have issues like hair loss and dry skin due to old age. You can address these issues in your senior pup by giving them supplements that contain ingredients to increase the amount of moisture in their skin and hair.To address hair loss and dry skin, look for supplements that contain fish oil and fatty acids. These ingredients can help to improve your dog’s coat.

, If you notice your older dog is struggling with memory loss, you may try giving them a supplement to address this. Supplements that contain vitamins C and E can help to improve cognitive function in your older dog., Start by reading the label of the supplement. Look for a lot number on the label, as this is an indication the manufacturer has done quality control checks. It will appear on the label as ""Lot #:"". You should also check for the brand name and a contact number for the manufacturer on the label. You may try calling the contact number to confirm the manufacturer is legitimate.Be wary of claims on the label that sound too good to be true. Labels that advertise the cure for cancer, hip dysplasia and parvovirus are likely not high quality. Avoid products that are labeled as specifically designed to meet the health needs of older dogs, as these types of promises are often marketing ploys.

, Check the ingredients list on the label to ensure the ingredients you need for your dog are clearly listed. For example, if you are looking for a supplement to address joint issues, you may look for glucosamine and chondroitin on the list of ingredients.You should also make sure the supplement does not contain ingredients that will be harmful to your dog, such as natural ingredients like garlic as well as certain roots and herbs such as tea tree, wormwood, comfrey, and yucca., The Federal Drug Administration oversees the regulation of animal supplements and reputable pet supplements will often be confirmed tested by the FDA. Keep in mind the FDA does not do constant monitoring of animal supplements and many supplements on the market are not confirmed safe by the FDA.You should also check that the supplement has been independently verified by a third party organization and certified as safe to use. There should be a certification listed on the label of the supplement to confirm this testing.

, Get to know the seller of the supplement to confirm it is safe to give to your dog. If you buy the supplement online, do research on the seller to confirm they are legitimate and do not have any negative consumer reports or complaints. You should also discuss your pet’s medical history and their health needs with a seller in store before you buy any supplements.Often, supplements purchased through a vet are less likely to cause issues for your pet. But you should still research the supplement on your own before giving it to your older dog, even if it comes recommended through your vet.

Recognize the symptoms of aspirin poisoning.,
Seek veterinary attention as soon as possible.,
Stabilize the dog.,
Decontaminate the dog through induced vomiting.,
Perform gastric lavage if induced vomiting is not an option.,
Give the dog medications to aid treatment.,
Learn what the maximum safe dose for dogs is.,
Take steps to prevent accidental poisoning.",How to Treat Aspirin Poisoning in Dogs," The common clinical signs associated with aspirin toxicity are the result of liver damage and lack of oxygen in the blood cells. The clinical signs are as follows:


Vomiting
Drooling
Loss of appetite
Tremors/ Seizures
Coma
Lethargy and panting
Hypoxia and difficulty breathing
Abdominal pain (owner can spot it by an arched back).
Brown discoloration of the gums due to production of methemoglobin, followed by blue discoloration indicating an inadequate oxygen supply.
In severe cases, shock and collapse.;
, Aspirin poisoning in dogs can be treated effectively through early detection and aggressive treatment.


The basic objectives of the treatment are to stabilize the animal, decontaminate them, convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and prevent the failure of liver (necrosis).
As an owner, you are advised to consult with your veterinarian immediately, as the prognosis is poor in the case of severe methemoglobinemia or hepatic damage.

, Aspirin poisoning may result in oxygen deprivation, hyperthermia, bleeding from ulcers, and/or systemic acidosis, so before treatment can be given, the animal must first be stabilized.


If the animal is suffering from hypoxia and goes into a coma, it is recommended to give assisted ventilation and an artificial oxygen supply. Some toxic patients may show signs of seizures (inter-changeable convulsion). This can be treated with diazepam @ 0.5-1.0 mg/kg intravenously with an increment up to 5-10 mg/kg.
In case of hemorrhage and bleeding, intravenous fluids such as whole blood (2-5 mg/kg/minutes in dog) can be given to prevent dehydration and shock. Electrolyte therapy is also indicated to manage renal function and hypotension after assessing the degree of dehydration. Sodium bicarbonate can also be administered via IV infusion to prevent systemic acidosis.

, Emesis, or vomiting, should be induced to evacuate the aspirin from the digestive tract for rapid results. Never attempt to decontaminate your dog at home without consulting your vet.


3% Hydrogen peroxide (1-3ml/kg) is orally administered to induce vomiting in your dog. The dose of hydrogen peroxide is a maximum of 45 mL for all ages and weights of dog.
The affected dog should vomit within 15 minutes. However, you should be aware that vomiting is contraindicated in some dogs.

, Gastric lavage can be performed if the patient is contraindicated for emesis, but this is less effective than emesis.


Activated charcoal (2-3 grams/kg) is most frequently used for gastric lavage in dogs to absorb the aspirin compounds. A laxative (e.g. castor oil, bisacodyl, magnesium sulphate, or hydroxide) should be used in combination with the activated charcoal to speed up the passing of the aspirin. However, the use of laxatives is contraindicated in the case of dehydrated dogs and those suffering from diarrhea.

, Unfortunately, there is no specific therapy (antidote) for aspirin poisoning in dogs. N-acetylcysteine is frequently recommended by many veterinarians as it directly binds with aspirin compounds and eliminates them. It can also reduce the extent of liver damage and the formation of Methemoglobin by binding the reactive metabolic substances of aspirin.


N-acetylcysteine (5%) solution at a loading dose of 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg orally is recommended for the treatment of aspirin poisoning. The therapy should be continued every 4 hours for at least 3-5 consecutive doses of acetylcysteine.
Vitamin C preparations like ascorbic acid (30 mg/kg orally) are also recommended to enhance the reserve system of methemoglobin restoration. The hepato-toxicity can be treated with cimetidine @ 5-10 mg/kg, IV every 8 hours, and this may continue for up to 4 weeks.

, Most veterinarians recommend a maximum of 15 to 20 mg/kg of aspirin over a 48 hour period, for a maximum of 3 weeks.


Use of aspirin in 25 mg/kg doses three times daily can cause gastric ulceration in 50% of dogs within two days.
Acute toxicity with gastro-intestinal tract disturbances, panting, hypothermia, and even coma can occur as a result of the accidental ingestion of more than 400 to 500 mg/kg.

, Try to keep all medicine out of your pet's reach. Avoid dropping medication on the floor or leaving the bottle within your dog's reach.


Always check with your vet before giving aspirin to your dog, even in small doses.

Keep the wound clean.,
Make the dog lie down on the uninjured side.,
Apply gentle pressure to bleeding.,
Take the dog to the vet as soon as possible.",How to Treat Broken Bones in Dogs2," If bone is sticking out through the skin, do not attempt to splint the leg. Instead, keep the ends of the bone and the skin wound as clean as possible. Lay a sterile gauze bandage from a first aid kit over the open wound. If you don't have any gauze handy, place any clean cotton garment, such as a T-shirt or a handkerchief, over the area.The goal is to prevent bacteria from the atmosphere further contaminating the wound.

, Encourage your dog to lie down on the uninjured side, with the leg with the open wound on top. Attempt to keep the leg straight from the hip instead of letting it flap down. To do this, roll up a towel or a piece of clothing and place it underneath the leg to provide something for it to rest on.


Be very gentle when you place the towel beneath the dog’s leg. Moving the leg will cause pain, so take care to cause as little pain as possible.

, Open wounds may present the added problem of bleeding. If your dog’s open wound is bleeding, apply gentle, easy pressure to try to stop the bleeding.Hold a clean towel or gauze against the wound until it stops.

, Take your dog to the vet as soon as you can. When you put him in your vehicle, make sure to prop the leg up straight using the towel. You can have someone sit in the back with him if you can to help. Make sure to drive carefully, avoiding unnecessary bumps.Open fractures are painful so don't be surprised if a normally placid or sweet dog attempts to snap at you. Stay calm, and if necessary, muzzle him or have another person hold his head.

Drooling excessively (hypersalivation)
Weakness
Difficulties with breathing (shallow, rapid), stridor (harsh breathing sounds)
Gums turning paler
Overly excited or lethargic
Elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and poor pulse
Cold limbs
Seizures
Unconsciousness and ultimately coma and death if left untreated.;
, Tell the veterinarian what has happened, let them know that you are bringing in your dog immediately and follow any instructions given to you over the phone.

, There is very little time--your dog needs immediate emergency veterinary attention, including intravenous injections of epinephrine (adrenalin) to counteract the reaction.You will not have what is needed to treat anaphylactic shock in your home.

, Grab a neighbor if nobody else is at home. While getting to the vet's, try to do the following:


Keep your dog calm and reassured. Do not play radio or music in the car at a loud volume. Speak soothingly; try really hard not to convey your own panic to the dog.
If your dog is still able to move, let your dog find his own most comfortable position--likely he will adjust to the position that helps him breathe as much as possible.Cover your dog in something warm such as a blanket. Do not wrap it around him or distress him by fiddling, shifting him, disturbing him in any way.
Keep your dog's airway clear. This is especially important if he falls unconscious.

,
Epinephrine will be given to increase the heart rate.
Other drugs may be given, according to the vet's discretion. Oxygen may be given also.
Antibiotics are often given after rescuing a dog from an episode of anaphylactic shock, to prevent the chance of a secondary bacterial infection.

, The vet staff will continue to monitor his progress with blood samples, etc. Your dog will only be allowed home when he can urinate properly."

Be prepared for long-term effects from the snake bite.",How to Treat a Snakebite on a Dog," This is important if you live in an area that has venomous snakes. Clear away brush piles and undergrowth. You want to minimize the places that a snake will hide.Also make your yard unattractive to rodents. If you have rodents in your yard, and you live in an area that generally has snakes, then snakes will be attracted to the area. Keep food, including bird seed, out of your yard, so that rodents are not attracted there.;
, There are some dogs that are more likely to get a snake bite. With this in mind, you should take preventive measures to avoid the potential for snakebites happening to your dogs.


Dogs are naturally inquisitive when young and puppies often think a snake is a moving toy. Keep an eye on puppies or young dogs when in areas populated by snakes.
Hunting dogs are at greater risk because of their instinct to hunt. When young and agile, they may be able to attack a snake and succeed in killing it before the snake bites. However, as the dog's agility lessens with old age, the outcome may not be so successful and older hunting dogs tend to get bitten.

, Snakes are more active in the warmer months and tend to hibernate during winter.Early spring bites will carry the most potency, as the snake's venom glands have built up during hibernation.


Remember, prevention is always better than cure; it makes sense to take precautions to avoid snakebite in the first place.
Keep dogs out of long grass or shade shrubberies where snakes are likely to lie hidden.

, Being bitten by a snake causes a range of problems of varying severity. At the milder end of the scale is the pain and discomfort caused by a penetrating bite, which can include soreness, inflammation, and pain locally on the skin. On the other end, a snake bite can lead to death.


Depending on the snake's species, the toxin it injects may either be a neurotoxin (affecting the nervous system) or a hemotoxin (affecting the blood and circulation). This can lead to rapid paralysis (neurotoxin), including the muscles of respiration so the victim slowly suffocates, or a life-threatening inability to clot blood, organ failure and shock (hemotoxin)., This depends on whether they have recently bitten something else, and also on the time of year.Observe the pet closely, but if in any doubt seek veterinary attention.


It is better to travel to the vet's to discover the dog is fine, than wait until symptoms appear by which time treatment could be too late.

, Bear in mind that some of the symptoms are general, such as vomiting, which means that it is not the case that every vomiting dog has been bitten by a snake. These general signs become significant if the dog also has puncture marks, possible exposure to snakes, and rapidly developing symptoms. Here are some of the symptoms to be expected when a dog is bitten by a venomous snake:


Trembling
Vomiting
Salivation, drooling, frothing
Diarrhea
Weakness in the back legs, unsteadiness
Dilated pupils
Respiratory distress
Bloody urine
Continuous bleeding from the bite wound
A flaccid paralysis leading to coma or respiratory failure
Death can occur within 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the type of snake venom and the amount of venom injected.

, This can be very helpful if the venom from a snake in your area has unique symptoms. For example, a bite from a Coral snake may be painless, and it can take up to 18 hours before symptoms develop. This means it's all too easy to be lulled into a false sense of security and assume the dog is OK. Instead, the opposite is true and you should use the time to seek veterinary treatment., If you see the snake, do NOT approach the snake. It is not recommended under most circumstances that you try to kill the snake yourself; you could end up a casualty or waste the precious time you need to save your dog.

, Pay attention to it's head shape, approximate length, color, and pattern. In the US the commonest cause of venomous snake bite is the rattlesnake but other significant snakes include the coral snake, Cottonmouths (Water Moccasins) Banded rock snake, Black-tailed snake, Canebrake, Diamondback snake, Massasauga, Mojave, Mottled rock snake, Pacific snake, Pygmy, Prairie snake, Red diamond and Ridge-nosed snakes.Also be aware that as a general rule of thumb venomous snakes have slit shaped pupils (like a cat) and non-venomous snakes have round pupils (like a dog). Of course, do not get close enough to look if you aren't certain!

, If you can do so safely, take a photo with your phone or with any camera you have handy. If the snake is aggressive and moving towards you, skip the photo and retreat.


Likewise, do not prevent the snake from escaping in order to take a picture. You could end up being bitten.

, If your vet can identify the bite area, your vet can swab the bite site using a snake detection kit to identify the snake venom. However, if you can give any details about the snake or your dog's reaction to the bite, it will help.

, You need to keep a calm head and focus on your dog's health. Getting your dog help should be your primary concern, so focus on it and don't lose your composure.

, Call your veterinary clinic ahead of time and tell them you are bringing in a dog with a snakebite. This will allow the vet to prioritize treating your dog once you arrive. It may also help them to make logistics arrangements to make the admissions process smoother, such as getting you a parking spot close to the clinic and retrieving your dog's health records.


Be aware that a dog showing signs of toxicity is not a problem that you can care for at home or will not stand a good chance of survival with first aid alone. The dog is likely to require anti-venom, intravenous fluids to support failing organs, and pain relief. All of these require the intervention of a veterinary professional.

, The farther away you are from the vet and the greater the amount of venom from the bite, the worse your dog's chances of survival. However, some basic first aid will increase your dog's chances of survival, especially during the car trip to the vet's:


Apply a pressure bandage to a limb bite but do not apply a tourniquet or bandage the wound too tightly. This will restrict blood flow too much.
Do not wash the bite area or cut the wound. Do not try to suck or squeeze out the venom.
The dog is likely to be in pain and restless. However, moving around increases blood circulation and spreads the toxin more rapidly. Try to keep your dog calm (and its heart rate down) by acting calm yourself and speaking to it in a reassuring manner. Do not encourage the dog to walk, instead carry him to your car., There are many myths when it comes to treating snakebites, and taking these actions can make matters worse rather than better. Avoid trying to suck venom out, cutting the animal to make it bleed, applying a tourniquet to localize the venom, and ice-packs over the site of the bite. These are all to be avoided.

, You may feel better if you know how the vet will probably treat your dog. Although treatment depends on the type of venom and the treatment facilities available, Your vet will likely:


Determine the stage of envenomation
Examine the site of the wound
Administer a snake detection test (blood or urine sample) and analyze the results
Give your dog intravenous fluids and appropriate anti-venom

Anti-venom is administered by slow intravenous injection. In a small number of cases the dog can be allergic to the anti-venom, in which case the outlook is poor. Many vets will administer an antihistamine at around the time the antivenom is given, in order to reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which could send the dog into shock.
Intravenous fluids may be given to support the organs, especially the kidneys. Once the dog has recovered the vet may suggest monitoring its renal function with blood tests to check there was no lasting damage.Give your dog antihistamines, allergy reduction reduction drugs, painkillers, or sedatives if they are necessary

Broad spectrum antibiotics are generally given to protect against secondary infections as a result of tissue damage.In some cases the venom causes blood clotting disorders, which can lead to hemorrhage. The vet may assess the dog and decide that a blood transfusion is necessary or the administration of replacement clotting factors in order to prevent internal bleeding., The consequences of a bite can be extremely painful, and while the anti-venom can reduce the spread of the toxins, they do not deal with the pain. Expect recovery in 24 - 48 hours, but expect that your dog will take more time to get back to his old self. Set aside time to nurse your dog back to full health and ask the vet for advice.


The vet will likely use strong painkillers, such as those from the morphine family, to control the pain while the animal recovers.If the dog has nerve damage and difficulty breathing, it may need intensive care facilities, where it can be put in an oxygen tent or onto a respirator until it recovers.

, Some dogs suffer long term complications, such as damage to their kidneys. This will only reveal itself over time, and the vet will monitor your dog's renal function by taking regular blood tests.


Others recover from the toxin but suffer extensive areas of skin loss and sloughing because of damage done by swelling and the toxins. These will be managed by your veterinarian with antibiotics, pain relief, and dressing, with a view to a skin graft if necessary."
"
Get a cast.,
Undergo surgery.,
Monitor your dog carefully during recovery.",How to Treat Broken Bones in Dogs3," For some breaks, your vet may put a cast on your dog. The cast helps keep the dog’s leg at a certain angle and reduces movement. A cast can only be placed on certain locations on the body due to the way it fits on the dog. For a simple crack in the bone or a non-displaced fracture, then a cast may be sufficient.Puppies heal much more quickly than older dogs, so they may also get a cast.

, For more complex fractures or breaks, your dog may require surgery. Breaks in adult or older dogs often are repaired through open surgery. During surgery, the dog is given an anesthetic. The surgeon opens the tissues overlying the bone to gain access to the fracture.


One method used in surgery is to stabilize the bones using a metal pin which is passed up through core of the bone to realign the fractures. Alternatively, the vet may use special metal plates which are screwed either side of the fracture to hold everything in place.For exceptionally complex fractures where the bone is broken in several pieces, an internal-external fixator is used. This is where pins are placed at right angles to the bone and the pins supported on an external scaffolding system.

, Regardless of the treatment method, it is essential your dog is rested for the duration of the healing time. The recovery time for your dog will vary depending on the age and severity of the break. The recovery time can range from five weeks for a growing puppy to 12 weeks for a typical adult dog.Complications, such as movement of the implant or infection, can considerably delay healing and may raise the need for revisional surgery.
Make sure to limit your dog’s activities, give your dog any prescribed medications, and follow your vet’s post-op directions exactly to ensure a speedy recovery for your dog.

Recognize the symptoms of a broken bone.,
Limit your dog’s movement.,
Compare your dog’s legs.",How to Treat Broken Bones in Dogs4," Broken bones in dogs are most commonly associated with a trauma or accident, such as being hit by a car or falling from a height. The dog will be lame and not able to walk evenly on all four legs. He may hold the fractured legs up and limp heavily when he puts it on the ground. Your dog may whine or whimper while trying to move or walk.If your dog has broken his spine, he may be paralyzed.Some breaks are easy to spot because you see the end of the bone sticking through the skin. Other types are more subtle, such as a slight bow in the leg or even just a limp.
However, this does not mean he has definitely fractured a bone since a sprain, cut, migrated grass seed, or infection could also produce these signs.

, If you suspect that your dog has a broken bone, the first thing you should do is take measures to limit his activity. Get your dog to rest in one place. You can put the dog in his crate or encourage him to rest on his bed.If you believe your dog has broken his back, move him by putting a piece of wooden board or cardboard beneath him.
Do not take your dog out for a walk or encourage any other physical activity since putting weight on a broken bone can further separate the bone ends and worsen the fracture.

, Another way you may be able to tell if your dog has a broken bone is to compare one leg with the other. Carefully check to see if both legs look the same or if one leg is bent oddly or shorter than the opposite side.Also look for swelling joints or joints at odd angles.
If in doubt about whether your dog has a broken bone, confine the dog to his crate and call your vet for advice.

Understand your dog's anatomy.,
Know the causes of a sprained ankle.,
Look for limping.,
Look for a visible injury.,
Look for behavioral signs.,
Make your dog rest.,
Apply an ice pack.,
Apply heat.,
Watch for signs of improvement or worsening.",How to Treat a Sprained Ankle on a Dog," Dogs actually stand and walk on the toes of their front and rear legs. When a dog is standing, you will see its ankle on its hind leg between the knee and the toes. This is similar to where a your ankle is when you stand on your toes.Dogs do not have ankles on their front legs, just as you don't have them on your arms. Other types of sprains can occur in the front legs, and they are treated similarly.;
, Many dogs are athletic. The activities they take part in can put an extreme amount of force and stress on their joints and sometimes this results in an injury.Running, jumping, and making sharp and quick turns can put undue stress on a joint.
While not all dogs are equally energetic, their joints can also be put under more stress than they can handle. A sprain can also be the result of slipping, falling, stepping in a hole, or something as seemingly minor as jumping on or off the couch. Any of these can cause your dog to end up with a sprain.

, The first, and usually the most recognizable sign of an ankle sprain is limping on the affected rear leg.A dog with a sprain will often try not to put weight on the affected leg.
Depending on the severity, the dog may carry the leg in a raised position, not using it at all.
Be aware of other common reasons for rear leg lameness. Injuries to the hip, knee, or foot area can also cause a dog to limp., You may see swelling or redness around the ankle if your dog has a sprain.You may also notice your dog regularly licking the area.

, An injured dog may also display changes in its normal behavior. Changes to look for that can suggest an injury include:A change in appetite, usually apparent in decreased food consumption
A change in activity level, such as sleeping more or a reluctance to exercise
Vocalization related to the injury, such as barking, grunting, or whining when the ankle is touched or moved

, Rest is the first step to treating a sprain.To ensure your dog gets enough rest, you will need to restrict your dog's activity. You should keep the dog inside or in a small area where it is unable to run or play. The less active the dog is, the better.


As needed, you can take your dog outside on a short leash. Keep the walk short and slow.Return the dog to a confined area as soon as possible.
Restrict the dog's activity for a full 48 hours to give the injury enough time to heal.

, To reduce swelling, help with pain, and aid in the healing process, apply an ice pack for 10 to 15 minutes.Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect the dog's skin from any excessive cold.
Repeated as needed, waiting at least two hours between applications. This will help prevent irritating the skin and reducing circulation, which can delay healing.
You can use a bag of frozen vegetables, such as peas, for an ice pack that you can mold around the ankle. This will allow you to evenly and effectively apply the ice to all of the damaged tissue., If your dog has an older, chronic, or recurrent injury it is not recommended to apply an ice pack. At this stage of an injury it is best to apply moist heat.Heat will improve circulation and help to loosen tightness in the muscles while having a soothing effect.
To apply heat, use a damp towel warmed in the dryer or microwave. Be sure the towel isn't hot enough to burn the skin.
Apply heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Then, remove it for at least an hour before applying again.Don't use a heat treatment immediately after exercise.

, During the 48 hour rest period you should watch closely for signs that the injury is improving or worsening. With rest and treatment, most ankle sprains will be back to normal fairly quickly.


If the leg is not better after 48 hours or if it is getting worse, consult with your veterinarian.If you don't see improvement, it's possible that your dog may just need more rest, along with some veterinarian-prescribed medication.
Sometimes, there can also be an injury in another area that is delaying recovery. If there is a more serious injury, such as a dislocation or small fracture, your vet can do a full examination and X-rays if needed.

Look for a stinger in the wound area.,
Listen for a yelp.,
Try to keep your dog from licking the area.,
Look for the signs of a typical reaction.,
Watch for signs of an anaphylactic reaction.",How to Treat a Dog for Bee Stings1," Each individual bee can only sting once because when he stings something, he embeds the stinger in his victim. This means that if your pet is stung by a bee, you will most likely be able to see a stinger sticking out of his skin.The stinger looks like a small barb, or thorn, and may have a blob of fleshy tissue at the end of it (this is where is was attached to the bee’s abdomen). The stinger contains toxins that can irritate the skin and cause pain and swelling.
If you can pick the stinger out right away, your dog is likely to experience less pain and swelling. This is because the stinger continues to pump toxins into the area long after the sting has occurred.;
, If your dog was playing with an insect in the yard and suddenly yelps loudly for no apparent reason, there is a good chance that he has been stung. Along with the yelp, he may also appear cowed, meaning he has his tail between his legs and his ears are down.


Quickly look around the yard to see if there is anything else your dog could have hurt himself on. Look for sharp rocks on the ground and objects that could have cut him.
Check your dog to see if he has any injuries, such as a lame leg or a cut. If you can’t find any dangerous objects and your dog doesn’t have any outright injuries, there is a good chance he was stung by an insect.

, If you see your dog beginning to lick a certain area, stop him so that you can look for a stinger to confirm your suspicions.

, Bee stings generally cause pain and swelling in the area where they occur. If your dog is able to scratch the area, this will cause further swelling. Other things to look for include:


A pin-prick sized red spot, surrounded by reddened skin.
Puffiness in the area.
Your dog may try to bite or scratch the area because be stings can be itchy.
If your dog has been stung on an area where the skin does not have much stretch (such as on the bridge of the nose), then the area may become puffy and swollen.

, An anaphylactic reaction means that your dog is allergic to bees and the toxins that their stingers contain. Anaphylactic reactions cause a shock-like collapse of the circulatory system and are not so much an external (skin) reaction as an internal one. Anaphylaxis is an emergency situation that requires immediate veterinary attention. Signs to look for include:


Your dog becomes groggy and wobbly, as if he is drunk or very tired.
He may seem weak, and might even collapse on the ground. He may also have a hard time lifting his head.
Your dog’s breathing may become rapid and shallow.
Look at your dog’s gums. If they appear pale pink or white, rather than a healthy pink like the color of your own gums, then he may be having an allergic reaction.
Press your dog’s gums with your fingertip. Remove your finger and watch the color come back into the gums. A healthy circulation pumps blood back into the area instantaneously, whereas a dog with slow circulation because of shock will not have color return to his gums for two seconds or more.

"
"
Remove the stinger if you can see it.,
Bath the puncture site with baking soda.,
Apply a cold compress to the area.,
Give your dog antihistamines.",How to Treat a Dog for Bee Stings2," To do this, flick it off the skin using a fingernail or the edge of a credit card. There is a slight chance of squeezing more irritants into the skin if you grip the stinger in order to pull it out of your dog’s skin.

, Bee stings are slightly acidic so the irritant can be neutralized by the application of a little baking soda. There is no exact formula for how much to apply.Simply add a teaspoon of baking soda into a cup of water. Soak a cotton wool ball in the solution, and hold this over the sting site for one to two minutes.

, Applying a cold compress to the area can help to minimize swelling. You can improvise a cold compress by using anything from a packet of frozen peas to some ice cubes in a plastic bag.


Hold the cold compress over the site of the sting for five to ten minutes. Remove the compress and, if necessary, repeat again around a quarter of an hour later.

, Antihistamine may be effective in some dogs, while it does nothing for others. There is no harm in giving your dog an antihistamine, so you may as well try. The antihistamine is intended to stop further swelling, and potentially reduce the swelling that has already occurred. However, there are some things to keep in mind:


Many over-the-counter antihistamines are suitable for dogs, but never use combined products, such as cold and flu relief product that happens to contain an antihistamine. The other active ingredients may not be safe for your dog.
One typical antihistamine is diphenhydramine (Benadryl). The dose is 12.5mg (equivalent to a child's strength Benadryl) per 10 to 15 kg body weight. Thus a typical Labrador requires two tablets.If your pet has other health problems (especially heart disease or seizures) speak to your vet before administering antihistamines, as diphenhydramine can increase blood pressure in some rare cases.Another non-prescription antihistamine is cetirizine (Zyrtec). This is particularly effective against allergic skin disease, and may help a particularly itchy dog. The dose is one 5 mg tablet twice a day (per 15kg body weight)."
"
Bring your dog to the vet immediately if you recognize signs of anaphylactic shock.,
Get medication for your dog.,
Try to manage the situation until your dog can be brought to a vet, or a vet can arrive.",How to Treat a Dog for Bee Stings3," If you dog gets a bee sting and then collapses, he is most likely having an anaphylactic reaction that requires urgent veterinary care. Remove the stinger and take your pet to the vet immediately.


The faster you get to the vet’s office, the more likely it is that your dog will be able to absorb the drugs the vet will give him.

, The vet may either give your dog an intravenous antihistamine injection, or intravenous steroids in order to suppress the allergic reaction.


A dog in shock may also need intravenous fluids in order to support his circulation and prevent organ damage.

, If you do not live within traveling distance of a vet, then give your dog an antihistamine tablet (as described in the previous section) and keep your dog as warm as possible.


However, it is important to keep in mind that there is a high risk that your dog will go into shock, which could potentially lead to death. Because of this, it is very important that you try to get your dog veterinary help.

Identify any difficulty breathing.,
Look for an increased respiratory rate.,
Watch for exaggerated breathing movements.,
See if your dog adopts the air hunger position.,
Inspect the color of the dog's mucus membrane.,
Watch out for weakness or extreme lethargy.,
Seek immediate veterinary advice if your dog has ingested any toxins.,
Never ignore a rapidly swelling abdomen.,
Seek advice after a severe trauma.,
Be wary of fainting, fits, or seizures.,
Look for signs of altered mental faculty.,
Keep track if your dog has been vomiting or experiencing diarrhea for more than 24 hours.,
Seek veterinary help if your dog is unable to walk.,
Watch for an inability to pass urine despite straining.,
See the vet if there is heavy bleeding or bruising.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is Having a Medical Emergency," The normal respiratory rate for a dog is 10-34 breaths per minute at rest. Obviously a dog will breathe more quickly if he has exercised and if he is hot he may pant, so the crucial word here is ""difficulty"".


Normal breathing movements involve the expansion of the chest wall and ribs on an in-breath, and the incursion of the ribs on the out breath. This is normal effortless and there is no movement of the abdominal wall involved.;
, Depending on the nature of the breathing difficulty, the respiratory rate may be raised to 60 breaths a minute, which is rapid shallow breathing. This is a significant sign of distress.


However, not all dogs with breathing difficulties breathe more quickly, some try to compensate by taking deeper, slower breaths and using their stomach muscles to try to suck air in.
Interpret the respiratory rate by taking into account recent exercise, whether it is hot, and if the dog seems happy or distressed.

, Dogs with breathing difficulties may have exaggerated breathing movements. One sign of this is that they use the abdomen when breathing. To spot this, watch the belly closely.


A dog struggling to get air into his lungs may expand his belly to try to fill his chest with air. Then on the out-breath he may squeeze the muscles of his abdominal wall to help force air out of the lungs.
If this movement of his abdomen is easy to spot then it is likely the dog is struggling to breathe and veterinary assistance is necessary.

, If a dog is struggling to breath he may adopt the air hunger position. This is a stance that maximizes his capacity to breathe, mainly by straightening his airways and relieving compression on his chest.


The air hunger position is recognizable because the dog stands or lies with his head and neck held in a straight line (he is trying to open up his windpipe), and holds his elbows away from his chest (to decrease pressure on the ribs).
He usually breathes through an open mouth, but in a gasping way rather than panting.

, A healthy dog with well-oxygenated blood usually has pink gums. The gums are covered in mucous membranes and their color is a good indication of health.


The gums should be pink (of course, some dogs do have dark pigment in their gums which makes it impossible to see the pink). If the dog is struggling to breath it is likely that his blood will have low oxygen levels, and high levels of carbon dioxide.
Low oxygen levels become evident as a blue tinge to the gums, which deepens in color depending on how severe the problem is.

, Weakness or extreme lethargy should be gauged against the dog's normal behavior. If your dog is an energetic beagle that suddenly can barely stand, then this is significant and should not be ignored.


Weakness is often the result of muscular weakness which, if it comes on suddenly, could be the result of a serious internal problem such as internal bleeding, or a potentially serious electrolyte imbalance.
There are many reasons why lethargy and weakness may develop, from heart disease to running a fever, but what they all have in common is that the dog needs veterinary attention.

, If your dog has ingested a toxin, do not hesitate to seek veterinary advice. The effects of the toxin will depend on exactly what type of poison it is, how much was eaten, and the dog's size.


There is a golden window of opportunity when treating such cases, in that if the dog is seen within two hours of eating the poison, the vet can make the dog vomit (i appropriate).
Although some of the toxin will have been absorbed into the blood stream, if the dog vomits within two hours, the rest of the stomach contents will be emptied out and the effects of the poison will be minimized.

, If your dog's abdomen swells visibly over a period of minutes to hours, this indicates an acute emergency (that said, even if the tummy swells over several days there is likely to be a problem present that needs veterinary attention).


The two major problems that pose a life-threatening risk, of which a swollen abdomen are a sign, are severe bloating and internal bleeding. A stomach dilated with gas may twist on itself and this is a genuine, serious emergency.Likewise internal bleeding such that the volume of blood is sufficient to distend the belly will result in shock and organ damage, and urgent attention is needed.

, This includes road traffic accidents, fights, and falls. Severe trauma such as a dog hit by a car is not difficult to spot, because there will be deep scrape wounds, cuts, and possibly broken bones.


Even if the dog is able to walk, it is best to treat this as an emergency because pain can push a dog into shock, which can be life-threatening.
Also, the veterinarian will need to monitor the dog for signs of internal damage or bleeding.

, These all involve the loss of consciousness, and as such should be treated as an emergency.


Fainting is subtly different from a fit because it is usually caused by a cardiovascular problem, rather than a neurological one, as for fits and seizures.
However, any issue that is severe enough to cause the pet to pass out or have a fit needs to be urgently assessed by a veterinarian.

, This includes your pet responding in a bizarre or unusual manner. Common signs include a pet walking into things, or not recognizing you. Altered mental status can indicate significant metabolic disease and urgent advice should be sought.


Altered mental status can be difficult to assess, because you need to be able to recognize what is normal for your pet. A change from this normal behavior where the pet is consistently and repeatedly acting in a strange and worrying manner could be described an altered mental status.
Examples of this would be when a pet that is normally excited in company fails to respond and if roused behaves in a zombie-like way.

, Vomiting and diarrhea represent fluid loss from the body, and if this is protracted the dog may become dehydrated. Signs of dehydration can be subtle in the early stages, so if in doubt contact the vet. The symptoms of dehydration include gums that are dry to the touch and a delayed return of the scruff to normal when it is lifted.


The latter refers to lifting the scruff over the shoulders blades. Use the finger and thumb of one hand to grasp a fold of scruff and raise it away from the body, then let go. In a well-hydrated animal the scruff springs back to the original position without delay. In a dehydrated animal you can watch the tissue slide back down as the fluid loss reduces the elastic recoil of the skin.
However, you should interpret vomiting and diarrhea in light of the dog's overall demeanor. If he has only been vomiting for 2-3 hours and yet is very depressed, contact the vet. Also, if the diarrhea contains blood, do not wait 24 hours but contact the surgery immediately.

, Being unable to walk is a form of collapse and should be treated as an emergency.


The options for collapse range from an old dog so stiff that he cannot get his legs underneath him to a dog with circulatory problems as a result of heart disease.
Either way, the pet needs attention, be it pain relief or heart medications, and the inability to walk should be treated as an emergency.

, Signs of straining include repeated cocking of the leg, or squatting, but when the dog moves off the ground is dry.


The dog may also lick his or her genitals excessively, as if attempting to relieve discomfort. He or she will also seem restless and unable to settle, and be off their food.
Not being able to pass urine is a genuine emergency which requires immediate veterinary attention. Failing to do so could result in the bladder bursting, kidney failure, or even a heart attack.

, Heavy bleeding needs to be controlled before the volume of blood loss becomes critical, thus it is an emergency. Likewise visible heavy bruising could be an indication that the dog has a clotting problem. If he has a clotting problem then there is also a risk of internal bleeding and he should be checked immediately by a veterinarian.


Heavy bleeding is described as blood pumping out of an injury, or constant dripping. Non-life-threatening bleeding would include bleeding that stops when pressure is applied over the site of the bleed, and the bleeding does not resume when the pressure is removed.
Any bleeding that resumes once pressure is removed should be treated as an emergency.

By staying as relaxed as possible you will be able to best assess your dog's condition as well as help your dog to remain calm. This can prevent further injury or stress.If your dog sees you panicking it will likely also panic, increasing its pain and stress levels.;
, After your dog has fallen, calmly look for any signs of injury that you can see. Don't touch your dog as you look, use only your eyes. By evaluating the extent of damage your dog has sustained during the fall, you will be able to best judge what to do next. Look for some of the following signs of injury in your dog:Yelping is a clear sign that your dog is in pain.
Check your dog for any surface injuries such as cuts, scrapes, or protruding bones.
Look at the dog's front and back legs. If a limb is broken, it will appear disfigured, being bent or held at an odd angle.
Some broken bones might not be visible. If your dog is limping for more than five minutes, take it to your veterinarian.
Injured dogs will breathe faster than normal. Look for a sustained increase in the rate of breathing in your dog.
Not all injuries will be external or visible. Only a veterinarian will be able to verify internal injuries.

, If you have noticed any obvious injuries to your dog you can apply first aid. Applying basic first aid to your dog can help prevent the injury from worsening during the time it takes to get it to the veterinarian. Only apply first aid if your dog seems comfortable with you doing so. Stress and pain might make your dog growl or even bite you, so work slowly and monitor your dog's reactions.If your dog is not able to move, do not pick it up until it has a stable and solid surface underneath it such as a board.
Never treat any serious wounds yourself. Leave severe injuries for your veterinarian to treat.
Clean any superficial cuts or wounds by applying hydrogen peroxide to the affected area.
Apply pressure using a clean piece of gauze to any areas that are heavily bleeding.

, Having assessed what injuries your dog may have and after applying first aid, it's time to call your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will be able to best identify and treat any injuries your dog may have after its fall.If your dog has severe injuries, take it to an emergency veterinarian immediately.
Take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible, even if injuries are not immediately life threatening.
Even if your dog doesn't have apparent or obvious injuries, your veterinarian can detect issues that may be internal or unclear.

, When you meet with your veterinarian you will need to provide accurate information about your dog's injuries. By giving your veterinarian this information, they will be able to start treating your dog more quickly and efficiently.


Tell your veterinarian exactly how and when your dog fell.
Inform your veterinarian about any signs of injury that you have noticed.
Let your veterinarian know about any first aid you have administered.
Tell your veterinarian about any past injuries or surgeries that your dog may have had.
Be ready to provide basic information about your dog including age, current medications, or other health issues.

, Your veterinarian will likely perform some diagnostic tests and will administer certain medical techniques to treat your dog's injuries. Review some of the following possible tests and treatments that your veterinarian may perform.A basic physical exam will let your veterinarian learn of any surface injuries as well as the overall condition of your dog.
Orthopedic examinations will check for any injuries to the bones, joints, muscles, or affected range of movement in your dog. This examination may include an x-ray.
Neurological examinations will be ordered if your dog has hit its head during the fall. If your dog is walking oddly or seemingly unaware, this test can help determine if your dog's nervous system was damaged.

, After your dog has received initial emergency treatment and has been cleared to go home with you, your veterinarian will likely give you home-care instructions. These instructions must be accurately followed to ensure that your dog will have a quick and full recovery.If your dog is given medications, keep up with the schedule. Make sure your dog is consuming them completely if administered orally.
Keep up with changing any bandages that your dog may need.
You may need to apply ice or heat packs to your dog's injuries.
Make sure your dog rests and keep activities to a minimum while injuries heal.

, If your dog enjoys going for car rides with you, take this simple step to help keep it safe. Although most humans wouldn't dare jump out of a moving car, your dog might not be so hesitant. Keep the windows rolled up enough to prevent your dog from jumping out during your drive.You might also wish to purchase a seatbelt designed specifically for your dog, to keep it as safe as can be during any road trips.
Consider locking power windows as dogs may accidentally be able to roll them down.
Do not leave your dog alone in the car on a hot day with the windows rolled up. This can raise temperatures to a deadly degree for your dog., A common fall hazard for dogs is any open window in your house that it can reach. Even if the window has a screen on it, your dog may still try and escape, which can lead to it suffering a dangerous fall. Any window your dog can reach needs to be kept closed enough so that your dog cannot fit out the window., If your home has potential fall hazards you should prevent your dog from accessing this areas. Keeping your dog away from these potentially dangerous ares will help keep it safe in your home.


Steep stair cases, lofts without a railing, and balconies are some examples of places in your home that your dog may fall from.
Make sure to leave doors to these areas closed.
You can buy pet-gates to block off staircases or doorways in your home.
Never bring your dog into an area of the house that presents a fall hazard.

, If you notice your dog stumbling and falling without any apparent reason, it should be taken to your veterinarian as soon as possible. This may be a sign of a medical condition that your veterinarian will be able to diagnose and offer treatment options for.Inner ear issues or ear infections can cause your dog fall down.
Brain tumors, which are more common in older dogs, can also be responsible for your dog falling.

The most common areas of irritation for allergic dogs are around the back and tail, the abdomen, and the legs and paws.;
, To the naked eye, this type of mite looks like flakes of dandruff. It is also a slow moving mite. You can see this mite when you brush the dog’s coat over some paper. It can also be trapped on sticky tape for diagnostic purposes. Your dog will be moderately irritated by these mites. Puppies may experience a more severe infestation due to an immature immune system., Sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabei) is a parasitic mite infestation. The dog may have red, scaly skin in some areas.Sarcoptic mange can cause significant skin lesions and distress for the dog because the mite causes severe itching.Dogs can catch sarcoptic mange very easily and it is highly infectious to the species. While these mites will bite people, they don't usually cause major problems.

, Demodectic (red mange) is caused by small mites found naturally on most dogs but do not generally cause skin problems unless the dog’s immune system is compromised. Demodex is most commonly seen in puppies, because their immune systems are still developing.Demodectic mange is not very contagious and people cannot contract it. It is generally passed on to nursing puppies by the mother. This mange is most noticeable around the eyes and mouth when the young puppy’s immune system does not keep the mite in check.A predisposition for this skin problem may be inherited. It is not uncommon for the puppies to have Demodex if their parents also had Demodex at some point in their lives., Consult your veterinarian for the best treatment for the type of mange seen in your dog. Not all mange mites react to all treatments and some breeds of dogs cannot tolerate some treatments. Never use any medications or treatments without your veterinarian's approval.


Your vet will determine what kind of mites are plaguing your dog. Effective treatment differs depending on the mite involved, so diagnosis of the mite type is critical.

, A coat brushing is a simple matter of standing the dog over a piece of white paper and roughing up the coat to make dander and debris fall onto the paper. The vet then deposits the debris onto a microscope slide for examination.


An alternative is to use clear sticky tape to collect dander samples direct from the coat for microscope examination.
This is the most common method of diagnosis for cheyletiella. To the naked eye, it looks like flakes of dandruff. It is also a slow moving mite, and can be trapped on sticky tape. Other methods are needed for the other two mite types. Sarcoptes is another mite that lives on the skin surface, and it can sometimes be picked up on coat brushings or skin scrapes. However, it is fast-moving and microscopic in size, so it can easily evade these tests.

, Since sarcoptes mites are fast-moving and often too small to see, your vet might administer a blood test. This test looks for evidence of the body mounting an immune defense to the irritant action of sarcoptes mites. This test gives a yes-or-no answer to infection. However, it is only reliable once the dog has been infected for at least 2 weeks. This is how long it takes for the immune response to occur.

, Demodex mites live within the skin, so the veterinarian needs to use a blunt scalpel blade to scrape or abrade the surface layers of the skin. This will bring the mites to the surface and capture them in the skin debris on the edge of the scalpel blade. Good-natured dogs will have no problem undergoing this procedure.


The scrapings are looked at under the microscope to identify the typical ""cigar"" shape of these mites., A skin biopsy may be used if the other collection methods fail to reach a diagnosis. This method is also recommended if demodex is strongly suspected. The idea is to collect a full thickness sample of skin. The pathologist will look for the presence of demodex mites within the hair follicles.

, This condition responds to a variety of different medications. Some medications carry more risk than others. It is therefore advisable to use safer alternatives when available.


The recommended treatment is three treatments, two weeks apart with a spray containing Fipronil. Please note that this product is not licensed for this use, but widely acknowledged to be both safe and effective. It is widely recommended by specialist veterinary dermatologists.
Alternatives include selenium sulphide shampoo used weekly for 3 to 4 treatments. This is also a safe treatment.
A higher risk alternative is ivermectin. This treatment is given by injection at weekly intervals for 3 treatments. This can cause coma in breeds that are sensitive to ivermectin, such as collie breeds. It is best avoided unless there is a compelling reason to use it. , Once identified, this condition is easily treated with regular applications of certain common external application products. Recommended products will contain selamectin (such as Revolution in the US), imidacloprid (such as Advocate in the UK).


Initially, this treatment is applied every 2 weeks for 3 treatments, and then monthly to prevent reinfection.
Oral products can also be effective. These will contain milbemycin (Milbemax), which is given as a weekly tablet for six treatments.
Older treatments such as Amitraz are also effective. This is an insecticidal dip that can damage the environment when disposed of improperly. It is toxic to fish if it gets into the water. Choose safer products over this treatment.

, Both cheyletiella and sarcoptes mites can transfer between dogs. Any dogs who have been around the affected dog should be treated with the same medication.


Cats and other animals do not need to be treated.

, Discard or thoroughly wash all of the animals' bedding, collars, leashes and any other materials worn by them. You need to rid your house of the mites. Wash all bedding and other materials in hot water. Run them through the dryer if possible.

, The mite that causes Sarcoptic mange can be transmitted to humans. But the mite cannot reproduce on humans. It may cause terrible itching on specific areas of the skin. The mites will, however, die off. If you start itching from these mites, your symptoms will subside within about 3 weeks.

, Demodex is a little bit different to the other two forms of mange because the mite is not a surface dweller but burrows beneath the skin's surface. It also takes two forms:


A localized, self-limiting infection in puppies and dogs under 12 months of age. The skin does contain the odd demodex mite, but this doesn't cause a problem unless the dog’s immune system is compromised. Because they have developing immune systems, puppies sometimes have small bald areas which are smooth and pink. But these do not bother the dog and they do not require treatment. As the pup's immune system strengthens, the body fights the infection and brings it under control.
A generalized infection, often occurring in dogs over 12 months of age. If the areas enlarge or the patches became sticky and itchy, showing signs of secondary infection, then treatment should be started.

, The generalized form of demodex, which happens all over the dog’s body, is more serious. The name, ""red mange,"" reflects the intense irritation and inflammation of the skin in response to large numbers of mites within the hair follicles. You first need to shampoo the dog with a shampoo containing benzoyl peroxide. This is not a treatment in itself but has a ""follicle flushing"" effect, which means that it penetrates into the hair follicles and gives them a good clean out. Thus, the dog’s body is a more hostile environment for the demodex. It also dislodges some of the mites in the process.


This type of shampoo is available at pet stores. Talk with your veterinarian for recommendations.

, The treatment for demodex is a weekly bath with an insecticide called amitraz. This is a liquid drug that is diluted in water and poured over the dog. Since the paws are commonly infected, have the dog stand in a small amount of the solution for 10 minutes. At least 10 minutes contact time with the skin is necessary for it to be effective.


Do not rinse off the product. Allow it to air dry.
Treatment is weekly and continued until 2 or 3 negative skin scrapes are obtained. Treatment can last anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks, depending on the response
Please note amitraz is toxic to fish, birds, and reptiles. It can also aggravate asthma. The bath must always be done in a well ventilated place, preferably outdoors and the operator must wear protective waterproof clothing such as rubber gloves and a plastic apron. People with a history of asthma should not use amitraz.

, Because amitraz is unpleasant and is toxic to some other animals, many vets may recommend unlicensed treatments. These include:


Milbemycin (milbemax): This is an oral wormer. It is administered at the label dose daily for 30 days beyond 2-3 negative skin scrapes taken at least 7 days apart. The drawback with this is cost. Milbemycin is expensive and the cost of 60 day course of treatment for a large dog can be prohibitive. Also, it is not always effective, in which case the dose needs to be doubled, leading to further expense.
Ivermectin. This oral medication is administered with a low dose initially. Your veterinarian will carefully increase the dose. Daily treatment is often necessary for 3-8 months. Ivermectin can have catastrophic side effects in some dogs because the ivermectin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain. It can cause breathing problems, extreme incoordination and even coma. Collie breeds are known to be especially sensitive and vulnerable to these side effects. It is arguable that ivermectin should not be used on these breeds at all. , Discard or thoroughly wash all of the animals' bedding, collars, leashes and any other materials worn by them. You need to rid your house of the mites. Wash all bedding and other materials in hot water. Run them through the dryer if possible.

, Demodex is not infectious in the same way as cheyletiella or sarcoptes, so other pets who have been in contact with the affected dog do not need treatment.


Puppies can become infected from their mother during the birthing process. The mites can be present in the skin for years, waiting for an opportunity to breed.

, A suppressed immune system makes demodex infection more likely. Every effort should be made to diagnose and treat health problems. These can include underactive thyroid glands, diabetes, or Cushing's disease.

, The consequence of mange is often itching, broken skin, and bacterial infections. It is important to bring secondary infections under control with antibiotics (as necessary).


Sometimes, a short course of an oral steroid is advisable to reduce the itching while drugs treat the underlying cause. The exception to steroid use is demodex, where its immunosuppressive effect could inhibit the body's ability to fight and eliminate the mites.

, Feed your dog a well-balanced diet that contains the necessary vitamins and minerals for a strong immune system. This will put him in a better place to deal with mite infections. For instance, experts think that demodex may be burrowed into the skin of many normal dogs who don’t have skin problems. But their skin immunity keeps the numbers in check, so these dogs don't develop clinical signs of mange. When a dog’s immunity dips because of poor diet or ill health, these mites can then breed and cause a problem. , Most treatments for external parasites have a broader spectrum of activity that just treating fleas or heartworm. For example, a common product, Revolution, contains selamectin. This drug is effective against fleas and sarcoptic mange mites. Other common products that contain fipronil, such as Frontline and Efipro, are effective against fleas and cheyletiella. By using a product regularly, your dog will be protected if he comes in contact with these mites.


These products won’t completely eliminate the risk of your dog getting mange. But they do eliminate the risk for certain types, depending on the product used. , It is good general practice to keep a clean and hygienic living space for your dog. Dirt and debris can harbor parasites and provide them with nutrition. In contrast, a clean environment is more difficult for parasites to survive in.


Vacuum regularly (daily if possible), and use an insecticidal flea collar in the vacuum bag to kill parasites that get vacuumed up. Try a flea collar with pyrethrin on it.
Spray soft furnishings and carpet with an insecticidal spray designed to kill flea eggs and larvae. These products are very strong and likely to kill parasites such as cheyletiella and sarcoptes off the host (demodex live in the skin, so this is not relevant in this case). This reduces the risk of the dog reinfecting himself by being in contact with contaminated bedding. Your veterinarian can advise you of an appropriate spray. Some recommended ones might include Indorex, RIP Fleas, and Nuvan Staykill. These sprays should not be used near birds, fish or reptiles. Be sure to ventilate the room well for a couple of hours after the initial spray.
Parasitic activity can persist for 7 months, so it’s important to address possible infestations., If your dog goes outside, make sure to have a tidy environment for him. Remove plant refuse such as dried leaves and rotting vegetation that might harbor parasites.

Pick out the form of medication you would like to give your dog, and give the appropriate dose.",How to Treat Lyme Disease in Dogs," This is a tick-borne disease, which means that certain tick species, like Ixodes ricinus (the deer tick), carry the Borrelia disease in their body and infect mammals when they bite them to feed on their blood. A wide variety of mammalian species, including us humans, can catch Lyme disease, but the condition cannot transfer directly from dog to human or vice versa.Disease spread is dependent on the presence of biting ticks. The tick also needs to be attached to the host’s body (in this case, your dog’s body) for at least 48 hours to effectively pass the disease on. If the tick is removed before 48 hours have passed, it is very unlikely that your dog will get the disease.;
, These blood tests work by detecting the body's immune response to the presence of Borrelia. If the result is positive, this does not necessarily mean the dog is ill or will become ill because of the Borrelia.


A positive result merely means that the body has mounted an immune response to fight off the spirochaete, in much the same way that vaccination induces the body to raise an immune response to whatever the vaccination is against. Thus the blood test is of value in demonstrating the dog has had contact with Borrelia, but not in conclusively proving it is causing a dog's current illness.

, Because the blood test can sometimes be inconclusive, many veterinarians do not use the blood test, but are guided by clinical signs to give trial treatment. Animals with Lyme disease often respond quickly, and show signs of improvement within 24 hours of starting antibiotic therapy.


Thus, ""diagnosis by treatment"" is entirely justified if the veterinarian uses his clinical judgement and concludes Lyme disease is a possibility.

, Antimicrobial drugs from the tetracycline or potentiated amoxycillin family are effective against Lyme disease.


Dogs usually show signs of improvement within 24 to 48 hours of starting therapy, and treatment should be continued for 30 days., This treatment is the most effective way to treat Lyme disease. It is also readily available, and relatively inexpensive, which is good because the treatment often has to last for at least 30 days.


The dose is 10mg/kg by mouth, twice a day for 30 days. Avoid giving milk or dairy products with this medication because it stops the medication from being absorbed into the bloodstream. A typical dose for a 20 kg dog is one 200 mg oxytetracycline tablet twice a day., Do not give your dog oxytetracycline if he is still growing and has his milk teeth (his baby teeth). Oxytetracycline can cause yellow discoloration of the tooth enamel to occur. Instead, amoxicillin works well for dogs who are six months old or younger.


Keep in mind that potentiated amoxycillin is a bit more expensive than other Lyme disease treatment medications.
The dose is 20 mg/kg by mouth, three times a day for 30 days. A 25 kg dog requires a 500 mg potentiated amoxycillin capsule three times a day., On some occasions this antibiotic can cause minor gastrointestinal upsets such as diarrhea. This is usually because of disturbances in the bacterial population of the gut. If this occurs then your dog should be put on a bland diet (such as chicken and rice) and a probiotic treatment given to rebalance the gut.Examples of suitable probiotics include Promax paste or Fortiflora granules. Both are mixed into your dog’s food, once a day for 3 days., This is especially important to do if your dog spends a lot of his time outside. Create a routine pattern for inspection so that you make sure you do not miss any spots that a tick could have bitten. To check your dog for ticks:


Start at your dog’s head. Brush his fur in the wrong direction with your fingers so that you can more easily feel any unusual bumps, or even spot the ticks with your eyes.
Next, move to your dog’s ears. Be sure to lift the ear flaps and look underneath.
Check your dog’s neck—all around, from top to bottom.
Feel along your dog’s back, sides, and belly. Run your hands down each leg in turn, and don’t forget to check in between your dog’s toes.
Lift your dog’s tail and check around his anus, as well as along the tail itself.
Double check your dog’s tummy and give him a belly scratch at the same time.

, Certain anti-external parasite treatments are effective against ticks. Talk to your vet about what preventative treatment would be best for your dog. .

, A monthly application of fipronil means that any tick that attaches to your dog will die before it can transmit Borrelia. Fipronil works by over-exciting receptors in the tick’s nervous system, causing paralysis and death within 24 to 48 hours after the tick has bitten your dog., You can use a spray, or a spot-on formula. For fipronil, the dose is weight related and so it is important to have the correct weight for your pet. The most convenient application method is a spot-on pipette designed for pets in the following weight ranges:


Up to 22 lbs, 23 to 44 lbs, and 89 to 132 lbs.For dogs over 132 lbs the appropriate combination of pipettes should be applied.

Clean your dog’s ears once a month.,
Isolate your dog from infected dogs.,
Clean bedding often.,
Keep dogs away from other animals.",How to Prevent Canine Ear Mites1," One way to prevent ear mites is to keep your dog’s ears clean. This can help reduce the risk of your dog getting mites.Detecting ear mites early can help you prevent ear mites from spreading to other days.Use an ear cleaning solution specially made for cleaning dog's ears. You should be able to find this in a pet store.
Ask your vet for help choosing an ear solution if you are having trouble finding one.;
, If you know that one of your dogs has ear mites, keep other pets separate from the infected dog. Mites are easily transmitted between animals.Take caution when taking your dog to public places where she mixes with other dogs, like the dog park, groomers, or other places. Keep your dog away from dogs who are scratching their ears or exhibiting symptoms of ear mites.

, Regularly wash your pet’s bedding. This helps remove any ear mites that may be on it and keep other pests and bacteria away.Wash the bedding once every couple weeks. This helps reduce the risk of mites infesting the bedding.
You can also spray the area your pet inhabits with a flea spray treatment.

, Ear mites are extremely contagious. The most common way dogs get ear mites is through contact with infected animals. One way to prevent ear mites is to keep your dog away from other animals.Ear mites are extremely common in outdoor cats. Try to keep your dog away from stray cats outdoors, or take measures to keep stray cats out of your yard.
If you have an outdoor cat, make sure to treat him for ear mites and keep his ears healthy.

Look for brown discharge.,
Watch for excessive ear scratching.,
Monitor for head shaking.,
Check for unpleasant smells.",How to Prevent Canine Ear Mites2," Ear mites trigger the production of a thick, brown-black type of ear wax. You might see inside your dog's ears a substance that looks like coffee grounds.Ear mite infections are commonly associated with an excessive amount of this brown-black wax produced by the ear canal.
Your dog may also have crusting on the neck, rump, and tail if the mites have spread to other parts of the body.

, The ear mites cause considerable irritation, so your dog may scratch at the ears with a paw. Because of this scratching, your dog's ears may be red, sensitive, or even have open sores.Your dog may also rub the ears, or scoot the ears along the ground.
Look for rashes or skin irritation around the skin of the ears, too.Your dog may also have sensitive or tender ears, which means she might whine as she scratches her ears or if you touch them.The scratching and rubbing can lead to inflammation and sore skin. The constant rubbing can introduce a secondary bacterial infection with a foul smell., Your dog may also repeatedly shake her head from side to side. She may also lean her head over to one side. Her ear may droop just a bit more than usual.She may act like she is trying to get something out of her ears.

, The ear may also smell unpleasant due to the secondary infections that commonly accompany ear mites. If your dog is favoring the ear, rubbing it, or scratching it, this can lead to a foul smell because of an infection.Lift your dog's ears and sniff. If it smells badly, there is something wrong and she should be taken to the vet immediately.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Clean the ears of discharge.,
Use a parasiticide.,
Bathe the dog with flea shampoo.,
Treat all animals who have contact with the infected dog.,
Wash all bedding.",How to Prevent Canine Ear Mites3," A vet should examine the ear and come to a diagnosis of ear mites. He will examine the ears with an otoscope, which helps him be able to see the mites since they are difficult to see with the naked eye.Similar symptoms may be due to a bacterial infection, a foreign body in the ear, or an allergy.

, Before you administer the ear medication, clean the ears with a regular ear cleaner made for dogs before using the medicine. This helps remove the discharge that could protect the mites.Make sure to dry the ears to reduce the moisture. This can help reduce bacteria from forming., Your vet will prescribe a parasiticide to use on your dog. This medicated topical treatment also contains ingredients which decrease inflammation and therefore give relief from the symptoms, such as itching.The frequency of the application of medication depends on the individual preparation. It can vary from daily for a set number of days, to twice daily for seven days followed by a second cycle of treatment after a gap of seven days.
If your dog has a secondary infection due to the mites, your vet may prescribe antibiotics., As your dog scratches her ears or sleeps on infected bedding, she can end up with mites on the rest of her body. To help prevent this, bathe your dog with a flea shampoo.Most sprays, shampoos, or powders geared towards killing fleas and ticks will probably be effective for killing mites.Your vet can recommend a shampoo to help with mites.

, It's important to treat all animals that are in contact with the animal who has ear mites. This prevents the mites from hopping onto an alternative host while the dog is on treatment, only to reinfect her against once treatment finishes.Your vet can suggest treatments for your other dogs. Talk to him about what treatment you should use to treat any dogs that have come in contact with the infected dog.

, You should wash all the pet bedding while you are treating your dog for ear mites. Wash any blankets your pet has come into contact with.Make sure to wash the bedding in hot, soapy water and dry the bedding in a hot dryer.
Wash and change the bedding every day while you are treating your dog for ear mites. Wash it regularly, every few days or so, for a few months after treating the mites since any eggs left behind might hatch.

Repeatedly clean your home.",How to Get Rid of Dog Lice," Lice cause itchiness, so you will probably first notice that your dog is scratching itself excessively. There will probably also be more than usual dandruff visible on the dog's coat.


Lice do bite the dog and suck blood, so heavy infestations can also cause anemia.;
, Similar to human head lice, dog lice are small creatures that can barely be seen with the naked eye. They have six legs, each equipped with gripping claws, which enable the lice to cling tightly to hairs. Lice spend their entire life cycle on the pet.Dogs can be infected by one of two kinds of lice, the common biting louse (Trichodectes canis) or the sucking louse (Linognathus setosus), which is less common. Treatment for both types is the same.

, Use a nit comb, a very fine-toothed comb, to look at the base you your dog's hair follicles right at the skin. The lice attach themselves to hair shafts and can be seen as tiny glistening dots. You may also see the nits or eggs, which the parasite glues onto the hair shafts and also look like tiny glistening specks.These parasites are slow moving, so examination with a nit comb of the dog's coat will usually show up either the lice themselves or nits glued to the hair shafts, if your dog is actually infected.

, This option depends on physically removing the lice using a comb with narrow teeth. The advantage is that it is chemical free, however it is extremely time consuming and labor intensive. This could be an option for a short-haired Chihuahua but is impractical for a Bernese Mountain dog.


Lice and nit combs are best used as an aid to getting rid of lice, rather than a solo strategy.
You need to be 100% certain you have combed the entire dog and gotten into all the nooks and crannies. It's very important to focus a lot of your attention on the armpits, groin, and ears. Lice also cling onto hair pretty tightly, so it's possible to comb the entire dog and not remove all the lice.
Repeated daily combing is necessary for several weeks (around 4 - 6 weeks) in order to catch and remove nymphs as they hatch out from eggs.
Kill the lice you have removed by immersing them in boiling water for a few minutes.

, Many flea shampoos containing pyrethroids or organophosphates are effective against lice when backed up with a nit comb directly after the bath. However, the treatment does not continue working once it is dry, and no shampoo can penetrate the eggs, so expect the next generation of lice to hatch out within 2 - 4 weeks. Thus regular weekly shampooing is required for at least 6 weeks.


Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. This is especially important with regard to how long the product needs to stay in contact with the skin before being thoroughly rinsed off. Not sticking to the recommended contact time can lead to lack of effectiveness., There are no parasitic products that are licensed to kill lice in dogs however several are known to be effective. These include products containing fipronil (Frontline, Effipro) Permethrin, Phosmet, fenthion, and selamectin (Revolution US, Advantage UK).However, be aware that while most of these products have directions for monthly application, when treating lice application every two weeks is advisable. This is because there is a drop off in effectiveness after 2 weeks. Since no product can penetrate the tough louse egg, it is essential to keep the persistent level of active drug high enough to kill off the hatching nymph., Lice are highly infectious to other dogs but can survive off of one dog alone. Whether you have one dog or many dogs, every dog needs the same treatment. Just assume that all the dogs in your home are infected to some degree and treat them all for lice with the same diligence. , Because of the highly infectious nature of lice infections, the dog should not mix with other dogs (including at doggy day care) while on treatment. In order to prevent spreading this nasty infection, quarantine your dog for a period of around 4 weeks after treatment., For example, wash pet bedding on a hot cycle in the washing machine. Repeat this every time the dog has a treatment so that it goes back onto clean bedding and does not reinfect itself with contaminated bedding.


Take special care to disinfect grooming utensils. These provide the perfect way for lice to spread between pets. Disinfect brushes and combs after use on one dog, by immersing them in boiling water and leaving for 10 minutes., Adult lice are not particularly hardy and can be killed by steam cleaning. This is a good option for soft furnishings and carpet. However, the eggs or nits are more hardy. You will need to wait for those to hatch out and then retreat with the steam cleaner in order to kill the more vulnerable adult stage.


Alternatively, use an insecticidal environmental spray product such as Nuvan Staykill, Acclaim, or RIP Fleas, which are designed to kill fleas, larvae, and eggs. The advantage of these sprays is that they have a persistent action of several months, so the hatching eggs are killed with just one treatment. The disadvantage is that they are strong chemical products and not suitable for use in rooms where there are birds, reptiles, or fish, as they are toxic to these species and will cause death., It can be difficult to predict when lice eggs will hatch, so regular cleaning is the answer. The entire process of going from egg to adult takes between 2 - 4 weeks. With that in mind, a suggested minimal steam cleaning regime would be weekly for around 6 weeks, although there is no harm in treating more often (weekly) and for longer.


Prevent future outbreaks by keeping a clean, sanitary home. Make sure the dog is kept in clean living conditions and is not overcrowded with other dogs. Lice thrive in dirty conditions with lots of dogs all kept in close confines, as they can then transfer between hosts easily."

Keep your dog away from other dogs who may be infected.,
Take your dog to the vet for regular check-ups.",How to Cure Mange in Dogs," If you suspect that your dog has mange, the first thing you should do is take him to the veterinarian. Treatments vary for the different types of mange and some medications can be toxic, so it is best to obtain an accurate diagnosis from a veterinarian who can advise you on the right course of treatment.The process for diagnosing mange will vary from case to case. In some instances, the vet will be able to take a skin scraping from the affected area and analyze it under the microscope to look for mites or eggs.
In situations where the mites are buried within the dog's skin -- such as in demodectic pododermatitis -- the vet may have to perform a deep biopsy to confirm the presence of mange.
The vet will also perform a physical exam and take your pet's general health and history into account when making a diagnosis.;
, Demodectic mange is characterized by thinning patches of hair that can scab over. They can be localized in one area or spread throughout the body. Demodectic mange is not contagious and cannot be transferred to humans.


Demodectic mange -- also known as demodex or ""red mange"" -- is caused by mites that are transferred from mother to puppy during the first few days of life. These mites are present in all dogs and usually won't cause any problems.
Mange occurs when mite populations proliferate in dogs with underdeveloped immune systems -- like puppies under the age of 18 months, older dogs and dogs with compromised immune systems.
When the mites are concentrated in one or two isolated patches on the skin, this is known as localized demodectic mange, which presents as bald scaly patches, usually on the dog's face. Localized demodectic mange is most common in puppies and will usually clear up on its own with no need for treatment.
When the mange is present in large patches or all over the dog's body, this is known as generalized demodectic mange. This type of mange produces bald, scaly patches of skin, which can be very itchy. When the dog scratches, sores can form which are susceptible to unpleasant-smelling bacterial infections. Generalized demodectic mange is most common in dogs with compromised immune systems and will require treatment.
The most resistant form of demodectic mange is known as demodectic pododermatitis, which occurs only in the feet and is accompanied by bacterial infection. This type of mange is difficult to diagnose and treat., Sarcoptic mange symptoms are similar to those of a flea infestation, and involve excessive biting and scratching at the skin, thinning of the hair and hair loss and open sores.


Sarcoptic mange -- also known as canine scabies -- is caused by microscopic mites that are easily transferred from host to host, including humans (where it causes a red bumpy rash, similar to mosquito bites).
In dogs, symptoms of sarcoptic mange usually develop about one week following exposure. The dog may become restless and start scratching frantically, before scaly, bald patches start appearing on its face, elbows, ears and legs.
If the mange is not treated immediately, it may spread all over the dog's body and become more resistant to treatment., Cheyletiella mange is caused by large, white mites which live on the surface of the skin and is characterized by a red bumpy rash and scaly, flaky skin in the hair along the dog's neck and spine.


This type of mange is also known as ""walking dandruff."" The mites themselves that look like flakes of dandruff, so the ""walking dandruff"" is the mites moving around.
Cheyletiella mange is highly contagious to other dogs (especially puppies) and can cause intense itching (although sometimes itching is completely absent). It is usually passed from puppy to puppy as a result of mite infestations in straw and animal bedding in pet shops and kennels.
Cheyletiella mange can also be passed on to humans, causing an itchy, bumpy red rash on the arms, trunk and buttocks. However, the symptoms should disappear once the puppy has been treated, as the mites can't survive without a host for more than 10 days.
However, as the use of straw in animal bedding is becoming less common and the use of flea-control preparations had risen, instances of cheyletiella mange are becoming less and less frequent., If your dog has mange, you should keep him away from any other pets you have to prevent them from becoming infected as well. Make sure that your dog is safe and warm. Do not isolate your dog by tying him outside or keeping him in an unheated space in the winter. Select a room in your house to keep him while you are treating him for mange.Provide food, water, bedding, and toys for your dog while he is in isolation. Make sure that you spend time with him, take him for walks, and play with him so that he is not frightened by the isolation.
In rare cases, humans may become infected with the mites that cause mange in dogs. Protect yourself by wearing gloves when you administer treatments to your dog., Your dog’s treatment will depend on the type of mange he has and this can only be determined with certainty by a licensed veterinarian. Some dogs will need special baths, prescription medications, or even injections to treat their mange. Make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions for treating your dog and contact your vet if you have any questions or concerns. Do not attempt to diagnose and treat your dog without the help of a veterinarian., In order to prevent mites from hiding out on your dog’s bedding or collar, you should remove these items and replace them.Change and wash your dog’s bedding daily to keep it free from mites. Use hot water, soap, and bleach to thoroughly cleanse your dog’s bedding.

, Mange can cause dogs to become stressed because of the itching, isolation, vet visits, medications, and other treatments that they receive to treat their mange. As your dog goes through his treatment, make sure to do things that will help to keep him calm.For example, you can provide him with a treat after he has had a bath, make sure that you visit him often while he is in isolation, and do things that you normally do together like going for walks and playing in the backyard.

, If your dog was infected with either sarcoptic or cheyletiella mange, you will need to treat any dogs or other animals that your pet is in frequent contact with -- otherwise he could be re-infected. Talk to your vet about how to treat your other pets to avoid a recurrence of mange in your dog.

, If you suspect that a dog (or cat) in your neighborhood may have mange, you should keep your dog as far away from the animal as possible.Talk to the animal’s owner to let them know that you think their pet has mange or call animal control if the animal is a stray.

, Following treatment, you should bring your dog back to the vet for periodic check-ups. The veterinarian can analyze skin scrapings to confirm that the mites have not returned. Do not attempt to treat a recurrence of mange without consulting your veterinarian first because some treatments can be toxic if used more than once in too short of a time period."

Look in your dog’s mouth.,
Take your dog’s pulse.,
Take your dog's temperature with a thermometer.",How to Recognize Poisoning in Dogs1," Your dog’s gums and tongue should be pale to medium pink. If your dog naturally has black gums, look at its tongue. If the gums or tongue are blue, purple, white, brick colored or extremely bright red, seek veterinary medical attention immediately. This means that something is impeding the flow of blood throughout your dog's body.You can also do a ""capillary refill time"" test to determine if a poison is impeding your dog's blood circulation. Lift the upper lip and press above a canine tooth with your thumb. Release your thumb then watch for a color change where you pressed. The gum color should change from white to pink within two seconds If there is significant delay (more than three seconds), check with your veterinarian.;
, If a dog’s heart rate is over 180 beats per minute, and you have any reason to suspect poisoning, seek immediate medical attention. A normal resting adult dog’s heart rate is between 70 and 140 beats per minute. Larger dogs are typically at the lower end of the scale.


You can check your dog’s heart rate by placing your hand on the left side of its chest, behind its elbow, and then feeling for the heart beat. Count how many heart beats you feel in 15 seconds and multiply that number by four to get the beats per minute.If you have enough foresight, write down your dog’s normal pulse rate in a dog journal for future reference. Some dog's heartbeats beat faster by nature.

, The normal temperature range of a dog is between 100 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 39.2 Celsius).A fever does not necessarily indicate that your dog has been poisoned, but it does point to some general infirmity. If your pet is stressed or excited, you may get a falsely elevated temperature. If your pet is acting lethargic and ill and has an elevated temperature, contact your veterinarian immediately.Ask a partner to help take your dog's temperature. One person should hold the dog's head while the other inserts the thermometer into the dog’s rectum, which is found directly under the tail. Lubricate the thermometer end with petroleum jelly or water based lubricant like K-Y. Use a digital thermometer.

or bandage the wound too tightly, as the blood flow must not be impeded.,
Know what the vet will do.,
Expect recovery in 24 - 48 hours.",How to Treat a Dog for Snakebite in Australia," Although some symptoms are quite distinct depending on the type of snake that has bitten your dog, it is possible to say that a snake-bitten dog tends to react in the following general ways:


trembling
vomiting
salivation, drooling, frothing
diarrhea
weakness in the back legs, unsteadiness
dilated pupils
respiratory distress
bloody urine
continuous bleeding from the bite wound
a flaccid paralysis leading to coma or respiratory failureDeath can occur within 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the type of snake venom and the amount of venom injected.;
, If it is safe to do so, and possible, try to identify the culprit snake in order to match the anti-venom (colour, size, distinctive markings etc.). A vet can take a swab of the bite site using a snake detection kit (provided he or she can locate the bite area amidst the hair) to identify the snake venom but it can speed things up if you can either sight identify a snake or possibly relate the type of reaction your dog suffered. These images and symptom overviews will assist you:



Tiger snake: a dog bitten by a tiger snake tends to react immediately, becoming agitated and hyperactive. Not long after, the dog will most likely collapse, its tongue hanging out and the breathing becomes laboured. Lethargy sets in and the dog will either die or recover only with appropriate and immediate treatment.Dugite

, The paralysis takes over and the dog's tongue will loll out, some frothing at the mouth may be apparent and the dog will become lethargic, with its pupils not responding to light.Australian Copperhead snake - see photos for identifying features; only snake found above the snowline because they are adapted to cooler climates. They are found in river, swamp and marshland areas Red-bellied black snake - see photo for identifying features; black top and red base. It is widespread on the coast and eastern regions of Australia and especially likes moist areas, such as near water.

Other venomous Australian snakes: Yes, there are more but the ones listed here are the more commonly encountered snakes. Snakes such as the death adders and mulga snakes are less likely to be encountered by your dog unless you are venturing into their territory with your dog. Follow the general symptoms and advice outlined here.

, Ring your vet and tell them you have a dog with a snakebite coming in immediately. This will alert the vet to make arrangements to treat your dog ahead of any other animal in the surgery. It may also enable them to make logistics arrangements prior to your arrival that will ease any difficulties, such as ensuring you get a car space close to the surgery and pulling out your dog's previous records for allergic reactions etc.

, The best solution to a dog bitten by a venomous Australian snake is anti-venom and vet care. The farther you have to travel to the vet's and the more venom that has been injected into your dog, the worse your dog's chances of survival. However, you and a helper can help prolong your dog's chances of survival by some basic treatment, especially during the car trip to the vet's:


Apply a pressure bandage to a limb bite; do not apply a tourniquet

, Do not wash the bite area or cut the wound.


Apply hand pressure to a body bite (face and jaws are quite common areas for dogs to be bitten)
Keep talking to your dog and stroking it; it is good for both of you to feel a sense of reassurance and to keep calm
Carry your dog at all times - the dog cannot be expected to walk and any movement will spread the venom.

, For your own peace of mind, it helps to know how the vet will probably treat your dog. This list gives a broad overview of likely procedures, although this is dependent on the type of venom and the treatment facilities available:


The vet will likely examine the site of the wound






The vet will determine the stage of envenomation of your dog.
It might be necessary to take a snake detection test (blood or urine sample) and analysis of results
Treatment commences, usually via intravenous fluids and administration of the appropriate anti-venom
There may also be a need for antihistamines, allergy reduction reduction drugs, painkillers or sedatives., If your dog pulls through, full recovery will take 1 - 2 days. However, recovery isn't the same as being well and you will need to set aside time to nurse your dog back to full health; ask the vet for appropriate advice and help."

Examine your dog's balance.,
Watch for vomiting and diarrhea.,
Pay attention to your dog’s breathing.,
Watch for signs of sudden appetite loss.",How to Recognize Poisoning in Dogs2," If your dog is staggering, disoriented, or dizzy, it could be suffering from neurological or heart problems, as well as low blood sugar caused by poisoning. Again, seek veterinary medical attention immediately., Both are highly irregular in dogs. They are signs of your dog’s body attempting to expel foreign poisonous substances. Examine your dog’s vomit/stool for content, color, and consistency. Your dog’s stool should be firm and brown. If your dog’s stool becomes watery, loose, yellow, green, or deep black, contact your vet.

, Panting is normal for dogs most of the time. It is their way of expelling heat. Heavy panting lasting for longer than 30 minutes may be a sign of respiratory or cardiac difficulty. If you can hear wheezing or crackles as your dog breathes, seek immediate veterinary medical attention.If your dog ingested something, it could be affecting its lungs. You can determine your dog’s respiratory rate by watching the dog’s chest and counting how many breaths they take in 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get the breaths per minute. The appropriate respiratory rate of a dog is 10-30 breaths per minute.

, If your dog stops eating suddenly, it could be a sign of toxic substance ingestion. Call your vet if your dog displays a lack of appetite for more than 24 hours."

Call a poison hotline or a vet.,
Take your dog to a clinic.",How to Recognize Poisoning in Dogs3," Note when the symptoms started and any actions you are taking to alleviate them. The more information you can include the easier it will be for the professional to assist you.


Do not give your dog any liquids after ingesting a poisonous substance. Doing so, may help disseminate the poison throughout the body faster., Walk around your house and yard to check for potential dog poisons such as rodent bait, anti-freeze, mushrooms, or fertilizers. Keep an eye out for upturned boxes, damaged prescription bottles, spilled liquids, or disturbed household chemicals.If you suspect your dog ingested a poisonous product, check the back label of the packaging for warning disclaimers. Most products with toxic ingredients will list a company telephone number that customers can call for advice. Here is a list of commonly ingested poisonous substances:
Wild mushrooms (need to check individually in a reference text)
Moldy walnuts
Oleander
Lilies/bulbs
Dieffenbachia
Foxglove
Household cleaning products
Snail Bait (metaldehyde based)
Pesticides
Herbicides
Some fertilizers
Chocolate (particularly dark or baker’s chocolate)
Xylitol (sugarless gum)
Macadamia nuts
Onions
Grapes/raisins
Yeast dough
Alcohol, Poison hotlines are not just for people. Because poisons have similar effects on people and dogs, their representatives will be able to advise you.Call your veterinarian. Describe the symptoms and possible causes of the accidental poisoning.Discuss any concerns you may have regarding the poisoning. Ask if the symptoms warrant an immediate visit to the clinic.


Do not induce vomiting unless instructed. In general, after 2 hours, the substance is already out of the stomach.Also, if your pet is having trouble breathing, is staggering, or is partially conscious, do not induce vomiting because they might choke on their own vomit., Time is of the essence when treating accidental dog poisoning. If symptoms persist even after your veterinarian's initial assessment, take your dog to a clinic immediately. Locate the nearest 24-hour care facility if symptoms persist over a weekend or during nighttime hours.

Trim but do not shave their coat.,
Leave a water bowl outside.,
Give dogs plenty of shade.,
Avoid tethering your dog outside for long periods of time.,
Cool down the dog if they exhibit signs of heatstroke.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke in Dogs1," Dogs’ fur is designed not only to keep them warm but to protect their skin from the sun. Some breeds have heavier coats than others, and you may want to take them to a dog groomer to have their coat trimmed for the summer months. That said, do not shave your dog, or you may leave them at risk for sunburn and overheating., If you have a backyard where your dog runs free, you should leave out a full bowl of water when they are running around in the heat. Refill this bowl every time your dog goes outside to make sure that it is cool and fresh.

, Dogs will need shady areas to rest while they are outside so that they do not overheat. If you have a backyard, you might want to provide your dog with an area of shade, either by giving them a dog house, an umbrella, or by planting trees.


If you are planning on taking your dog to the beach, be aware that there might not be much shade available. Sand can also become hot, burning your dog’s paws., Some dogs are kept outside tied to a tree or post. Others might wait outside while their owner goes into a shop. Either way, in the summertime, it is inadvisable to leave your dog tethered for more than fifteen minutes. If you need to go shopping, leave the dog at home., Symptoms of heat stroke include heavy panting, difficulty breathing, loss of energy, drooling, and any obvious weakness or stumbling.If your dog is starting to show these signs, you can hose them down with cool (but not cold) water. If you do not have a hose, you can put your dog in the shower. As you do this, check the dog’s rectal temperature every 30-60 seconds until the temperature is down to 103.5°F / 39.8°C. The goal is to slowly bring the dog’s temperature down. You should have the dog checked out by a veterinarian.You can also soak rags or wash cloths in cool water. Place these inside of the dog’s thighs.
Do not use cold water, ice packs, or iced water. These can actually prevent the dog from cooling down.If you do not have a thermometer or cool water available to you, go directly to the vet."

Because it will take time for emergency assistance to arrive, you’ll need to begin care as soon as possible and continue until help arrives.;
, A collapsed dog that is unconscious may still be breathing, and if the dog’s still breathing, CPR is not required. So it’s imperative that you first determine whether CPR is necessary before beginning.To determine if the dog is breathing, watch for a subtle rise and fall of the chest. A dog normally takes between 20 - 30 breaths a minute, which means its chest will move every 2 - 3 seconds. If you can’t see the chest moving, place your cheek close to the dog’s nose to feel for air flow against your skin.
If his chest does not move and you can't feel air movement, the dog is not breathing.

, To locate the heart, lay the dog on its side, swing its front elbow back to the point where it meets the chest wall. That point is the third to fifth intercostal space, which is where the heart lies.Watch the chest wall at this point on the chest and look for signs of the dog’s hairs moving in time with a heartbeat. If you don’t see any movement, place your fingers over that same point on the chest and apply gentle pressure, feeling for the bump of a heartbeat against your fingertips.
If you can’t feel a heartbeat, check for a pulse on the dog’s wrist. Run your fingertip along and under the main stop pad (the pad that doesn’t touch the ground) on the back of the front foot and press gently to feel for a pulse.

, Open its mouth and check the back of its throat for blockages.An obstruction at the back of the throat can block the dog’s air supply and interfere with resuscitation, so if you discover any blockages, remove them before starting CPR.

, If the dog has a heartbeat, you'll want to concentrate on breathing for the dog. Before beginning, remove any blockages from the dog’s mouth, including any vomit, blood, mucus, or foreign material., Pull the dog's tongue forward. Align the head with the back, and tilt it back a little to help open the airway.

, If it’s a small dog, place your mouth over the dog's nose and mouth. If it’s a large dog, place your mouth over the dog's nostrils.


Hold one hand under the lower jaw to close it. Place the thumb of the same hand on top of the nose the hold the mouth shut. Alternately, you can cup both hands around the mouth (and lips if it’s a large dog). It’s important that you prevent air from escaping through the mouth.

, Blow firmly enough into the dog's snout to lift the dog's chest wall. If the chest rises easily (as is likely in a small dog), stop blowing once it has gently lifted. If you continue blowing, you may damage the dog’s lungs. Then release your lips to allow the air to escape.


Aim for 20 - 30 breaths a minute, or one breath every 2 - 3 seconds.

, The heart pumps oxygenated blood to the organs, so if you’re giving artificial respiration but there’s no heartbeat, the oxygen can’t get where it’s needed and you’ll need to provide chest compressions as well as artificial respiration.The goal is to perform chest compressions and artificial respiration in a pattern of 1 artificial breath for 10- 12 chest compressions.

, Locate the heart by laying the dog on its side and swinging its front elbow back to the point where it meets the chest wall, which is where the heart lies.

, Lay your palm over the heart and press down gently but firmly--use enough pressure to compress the chest to one-third or one-half of its depth. The compression is a quick, rapid movement: compress-release, compress-release, repeated 10 - 12 times around every 5 seconds.


Give one artificial respiration breath and then repeat the cycle.

, Stop every 2 minutes and check if the dog has resumed breathing for itself. If not, continue artificial respiration until help arrives.

, A large or giant breed may benefit from abdominal compressions, which can help return blood to the heart, but these should not be done at the expense of cardiac compression.


To give a dog abdominal compressions, gently squash or compress the front part of the belly, where large organs such as the spleen and liver are located.
You can also add an “abdominal squeeze,” which can assist recirculation of blood to the heart, by slipping your left hand under the dog’s abdomen and using your right hand to ""squeeze"" the abdomen between your two hands. Repeat this movement once every two minutes or so--but if you have your hands full with chest compressions and artificial respiration, leave this element out."

Immediately before dying, the dog will exhale deeply, and like a balloon, you can feel your dog deflate as her lungs collapse.
The dogs heart rate will drop from the normal 100 to 130 beats per minute, to as low as 60 to 80 beats per minute, with a very weak pulse.
In the final hours, you will observe that your dog breathes shallowly, and will not move anymore. Most of the time, your dog will only lie in a dark or hidden corner of your house.;
, If your dog is dying, he/she will show a very clear loss of appetite. There will be virtually zero interest in eating and drinking water. As death nears, his organs like the liver and kidneys are slowly shutting down, making her lose digestive functions.


A dry and dehydrated mouth, due to dehydration, can be observed.
Vomiting can also be observed, and usually will contain no food, only frothy or sometimes yellowish to greenish colored acid, due to bile. This also comes as a result of loss of appetite.

, Twitching or involuntary spasms of muscles can be observed as your dog weakens due to loss of glucose. There will also be a loss of response to pain, and loss of other reflex actions will be observed.


When your dog tries to stand or walk, you will notice in-coordination and staggered walking -- possibly not able to walk at all. Coma or loss of consciousness will be observed immediately before death.
Dogs that are nearing dying and have suffered a chronic or prolonged illness will have a very emaciated look. Fleshing will be lost, and muscle will be atrophied or become very small.

, Another sign is an uncontrollable bladder and anal sphincter control. Towards death your dog will urinate and defecate without control; this will be noticed even on the most disciplined and trained dog.


Urination will be uncontrollable and with little volume.
Nearing death, the dog will pass liquid diarrhea that is sometimes foul smelling, and sometimes blood tinged.
After dying, your dog will urinate and defecate for the last time because of total loss of muscle control.

, Skin will be dry and will not return to its original place when pinched -- this is due to dehydration. Mucous membranes like gums and lips will be pale; when pressed they will not return to their original pinkish color even after a long time (one second is the normal return time for gums to return to the original color).

, When your dog is slowing down in movements but is still able to eat, drink, walk, stand on its own, and can still respond to your calls, this is a sign of just plain old age. He's not suffering any particular pain, he's just growing old.


Your dog can still do the things he/she enjoys, like walking around, being petted, playing, or socializing with other dogs, though in a more decreased frequency and intensity.

, Old age can be noted when your dog is starting to reduce the amount of food he/she intakes but is still eating regularly. As dogs grow older (and people, too), they generally expend fewer calories and require less food. It's nothing to be alarmed about -- it's just how life works.

, An old dog will sleep more and more, but still being able to stand and move around and eat afterward. A dog who sleeps and doesn't move around and eat is very sick; a dog who sleeps a lot and still eats and seems social is aging.

, A loss of interest in sexual activity, despite the presence of the opposite sex, is a sign of old age. Once again, dogs aren't that different than humans -- after a while, you're just content with the smaller things in life.

, A number of things will sprout up as they age. Look for the following:


A graying or whitening of hairs
Parts of the body, where friction is common are getting bald or hairless, like the elbows, pelvic area, and butt
The teeth disappearing
Whitening of facial hairs becoming very apparent

, If your dog is already in this stage of old age, provide comfort to her by:


Placing her in a well ventilated and warm room
Providing bedding so he/she does not feel pain
Provide but do not force food and water
Spend time with her daily -- talk to her daily and stroke her head daily.

Some dogs even when already bedridden and cannot move, can still respond to touch; some will still manage to wag their tail weakly, and some just by eye movement (a testament to a dog’s loyalty, that even to the last moments of life, he/she will try to please her owner).



, Euthanasia or putting the dog to sleep is defined in the The Merck Veterinary Manual as an ""easy painless death, in consideration to the animal, it is the act of killing an animal in a humane manner."" Its three main objectives are:


The relief of pain and suffering of the animal
To minimize the pain, distress, fear, and anxiety the animal experiences before consciousness is lost
To bring about a painless and struggle free death.

If euthanasia would provide him an easier way to go, it may be appropriate. Would this be better in the long run for your pup?



, When caught in a situation wherein you have to decide if euthanasia is right, your pet’s welfare should always come first. Try to remove all of your attachment, emotion and pride. Never prolong their life for your sake. It is more humane, and it is your duty as an owner to provide your dog a distress free, and humane death. Ask yourself these questions:Is the treatment for my dog’s condition not possible anymore?
Is my dog in pain and distress that is not responsive to drugs or pain killers?
Is my dog suffering from severe and painful injuries in which he/she may never recover, like amputation of a limb, severe head trauma, and severe bleeding?
Has terminal illness reduced the quality of life for my dog to a point that he/she can no longer eat, drink, move, or defecate on her own?
Does my dog have an inoperable birth defect that will give her a poor quality of life?
Is my dog suffering from a contagious disease like rabies that can pose a threat to life to other animals and humans?
Will my dog still be able to do the things he/she enjoys even when treatment is available?

Note: if the answers to the questions above are yes, then it is time for the dog to be humanely put to sleep.



, They can properly assess the condition of your dog through tests and they will have the authority to tell you if the condition is still treatable or if your dog is near the end of its life, or needs to be put to sleep.


However, in the end the permission to put the dog to sleep or euthanasia would still be up to the owner. What are the conditions that would warrant you to consider euthanasia?

, In general, any condition that causes pain and suffering be it acute or chronic is a humane reason to put her to sleep. Here are some examples:Vehicular accidents
Severe and unresponsive cases of demodicosis
End stage kidney failure, liver failure, and very invasive tumors or malignant tumors
Contagious diseases that are incurable and pose a threat to the life of other animals and humans (an example would be Rabies)
Animals suffering severe behavioral problems, like extreme aggression even after behavioral therapy has been conducted, that can pose a risk to other animals, people and environment

, If you observe these signs in your dog, Euthanasia may be called for:The dog cannot eat, drink, stand or walk anymore and has completely lost interest and effort in these activities
The dog is already down and is urinating or defecating uncontrollably
In respiratory distress wherein breathing is labored, and the pup is unresponsive to emergency procedures and drugs
If there are signs of pain like crying or whining continually due to a terminal illness
The dog cannot move its head up and is already lying down
Extreme low temperature can be felt in your dogs skin would be a sign that her organs are already shutting down
The dog has very large tumors that are already inoperable and already causing pain and immobilization
The mucous membranes like the gums are already gray and dehydrated
A very weak and slow pulse.

When you observe these symptoms it is advised that you call your vet to help you in assessing your dog’s condition. The vet will give you professional advice that can help you in deciding.

Decide whether your dog needs to be put to sleep.,
Prepare yourself to say goodbye.,
Decide how you would like your dog's end of life to happen.,
Decide what you want to happen with your dog's body.,
Bring your dog to the veterinary office or prepare a space in your home, if the euthanasia is happening at home.,
Understand how your dog will be euthanized.,
Grieve for your pet.",How to Put a Dog to Sleep," Besides a dog being in pain from an inoperable or untreatable condition, there is the dog’s quality of life that needs to be taken into consideration. Talk to your veterinarian about any concerns you have regarding your pet's quality of life. These can include the following factors:Complete loss of appetite or unwillingness or inability to eat
Trouble standing or walking. Falling over when standing or trying to walk.
Difficulty with breathing or every breath is labored
Incontinence or soiling problems
Chronic pain or inability to get comfortable
Chronic vomiting or diarrhea that threatens to leave the animal dehydrated;
, Before making the appointment you will want to prepare yourself and your family members for life without your beloved dog. Make sure you have photos of your dog, spend some time with your dog petting and comforting it, and giving it a special treat or food.Remember to let any children that cared for and loved the dog join in this process. Do not lie to them that the dog is going to another home or that it ran away. Instead, explain to them the decision making process to euthanize the dog and explain the death to them in an age appropriate manner. An excellent book for kids is When a Pet Dies by Fred Rogers of Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood fame.

, You will need to decide if you want to be with your dog to the end of its life. Only you can decide if you want to present for the process. Some people want to be, some don’t. It only depends on what is right for you and your dog.


Most veterinarians and their staff will be fine with you being present and will explain the process to you. If you can’t be present they will understand that decision as well.
When you call for the appointment to euthanize your dog you can ask if they will come to your home to do the euthanasia. Or you may prefer to have it done at the veterinarian’s office to avoid unpleasant memories at home. Either the way the procedure is similar.

, You will need to decide on the disposition of the body after the euthanasia is completed, basically whether you want the dog's body cremated or not. You will also decide whether you want to take its ashes or body home with you for burial.


Do you have a box or a special blanket to wrap the body in? Or will you decide to have the veterinarian’s office arrange for cremation, which will add more money to the final bill.
Do you have room to bury the body in your yard? Can you dig in the yard if it’s winter time? Is there a safe spot to dig? You may have to check with your local utilities to make sure you don’t damage any buried lines on your property.

, Pay any fees upfront, as you don't want to have to deal with this after your dog has passed away. Try to stay calm for the dog's sake. It will not know what is going on, so it's best to not make is scared at the end of its life.

, Many times a sedative will be given to your dog in one of its muscle. This will help it relax, as the euthanasia solution needs to be given in the vein, usually using a front leg vein. After access to the vein is achieved, the solution is slowly given and the dog’s heart will soon stop. This normally takes place very quickly.


Many veterinarians will place a small catheter into the vein while others are adept at using a plain needle on a syringe full of the euthanasia solution.The veterinarian will usually need their assistant to help hold the pet and keep its leg steady, but you should be able to stroke and speak to your pet if you want to.
Occasionally a dog with heart or circulation troubles will take a bit more time for the solution to work. The dog may give a sigh or a couple of deep breaths.
The veterinarian will check with his or her stethoscope to make sure your dog’s heart is stopped before pronouncing it dead. They will assist you in respectfully readying your dog's body for a proper disposition.

, Grieving at the loss of your beloved companion is normal. Your dog gave you companionship, loyalty, and unconditional love, which will be sorely missed. Everyone grieves differently: some cry, some get angry, some feel sadness. Here are some tips to help you cope with your loss:Create a memorial. This could be a spot on a shelf with your dog’s framed photo, a special photo album with photos, or you could plant a tree or bush in your dog’s memory.
Write your feelings in a journal.
Ask your humane society or veterinarian if there are any pet loss support groups in the area.
Call a pet loss hotline to speak with a counselorMost of all, remember the happy times with your dog and enjoy those good memories.

Observe head shaking.,
Pay attention to changes in your dog’s behavior.,
Check your dog’s ears for irritation.,
Look for a coffee ground-like substance in your dog’s ears.,
Observe the skin around your dog’s ears.,
Identify discharge coming from the ear.,
Smell your dog’s ears.,
Take your dog to your veterinarian.,
Provide detailed information about your dog.,
Allow your veterinarian to diagnose your dog.",How to Identify Canine Ear Mites," Ear mites will cause your dog to scratch in his ears a lot. In addition, he may scratch around his ears if the ear mites have moved outside his ears.Ear mites may also cause scratching around his head and neck if they have crawled to those areas. If the itching is intense enough, your dog may pull out his hair when scratching.Your dog may or not scratch other parts of his body where the ear mites have crawled to.;
, Ear mites can cause so much irritation that your dog will start shaking his head. This head shaking may be frequent, depending on the severity of the ear mite infestation. Frequent head shaking can damage the blood vessels in the ear, causing a pool of blood and formation of a hematoma (large blood clot).Head shaking is meant to relieve the itching, but may not be very effective at doing so., The constant itching can leave your dog feeling pretty miserable, especially if he has a developed an infection in his ears from all the scratching. Mood changes to watch out for include depression and a bad temper. In addition, your dog may start running in circles in the direction of the most severely affected ear., Ear mites affect the outer part of the ear canal (the part you can see), called the otitis externa.They can pierce through the skin lining the ear canal, causing irritation.Redness is a common sign of irritation.Your dog's ears may be very painful and sensitive, so use caution when touching them.

, If your dog scratches enough, the insides of his ears could start bleeding. When the blood dries, it would start to resemble coffee grounds.Dried blood is a common indication of ear mites.


Ear mites also cause excessive production of brown wax. The combination of wax and dried blood create the look of coffee grounds in the ears., Since ear mites are not confined to the ears, you may see evidence of irritation and scratching (e.g., abrasions, scratches) around your dog’s ears.In addition, you may see rashes on the skin around the ears., The intense scratching caused by ear mites can damage the skin in your dog’s ears and lead to an invasion of bacteria. A secondary bacterial infection can cause pus to drain out of your dog’s ears.It would look yellowish or greenish.

, Ear mites themselves do not have an odor, but the secondary infections caused by ear mite irritation could cause your dog’s ears to smell badly. If you detect a foul scent coming from his ears, a bacterial or yeast infection is likely present., If your dog is showing signs of an ear mite infestation, take him to your veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.Your veterinarian will perform diagnostic tests and then recommend treatments to kill the mites.


Do not delay in taking your dog to your veterinarian. The longer he continues to scratch, the more damage he will do to his ear, possibly leading to damaged eardrums and hearing loss., The more information you have about your dog’s history and ear problems, the better your veterinarian will be able to treat your dog. Give your veterinarian a history of your dog’s overall health, when his ear symptoms started, the severity of the symptoms, and if your dog has been in contact with other animals.Ear mites are very contagious, so other pets in your home may have gotten ear mites from your dog., Your veterinarian can diagnose ear mites in several ways. For example, they can use an instrument called an otoscope to look in your dog’s ears and see the mites. Interestingly, the mites would start moving around in response to the warmth from the otoscope’s light.Your veterinarian may also swab the debris inside your dog’s ear with a cotton-tipped applicator, then place the debris on a microscope slide with some mineral oil.Under the microscope, mites appear to have round bodies with four front legs and four back legs.Large numbers of mites would be easily visible in the ear. However, if there are only a few mites, it would be easier to see them under the microscope.If your dog’s ears are extremely damaged and painful, your veterinarian may have to sedate him to get a closer look in his ears."

It is recommend to walk your dog during these hours to avoid the worst of the heat., Asphalt can become dangerously hot during the summer, burning your dog's paws and increasing their temperature. Instead of walking on sidewalks or blacktop, try to find dirt trails or grassy areas where you can walk your dog., You will need to give your dog plenty of water while you walk. Plan on taking frequent breaks so that your dog can rehydrate. Inflatable water bowls fold up easily in a backpack or pocket, and they allow your dog to drink water easily.

Refrain from breaking a window to rescue a dog.,
Contact your local government to improve laws.,
Become an activist.",How to React when You See Dogs in Hot Cars3," There is incorrect information circulating around the internet about police officers saying it is okay to break a car window to rescue a dog. This is not true. In some states, it’s even illegal for police officers to break into a car to rescue a dog. Though you may feel the need to break a window to rescue a dog, realize that the action may be a misdemeanor or felony.Some states, like Ohio and Florida, have good Samaritan laws that may protect someone from charges if they break a window to save an animal or child left in a hot car.Check your state or country’s laws before breaking a window to make sure you don’t face criminal charges.

, Not all states and countries have the same laws about animal cruelty or dogs in hot cars. If your area does not have hot car laws, or you are not satisfied with them, consider contacting your local government to encourage them to make a law or stricter laws regarding animals in hot cars.Less than half of the states in the United States have hot car laws.If your town doesn’t have laws protecting animals in hot cars, talk to officials about getting a law put into place.

, Another way to react to seeing a dog in a hot car is to become an activist to help spread awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars. Some people don’t realize the dangers, or others may not think about it in the moment. Many animal groups have fliers, videos, stickers, and even dashboard sunscreens that you can distribute around your community to help raise awareness.Talk to local businesses about putting up fliers in their establishment or signs on their doors reminding people, especially during the summer, not to leave dogs unattended in hot cars.

Give your dog water breaks.,
Put the air conditioner on.,
Never leave your dog unattended in a parked car.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke in Dogs3," When your car is parked, you can put these shades in the windshield to prevent the car from heating up too much. The shades block out direct sunlight. Be aware that in the height of summer, the car will still be warm, but the inside of the car will not take as long to cool down for you and your dog.

, Your dog will need to be hydrated during the journey. If you are going on a long car trip, make sure to take regular breaks every hour or two to give your dog water. Bring along a travel dish or a collapsible water dish. Pour water in from a water bottle, and let your dog drink until they are satisfied., Even if you don’t need the A/C, your dog might. Proper ventilation and air flow is important for your dog in the car. If your dog is traveling in a crate, make sure that the air can reach them. The crate should have holes, and the air flow should be unobstructed towards the crate.If your A/C does not work, you can also crack a window while the car is moving. Do not let your dog stick their head out of the window.

, Even if you park in the shade and leave the windows open, the internal temperature of your car can spike very quickly to dangerous levels. Do not leave your dog in the car, even for just a few minutes. Leave them at home when you need to go to the store. If you are traveling with them, keep them close at all times."

Taking a long car ride with the windows rolled down partway.
Playing fetch on the beach.
Visiting a pet store and picking out a special toy.
Frolicking with friends at a dog park.;
, Most pet parents restrict their dog’s food and limit human foods, which is in the dog’s best interest. To make your dog’s final days really special, try easing up on these restrictions a bit.For example, if your dog licks the bowl clean every time you feed him, then give him a little extra food a few times per week. Or, if your dog drools whenever you cook bacon on the weekend, set aside a few strips just for him. However, be careful not to give your dog too many rich, fatty foods, as this could upset his stomach.
You might even consider cooking some special meals for your dog. For example, you could make him a dish of cooked ground hamburger and brown rice with a few carrots tossed in.
If you are not a fan of cooking, then look for a dog bakery or a pet store that carries gourmet dog treats and buy something special for your dog., Even if your dog is nearing the end of his life, he will probably still find joy in some of his favorite games, like playing fetch or keep away in your backyard. If your dog seems like he wants to play, don’t refuse him. Play with him whenever he seems up to it.


Watch your dog for cues that he is becoming tired. Some dogs will keep playing even if they are exhausted. For example, if your dog starts to pant, move more slowly, or lay down, then that is a sign that he is getting tired.Stop the game or at least give him a break before continuing.

Instead, feed them Iams or other dry, healthier foods. Only feed them twice a day. ;
, Just like humans, dogs need plenty of play time. For humans, 60 minutes a day is ideal so why not spend it running or playing outside with you pup? That way you both are becoming healthier and more fit!

, Whether you let your dog roam the house or play in the back yard, it is better than keeping him in that kennel.

Take the dog to the vet.,
Protect yourself while cleaning up the vomit.",How to Make a Dog Throw Up," When a dog is choking, time is of the essence and there are much more useful things you can do. See How to Save a Choking Dog for help with this problem.;
, Only a trained veterinarian will have the training and expertise to know when vomiting is appropriate with absolute certainty. This should be your first move as soon as you notice that your dog has eaten something hazardous. Listen to your vet's instructions and follow them promptly.


When you call your vet, you'll usually be asked for this information:Your dog's approximate weight.
What it ate, how much it ate, and when it ate it.
Any medical conditions it may have.

, Dogs don't always eat poisonous materials during your vet's office hours. Luckily, the following help lines are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Note that using these services may cost you a a consultation fee.ASPCA Poison Control: 888-426-4435

Pet Poison Helpline: 855-213-6680


, The animal expert you contact should be able to help you determine when vomiting is necessary. Always follow this person's instructions — even if they conflict with the ones in this article. In general, vomiting may be advised in the following situations:Your dog ate something that is poisonous.
Your dog is healthy.
Your dog ate the poisonous substance within about the last two hours.
Your dog doesn't have certain genetic features that make it more likely to inhale its vomit. These include collapsing trachea, abnormal airway, and brachycephaly (having a smooshed-in face — for instance, Boston Terriers and Pugs have this).

, As noted above, making your pet vomit can be a very bad idea in certain situations. In general, vomiting will not be advised in the following situations:Your dog ate the hazardous substance over two hours ago.
Your dog is obviously sick, dazed, distressed, or lethargic.
Your dog ate something corrosive, like bleach, acid, drain cleaner, batteries, etc. This can cause burns on the inside of the throat as it comes back out.
Your dog ate a hydrocarbons or petroleum distillate, like motor oil, gasoline, kerosene, lighter fluid, etc. This can lead to severe pneumonia if the dog inhales any of the substance when it vomits.

, Dogs aren't often very tidy vomiters — they don't understand what's happening to them, so they'll rarely get all their vomit into a single, tidy pile. This means that it's usually easiest to simply make your dog throw up outside.


If this isn't an option, grab a garbage bag or two to catch the vomit. You may also want to lay down a tarp or newspaper if you have some handy.

, This isn't essential, so you can skip this step if you don't have food handy. However, if your dog hasn't eaten in the last few hours, this will make it more likely to vomit by making its stomach fuller.You can use its typical dog food for this.


Don't pester your dog if it doesn't seem to want to eat. Your time is better spent by moving on.

, This converts to about two mL per kilogram. The hydrogen peroxide you want is 3% concentration. If you absolutely have to use more concentrated hydrogen peroxide, dilute it with water. If you have to use a less-concentrated hydrogen peroxide, use extra.


One tablespoon is approximately 15 mL. One teaspoon is approximately 5 mL.
Don't give more than 45 mL (three tablespoons) at once, even if your dog weighs more than 45 pounds. This can make your dog sick., This can be difficult — your dog doesn't understand the danger it's in, so it may resist. Your best bet is to use a syringe or a turkey baster aimed at the back of the dog's throat.Holding your dog, gently work your fingers under its lips and in to its mouth. Gently hold its head in place, aim the syringe or baster, and squirt the hydrogen peroxide all at once.


Do your best to get the hydrogen peroxide down, even if your dog doesn't like it (which it probably won't). If your vet has directed you to make your dog vomit, your dog's health is more important than its comfort.
If your dog is clenching its teeth, you can sometimes get it to open if you squeeze gently on either side of its jaw near the back.

, Vets will normally recommend against feeding ice cream to dogs for nutritional reasons. However, desperate times call for desperate measures. Mix the dose of hydrogen peroxide with some vanilla ice cream and offer it to the dog in a bowl. Most dogs will eat this, as the sugary taste of the ice cream does a fairly good job of masking the soapy taste of the chemical.Honey is another good choice if you don't have any ice cream on hand.

, Stay by the dog, watching it. Have it walk around with you for a minute or two to get the stomach moving, which helps speed things along.Hydrogen peroxide should irritate the stomach and cause vomiting within 15 minutes or so. Be ready — vomiting may come on quickly.


If your dog doesn't vomit within 15 minutes, you can give it a second dose. If it still hasn't vomited 15 minutes after that, call the vet or hotline again for instructions., Whether or not your dog vomits, you should do this. The only exception is if your vet specifically tells you it's not necessary. Vomiting doesn't always clear out the entire stomach and it does nothing to remove poison that has already moved on into the intestines. These mean that a vet's attention may sometimes be necessary to avoid danger, even if your dog seems happy when it's done vomiting.If you can, collect a small sample of the dog's vomit to bring to the vet. Your vet may be able to identify it.

, If your dog vomited outside, cleanup may not be terribly difficult — a hose will often get the job done. However, if more hands-on work is required, be sure to take all necessary precautions. Keep in mind that whatever your dog ate may still be in its stomach contents. If this is hazardous to humans, protecting yourself is very important.


With this in mind, you'll want to use thick rubber or latex gloves as you clean up the vomit. If the hazardous material is letting off fumes or the smell is overpowering, a facemask or a builder's respirator is a very good idea.

Use a gauze muzzle for emergencies.,
Cut off a long strip of gauze bandage.,
Tie off a big loop in the middle.,
Advance toward the dog so they can’t see you.,
Consider training your dog to wear a muzzle.,
Slide the loop over the nose.,
Tighten the loop.,
Tie the bandage behind the neck.",How to Apply a Gauze Muzzle to a Dog1," Gauze muzzles are not optimum for dogs. They are best reserved for emergencies, when there is absolutely no other option. You should also only use a homemade muzzle like a gauze muzzle temporarily.Other materials that can become emergency muzzles include leashes, ropes, pantyhose, and so on.
Avoid having to use a homemade muzzle by keeping a real muzzle in your dog’s fist aid kit.
You can purchase a gauze roll bandage at any pharmacy (like Walgreens), drugstore, big box store (like Walmart), or most grocery stores.
Check your first aid kit. Many come with a roll of gauze.;
, In an emergency, you want to create a gauze muzzle quickly. Get an idea for how much gauze you'll need by pulling out and cutting off a strip long enough to wind several times around your dog’s head. Before cutting the gauze, wrap it around your dog's head from under their chin to behind their ears. Then triple this length before cutting.The length that you cut depends on the size of your dog’s head. You will obviously need a longer strip for a bigger dog.
Cutting off such a long length allows you extra in case you estimated the size of your dog’s head wrong.

, Pull the strip of gauze out to its full length. Form a loop in the middle of the gauze strip. Tie a knot where this loop closes. You should now have a loop of gauze with long, loose ends on either side of the knot.Make sure the knot is a slipknot so that you can tighten the loop once it is around the dog’s nose.
Tie a slipknot by creating a loop and pushing a second loop through it., You want to approach the dog with the loop open in your hands. In order to place the loop securely over your dog’s snout, make sure you approach from the back or the side. This way they can’t see you coming and will be less startled.

, Although you should restrict use of a gauze muzzle to emergencies, you might want to train your dog to use a muzzle. If a dog is trained, they will be less likely to become aggressive when you apply a gauze muzzle.Use treats and gradual exposure techniques to train a dog to take a muzzle.
For example, you could smear the interior of a muzzle with a treat like peanut butter or wet dog food.
Play with the dog while they wear the muzzle so that they associate the muzzle with positive things.
Take short walks with the muzzle.
Do this muzzle training whenever you would normally walk your dog, such as every afternoon.

, Before your dog has a chance to see what you are holding, slide the loop over their nose. Keep the center of the loop over the end of the dog’s nose for the best fit.Slid the loop all the way back to the jaw line, where the snout meets the face.

, As soon as the loop is around the dog’s nose, tighten the loop firmly so that your dog cannot open his mouth. Bring the loose pieces of fabric around the snout and tie another loose knot on the bottom of the snout., Once the loop is in place, pull the loose ends of the gauze behind the dog’s head. Cross one end over the other. Then tie the two ends in a bow that is easy to undo.Since gauze muzzles are used only in emergencies, being able to remove them quickly is important.

Assess the severity of the scratches.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Apply drops or ointment.,
Consider more invasive treatments.,
Keep an eye on the injury.,
Look for excessive squinting or blinking.,
Pay attention to signs of irritation and pain.,
Inspect your dog's eyes.,
Try to wash out your dog's eye.",How to Treat Scratches on Your Dog's Eye," If the injury to eye is superficial and does not give your dog much discomfort, you can usually wait a few days to see it the scratches heal on their own before setting up a veterinary appointment. However, if the scratches are severe, or the eye looks infected, then you should get a veterinary appointment immediately.


If you are not sure about the severity of the scratches to your dog's eye, take it to a veterinarian. They can assess your dog's eyes thoroughly and can weigh the need for treatment versus the dog's ability to heal itself.;
, If your dog is in severe discomfort or the eye is getting worse over a day or two, then you should make an appointment at your veterinarian. It is important to get treatment for eye scratches that are not healing before they develop into a more severe issue.


Your veterinarian will be able to get a closer look at your dog's eye by using specialty instruments. This allows the vet to assess the trauma thoroughly.If left untreated, scratches to the eye can develop into serious infections, which could potentially impact your dog's vision long term. For example, corneal ulcers can develop in areas of the cornea that are damaged but do not heal. This damage to the clear exterior of the eye can progress deep into the eye, eventually damaging your dog's sight if it goes untreated.

, In most cases of light scratches, your veterinarian will prescribe drops or ointment to be applied to the eye. These medications will help the injury heal and will keep infections at bay. Your veterinarian will usually apply the first dose but you will need to apply additional doses at home.How often and how long you apply these medications will vary depending on the severity of the injury and what type of medication your veterinarian prescribes. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for application and feel free to call your veterinary office if you have further questions about the medication's application.

, If the damage to your dog's eye is more serious, your veterinarian may suggest surgery to correct the issue. In the case of severe corneal ulcers, for instance, some veterinary surgeons will suggest corneal transplants or grafts in order to save your dog's vision.As with all surgeries, there are risks to your dog's health when being put under anesthesia for surgery. Be sure that your veterinarian has assessed your dog's overall health and made sure that it is fit enough to undergo surgery before your dog is put under. This usually includes a physical exam and blood tests to look for risk factors and health problems., Once your dog starts treatment, you should keep an eye out for the signs of proper healing. Make sure that your dog's injury and symptoms are improving and not getting worse. This includes making sure your dog's eye is getting less red, expelling less puss, and that it is causing your dog less and less discomfort.If your dog will not leave its injury alone, you may need to put a cone on the dog to keep it from scratching its eyes.
If your dog's injury is getting worse, for instance there are signs of infection, then you should consult with your veterinarian. Tell them about the new symptoms and they will tell you whether or not to bring your dog back in to the veterinary office.

, When your dog gets a minor injury to its eye, it may squint or blink repeatedly to deal with the discomfort. If you notice this behavior your dog may have an scratched eye.Repeated blinking or squinting may signal a different problem as well. For instance, your dog may simply have a foreign body in its eye that can be removed easily.

, If your dog is pawing at its eyes repeatedly, or rubbing its eye area on the ground, it may have an injury to its eyes. This behavior indicates that the dog it trying to deal with some discomfort in the area.


Pawing or rubbing at the eyes signals an issue but it does not indicate exactly what is going on. The discomfort could be caused by a scratch or injury to the eye, but it could also signal some sort of illness or condition inside the eye, such as glaucoma.Stop your dog from scratching or rubbing at its eye. This behavior can do more damage to the eye. If you have a cone for your dog, put it on. If not, you should cover the eye with a bandage and watch that your dog doesn't rub at it until you can get veterinary treatment., Take a look at your dog's eye if the dog is exhibiting signs of discomfort. Hold the dog still and open up the eyelids so that you can get a good look at the surface of the eye. If you can see deep scratches, redness, or discharge coming from the eye, then you should get your dog checked out by a veterinarian.You may need a bright light to illuminate the surface of the eye in order to see the scratches.
It is likely that you will need a helper to hold your dog still while you are inspecting its eye. This is especially true if you need to hold your dog's eyelids open in order to get a good look at the surface of the eye.

, If you see a foreign body, use an eye wash to get it out. If you suspect that your dog has something in its eye but you don't actually see anything, you should still use a pet eye wash to flush the eye of irritants.Hold your dog still and flush the eye several times. You may need a helper to hold your dog still while you do this.
Using tweezers, for instance, can risk further injury to the eye if your dog moves while you are near its eyeball.

Place the knot under the chin.,
Tie loose ends behind the ears.,
Pull a loose end back through the nose loop.",How to Apply a Gauze Muzzle to a Dog2," Just as you would for a dog with a long snout, cut off a long strip of gauze bandage. Make sure it is long enough to wind several times around your dog’s head. Then form a loop in the middle and tie a slipknot for it., For pug-nosed dogs, you must be sure to place the loop’s slipknot under their chin. Come up on the dog from behind or the side, then slip it under their nose. Keep the knot turned toward the floor so that it easily slides under the dog’s chin.For longer snouts, the knot goes behind the ears.

, Once the loop is on the dog’s nose, slide it back toward the jawline. Then pull the slipknot tight enough to keep the dog’s mouth shut. Quickly pull the loose ends back and tie them behind the ears.Use a slipknot or bow so that the muzzle can be removed quickly.

, For pug-nosed dogs, it is important to take one loose end and feed it back through the gauze tied around the dog’s snout. Pull this loose end across your dog’s forehead. Then slide it under the tightened loop at the top, right by the nose.Feeding an end back through the loop keeps the muzzle from slipping off.
Keeping the muzzle on can be challenging on dogs with pug noses, and keeping it on is important.

In many cases of twitching eyes, your veterinarian will take a close look in your dog's ears. Certain types of ear infections can cause eyes to twitch.
Testing may include laboratory testing of your dog's blood and imaging of the dog's head., Eye twitching can be caused by a bad reaction to medications that are prescribed for your dog.

Make a list of suitable family and friends.,
Ask them to be your emergency contact.,
Determine how much they are willing to help you.,
Consider having multiple contacts.,
Locate safe havens in case of a natural disaster.",How to Establish an Emergency Contact for Your Dog1," Write a list of your trusted family, friends, and neighbors to see who might be willing to become your dog’s emergency contact. Think carefully about who may be able to assist you. An emergency contact may have to enter your home if you are hospitalized, incapacitated, or unable to return home. Make sure that you trust them to do this.


The person should be able to provide for all of your dog’s needs. For example, if you have an energetic or high-energy breed, you may not want to choose someone who lives in an apartment. Instead, you may want to ask someone who lives in a house or has a fenced yard.
You should exclude people who are allergic or afraid of dogs.
If they have pets, make sure that your dog is compatible and friendly with them.An emergency contact should already know your dog, and your dog should be comfortable around them. Do not choose someone if your dog acts nervous, aggressive, or shy around them.An emergency contact should live close enough that they can reach your home quickly in case of an emergency.;
, To ask, you should call or meet with your candidate. Tell them that you are trying to prepare in case of an emergency, and ask them if they would be willing to take in your dog. Emphasize that this in case of an emergency only.


You can say, “I am trying to find an emergency contact for my dog in case something happens to me. I was wondering if you would be willing to do that. I’m not asking you to dog sit; this is really just to make sure that Fido is taken care of in case the worst happens.”
You might also want to give them an idea of what taking care of your dog is like. You can say, “Fido is a very sweet and quiet dog, and he is house-trained. You would have to walk him twice a day though because he has a ton of energy.”

, Your emergency contact may take in your dog for a few days if there is an accident, but they may not agree to adopt your dog long-term or in the event of your death.You should make sure you understand the circumstances that somebody is willing to take in your dog. You should ask:


“How long would you be able to take my dog in for?”
“If there was a natural disaster, do you think that you would be able to take in my dog? Or would you have to evacuate as well?”
“If I died, do you think you would be able to adopt my dog permanently?”

, Depending on the circumstance, you may want to have a few different options for emergency contacts. If one contact is unavailable, another may be able to help in their place. This will ensure that someone is able to care for your dog in case of an emergency.


If someone takes in your dog but is suddenly unable to continue care for them, they can contact the other emergency contacts. When you choose your contact, you should let them know who else may be able to help.

, If you are evacuated for any reason, you may not be able to take your pet with you, as many disaster shelters will not take pets, and your normal emergency contact may have to evacuate as well.

Many shelters will fill up during a natural disaster or emergency. If you have advance warning, you should plan for your dog’s evacuation early.

Do follow up treatment for corneal ulcers.,
Keep your dog in a cone after surgery.",How to Treat Ingrown Eyelids in Dogs," Squinting is an easily recognized sign of eye irritation. Your dog may squint if it feels like there's something in the eye that it can't get out. In this case, the ingrown eyelid is causing the eyelashes to rub directly against the eye. If you can't tell if your dog is squinting, compare the size of your dog's irritated eye to the other one. If they're not the same size, your dog is squinting one.Your dog may just keep the eye closed because it's so uncomfortable.;
, You may not be able to tell if an ingrown eyelid is irritating your dog's eyes just by looking at the eyes. But you'll probably see your dog's eyes watering excessively if an ingrown eyelid is causing an eyelash to rub against the eye. The dog may blink more to empty the eyes of tears. Larger dogs may also have pus around the outer corners of the eyes.You may also notice tear staining down your dog's cheeks. This suggests your dog's eyes are constantly irritated.

, Your dog may rub at its eye with a paw. Since this may give your dog minor relief, your dog may continually swipe its eye with its paws so you'll need to monitor your dog for eye infection. If your dog develops an eye infection, you'll see yellow-green discharge.Instead of swiping its eye with a paw, your dog may rub its face along the ground.

, Dogs that are known for wrinkly faces (like Pekinese, Basset hounds, and pugs) are commonly associated with ingrown eyelids caused by entropion. This is because the weight of the extra skin pushes down on the eyelids which causes them to roll into the eye. Entropion can also occur in any breed. Entropion is often found in:Bulldogs
Shi Tzus
Boxers
Cocker and springer spaniels
Dalmatians
Labradors
Golden retrievers

, If you notice any symptoms of eye irritation, take your dog to the vet. The vet will examine your dog's eyes under magnification to see how well the eyelid sits against the cornea. The vet will also check to see if any hairs are rubbing against the surface of the eye.It's better to take your dog in if you suspect any eye irritation than to wait. When eye conditions like entropion are left untreated, your dog can develop secondary eye problems.

, To rule out secondary eye problems (like a corneal ulcer), the vet will put a special dye into the eye. The vet will also check eye pressure and measure your dog's tear production. These will all alert the vet as to whether or not there are additional eye conditions that need to be treated before treating the ingrown eyelid.These tests are not painful, but the vet may give your dog topical anesthetic drops to keep your dog relaxed and comfortable.

, The common treatment for ingrown eyelids is a procedure that removes a sliver of skin from immediately below or above the eyelid. This blepharoplasty treatment should make the eyelid lie flush against the cornea instead of turn in towards it.Some surgeons may recommend doing two small surgeries to remove very small amounts of skin. This prevents the removal of to much skin at once and another surgery can be added if the entropion is still present after the first surgery.

, If you have a puppy with ingrown eyelids, the vet may recommend temporarily tacking your dog's eyelids. This is because young dogs who get blepharoplasty may continue growing, requiring another surgery. Instead, with tacking, your dog will get a brief anesthetic in order to put tacking sutures near the eyelid. These will help turn the eyelids out.Once your dog has finished growing, the vet will give another anesthetic and remove the tacking sutures. Then your dog can get a full blepharoplasty.

, For dogs with heavy skin folds such as the Shah Pei, basset hound or bloodhound, a full 'face lift' may be needed. This is because the sheer amount of extra skin falls forward into the eyes every time your dog lowers its head. A surgeon will remove excess skin and pull the facial folds backwards.This is a major surgery and is usually only done if blepharoplasty hasn't worked for your dog. Realize that it will significantly change your dog's appearance.

, During the diagnosing exam, the vet will have checked for corneal ulcers. These are caused by repeated rubbing of an eyelash against the cornea. Most shallow corneal ulcers will heal on their own once the ingrown eyelids are treated. If your dog had deeper corneal ulcers, the vet will probably treat with medicated eye drops and surgery (if there's a lot of damage).Your dog may need to be hospitalized for corneal ulcer surgery. Your dog may need up to three weeks for a deep corneal ulcer to heal and will need to keep a patch in place over the eye.

, The vet will probably recommend putting your dog in an Elizabethan collar or cone until the eyes have healed, usually about 2 weeks after surgery. If your dog also had corneal ulcer surgery, it may have gotten a drain put in place. Follow your vet's recommendations for cleaning and maintaining the drain.Be sure to go to follow up appointments with the vet. This way, the vet can monitor your dog's healing and adjust any medications your dog is taking.

This agreement might state, ""If there is a situation in which I am hospitalized, incapacitated or unable to return home, I designate John Doe to arrange for the feeding and care of my dog until I am able to return home again.""You both should have a copy of this agreement.

, You can set provisions in your will to leave your pet to a designated caretaker, and you can even set aside money to that caretaker to provide for your dog after your death. Make sure you have talked about this extensively with your emergency contact before you do so; they should be fully committed to adopting your dog. You should then contact your lawyer about including the caretaker in your will.If you cannot find someone willing to adopt your dog after your death, you can name a charitable organization that will rehome your dog. This will ensure that your dog does not go to a kill-shelter after your death.
Some states allow you to establish a trust that immediately provides money to a trustee for your dog’s care in the event of your death. Talk to a lawyer to see if this is an option for you.

, Once you have decided who your contact is, you should make sure that your vet knows. Call your vet, and tell them that you have established an emergency contact. Tell them that this person is responsible for your dog if something happens to you. This will help your vet continue caring for your dog in your absence.


When telling your vet, you should say, ""Hi, I just want to notify you that I have chosen an emergency contact for my dog. Her name is Mary Smith, and she lives at 123 Main Street. If anything happens to me, she can make medical decisions for my dog on my behalf. Thanks.""

, Emergencies can occur when you are not home. To let emergency responders know that there is an animal in the home, you can place a sticker on your window. On this sticker, you should also write both your name and number and the contact information of the pet’s emergency contact.You can buy the stickers online or at a pet store.
The ASPCA provides free stickers through their website.


, In case something happens to you, you can inform responders that you have a pet in need of care at your home. The best way to do this is to stick a note in your wallet that states your dog’s name, any medications that they need, and the name of their emergency contact. Responders can reach the contact, and let them know that they should take your pet."

Check in with your contact.",How to Establish an Emergency Contact for Your Dog3," If there is an emergency and you cannot reach your home, your contact should be able to enter your house to take care of your pet. It is important that you give your contact your house key.If you have a security system installed, they should have the password to turn it off.

, To make things easy for your emergency contact, you should put together a kit that has everything your dog might need in an emergency. These items can be stored in a special toolbox, duffle bag, plastic storage crate, or trunk. Tell your contact where the kit is located so that they can grab it in an emergency.You should include:


Medications
A week’s worth of food
A bag of treats
A week's worth of clean bottled water
First-aid kitCopy of your dog's medical records
An extra leash, You should make sure that there are written instructions for your contact so that they know exactly how to provide for your dog. You might want to include these written instructions in the emergency kit, or you can post it on your fridge. You might also consider giving your contact the instructions in advance, so that they are prepared if an emergency strikes. Be sure to include:


How often and how much the dog eats
How often they need to be walked
When the dog needs to take medications
Who their vet is
Any medical problems
How often they need to be groomed
Where your dog’s crate, carrier, bed, toys, and food/water bowl are located in the home.

, If the worst does happen, you should stay in touch with your emergency contact. As soon as you are able, call them to make sure that your dog is taken care of. You might even ask your contact to send you pictures or videos of your dog so that you can have peace of mind while you recover from the emergency.


You may also want to make sure that the contact is updated on your situation. You can say, “I will be in the hospital for another week. Are you ok taking care of Max for that long?”
If your contact is suddenly unable to take care of the dog, let them know where they can take your dog while you recover. This can be another emergency contact, a vet, or a boarding facility.
Be sure to thank them for their help.

Consider a saline flush for narrow ducts.,
Wipe bulbous eyes every couple of hours.,
Remove environmental factors that cause eye irritation.,
Keep the eyes clear of hair.,
Check for inward-growing hairs around the eyes.",How to Prevent Tear Staining in Dogs1," Tears contain a chemical called porphyrin that turns rust-colored when exposed to the air. A process called oxidation causes an eventual color stain to a dog's fur. Just like hair dye, it takes a while for the porphyrin to stain fur. Tear staining is a result of tears not being wiped away before the fur gets stained.It is more important, however, to understand why a dog's eyes are tearing. This could have a medical cause and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.;
, The eye produces tears to moisten the eye's surface and flush away dust and debris. The tears then drain away via the tear ducts, which act like a plug hole in a sink. If the ducts are narrow or blocked, tears can't drain away efficiently and spill over the face.


If dirt or debris got your dog's eyes, it may have blocked the tear duct. The vet may be able to remove it.
Ducts sometimes get narrow due to infection. A vet should be able to detect an infection and prescribe antibiotics as treatment. See a veterinarian immediately if you suspect infection. Infections can cause ulcers and cause permanent damage to the eyes.

, Your dog may just have been born with narrow ducts. A veterinarian can confirm this by ruling out more serious causes. This is common in toy breeds like Chihuahuas, poodles, and Bichon Frises. Unfortunately, trying to open up naturally narrow ducts doesn't often succeed. The vet might try to stretch the duct with a saline flush, but it will likely shrink back down.


In rare cases, this process causes scar tissue that narrows the duct even more.In rare cases, this can lead to long-term improvement. Ask your vet's opinion about whether stretching the tear duct is the right decision for your dog.

, Some breeds such as pugs or Pekingese have very large, round eyes that are somewhat bulbous. Big eyes are more likely to water because they have a larger surface area. Bulbous eyes also tend to push the eyelid forward and out, making the tear duct poorly-aligned to drain the fluid away.Wipe tears away regularly. You can medicated pads from a pet store that contains solution to safely clean the area under your dog's eyes.
Wipe your dog's eyes every couple of hours or whenever you see fresh tears.

, When the eye's irritated, it produces tears to flush the irritation away. Irritants can include allergies, cigarette smoke, perfumes, deodorants, or spray air fresheners. If you suspect a substance is causing your dog's eyes tearing, stop exposing your dog to the substance and see if it helps.If the dog's eyes improve, you can try to reintroduce irritants to see if these were indeed what caused the tearing. If you're able to confirm, stop exposing your dog to these substances.
When using an aerosol spray of any sort, keep the dog out of the room for 20 minutes or until the air is clear.
See a vet for medication if your dog suffers from allergies, like hay fever, which can also result in scratching at itchy skin.

, If your dog has a long coat, his fur might be getting into his eyes. This can cause irritation that leads to tearing. Get your dog groomed in a manner that keeps his eyes free of hanging fur.

, Sometimes fine hairs around the eyelid that grow inward toward the cornea. If this is the case, the dog's eye will be irritated every time he blinks — like when you have dust in your eye.You will not be able to see inward growing hairs with the naked eye, but a vet should be able to use special equipment to examine your dog's eyes. He or she will be able to see if this is the cause of your dog's tearing.
A clinician can remove the hairs through a process like electrolysis. An electrical current is used to kill the hair follicles. The hairs won't be able to grow back.

Cataracts are often a cause of loss of vision related to age, and can be easily seen by looking at your dog's eyes.Cataracts are marked by a cloudy appearance around a dog's pupil.
Monitor your dog's eyes frequently as it ages, as cataracts are easier to treat and reverse if caught early. Take your dog to the vet the moment you notice cataracts developing.;
, Changes in your dog's vision can actually be detected by observing your dog's eyes on film. Usually, if there's glare on the photo, it will lead to red eye. However, if a dog is losing its sight, changes in the eye will cause a greenish appearance in response to camera glare., If there's a tacky discharge in or around your dog's eyes, this may indicate that your dog might have a condition called dry eye. It is not an indication of problems inside of the eye, but your dog may have trouble seeing if the discharge is thick enough. If you notice discharge in or around your dog’s eyes, make an appointment with your vet.

, Many owners assume their dogs are simply losing interest in playing as they grow older. However, sometimes a lack of activity can be due to vision. While it's normal for a dog's desire to play to decline, watch how your dog responds during play. This can offer clues regarding your dog's vision.Does your dog simply not react to toys anymore? If you, say, throw your dog a chew toy, does it offer no response?
If your dog does not look at a toy at all when it's thrown, it may simply not see it. You may also notice that a dog will bring you its toy, but be unable to retrieve it after you throw it. This is a sign your dog may be losing its vision.

, What appears to be a decrease in appetite can be a problem related to your dog's vision. If your dog is suddenly eating less, it may be struggling to find its food. If you notice your dog's food and water bowl do not need as frequent refilling, keep an eye on your dog around its food.Your dog may have to sniff in order to locate the food bowl. It may not realize food is present until it's close enough to smell the food.You should always have changes in appetite evaluated by a vet. They can indicate a number of health conditions in addition to a loss of vision.

, Dogs who are losing their vision suddenly become clumsier. Your dog may trip more often and bump into people and objects frequently. Your dog may also move less overall, and may be hesitant to move around if he is struggling to see.If a dog's vision is going, it may also be hesitant to jump on and off furniture or go up and down the stairs., When a dog's vision goes, it may rely more on its owner. Lacking the ability to see on its own, your dog may suddenly become clingier. A loss of vision can cause a lot of anxiety. You may notice your dog follows you around the house more and becomes increasingly agitated when you leave for work or school. Your dog may, for example, frequently whine or howl when it sees you leave your home., If a dog's vision is going, it will become easier to startle. This can sometimes result in aggression, as you may unintentionally frighten your dog. The dog will not be able to see you coming, and may nip or growl when startled.You may, for example, notice your dog starts growling at very small noises or jumps when petted.

, Changes in behavior and appearance should always be evaluated by a veterinarian. If you suspect your dog is having vision problems, a vet can do a checkup, determine the level of vision loss, and recommend a treatment program. Make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible to address your dog's eyesight.Changes in behavior such as increased anxiety, aggression, and appetite can indicate a variety of problems besides loss of vision. Tell your vet about all your dog's symptoms. The vet may want to run some basic tests to rule out other possible health conditions.

, If your dog has cataracts, surgery is sometimes an option. This removes the cataract and places an artificial lens in its place. It generally has a high success rate, but it is only safe if your dog is currently in good health.There is an intense amount of postoperative care required for cataract surgery, so make sure you understand your dog's needs after the procedure. You will need to keep your dog in a protective collar, offer it eye drops, and keep a relaxed and calm environment in your home.

, Sometimes, there is no cure for canine blindness other than management. If your dog's loss of vision is irreversible, work to leave non-visual cues around your home to help your dog get around.For hardwood floors, put stair runners near the top and bottom of the staircase. This will help your dog realize where the staircase begins and ends.
Make use of sound so your dog can identify you and other household members. Try clapping your hands when you enter a room, talking to your dog before petting it, and calling your dog for meal times.
Use scent to guide your dog. You can douse toys in vanilla extract or use strong smelling food.

, Safety is important if your dog goes blind. You want to make sure to keep your dog safe from hazards that it cannot see.You may have to block off places like staircases and swimming pools.
You may want to confine your dog in a crate or room in your home when you're away.
If you have other dogs, you may need to separate them during meal times. A dog that can see may steal a blind dog's food.

, It can be difficult to adjust when a dog loses its vision. It can take a while to make the necessary alterations to your home and schedule. However, know that most dogs who lose their vision still have fulfilling lives. Try to stay patient and have hope as you adjust to your dog's medical condition."

Understand that tear staining doesn't harm your dog.,
Wipe the eyes regularly.,
Be careful when using stain removing products.",How to Prevent Tear Staining in Dogs2," The sight of rusty fur might unsettle you, but your dog isn't suffering from anything but the tearing. Sometimes, tearing is just a natural part of the dog's anatomy, if he has bulbous eyes, for example. Treating the tear stains is a cosmetic concern only, so it's up to you on whether or not you want to treat the problem.

, Keep some clean cotton swabs with you, and and each time you see eye goop glistening in the corner of the dog's eye, wipe it away. Don't let the fluid dry and get crusty, or it will build up in the corner of the eye. You can usually just remove this with your fingers, but sometimes it dries onto the hair and is harder to clear away. In that case, soak a cotton swab in cooled boiled water, soak the crust until it softens, and then remove it with your fingers.

, There are many grooming products that promise to remove or reduce tear staining. However, you should only use these after a vet has checked your dog to find out if you can treat the tearing yourself.


Read labels carefully to see if you need to dilute the product before applying it to your dog's face.
Some of these stain-removing products have ingredients that can irritate the eyes. Check with your vet for recommendations on how to avoid worsening the problem.

When caught early enough, small tear stains can be treated easily.Get a cloth damp and then gently wipe the fur around your pet's eyes. There is no need to add soap, especially if the tear drops are very fresh.
Be very gentle, however, when cleaning around your pet's eyes. You do not want to get water in their eyes, or the edges of the cloth, as this can cause irritation.;
, Tear stain removers can be used to address set-in tear stains. While these are not necessarily a medical concern, they can be unsightly. In some cases, crusty stains can cause eye irritation for dogs and cats. You should always talk to your vet about a safe tear stain remover for your pet instead of purchasing a product at a pet store or online.Herbal or natural products may be safer on your cat or dog than harsher commercial products. However, labels can sometimes be misleading and a ""natural"" product may contain a lot of synthetic chemicals. This is why consulting a vet is important.
You likely will not need a prescription for a tear stain remover. However, your vet should be able to give you a recommendation for a commercial product to purchase. Your vet's office may even have the product in stock for you.
Go over instructions for use carefully with your vet, especially if your pet has an underlying health issue that could affect how the product is applied.

, Make sure to read reviews of any products you look at that promise to remove tear stains. You can read reviews online. You can also type the names of various products into a search engine. Some products are not FDA approved and have a bad reputation for causing eye irritation and other health problems in cats and dogs.For safest results, only browse and compare products recommended by your vet.

, In dogs, tear stains can sometimes be caused by the excessive production of molecules called porphyrins. This may be correctable via antibiotics, but over-the-counter products are not safe on all dogs. Small dogs especially may be adversely affected by over-the-counter products sold to eliminate tear stains. If your dog is prone to excessive tear stains, talk to your vet about whether antibiotics could help. Do not choose a product without veterinary supervision.Keep in mind antibiotics have not been strongly linked to reducing tear stains in dogs, but some people have had success with products known as doxycycline, metronidazole and enrofloxacin.
If your vet suggests one of these products, use it only as your vet instructs. With luck, it will clear up tear stains on your dog. However, you may have to resort to other methods if antibiotics are not successful.

, If the stains are very bad and crusty, you can see if you can have them removed at the vet's office. Your vet may have technical staff on their team who are able to remove tear stains. You can also take your dog or cat to a groomer to ask about removing tear stains.

Follow your veterinarian's treatment recommendations, if you can.",How to Diagnose Ingrown Eyelids in Dogs," The signs of an ingrown eyelid are usually linked to eye irritation. Thus, dogs with ingrown eyelids tend to have a permanently watery eye on the affected side. This is the eye's way of trying to get rid of an irritant.


The moisture from the eye is never successful at getting rid of the irritation, so the watering continues indefinitely.;
, A dog with an ingrown eyelid may squint and hold the eye partially closed. Having the eyelid closed may give the dog a bit of relief from the irritation associated with an ingrown eyelid.


However, dogs with this condition do not always squint, as they may have lived their whole life with an uncomfortable eye and are acclimated to the discomfort.

, This is another sign that your dog's eyes are irritated. Your dog's eyes may become red due to an ingrown eyelid because the surface of the eye may be constantly rubbed by the eyelashes from the under-turned eyelid.


This constant rubbing can even lead to corneal ulcers, which is when the clear surface of the eye is worn away and eroded permanently.

, Your dog may feel irritation on its eyes and rub or scratch them to relieve that discomfort. Some dogs will blink more regularly than you might expect, rub at the eye with a paw, or even push the face along the ground. These are all signs that there is an issue in your dog's eye.

, Some dog breeds are prone to having excessive amounts of skin on their faces and they also tend to have too much skin in the eyelid. This extra skin is on the outer surface and has a tendency to cause the eyelid to 'scroll' inward toward the eye.


Think breeds with wrinkly faces, such as bulldogs, basset hounds, shar pei, pugs, Japanese chins, Pekinese, and bloodhounds., There are some breeds that seem to be over represented when it comes to entropion. This may be because the condition is genetic and these breeds tend to be bred only with like breeds, to keep the breed pure. These include (but are not limited to):Cocker and Clumber spaniels
Dalmatians
Rottweilers
Akitas
American Staffordshire bull terriers
Poodles
Great Danes
Pyrenean Mountain dogs
Bernese mountain dogs
Golden Retrievers
Labradors

, If you see any of the signs of an ingrown eyelid you should have your dog checked out by a vet. He or she will be able to assess and treat your dog's condition. Assessment is done by observation, both by looking at the dog with the naked eye, and by using the magnification of an ophthalmoscope to look closely at the leading edge of the eyelid.Some vets will double check their observations by putting a few drops of local anesthetic into the eye. This is because general eye pain can sometimes cause the dog to squint and, in some cases, cause the eyelids to appear as if they are ingrown. However, if the pain is removed and the eyelid still lies in an abnormal position, then it is confirmed that the entropion is due to extra skin, rather than muscular contraction due to pain.

, This will help you to know exactly what is going on with your dog. For example, when the vet is looking with the naked eye, the vet may press gently with a thumb just below the eyelid in order to 'take up the slack' of any spare skin. It can then be possible to watch the eyelid unfurl into a more normal position. This will help you to understand the condition better.

, Treatment for an ingrown eyelid is a surgical procedure where a sliver of skin is removed from just below the eyelid. This rectifies the excess skin and allows the eyelid to sit in its intended position. This procedure is called a blepharoplasty.Surgery for your pet can be expensive. If you don't have the financial resources to pay for surgery for your pet, discuss other options with your veterinarian. This may include giving your dog treatment for pain and discomfort.
Some pet insurances can help with the cost of surgery. The insurance needs to have been purchased before your pet has a major health problem, but if you already have it in place it can offset the cost of surgery.

The theory is that the dog forms an understanding that his companion is dead and therefore copes better with the loss; however, there is no scientific proof one way or the other that this is the case, so do what you feel is best for you and your pup.


It's difficult to pinpoint why some dogs do better than others and if viewing the body has anything to do with that. However, it's unlikely that seeing his old friend would do him any harm, so, ultimately, the choice is up to you.
Often times, the grief or depression that a dog exhibits after the death of another dog stems from an evident change in ""pack order."" This can then lead to a lost sense of security or routine.;
, The survival instinct of dogs in the wild means that they don't take time out to grieve, and tend to keep going with the daily pattern of hunting and grooming. Keeping to your normal routine decreases the dog's feeling of stress – the last thing he needs after the loss of a companion is for his world to be turned upside down.


Thus, hard as it is when one of the dogs has gone, stick to your usual habits: feed him at the same time as usual, take him for walks, and visit places you normally go. This reassures the dog that life goes on, which in turn helps him to cope.

, It is human nature to want to comfort a pet after a loss; however, this may not be the best way to alleviate his grief. Take the example of a dog that stops eating. The owner's reaction is then to hand-feed the pet, and praise him when he accepts morsels from the hand. In effect the owner is rewarding the dog for eating from his hand, rather than from a bowl. Thus, when you want the dog to eat from the bowl he refuses, preferring the one-to-one attention of hand-feeding. This becomes a habit that is unhealthy for him and unsustainable for you.A much better option is to act normally around food and feeding time, thus reinforcing the impression that although the other dog has gone, all is still right with his world. Thus, put the food down as usual, and if the dog doesn't eat, after ten minutes throw the food away and don't offer anything else until the next mealtime. This sounds harsh, but in dog language it is enforcing a sense of routine and security, which is what he needs during this time.

, Dogs need to know their place in ""the pack"" in order to feel secure, and when a member of their pack passes away, it can leave the survivor feeling confused and anxious. The key to this period of adjustment, be it for the leader or subordinate, is keeping to a regular routine and spending time training or playing with the dog, continuing as normal.


If the deceased dog was the leader, the survivor may feel insecure since his understanding of who is in charge has changed. This can show itself as barking excessively at other dogs, either to assert his new found freedom, or more likely because he feels threatened and barks to warn other dogs off.
If the deceased was the subordinate dog, the surviving pack leader may experience a loss of purpose, in that his guidance and support is no longer needed. He may seem restless and aimless as he patrols around, without a pack member to follow his lead.

, Two dogs that live together are constantly interacting with each together in subtle ways. When one of the dogs dies, his companion may well feel under-stimulated and even bored. It helps the dog to adjust if you can fill the gap with mental stimulation such as games, extra walks, and even teaching him a new trick or two.


This excellent one-on-one interaction will divert his attention and strengthen the bond between you. It may even help alleviate your grief, too.

, The best time to get another dog is when you feel ready, rather than immediately so as to comfort another dog. Dogs are individuals and if the survivor had a strong bond to the deceased, it is unlikely you will replicate this purely by adding another dog into the household – think of it in terms of ""buying"" a new best friend – as nice as it sounds, it just doesn't work like that.


There is also a possibility of making the situation worse by stressing the survivor with a strange dog intruding on his territory. Only get another dog if you're confident the two of you are ready.

, If you feel strongly that a new dog is the answer, test it out by borrowing a friend's dog and letting them play together. See how your dog reacts and whether it helps or not. If he takes to the other dog, he may be ready. If he doesn't, it's best to wait.


If you're dead set on another dog and your current one doesn't take to your friend's, consider another of a different sex or size. Your dog may be likely to take to a dog that's less (or more) intimidating or one of another disposition.

, It is difficult to know for certain if dogs suffer depression, but they do exhibit body language consist with our concept of depression. These symptoms can be especially alarming when you're struggling with your own loss. Here's some of the behaviors they may exhibit in this turbulent time:


Refusing to eat
Refusing to engage in activities he once enjoyed
A change in sleeping patterns (either sleeping more than usual or being unable to settle)
A change in habits (for example, he no longer gets up to greet you upon your return home)

These behaviors are normal after the loss of a loved one. If they persist over a month or so, you may wish to talk to your vet to take further action.



, Grief is a natural process that needs to be worked through, and numbing those feelings with medication is not the way ahead unless the depression goes on for several weeks. If, however, you have done everything right and three or four weeks down the line your dog still seems depressed, then it is worth getting him assessed by a veterinarian. One option he or she may suggest is a dog appeasing pheromone.


This is marketed as Adaptil, and is available as a plug-in diffuser that infuses the pheromone into the air, or on a collar worn close to the dog's skin. Adaptil contains a synthetic analogue of the chemical messenger (pheromone) given off by a nursing doggy mom that makes her pups feel safe and content. The dog breathes the pheromone in and it activates feelings of safety and wellbeing. While this is not a quick fix, it can help to decrease anxiety levels in a stressed dog, which can help him turn a new corner and become more well-adjusted.

, Another option your vet may suggest is a prescription anti-depressant, usually reserved for when all else fails and the symptoms have lasted over a month. The anti-depressant medication that is licensed for use in dogs is called clomipramine, which is a tricyclic antidepressant. This works by blocking the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters (serotonin and norepinephrine) in the brain, which has an anti-anxiety effect.The dose is 1-2mg/kg twice a day by mouth. Thus a 30kg Labrador requires half an 80mg tablet, twice a day.
This drug does have side effects such as a dry mouth and constipation, and can increase the plasma levels of certain anti-epileptic drugs and so should be used with caution in these cases.

Switch your food bowls.,
Use bottled water.,
Have longhaired dogs trimmed regularly.,
Talk to your vet about high quality food.",How to Eliminate Tear Stains on Cats and Dogs2," Plastic food bowls can cause eye irritation due to tiny cracks that build up bacteria. If you use plastic bowls, try switching them out for glass, stainless steel, or porcelain bowls. This small tweak may lead to less tear stains in your dog or cat., The high mineral content in some tap water can cause irritation in cats and dogs, leading to tear stains. If your pet is prone to tear stains, try switching from tap water to bottled water. This may make a difference in the appearance of tear stains.If you have a filtration system such as a Brita filter, try using that instead.

, Longhaired dogs are particularly prone to tear stains as their fur irritates their eyes. Long hairs around the face can easily brush against the eyes, leading to tearing and irritation. Regular trimming can help combat this problem, so make regular appointments with your groomer.Unless you have specialized training in pet grooming, it is not advisable to attempt to trim your dog's face yourself. When trimming near a dog's eyes, it's very easy to accidentally clip into your dog's face or eyes. Always consult a professional.

, While there is no clear link, a high quality diet can prevent health problems overall. If other means have not helped with tear stains, have a talk with your pet about your animal's current diet. They may recommend switching food types (i.e., switching from wet food to dry food) or trying a more nutritious brand of cat or dog food.Switches in food type should usually be made gradually to avoid stomach irritation. Talk to a vet about how to slowly introduce new foods to your pets to prevent indigestion.

Be very careful when cleaning near a pet's eye.,
Do not use unverified methods.",How to Eliminate Tear Stains on Cats and Dogs3," Tear stains are often benign and more of a cosmetic problem than anything. However, excessive tear stains can point to a number of underlying medical conditions. If tear stains seem to be excessive, make an appointment with your vet for an examination.In cats, eye conditions, tear duct blockages, allergies, and bacterial infections can all cause tear stains.
In dogs, eye infection, ingrown eye lashes, abnormally small tear ducts, and ear infections can all cause tear stains., Some tear stain removing products are not FDA approved and can potentially cause problems. This is why it's so important to talk over tear stain removers with a vet. Avoid the following, for instance:Angels’ Eyes
Angels’ Glow
Pets’ Spark
Groom
Health Glow

, It's a good idea to have someone restrain your pet while you clean near its eyes, especially when applying tear stain removers. These are made for external use only and you do not want to get the product in your pet's eyes. Go as slow as possible and keep the applicator far away from your pet's eyes.If you get product in your pet's eyes, call your vet or the number on the tear stain container for guidance.

, There are many tear stain removal methods on the market that are unverified. People often anecdotally claim household products, like herbal products or makeup remover, work on tear stains. There are often herbal and natural supplements sold that allegedly help with tear stains. However, these methods have not been proven effective and may actually be harmful."

Look for behavioral symptoms.,
Inspect your dog's eyes.,
Take your dog to your veterinarian.,
Be proactive about treatment.,
Give your dog glaucoma medication.,
Try alternative treatments.,
Consider surgery.,
Understand that glaucoma will eventually cause your dog to go blind.Treatments and surgery will only extend the length of time your dog can see.",How to Treat Canine Glaucoma," Glaucoma is a painful condition, but most owners won’t be aware that their dog is in pain. The discomfort caused by glaucoma will make your dog's behavior abnormal. The main behavioral symptoms an owner may see in a dog with glaucoma include:Rubbing or scratching at the eye
Decreased vision or loss of vision
Lack of appetite
Lethargy
Headache or pressing head into floor or wall;
, If your dog is showing the behavioral symptoms of glaucoma, you should take a closer look at its actual eyes. Get close to your dog's eyes and make sure you have enough light so that you can see the eyeball. If the dog has glaucoma, the front center of the eye will look foggy or milky, and have a bluish hue.Look for redness in the whites of the eyes and dilated pupils. These are the other visible physical symptoms of glaucoma.

, If you suspect that your dog has glaucoma, then you need to take it to the vet quickly. When a veterinarian examines a dog with glaucoma they will use an instrument that measures pressure in the eyeball, called a tonometer.With glaucoma, this pressure will be increased.A normal eye produces a liquid called aqueous humor to provide nutrition for the inner eye tissues. The eye keeps this fluid balanced and a normal pressure in the eye by providing outflow routes. In the traditional route the fluid passes out through the pupil to a sponge like mesh of tissue called the trabecular meshwork which eventually passes the fluid to veins. This is how 85% of the fluid leaves the eye in the dog.
In dogs with glaucoma the outflow of the aqueous humor becomes blocked. The eye will compensate for this blockage by decreasing the production of aqueous humor, but it does still need to produce it to provide nutrition to the eye tissues. Eventually the production will be too much for the outflow to allow the fluid out and damaging pressure starts in the eye.

, In order to sustain your dog's sight for as long as possible, treatment needs to be started quickly. There are two main approaches to controlling the fluid production in its eyes, and thus the glaucoma, include: medicine and surgery. Keep in mind that once an eye has glaucoma the disease is progressive and the other eye has a high probability of also developing glaucoma.
Each treatment plan will need to be tailored to each patient, so there isn’t a “one plan fits all” approach to glaucoma treatment.

, There are medications (eye drops and pills) that can be used to help control the symptoms of glaucoma. Generally these are fairly expensive, but necessary, drugs. These include:Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and brinzolamide, reduce the production of aqueous humor (eye fluid). These are typically eye drops, but an oral (pill) form is also available.
Prostaglandin Analogues, including latanoprost and travoprost, work by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye. These are given in eye drop form.
Beta blockers, like betaxolol and timolol, reduce blood flow to the eye and therefore reduce aqueous humor production. For a treatment of a dog, these are given as eyedrops.
Miotic agents, such as demecarium bromide, works by constricting the pupil and increasing aqueous humor outflow. This drug is given in eye drop form.
Hyperosmotic agents, like mannitol, “dehydrate” the blood supplying the eye and therefore decrease aqueous humor production. These are reserved for emergency purposes, as the dehydration can be dangerous. It is given via the intravenous (IV) route, so is only administered by a veterinarian in clinics or hospital settings.

, There are additional ways that you can help your dog's eye health. These include reducing your dog's stress level and keeping pressure off its eyes, as well as improving its diet.Feed your dog more antioxidants, such as those found in Ocu-Glo.
Use a harness instead of a collar to keep pressure off of the eye if the dog decides to pull.
Reduce your dog's stress by keeping the home quiet and treating any underlying anxiety issues it may have with appropriate behavioral therapy and/or medications.

, There are a very few veterinary surgeons who can perform a delicate operation to destroy the cells that produce the fluid in the eye. This procedure is called endolaser cyclophotocoagulation.Surgery to remove the damaged and non-visual eye is called an enucleation.

, They will not, however, eliminate the problem forever.


When discussing treatment options with your veterinarian, you will need to weight the potential benefits against the cost and the impact on your dog.

Watch for your dog rubbing his eye.,
Watch for red or cloudy eyes.,
Monitor for discharge.,
Look for eye sensitivity.",How to Treat Canine Corneal Ulcers1," Since corneal ulcers are painful, the dog’s eye will bother him because it hurts. This means your dog may rub his eye. Your dog might also squint with the affected eye and hold it partially closed. The discomfort and pain from the ulcer may also cause your dog’s eye to water.


Your dog might do this by rubbing the affected side of the face along the ground or rubbing at the eye with a paw.To figure out if your dog is squinting, look at the dog’s face. If one eye looks smaller than the other, then the dog may be squinting.;
, If your dog has a corneal ulcer, the white part of the eye may be red or have a pinkish color. The surface of the cornea is usually clear, but if your dog has an ulcer it may have a cloudy or milky appearance. This might look like a film over the eye., If your dog has a corneal ulcer, he may also have a discharge from the eye. The discharge may be bloody or even pus-filled.This discharge may gather in the corner of the eye, nearest to his nose.


Sometimes the area beneath the affected eye may be wet or damp.

, Because of the pain and discomfort of the eye, your dog may have a new sensitivity to light. He may shy away from bright lights, or squint in bright areas.Your dog may also keep the affected eye closed.Your dog may also flinch if he goes from a darker inside to bright sunshine outside.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Treat the ulcer with medicine.,
Undergo additional treatment for any complications.",How to Treat Canine Corneal Ulcers2," To get a proper diagnosis for your dog, you need to take him to the vet. The vet will perform an examination of both eyes to determine which eye is the problem, what is wrong with it, and how inflamed or sore it may be. The vet will probably also examine the eyelids and eyelashes to look for rubbing on the surface of the cornea, such as an inturned eyelash.As well as treating the ulcer, it is important to correct any underlying health problems, such as dry eye or underactive thyroid glands, to prevent the problem recurring. Your vet may perform a full examination to determine if your dog has any other problems related to the ulcer.

, Your vet needs to inspect the eye and record the size, shape, and depth of the ulcer. If the ulcer is superficial and only affecting the epithelial layer, such as a minor scratch, then all that may be needed is a drop to keep the surface of the eye moist so that healing can take place.For ulcers affecting the stroma, an antibiotic drop is prescribed to prevent infection and keep the eye moist. However the antibiotic is only effective for a few hours at a time and so needs to be reapplied every four to six hours, or as advised by your veterinarian. #*Most ulcers heal within five to seven days, and slower healing than this can be indicative of a problem.
Sometimes the vet fits a special 'bandage' contact lens in the affected eye. This aids healing as it keeps moisture in and dust out, and can speed up the recovery time.

, One complication that prevents an ulcer healing is if a rim of damaged epithelia clings to the edge of the ulcer. The cornea heals by sending in new cells from the side, and epithelia tags act as a barrier through which the healing cells cannot pass. If the vet diagnoses this complication, he or she will use a cotton tip to gently rub the surface of the eye and abrade away the unwanted cells. This should then let healing continue.On some occasions, ulcers can be problematic to heal, especially those in Boxers where there is an underlying anatomical problem with the glue holding the layers together. In these cases, the vet may put drops of local anesthetic into the eye and then perform a minor procedure call a grid keratotomy. This involves making tiny partial thickness puncture holes with a hypodermic needle, through the layers of the cornea. This then provides a key for the healing cells to cling onto to allow healing to take place.
On rare occasions, the ulcer is so deep that Descemet's membrane is the last line of defence and it bulges outward. This is potentially very serious because if the membrane ruptures the eye will perforate. This requires a specialist procedure whereby a surgeon grafts a flap of cornea from another part of the eye to cover and repair the hole.

Learn what a corneal ulcer is.,
Identify the causes of a corneal ulcer.,
Identify which breeds are prone to corneal ulcers.",How to Treat Canine Corneal Ulcers3," The transparent layer that is the cornea is made up of three layers. The top layer, which is exposed to the air, is the epithelial layer. Beneath this is the middle and thickest layer, which is called the stromal layer, and at the bottom is a tough lining membrane called Descemet's membrane.Corneal ulcers can be of any depth.


A superficial scratch or abrasion only affects the epithelial layer and often heals quickly. An ulcer is deeper and typically erodes down through the epithelia and into the stroma, which is the main structural layer. If the ulcer eats deeper still through the complete thickness of the stroma, then only the thin Descemet's membrane is left to stop the eye from perforating, which is potentially very serious.It is not possible to tell with the naked eye which layers of the eye are affected. It requires special stains and magnification, and therefore if you suspect damage on the surface of your dog's eye, a vet trip is essential.

, The most common cause of a corneal ulcer is trauma, such as a scratch to the surface of the eye or grit that got in and rubbed around. Anything that impacts the health of the eye can weaken its ability to respond to injury and predispose to ulcers. This includes conditions such as Cushing's disease, underactive thyroid glands, and diabetes.


Some dogs suffer from a condition called dry eye where they are unable to produce adequate tear fluid to moisturize the cornea, which leads to it drying out and ulcer formation.Some breeds, such as the Boxer, suffer from a lack of cohesiveness between the cells of the cornea, which leads to them flaking away and ulcer formation.

, Some breeds are more prone to corneal ulcers than other dogs. Breeds with large bulbous eyes, such as Pekingese, pugs, and other squash-faced breeds, are inclined to develop ulcers since their eyes provide a large surface area of cornea exposed to the air.


These dogs also get in-turned eyelashes due to the shape of their eyes. This can scour the surface each time the animal blinks, leading to ulcer formation.

, During times of loss, whether of a person or a dog, it’s a good to ask the people close to you for support. Ask your family and friends to help you handle your grief and work through the grieving process and consider reaching out to others who have been through the same thing.Ask someone to come be with you. You don’t have to do or say anything when they’re there. For example, you might say, “Mom, could you come over for a little while? I miss Daisy and just need someone to be here.”
Keep in mind that people may make unsolicited comments. It is okay to let them know that you are not looking for advice, and that you just need someone to listen and distract you from your grief.

, Spending time with other people who have experienced the loss of a dog can help you cope with your dog’s death in several ways. It can help you feel connected, provide you with strategies for handling your feelings, and offer you encouragement. Consider joining a support group in your area or an online group or forum.

However, if you begin to feel suicidal, lose a noticeable amount of weight, or have trouble going about your day, then you should talk to a medical or psychiatric professional for help."

, Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you’ll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog’s condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.

, You’ll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes.Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he’s already in discomfort.

, When you sign in for the appointment, you’ll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.

, If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain., Once you’ve been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.

, Your vet will ensure you’re ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths.Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing.The veterinarian’s office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.

, Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you’re going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.

, After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog’s remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not.In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.

You can also say a few words, play a song, or recall a memory that reminds you of your dog. Do what feels appropriate and meaningful to you.
You can hold this ceremony each year on the dog’s birthday, adoption anniversary, or anniversary of their death.

, It’s likely that there are a lot of large and small things about your dog that you’ll want to remember. It may be difficult for you to do now, but taking the time to gather and store some of your dog’s favorite objects and things that remind you of your dog can help you cope with your loss. Although you may not want to keep everything, save a few items to help preserve your memory of your dog.If it is too upsetting for you to do this right now, then you could also ask a friend or family member to do it for you. They can dispose of these things for you in the way that you specify, or you can simply ask them to hold onto these things until you are ready to deal with them yourself.

, An album, photo collage, or scrapbook of items related to your dog is one way you can preserve their memory. Include pictures, vet reports, adoption papers, training certificates, and other things that help you remember your dog.


Use the time you spend collecting items for the project to reflect on the memories you have with your dog.
Consider making an online scrapbook, webpage, or blog about your dog as an alternative or supplement to a hard copy.

, This is an excellent way to preserve some of your dog’s items that won’t fit in a scrapbook. You might include favorite toys, photos you have of the two of you, their collar, and other things that give you fond memories of them. You can look through the box any time you want to remember your dog.


Decorate the box with dog-themed pictures, stickers, or other art that makes you think of your dog.
If you have an annual ceremony to remember your dog, you can use some of the items from the memory box at the ceremony.

, Although you may not want or need to go out and adopt a new dog, doing things to help other dogs is one way to cope with your grief and remember your own dog.Consider making a donation to an animal rescue or rights organization in your dog’s name. Or, you may want to volunteer at an animal shelter or clinic in your area.

, In some cases, your dog might have been a significant part of other people’s lives as well. Give these people the time, space, and respect the need to grieve and memorialize your dog as well.For example, respect it if your partner doesn’t want to throw away the old shoe that your dog used to chew up. It may have sentimental value for your partner.
Or, for instance, allow your children to remember your dog in their way, even if it doesn’t make sense to you.

Contact your veterinarian.,
Storing the body short term.,
Consider cremation.,
Think about burial as an option.If you have private land or if there is a pet cemetery in your area, you may want to consider burial as a way to handle the remains.Burying your dog gives you the chance to visit them and makes it possible for other people to mourn your dog in the future as well.",How to Cope With the Death of a Dog3," Depending on the situation, your vet may already be aware that there is a problem and may have already given you instruction for handling the remains. If you haven’t contacted your vet, however, you should do so because they can help give you specific instructions on how to humanely take care of the remains.If you would like the body examined to determine cause of death, you should definitely contact your vet to determine the best way to store the body if it can’t be picked up or delivered immediately.

, You may need to store the body for a few hours or even a day as you work out how you will handle the remains. Take care to store the body in a way that keeps it cool and dry.If possible, store it in a plastic bag or sheet in a freezer.
If it can’t fit in a freezer, try to store it uncovered on concrete.
Choose a place where children and other people who might be easily upset won’t see the body.

, Many dog owners consider cremation when deciding what to do with the remains of their deceased pet.This option allows you to keep some of the remains in memorial or to scatter it in a favorite place your dog loved. It’s also a viable option for people that don’t have land for a private burial or don’t want to have a public burial. There are many cremation options ranging in price from $50 - $200.,

Contact a pet loss hotline.",How to Determine if Your Dog Has Passed Away," When a dog passes away, its heart will stop beating. To check for a pulse, place two fingers either on your dog’s chest where its heart is located (near the elbow joint), or high up on your dog’s inner thigh where a major artery is located.If there is no pulse, then your dog has passed away.
If your vet euthanizes your dog, they will check for a pulse after administering an overdose of a drug that gradually slows the heart until it stops.;
, Breathing may continue even after a dog’s heart has stopped. To check for breathing, hold a small mirror near your dog’s nostrils. If your dog is still breathing, a small amount of condensation will form on the mirror. You can also hold a tissue in front of the nose or mouth and see if it moves.After at least several seconds, if you do not see condensation on the mirror or the piece of tissue doesn’t move, that means your dog is not breathing. If you know its heart has also stopped beating, you will know at this point that your dog has passed away.
As your dog is taking its last breath, it may stretch its head back and stretch out its legs., When your dog has passed away, its eyes will be open.The eyes will have a vacant look, as if your dog is staring into space.

, Your dog’s body has electrical activity that helps coordinate muscle movement. Even after your dog’s breathing and heartbeat have stopped, its leg muscles may twitch for a little while. This does not mean your dog is alive. Instead, it means there is still some electrical activity in the muscles.Eventually, all the electrical activity will run out and your dog’s muscles will stop twitching.

, If your dog has died at home, call your vet for guidance on what to do next. You will probably be very emotional after knowing your dog has passed away, and it will be hard to think clearly. Your vet can help you organize your thoughts and emotions enough to decide what to do next.


If your vet has euthanized your dog, they can talk to you at the vet’s office about making final arrangements for your dog’s body.

, Whether your dog has died at home or was euthanized at your vet’s office, you can decide to bury your dog or have your pet cremated.Professional services are available for both options. If you’d like, ask your vet for recommendations on pet burial and cremation services.


Be aware that home pet burials may not be allowed in your city because of public health concerns. Check your city’s laws on home pet burials before deciding on this option.If home burial is not an option, you can bury your dog at a pet cemetery.
Cremation is a way to keep your dog’s remains without creating a public health risk by burying your dog in your yard.If you do not want cremation or burial services, you could also have a professional animal removal service remove your dog’s body from your home., It is perfectly normal to grieve the loss of a pet. Through your grief, though, you can think about your dog in a way that makes you smile and feel better. You can remember your dog in several ways:Remember the good times you had with your dog (play time, leisurely walks, quiet quality time).
Create a memorial of your dog. Examples of memorials include scrapbooks, planting a tree, or planting some flowers.
Make a donation in memory of your dog. Ask your vet or visit http://www.avmf.org/ for more information about making a donation.

, If your grief becomes too much for you to handle on your own, contact a pet loss hotline.

Loss of mobility and excessive weight loss are signs that your dog's body is shutting down. As your dog loses weight and loses the ability to move, its quality of life also suffers.Discuss the reasons for weight loss with your veterinarian. If there is a treatment that can reverse the weight loss and improve the dog's quality of life, then it is a good idea to try it. However, if the weight loss is due to a condition that cannot be treated, then this may point you towards euthanasia.
Mobility issues in dogs can be caused by a wide variety of issues. If you know what is causing the issues then you should try to treat them. If you have tried to improve your dog's mobility to no avail, then euthanasia may be the compassionate route to take.;
, If your dog is suffering and is no longer doing any of the activities that it loves, then it may be time to consider euthanasia. This unhappiness may be due to acute issues or pain, or simply an aging body that no longer allows the dog to move in ways it used to. Take the dog's happiness in to consideration when determining whether you should euthanize.If you are having a hard time assessing whether your dog is happy or not, try making a list of the things it has loved to do over the course of its life. If it is no longer able to do any of these things, then it may be time to consider euthanasia.

, If your dog is no longer eating or drinking it likely means that its body systems are shutting down. You can supplement the food and water with i.v.'s or injections, for example, but not eating and drinking in many cases is a sign that your dog's overall system is shutting down.Clearly, you should be discussing your dog's inability to eat or drink with its veterinarian. If the dog can have reasonable treatment that will help it to eat and drink again then you should try that. If not, it may be time to put you dog to sleep.

, Dogs that are very ill often have trouble caring for themselves in the most basic ways. This includes controlling their bodily functions. In otherwise healthy dogs, this is not necessarily a reason to put your dog down. However, if this lack of control is in combination with other symptoms of declining health, then choosing euthanasia may be your best choice.An accident in the house once in awhile is not the issue. Instead, if your dog no longer even tries to get outside to go to the bathroom or looks caught off guard when going to the bathroom, then it no longer has control of its bodily functions.
If your dog no longer has bladder or bowel control that is a sign that its body functions are shutting down.

, If your dog is in pain and is suffering it is the compassionate thing to do to eliminate that pain. In the best cases, this can be done with medication and veterinary care. However, if all methods of veterinary care afforded to you have been utilized and your dog is still in pain, then euthanasia is the best recourse.Assessing whether your dog is in pain can be difficult. Is it trembling or shaking a lot? Does it react poorly to your touch? Does it whimper or whine? Does it seem uncomfortable or agitated?These can all be signs that your dog is in pain.
If a dog is constantly on pain medications that limit its ability to enjoy its life, then this may also be a good sign that you should consider euthanasia. It may be more humane to eliminate the dog's suffering than to keep it in drug-induced limbo.

, Making the decision to euthanize your dog is difficult enough when the dog is terminally ill but it can be even more difficult if you are considering euthanasia due to behavioral issues. If you are considering putting down a dog due to aggression or other behavioral issues you should do some specific steps to give your dog every chance at life before making the decision. If you do these things and you still come to the realization that you need to put the dog down, then at least you will know that you have done everything you could.A certified dog behaviorist can help you determine whether your dog's issues can be trained out of it. They can recommend treatment or training to help.
Make sure there are no medical causes for the behavior. If your dog is acting out it could be due to illness. Have it assessed by a veterinarian to rule out a medical condition that could be cured.
Get professional dog training. Seek out a professional that is experienced dealing with dogs that have the behavioral problems that your dog has.
Try to rehome the dog. If you find that you cannot deal with the dog's behavior you should try to find it a new home with an experienced dog owner who is willing to work with its specific behavioral issues.

, Veterinarians are taught to consider the quality of life of their patients when considering euthanasia. This means that they should present to you all treatment options that they think could help your pet before suggesting euthanasia.Ask your veterinarian any questions you have, such as what the process will entail and what makes them sure that euthanasia is the right choice.
If the veterinarian does not believe that there is a reasonable treatment that could help the pet then they will suggest euthanasia as a compassionate and caring option.
Ask questions such as ""Will I be allowed in the room with Rufus?"" ""Will he feel pain?"" ""How long will the process take?"" A good vet will take the time to explain the process to you.

, Take time to consider your options. Deciding to euthanize your dog is a very difficult decision that requires some contemplation. Think about your dog, whether they are in pain, and whether they have any quality of life left. Use these questions to think and debate your options.


In some cases you will not have very much time to debate your options. If your dog is in an emergency situation you may be required to make the decision quickly.

, Discuss the situation with those closest to you. Ask them if they have any experience with euthanasia and how they dealt with it. They can help console you and, in some cases, they can help you to make the hard decision to euthanize your dog.Small children in your family should be told that the pet will be gone soon. How you do this is up to you but it should take the children's feelings about the pet into consideration.
You can try saying, ""Sam hasn't been feeling well for a while. We don't want him to be in pain, so the vet is going to give him medicine that will ease his pain. Sam will die, but that is what is best for him."", After you have decided to euthanize your dog you should spend some quality time with it. Take it to its favorite places or do activities that it loves if you can. This is a time to make some wonderful memories with your pet before you have to say goodbye to it.Quality time with a pet that is ill could just mean quiet times together. Pet your dog softly and keep it nice and warm. Feed it food it loves and pamper it in any way that you can.

, Most people who are having to euthanize their dogs due to old age or chronic illness make an appointment to do it. This allows them to have some last quality time to spend with their pet before the procedure and for their families to give the pet a proper send off. This will also allow you to have more time to think about your choice and whether it is the best decision for your pet.In some cases, if your dog is brought in to a veterinary office with acute emergency symptoms, you will not be able to make the decision to euthanize and then come back to do it. In cases where your dog is in severe pain and distress and you have brought it in to a veterinary office for care, it may be best to euthanize the dog quickly to avoid extending its pain and suffering.

, While many veterinary procedures are paid for afterwards, in the case of euthanasia, it's best to get the business out of the way ahead of time so that you can focus on grieving afterwards. This includes deciding how your pets body will be dealt with after it is euthanized and paying for euthanasia and cremation, if chosen.Euthanasia is usually a reasonably priced procedure. If you cannot pay for the procedure, however, discuss your financial issues with the veterinary office and they may allow you to pay over time or they may refer you elsewhere for the procedure.

, In most cases, your veterinarian will ask you whether you would like to be with your pet while it is euthanized. This is a purely personal choice that depends on a lot of factors, such as whether you are emotionally sound enough to support your dog during the procedure.Before you make a decision, discuss how the procedure will proceed with the veterinarian. In most cases euthanasia is done with an injection of a barbiturate anesthetic that puts the animal to sleep peacefully and then stops its heart.
Occasionally, the vet will give an anxious or nervous dog an anti-anxiety medication to help soothe them.
If you do decide to be present, spend the time loving on your dog. Pet it and care for it as it goes through the transition of death.

Be sure to share this information with your vet.;
, You need to be sure that there is nothing causing your dog’s weight loss that needs medical attention. Your dog may have an illness or parasite that isn’t immediately obvious to you that your vet will be able to determine.


Illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease may manifest as weight lost,but require additional treatments and medications. Therefore, a pet with an undiagnosed condition will not improve with food alone. In fact, they will get much worse without proper treatment.

, Talk to your vet about using body conditioning scoring (BCS) to help objectively assess whether your pet is too thin, too heavy or just right. A sample chart can be seen here. If your dog seems underweight based on the BCS, you should talk to your vet about an approach to help your dog gain weight.


In general, your dog is at a healthy weight if you can see their waist, you can feel their ribs when petting their sides without actually seeing the outline of the ribs and their belly curves upward to meet their hips.If you can easily see most or all of the ribs, the backbone or hip bones, your dog is likely too thin.
Some breeds, like Greyhounds, and some hunting and herding dogs (Border Collies, Pointers) tend to be leaner than other breeds like Mastiffs and Labrador Retrievers.

, It is best to have your vet do a fecal test for intestinal parasites, but if you are unable to do that, you can diagnose and treat your dog for worms from home.


A dog that has an intestinal parasite infection may be underweight because the parasite is sapping the nutrition out of the dog’s food before the dog is able to process it.

, A dog’s weight is related to his overall health, and part of your dog’s health is getting adequate gentle exercise.


Make sure to consult your vet before embarking on a rigorous exercise plan. Some dogs suffer from arthritis, neurological difficulties or metabolic diseases that lead to muscle wasting which would require special treatment under the guidance of your veterinarian to improve your dog’s health without additional injury.
Gradually increasing controlled walks on leash is usually safe for most dogs and less likely to cause injury. Swimming is a great no impact exercise for dogs who don’t mind getting wet. Make sure the entry and exit from the water are set up to prevent injury getting in and out of the pool, lake, or river.

Figure out if there is a logical reason your dog is underweight.,
Assess the overall health of your dog.,
Get your dog checked by a veterinarian.",How to Fatten Up a Dog1," If you know why the dog is underweight, such as a bitch that has recently raised a litter of strong, greedy puppies, or a rescue dog has been mistreated, then fattening up the dog will be relatively straight forward.


Be sure to monitor the dog who is underweight, so that you can find any issues that might be easy to fix. For example, if you have several dogs, the answer can be as simple as the other dogs stealing your underweight dog's food.;
, All kinds of illnesses can interfere with the body's ability to process food and get the goodness out of it, leading to weight loss. If this is the case, the dog will almost certainly show some signs including decreased appetite, increased thirst, lack of energy, vomiting, diarrhea, or a change of body shape.


Conditions that can cause weight loss include lack of pancreatic enzymes, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.Again, if you notice any of these symptoms then a vet check is for the best.

, If you suspect your dog is ill, or if you notice unexplained weight loss, it's best to consult a vet. If your dog suddenly has a poor appetite for no reason, it's also best to consult a professional before the problem gets out of control. Once the vet gives the all clear, and you know you just have a fussy dog, then there are a variety of strategies that can help improve its appetite."

Talk to your vet.,
Assess your dog’s diet.,
Control your dog’s portions.,
Consider a diet dog food.,
Make sure your dog gets enough exercise.",How to Know if Your Senior Dog Should Go on a Diet1," Stand over your pet and look down. Your dog should have a taper at the waist behind the ribs. Look at your dog from the side. There should be an ""abdominal tuck"" behind the ribs, meaning your dog's belly should not be as low as the bottom of their ribs, but tuck up somewhat. Feel your dog's side — you should be able to easily feel your dog's ribs, but not see them. These are signs of a dog within a healthy weight range. An overweight dog will have no discernible waist, a pendulous abdomen, and noticeable fat at the hips and neck, and may be lethargic.You can use a simple guide to check your dog's body condition (emaciated, thin, normal, overweight, obese), such as the one here: http://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/Body%20condition%20score%20chart%20dogs.pdf
;
, A veterinarian will help you come up with a diet that is right for your pet. Rather than going it alone, schedule an appointment with your dog’s vet. Be sure to ask your vet what your dog’s optimal weight is. You should also ask for specifics about your dog’s diet, such as what dog food brands are a good choice and what types of snacks are appropriate.


Your vet can assess your dog's body condition and determine whether their weight is under ideal, ideal, or over ideal.

, Once your vet has verified your dog needs to slim down, you will need to make an assessment of exactly what your dog eats each day. Make a dietary journal for your dog and be sure to include meals, snacks, and treats. It is likely you will need to eliminate most snacks and treats and, in some cases, this is all you will need to do to help manage your dog’s weight., A key to weight loss and management is controlling the amount of food your dog consumes. Make sure you are giving your dog the correct serving size of food, which can be found on dog food labels or the dog food company’s website. If you are unsure, talk to your vet for further advice on portion control.You can also try reducing your dog’s portions by 10 – 15% for a period of six to eight weeks.
If you eyeball your dog's portions or just use a cup from your cupboard, try using an actual measuring cup to measure out the proper portion for your dog. You may be overfeeding your dog without realizing it.

, If controlling or reducing your dog’s portions doesn’t result in weight loss after six to eight weeks, consider feeding him a diet dog food. Talk to your vet about specific brands that are a good match for your senior dog’s age, weight, and breed.

, Your senior dog should be getting out on regular walks on most days of the week. You can also help your senior dog manage their weight with other types of exercise like swimming. Talk to your vet about an exercise schedule that is right for your dog."

Add an extra meal into your dog's daily diet.,
Assess the quality of your dog food.,
Supplement the dog’s food with appropriate human food.Adding some yummy, safe “human” food to your dog’s diet can help increase a dog’s enthusiasm for eating.,
Try a different kind of food.,
Add water to your dog’s dry food.",How to Get Dogs to Gain a Healthy Weight2," If you feed your dog once a day, add a second meal. If your dog is already fed morning and evening, add a meal during the middle of the day. Do not necessarily change the diet you are already feeding, simply add one more meal to the day to add calories. Keep in mind that by increasing your dog’s diet by a whole meal, you are also changing the bathroom habits of your dog, which may require altering your dog walking schedule.

, Dog food comes in a wide variety of quality. You should be sure that the food you are feeding your dog is providing an adequate number of calories and an appropriate balance of nutrition.


Checking the protein and fat content of the food you currently feed is easily done by checking the information provided on the side of the bag.
The calories per cup will not always be found on the package, so you may have to go to the manufacturer’s website or call the manufacturer to get that information.
You will also find an ingredient list on the side of the bag. Look for foods that begin the ingredient list with a protein, such as “beef” or “chicken” or “lamb” instead of a carbohydrate like corn or wheat.
You can check the quality of ingredients of your current dog food http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/ here.
Talk to your veterinarian regarding your pet’s nutritional needs including the recommended caloric intake per day for your dog. Additional information can be found at: http://vet.osu.edu/vmc/basic-calorie-calculator.

, Non-fat, no salt chicken broth, beef broth or vegetable broth is very tasty, especially if you warm it up before placing on top of the dog’s food. You can find non-fat no salt broths in the grocery store pretty inexpensively. A few tablespoons will add nice flavor to your dog’s food.


A few tablespoons of roasted chicken without the skin, boiled egg or plain sardines (or mackerel) will often help awaken the appetite of most dogs and are healthy sources of protein and calories.
Dogs can get sick if fed too much fat, so stick to protein and carbohydrates to add healthy calories to the diet.
Other foods to try are the water from canned tuna, non-fat cottage cheese, non-fat plain yogurt, or plain canned pumpkin.
Avoid human foods that can be dangerous to dogs’ health, such as chocolate, raisins, grapes, onions, garlic, and anything with mold on it., If your dog is not responding well to the food he is eating, try giving him a different (high quality) dry food, a high-quality canned (wet) food, or follow a respected homemade dog food diet. High quality pet foods generally list the first ingredient in their formulations as a protein, such as “beef” or “chicken.”


If you are home cooking the whole diet for a dog over a long period of time, it is extremely important that the diet is complete and balanced nutritionally. Using a reputable source from your veterinarian for your dog food recipes is recommended, and make sure that you don’t leave out any ingredients when you cook.
No one diet is “perfect” for every dog, so be sure to do some research with the help of your veterinarian before changing to a home-cooked only diet for your pet. A few resources to consider when starting your research are The Whole Pet Diet by Andi Brown and the Dr. Becker's Real Food for Healthy Dogs and Cats by Beth Taylor.

, If your dog is not enthusiastic about eating his dry food, try adding hot water to the dried food then letting it cool so that it's mushy. This often makes the food more appealing to dogs.

Check your dog's actual weight against the breed's ideal weight.,
Check the food packaging against your dog's ideal weight.,
Compare what you have been feeding your dog to what the recommended amount of food is.,
Decide how much to increase your dog's food allowance.,
Gradually increase the amount of food you feed your dog.",How to Fatten Up a Dog2," It easy to think that a pet is underweight, whereas the reality could be that he is just less heavy than an obese dog of the same breed that you happen to know. Maybe your dog is actually fine, but it's the other dog that is too fat!

, For dogs that are thin but full of energy and producing formed feces, the first step is to check they are getting enough calories per meal. A dog may lose weight because it uses up more calories than it is eating. This may be straightforward -- as when the dog isn't being fed enough food. If this is the case, then increasing his portion size should do the trick.


The simplest way to do this is compare your dog's ideal weight with the suggested feeding amount on the food packaging.
If your dog is a specific breed, there is lots of information online about what is that breed's ideal weight. Go with the weight you want the dog to be, rather than the weight it is at the moment. For example, if you own a male Labrador then an average sized dog should weigh up to 40kg.

, Measure out a typical portion of your dog's daily food allowance by weight. Make a note of the weight of the food and compare it to the recommended amount from the food packaging.


It's interesting to note that some of these recommendations are actually 25% above what the dog needs (they tend to be on the generous side, rather than the skimpy side).
If you are giving your Labrador 400g of kibble a day, and the packaging advises 500g a day, then your dog is being fed 20% less calories than the recommended and so it will lose weight. This is easily rectified by increasing the amount of his daily allowance.

, This can be a difficult decision because each food contains different amounts of calories and the size of dogs vary so much. As a rule of thumb, increase the food by no more than 10% of the original quantity.


So if you were feeding 400g a day, an extra 10% adds another 40g, which you would split into 2 meals of 20g each additional.
Feed this for 2 -3 days and check the dog doesn't have diarrhea, at which point you can add another 10% and so on.

, Suddenly feeding way more food is a recipe for disturbing the balance of the bowel and causing diarrhea. Much safer is to gradually increase the portion size and monitor the dog's toilet to make sure it is coping.


If the difference in ration is not large, then divide the extra between two meals. If the difference is large, then adding in an extra meal (rather than making the existing ones larger) will be more gentle on the bowel.If the dog gets diarrhea it is then losing precious nutrition and so your efforts are for nothing.

Do a rib check.,
Examine your dog’s profile.,
Look at your dog from above.",How to Determine if Your Dog Is Overweight1," By doing a simple rib check, you can determine if your dog is at a healthy weight. Place both of your thumbs on your dog’s backbone. Then, spread your hands across its ribcage as if you are holding it. You should be able to feel your dog’s ribs easily, without applying too much pressure. Your dog’s ribs should also be slightly visible.If your dog’s ribs are not visible and/or if you have to apply pressure to feel its ribs, then your dog might be overweight.;
, You also need to assess your dog’s profile. Have your dog stand up, and get on the same level as your dog. Look at your dog’s underside, particularly the abdomen, i.e., the section just above the hind legs. A healthy dog will have an abdomen that is tucked up behind its ribcage.An abdomen that sags is a common sign that your dog is overweight.

, The final test to visually determine if your dog is overweight is to look at your dog from above. From above, dogs at a healthy weight will have an hourglass figure where the dog’s abdomen is slimmer than the chest and the hips.When viewing from above, you should see a noticeable reduction in circumference from your dog’s chest to its hips.

Feed senior dogs with diabetes a lower-fat, higher-fiber diet.,
Feed senior dogs with arthritis dog food that contains glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate.",How to Know if Your Senior Dog Should Go on a Diet2," If your senior dog has a health condition such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease, it is important to consult a veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist to help you formulate a diet. A professional can make dietary recommendations specific to your individual dog.

, If your senior dog has heart disease, it is best to feed them a diet lower in calories and sodium. Restricting sodium is particularly important, as dogs with heart disease can lose the ability to excrete salt from the body., If your senior dog has diabetes, it is important that they eat a diet that is low in fat and high in fiber. The goal of this diet is that it will delay the absorption of food, which helps blood sugar rise at a slower rate. Talk to your vet about what type of food you should buy for your dog.A higher-fiber diet can also be beneficial for senior dogs who struggle with constipation.

, If your dog struggles with joint pain and/or arthritis, you should consider feeding them a dog food that contains these supplements. You can also give your dog a glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate supplement, but make sure it is formulated for dogs and not for humans.While supplements are useful, dogs with arthritis and/or joint pain will benefit the most from weight management.

Pick up the dog.,
Step onto a scale.,
Weigh yourself without the dog.,
Subtract your weight from the first measurement.,
Compare this to the ideal weight.",How to Check Your Dog's Weight1," If you can comfortably lift your dog, you can weigh it with a standard bathroom scale and some simple subtraction. Just pick your dog up in your arms and hold it tightly so that it can’t wiggle around and jump (or fall) to the ground.Hold your dog with both arms, close to the center of your body, as if you were picking your dog up to give it some affection.
This is not a good idea if you struggle with lifting heavy objects or have some health restrictions that prohibit you from lifting things.;
, Get on the scale and wait a few moments for the scale to register the weight. Look down, view the number, and record the weight it displays. This is the total weight of you plus your dog.Be careful to keep a tight grasp on your dog the entire time. You don’t want to accidentally drop your pup if it wiggles in your arms.

, Let your dog down off the scale and then step onto the scale by yourself. Record your weight while standing alone on the scale.


Give the dog a treat for cooperating to encourage him to stay still next time.

, Take the total weight (you plus your dog) and subtract your individual weight. The answer is your dog's weight.For example, if the total weight (you and your dog combined) is 215 pounds and your individual weight is 187 pounds, you’ll perform this equation: 215 minus 187. The answer is 28 pounds, the weight of your dog.

, Your veterinarian should be able tell you the “target weight” for your dog’s breed. If your dog is purebred, you can also compare your dog to breed standards published on the American or British Kennel Club websites.These standards will also give you the typical weight range for males and females of that breed. Keep in mind that these standards are the average for “show quality” dogs, and that unusually tall or short dogs may not fall into these weight ranges.
If your dog is a mix of two breeds with a similar ideal weight, aim for that general range. If your dog is a mix between several breeds, consider the ideal weights of the breeds that the dog looks most similar to in size and appearance.

Know the issues related to obesity.,
Look for underweight issues.,
Know the complications of weight problems.,
Determine your pet’s weight status.",How to Keep Your Dog or Cat at Its Correct Weight1," The first step in combating pet obesity is to make sure your pet is not suffering from a medical illness that either contributes to obesity or is a complication from being overweight. In dogs and rarely in cats, hypothyroidism, or low thyroid hormone levels, can cause a pet to gain weight. Hypothyroidism can also cause a dog’s hair to thin or fall out in patches. The dog may also become less playful and energetic.


Increased secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands or from an insulin secreting tumor can also cause obesity. But by far the most common cause of obesity is eating too much food without an increase in exercise to compensate.;
, Pets can become underweight for a variety of reasons, including problems with the intestines, stomach, pancreas, or liver. Hyperthyroidism in cats leads to over secretion of thyroid hormone, which can also cause your pet to be underweight. Being underweight can also be caused by intestinal parasites, especially in young animals, as well as infections or tumors.


Intestinal problems and internal parasites can also cause vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Hyperthyroidism can make a cat ravenous and have very loose stools. Infections and tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, loss of appetite and energy, or occasionally no specific symptoms., Diabetes is a severe consequence of obesity in pets just as with humans. An animal with diabetes can lose weight rapidly, urinate more frequency and in larger volumes, have an increase in thirst, and be more susceptible to infections, especially urinary tract infections.Extra body weight can also stress the bones and joints in the body, leading to arthritis. It can also harm internal organs leading to a decrease in lifespan for the overweight pet.
Being underweight can make a pet more susceptible to infectious illnesses. Young animals that are underweight due to parasites can have intestinal problems well into adulthood and after the parasites are destroyed., You will first want to determine if your pet is obese, underweight, or at her ideal weight. Your veterinarian is your best source to help you to determine this. The vet can also point you in the right direction for a suitable diet to help your pet gain or lose weight safely. If you want to try to figure it out at home, you can determine it based on a condition score. Because of the vast variety in dog breeds, and to a small extent cat breeds, there is a wide variation in what is normal taking account the pet’s age, frame size and breed. To find a body condition score for your dog and cat, you need to do a physical examination. The condition is rated on a scale from 1 through 5 as follows:



1. Emaciated: Ribs, spine, bony parts of the body are plainly visible. Little muscle mass. No body fat.

2. Thin: Ribs are easy to feel, bony parts of the body are visible. Abdomen (waist) is “tucked up” from the side and “sucked in” from the top view. Little body fat.

3. Ideal: Ribs are felt with a little body fat between the ribs. The abdomen is “tucked up” from the side. Good muscle mass.

4. Overweight: Ribs are felt with more fat covering. Abdomen tuck is present, but not as discernible.

5. Obese: Ribs are covered in a heavy layer of fat. Abdomen is rounded. Has fat around the neck, limbs, and tail.

Then, gently feel these bones. Look at the shape of the dog's body from above and from the side. Compare your findings to the information below:Dogs with a healthy weight have ribs that you can see and feel easily, but that don't seem to ""jut out"" sharply (this is a sign of being underweight). The vertebrae should be a series of gentle bumps. Viewed from above, the dog should have a slight ""hourglass"" shape (its waist should be thinner than its hips and shoulders). Viewed from the side, the dog should have an ""abdominal tuck"" (its chest should be closer to the floor than its stomach).

Overweight dogs have ribs that aren't easy to see or feel underneath a layer of fat. Fat deposits around the base of the tail and waist may also make it hard to see or feel some of the vertebrae. The dog will lack a noticeable ""waist"" when viewed from above and its stomach may hang as low (or lower) than its chest.;
, Just like humans have different body types, some dogs within the same breed will be naturally larger or smaller than others. However, there are certain ""general rules"" for the weights of different dog breeds that can help you judge whether or not your dog is obese. An excellent table of average dog weights by breed is available here.Note: This chart won't work perfectly for mixed-breed dogs or mutts. You may want to try comparing your dog's weight to that of a similar breed or use the physical test above.

, Just like humans, there are a few legitimate medical issues that can make a dog obese even if it lives a healthy lifestyle. Though these are more rare than ""normal"" obesity, they're worth considering. A veterinarian will be able to tell you whether your dog has one of these problems.


Obesity-causing problems can include thyroid disorders, Cushing's disease, and diabetes.Even if your dog doesn't have one of these problems, it's a good idea to take it to the vet if it's overweight anyway. Your vet will be able to offer expert advice to get your dog back in shape.

, Losing weight may not be easy, but it is easy to understand: your dog just needs to burn more calories every day than it eats and it will lose weight over time. The bigger this calorie gap, the faster it will lose weight. To figure out how much your dog should be eating, use a calorie calculator, like this one.See below for instructions:


You have two options for your dog's ideal weight — you can either enter the result from the chart linked to in the section above, or, if you want it to lose exactly 10 pounds, just enter 10 pounds less than its current weight.
Next, enter its activity level from the list of options.
Finally, enter the calories per serving of the dog food you're using. You can find this on its Nutrition Facts label.
The answer you get will be how much you should feed your dog per day, not per meal. Divide this number by two if you feed your dog twice daily to find how much to feed it per meal. Divide by three if you feed it three times daily, and so on.

, Making your dog lose weight is all about controlling the food it eats. Once you use the calculator above to determine how much it should be eating each day, stick to this nutritional plan. Use a measuring cup every time you feed your dog to make sure you give exactly the right amount of food.

, Some owners have a ""free feeding"" policy for their dog — in other words, the dog is given access to food whenever it wants it. Unfortunately, this will make weight loss almost impossible. A dog with unlimited access to food will be able to eat as soon as it feels the first twinges of hunger from its new diet, so it won't ever accumulate a calorie deficit and start losing weight.


In addition, free-fed dogs can get in the habit of eating out of boredom, even when they're not hungry (just like humans).Switching from free feeding to better feeding practices is easy. One vet source recommends determining how much food the dog needs in each meal (see above), then putting out exactly this amount at each mealtime. If the dog doesn't finish it within 15 minutes, take it away and don't offer any more food until the next meal.It will quickly learn to eat the meals it is given.

, If you're used to giving your dogs treats throughout the day, it can seem cruel to stop. It may feel like you're depriving your dog of a source of happiness. However, you're actually doing the opposite — by helping your dog lose weight, you're giving it a happier, healthier life in the long run. Here are just a few things you can use as rewards for good behavior instead of food:


Playtime
Exercise
Petting
Cuddling
If you do need to use treats, use very small portions. Most dogs are simply attracted to the tantalizing smell of the treat — they don't need to use them as a major source of calories.

, It's not all about how much your dog eats — it's also about what it's eating. The best dog foods provide plenty of protein, while offering lower-than-average carbohydrates and calories.These dog foods help a dog stay full for longer, making it easier for it to adjust to its diet. They also more closely mirror the dog's natural diet.


A good selection of well-reviewed dog foods are available here.If your new dog food has a different calorie content than your old food, don't forget to use the calorie calculator again to determine your dog's new portion sizes.
Dogs can have digestive distress if their entire diet is suddenly changed. To avoid this, try introducing the new food gradually. You can try offering frequent small meals or mixing it with the dog's old food at first, then transition to two or three meals per day of the new food., With a few exceptions, food that's meant for people to eat isn't usually good for your dog. These foods (particularly human snack foods) can be calorie-dense and lack the nutrients that dogs need to stay healthy.


In addition, because these foods weren't part of dogs' natural diets, they can produce unexpected digestive effects. In particular, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, avocado, some nuts, grapes and raisins, raw meat and eggs, dairy, onions, garlic, and chives can produce side effects that range from mild to severe., Though they are cute, loyal companions, dogs are also selfish. They won't feel an ounce of shame begging or harassing you for the ""bad"" foods they've become accustomed to.Ignore your dog's pleading and offer it only proper, nutritious dog food at approved meal times. If it doesn't eat this food, don't give it anything else. No healthy dog will starve itself — it will soon be eating the food you give it.

Consistency is important here. Be sure to educate the people you live with not to feed the dog improper foods. If they do, the dog will quickly learn who's ""soft"" and won't lose its bad habits. You'll also want to avoid leaving food in places where your dog can get it while it's adjusting to its new diet.

, Some dog breeds are happiest with an occasional short walk, while others need strenuous exercise daily. If you're not sure how much exercise your dog needs, try looking online, where this information is freely available. Here is a good site that offers exercise specifics on many breeds.


Keeping a dog from meeting its natural exercise needs isn't just unhealthy — it's unfair to the dog. A lack of exercise can leave the dog unhappy and hyperactive, leading to numerous behavior disorders. These include excessive barking, destructive chewing, abnormal sleep schedules, rough play, and more., If your dog isn't getting enough exercise, don't worry — there are many ways to get it the exercise it needs. Best of all, many of these can give you a workout as well. Good ideas for exercise include:



Good for nearly all breeds: Fetch, neighborhood walks, chase, tug-of-war, play-wrestling, laser pointer play, playtime with other dogs.

Good for breeds with high exercise needs: Running or jogging, hikes, prolonged soccer-style games, swimming (best for natural water dogs — do not allow dogs to swim unattended).

, Not all dogs will ""jump"" at the opportunity to start exercising. This may be especially true if your dog is already obese. If you find it tough to get your dog to start exercising (or to get it to keep exercising once it's out of the house), try these tricks:Circle around your dog a few time, talking in an encouraging voice, and then start moving in the direction you want it to go. This will often make dogs want to follow you.
Teach your dog the ""Let's go"" command. See here for more information.Give the dog a chance to rest, then, when it gets up on its own, offer it a small treat (or some affection if it's on a strict diet). Don't use the treat to make it get up in the first place — this will just reward its laziness.
If nothing you do seems to make your dog want to exercise, bring it to a vet to rule out health problems.

, Just like people, dogs can't exercise forever without a break. If your dog is overweight or obese, it may be able to only exercise a little bit before it gets tired. Don't exercise your dog past the point of exhaustion — this is unsafe. Give your dog ample opportunities to rest in the shade (especially if it's hot out) and give your dog plenty of water to avoid dehydration.


If your dog has any health conditions you are aware of, talk to a vet before starting its exercise program. Some issues, like many heart conditions, can get worse with exercise.

, If your schedule doesn't allow for your dog to get as much exercise as it needs, consider hiring a pet care service to fill in the gaps for you. Many areas have local agencies that, for a reasonable fee, can walk your dog, play with it, and more — perfect for someone with a demanding job.


One pet care agency with a wide reach is Fetch! Pet Care, which has services in most (but not all) U.S. states. You can try to find a location near you with the service locator available here.Not that Fetch! is a franchise business, so quality can vary from location to location.
You may also be able to find local small businesses willing to provide similar services. Be sure to look for reviews or testimonials on sites like Yelp! to ensure the business you've chosen is a reputable one.

, When a dog exercises, its body burns more energy in the form of calories than normal. This will help it lose weight, but burning too many calories without replacing them can be unhealthy. For this reason, if your dog suddenly starts a new, more intense exercise routine, use the calorie calculator in the section above to re-calculate its ideal food intake. There's a good chance you'll need to feed it slightly more than if it were dieting without the exercise.

For example, you would want to feed a 10 kilogram dog 50 to 70 grams of cooked liver.
Eggs are also high in B12. In addition they contain a lot of Vitamin A, Riboflavin, Folate, Vitamin B12, Iron, Selenium, and Fatty acids. Give your dog raw eggs, adding one egg three times a week to their dog food.
Remember to add these foods gradually, so that they do not upset your dog's stomach.

, High energy dog food means they have a high caloric content and can easily be absorbed and assimilated into the body. This will prevent thinning and emaciation, and will aid in giving your thin dog additional weight.


Good brands to try include Hill’s Science Diet High Energy ®, and Royal Canin Veterinary Diet High Energy.
You can also try transitioning your dog onto a puppy food. Puppy food contains more calories than regular food, because it is designed to serve the high energy needs of growing puppies. The down side is that puppy food tends to be rich, and may upset some dogs' stomachs.
Introduce it gradually, adding a spoonful to the existing food, and gradually building up the amount feed over 4 - 5 days. Monitor the dog's feces and if diarrhea develops then stop the new food.

, Imagine yourself eating the same dry food, or the same cereal or soup, day in and day out. You’d probably get bored of it. Dogs can experience a similar boredom with their food. Sometimes switching from dry to wet canned food, or vice versa, will do the trick and get your dog to start eating again.


However, be aware that tin food contains a lot less calories than dry food. For the same volume of food, wet food contains just a quarter of the amount of dry kibble, so a little dry kibble is worth a lot of wet food. This is because wet food is 60 - 80% water, so whilst it may be more appetizing, you run the risk of filling the dog's stomach with water and giving it inadequate calories.

, Feeding your dog homemade recipes can give variety to your dog’s diet, making it more interested in its food.


A sample recipe is from Founder's Veterinary Clinic of Brea, California. This sample recipe is for a 10-kilogram dog that you can divide into two for a 5-kilogram dog, or double the amount for a 20-kilogram dog. The dog food consists of 100 grams of cooked, skinless chicken; 1 cup of cooked brown rice; 1 cup of peas and carrots; 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil; and 1/4 teaspoon of a salt substitute. Cook all of these ingredients and mix them together.

Give your dog vitamin supplements.,
De-worm your dog with de-wormer medication.,
Give your dog energy supplements.",How to Fatten Up a Dog4," The B vitamins are mainly involved in enzyme systems that increase your dog’s appetite, and in energy metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. In short, they ease the conversion of energy sources like fats, proteins and carbohydrates into energy, providing your pet the energy needed for growth and maintenance. The excess energy brought about by the increase in appetite and consumption will then be converted to fats and will prevent muscle catabolism, or wasting.


The best B-complex vitamins include Pet-Tabs® and LC-Vit®. Be sure to follow the directions on the packaging.
For puppies, it is recommended that you use liquid multivitamins like LC-Vit® (3ml daily).
Another option is to bring your dog to a vet and have her given a shot of B-complex vitamins, if you do not have time to give it daily vitamin supplements. The regime is one injection, once a week for four weeks. If the dog's appetite has not improved at the end of this time, then further injections are unlikely to be beneficial.

, It is sensible to regularly deworm your dog because worms compete for food in the dog's bowel and cause poor body condition, silently sucking the nutrition out of your dog. Perversely, a dog with a heavy worm burden is likely to have a potbelly, but the bones of the ribs and hips lose fat cover and become stark.Choose a broad spectrum de-wormer that can cover all types of worms. Praziquantel (Canex®) is a good example of a broad spectrum de-wormer. Canex® for Medium Sized Dogs can be used at a dose of 1 tablet per 10 kilograms of body weight. Canex ® for Large Sized dogs can be used at a dose of 1 tablet per 20 kilograms of body weight. For smaller dogs, half a tablet of Canex® for Medium Sized dogs can be used.
If it’s the first time that you will de-worm your dog, you can do it three times with a two week interval. From the first time on, de-worming can be done every six months to one year.

, Dogs that are active, working, lactating, frequently travelling, or getting used to a new home tend to become thin and lose appetite. You can give these dogs energy supplements that are packed with easily absorbed carbohydrates and vitamins.


A good example of an energy supplement is Nutri-Plus Gel®. You can give your dog 1 to 2 teaspoons per 5 kg body weight or 10 centimeter (3.9 in) of gel per day (using the plastic gel applicator or doser provided).

Check your dog’s reluctance to exercise.,
Observe how your dog moves around.,
Pay attention to your dog’s breathing.",How to Determine if Your Dog Is Overweight2," Try to take your dog outside to play fetch, run around, for a walk, or take your dog to the dog park. If your dog is reluctant to get up, lags behind, or stops or lies down frequently on your outings, then your dog might be overweight.Additionally, sleeping a lot, lying around all day, or showing a general unwillingness to move, i.e., lethargy, are also signs that your dog is overweight.

, Dog’s that are overweight tend to have a waddling gait, for example, a rolling from side to side when moving. Also, dogs that are overweight have difficulty moving, or need someone’s help to move.Also observe the pace at which your dog moves and the duration of your dog’s moving. Moving slowly and/or not being able to walk or run for very long are symptoms of being overweight.

, Dogs that are overweight also have difficulty breathing. They might have respiratory distress, dyspnea, or need to make extra respiratory effort to breathe normally. An overweight dog might also have noisy breathing.For example, a harsh, rattling sound, i.e., stridor, wheezing, or crackling.

Know when to see a veterinarian.,
Be cautious about using tea tree oil.,
Try giving your dog antihistamines.,
Give your dog temporary relief.",How to Soothe a Dog's Itchy Ears1," If you've noticed your dog constantly scratching his ears, get him examined. The vet will use a tool (otoscope) to examine deep inside the ear canal and check if the eardrum (tympanum) is intact. The vet will also look for other causes of itchy ears. For example, the vet may swab your dog's ears to diagnose an infection.


If your dog is in so much pain that an examination is difficult, the vet may choose to sedate him and clean out the ear. This allows the vet to see the eardrum and helps topical treatments be absorbed by the skin.
Don't attempt giving topical ear treatments to your dog without seeing the vet first. If the eardrum is damaged, medication could cross into the middle or inner ear, causing permanent balance and hearing problems (possibly even deafness).;
, While some may recommend using this essential oil to calm inflamed or infected skin, know that it contains terpenes, which are toxic to dogs.Animals can tolerate tea tree oil that has been diluted to 0.1 to 1.0%, but most shampoos, disinfectants, and skin treatments sold by pet shops contain stronger amounts which could harm your dog. If you do use a tea tree oil product, make sure it's very diluted.


Watch for signs of terpene toxicity if you choose to use tea tree oil. Toxic signs include nausea, vomiting, and, commonly in both cats and dogs, paralysis. Serious cases of paralysis, seizures, and even death have also been associated with tea tree oil., If you're unsure what's causing your dog's itchy ears, you'll want to get him some relief until you can determine the problem. Contact your vet to confirm that the antihistamine is safe for your dog, especially if they are on other medication. Then you can give your dog 2 mg of a common antihistamine, like diphenhydramine, for every kilogram of body weight. Usually these are tablets given orally, three times a day.Antihistamines work by histamine release to prevent inflammation.


Note that even once you've started treatment, your dog will probably continue to scratch. Also, antihistamines are not widely effective in treating canine itchiness. You can try it to see if it brings your dog any relief, but know that only 10 to 15% of dogs benefit from them., The veterinarian may prescribe a short course of corticosteroids to provide temporary itch relief until a course of medication kicks in. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatories which are excellent at relieving itchiness. Or, ask your vet about using over-the-counter (OTC) creams that contain 0.5 to 1% hydrocortisone. Applying these creams to the skin of the ear flap and around the base of the ear could soothe inflamed skin.


Be aware that steroids should not be used with certain medications, like if your dog is taking NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) which are typically prescribed for arthritis. Taking the two drugs together can result in catastrophic gastric ulceration leading to hemorrhage and death."

Know if you have a senior dog.,
Understand that eating habits and dietary needs change as your dog ages.,
Determine if your dog is overweight.,
Find out if your dog has a health problem.",How to Know if Your Senior Dog Should Go on a Diet3," Whether or not your dog is a senior depends on their breed and body weight. Larger breeds tend to age faster than smaller breeds, and most dogs are considered senior when they are between the ages of five and 10 years old. Overweight dogs will often age quicker than dogs whose weight is within a normal range., As your dog gets older, you may need to adjust the type and amount of foods he eats. Limited mobility may cause an increase in weight, and an aging dog is more likely to encounter health problems than a younger dog.

, Dogs that are overweight are more likely to develop health problems. As such, it is likely you will need to put your overweight dog on a diet. Take your dog to a veterinarian to determine if they are overweight, as the vet is qualified to make such a determination., If your dog has a health problem such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease, they will need to go on a special diet. Make an appointment with your veterinarian for a check-up. The vet will be able to determine if your dog has a health condition that necessitates dietary intervention.Conditions that may lead to your dog being overweight include arthritis, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), Cushing's disease (overactive adrenal gland), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, pituitary gland diseases, and insulinoma (a tumor in the pancreas). Tell your vet about any new or unusual behavior in your dog (such as drinking and/or urinating more frequently, increased or decreased energy, change in appetite, etc.).
Blood tests, radiographs, and ultrasounds may be necessary to check your dog for an underlying condition.

Build a platform over your home scale.,
Take your dog to a bus station instead.,
Bring the dog to a veterinarian.,
Find your dog's ideal weight.",How to Check Your Dog's Weight2," If your dog is too heavy for you to pick up, you can still use a home scale with a little preparation. Place a large, stable container on the scale, or make your own platform from plywood, rigid foam, or plastic. Place this so the scale supports the entire platform, then cut out a window so you can read the display. Now you can still use a home scale to weigh your big dog. Follow these steps:Coax the dog onto the platform and have it sit down in a steady position. Record the weight displayed on the scale.
Move the dog off the platform. Record the weight of the platform alone.
Subtract the weight of the platform from the first measurement. This is the weight of your dog.

, If you don’t have a scale at home, or you can’t get your dog to use the platform method, try taking your dog to a bus station. Put on the leash and take your dog to a long-distance bus travel station – Greyhound is an appropriate choice. These stations have oversize scales to weigh luggage, though you may need to sweet talk the employee at the counter.Consider bringing a small coffee gift card or similar token of appreciation for the favor.

, Call up the receptionist or vet tech at your veterinarian and ask if you can use the scale at the office. If you find a nice employee, you might be able to pop in and use the scale without paying for an appointment.If your vet is a stickler for following the rules, you may need to just bite the bullet and schedule an appointment with your vet to find out your dog’s official weight.

, For best results, have a veterinarian examine your dog and recommend a goal weight. You can find weight recommendations for each breed online, but these are not always accurate for your dog, especially if he is a mixed breed.Talk to your vet about your dog’s weight and ask if they have any recommendations for diet and exercise.

Learn about your breed's body shape.,
Look for the rib cage.,
Feel the fat over the ribs.,
Look at your dog's figure.,
Use caution when judging by belly size.",How to Check Your Dog's Weight3," Hounds, setters, and other hunting dogs tend to be naturally thin. Other breeds look stocky even at a healthy weight, including Rottweilers, bull dogs, and Labradors.Some dogs are very tall, lanky, and skinny. Others are large and stocky. Most recommendations for monitoring a dog’s weight are based on dogs whose body types fall somewhere in between these extremes.
You'll be able to judge more accurately if you know your dog breed's normal body shape.

, As a rule of thumb, a dog at the correct weight should not have any ribs showing when it is standing straight, but some ribs will show when the dog is curled up. If you can see the ribs when it is standing straight, the dog may be underweight. If you can't see the ribs when the dog is curled up, the dog is likely overweight.This can be difficult to judge for shaggy dogs, or for some breeds with unusual body shapes, such as English bulldogs and whippets.

, When palpating the rib cage gently with your fingers, you should be able to feel the ribs under the skin, but only slightly. If you cannot feel your dog’s ribs, it is overweight. If you can feel the ribs easily and there's little fat over them, the dog is probably underweight.You should also be able to feel the top of the breastbone by pressing lightly.

, Stand right behind your dog while it is standing up, looking down at his back. The width of the dog should get narrower from the shoulders and rib cage, as you move down the dog's back. You should be able to see the waist easily, narrowing right before the hips.If you cannot see the waist, your dog is overweight.
If the hip bones stand out sharply, take the dog to a vet. This could be a sign of a health problem.

, In younger dogs (under seven years old for most breeds, under four for giant breeds), the abdomen should be “tucked” slightly higher than the rib cage when viewed from the side. The depth of this “tuck” depends on the dog’s breed, so again, consult breed standards and view lots of pictures before performing a visual evaluation. As dogs age, their abdominal muscles weaken just as humans’ do, giving them a “potbelly” that may mislead you about their weight.Generally, when the dog lies on her side, the stomach should be even with her rib cage.
The dog's belly will look larger after a meal.

Do weekly weigh ins.,
Walk or run your pets.,
Vary the activity.,
Change the way you feed your pet.,
Prevent overeating.,
Limit treats for dogs.",How to Keep Your Dog or Cat at Its Correct Weight2," Once you have determined your pet’s body condition score, you can help your dog or cat to lose, gain, or maintain her weight. As you work with your pet, you need to do weekly weigh ins to track your progress. Keeping track of your pets progress through weekly weigh-ins is a great way to keep you on track and moving toward your pet’s weight goal.


It might be hard to weigh your cat. Do the best you can with the scale you have.

, One of the best ways to help your pet lose weight is to help her get more exercise. Walk your pets daily. Most dogs exercise at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise daily. Smaller dogs need 10 to 30 minutes daily. It is complicated to walk a cat, but you want attempt to get her to walk around the yard or house with you or play running games with your cat for 10 to 30 minutes each day.


You can also train your dog on a treadmill if you don’t have a great place to walk her or if it is too cold or rainy outside to walk every day., Just walking it great, but as your pet gets stronger, you should vary the intensity and variety of exercise daily. What kind of exercise you choose will depend on the type and size of pet you have. Cats love toys like feathers on a string or laser pointers. Plus these give you good interaction with your cat. Obese dogs may need a more gradual start up in exercise, especially older dogs. Leash walks on cool mornings are an excellent starting points. Even if your dog can only walk a few blocks at first, that is a start.


Always ask your veterinarian how much exercise your dog or cat can tolerate., One of the main reasons that pets become obese is that they eat too much. Feed your pet the recommend amount of food daily as recommended by your veterinarian. If you feed your pet twice a day or more, split the recommended amount of food between the feedings. Use a measuring cup to actually measure out the exact amount of food.


Don’t feed your pet table scraps. Your dog or cat needs fewer calories than you expect. Feeding pets from the table or feeding leftovers can unbalance a pets' diet quickly. Most human food is typically too high in fats, salts, and sugars for pets.
Talk to your vet about cutting down on how much you feed your pet. Some vets suggest cutting the amount of food your pet gets every day by a third from where she starts. This will reduce her food intake and should help you lose weight., Your pet may be obese due to overeating. Some cats and dogs are simply gobblers and always want to eat. Try feeding your pet a few bites several times a day to get her into healthy eating habits. Once she stops begging between the frequent meals, slowly increase the amount of food at each meal and decrease the amount of meals. Eventually, your problem should be solved and you'll have a nibbler that doesn't overeat.

, If you feed your dog treats, be sure to include this as part of the diet daily calories. Feeding treats can be overdone. Feed low calorie healthy treats to your pet, either commercially prepared dog treats, carrots, apple slices, or green beans. Also try saving some of your dog's dry food and give it as treats. If your dog likes carrots, frozen peas, apples, or other vegetables, give these as low fat, high fiber treats.


Instead of handling a treat to your healthy dog, toss it a distance from you so the dog is encouraged to trot across the room or down the hall to get the treat. Add a phrase like ""go far"" as you toss the treat. Most dogs will soon learn to start the walk as you say the command and getting treats will become additional exercise.
You can also start rewarding your pet with play or a training session instead of a treat.
If you have a cat, limit the amount of treats you feed her as well. Alternate treats that are healthier can be lean chicken or tuna."

Make sure your dog gets mental stimulation.,
Monitor your dog's weight at least once a week.,
Evaluate whether your weigh-loss plan is extreme enough.,
Think about ways your dog might be getting additional calories.,
Consider medical issues may be a cause.",How to Help Your Dog Lose Weight," Because of the varying body types between dogs of the same breed, what your dog looks like is actually the ultimate test of whether it is overweight or not. Checking its profile from both the top and the side will give you a good idea of your dog's current condition.


When standing above your dog and looking directly down at their back you should see an obvious waist in front of the rear legs and a definite difference between the chest and the abdomen. When looking at your dog from the side, you should be able so see a difference between the size of the chest and abdomen. Your dog should have a waist that is easily noticeable and its abdomen should be closer to its spine than its chest. A broad, flat back and a sagging abdomen can indicate that a dog is overweight.;
, Put your hands on either side of your dog's chest and feel for their ribs. In a normal weight dog, you should not be able to see their ribs, but you should be able to easily feel and count each individual rib. If you can't do this easily, it is a sign that your dog is overweight., There are several good charts available on the internet that give an ideal weight range based on your dog's breed. Keep in mind that these ranges are based on averages and what's typical for each breed listed. Each dog should ultimately be evaluated as an individual.


Depending on its size you may be able to get an accurate weight at home. If you want to weigh your dog at home, first weigh yourself and then pick up your dog (if you can) and weigh you and your dog together. By subtracting your weight from the what you both weighed together you will get your dog's weight.Always use the same method for weighing to keep the results as accurate as possible.
A visit to your vet is a great time to easily get an accurate weight and also get their recommendations on a healthy weight for your dog.

, Once you've determined that your dog is overweight, or if you're still unsure, it's time for a visit to your vet. Your vet can evaluate your dog's weight, discuss possible causes, and give you an idea of how much weight your dog needs to lose or at least an initial goal.

, Your vet can also help you with a specific weight loss plan to get your dog to where they need to be. This may include changing to a dog food designed for weight loss, recommendations on what to feed as treats, adjusting the portion size and frequency of feedings, and increasing the amount of exercise.


Your vet can also evaluate if there are any health reasons for not starting such a plan. , There are now also drugs, specifically for dogs, that are available to aid in weight loss. These drugs basically work by causing a decrease in appetite. Be aware that these are known to cause a high rate of side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea.They should only be used as a last resort, in dogs that are otherwise healthy, and only after ruling out all medical issues that can be a cause for both your dog being overweight and their inability to lose weight.
Your veterinarian can determine if your dog is an acceptable candidate for this option.

, Your veterinarian can help you decide what to feed your dog. This can be simply reducing the amount of your dog's current food or changing it to a weight loss diet.


There are prescription diets available to help your dog lose weight along with diets to help them keep it off once they have reached their ideal weight. These diets are lower in calories and contain higher amounts of fiber to make your dog feel full while taking in fewer calories. These diets are typically more expensive than regular foods and are usually reserved for cases where extreme weight loss is needed or where simply reducing the amount of a regular food isn't working.
There is now a new category of weight loss diets available, which work by using ""genomics"" or using science to switch on genes concerned with burning calories. Hills Metabolic diet is the only variety currently on the market.

, This allows you to easily spot any changes in appetite, which can indicate other issues. This is even more important when trying to get your dog to lose weight. You need to know exactly what and how much your dog is eating in order to be able to gauge how effective your plan is and to make any needed adjustments.


If you have other dog's in the house you may need to keep your pups separated during feeding time. Make sure that each dog only gets its own food by placing them in separate rooms with their meals until all food it consumed.

, You can use a measuring cup, but weighing each day’s amount is a more accurate way to be sure you are feeding the right amount.


You can make a chart or download one from the Internet. Be sure to also include a weekly weight for your dog. Take it with you when you visit your vet to best evaluate your progress. , Most commercial treats for dogs are very high in calories, similar to the candy that people eat. While there are reduced calorie commercial treats, you can almost eliminate your dog's treat calories by replacing them with much healthier snacks.Examples of healthier snacks that are safe for dogs include carrots, green beans, broccoli, celery, and apples.As with any diet plan, these should be limited.
Always consider any known food allergies before giving your dog anything new to their diet and also be aware that some human foods can be toxic to dogs and should be avoided.
When feeding treats, don't forget to include them in the total amount of daily calories. You may need to decrease the amount of calories from other sources to compensate.
As a rule treats should make up no more than 10% of the total daily diet.
You can also put some of your dog's daily kibble allowance in a container and use this as a treat throughout the day.

, Exercise will improve your dog's muscle tone, metabolism, and weight. The sum of your dog's weight is simple math. The number of calories consumed in their diet minus the number of calories used during their day, will determine whether they will lose weight or not. By developing an exercise routine, you will improve your dog's metabolism and overall health.


This should be a major point of discussion with your vet before starting regular exercise. Some breeds are naturally unable to perform certain types and intensities of exercise. Also, depending on your dog's overall physical condition and the environment the exercise will take place in, you may need to be very careful about what you encourage your dog to do.
Typically, starting with short walks and then gradually increasing the distance and/or the speed of the walks, depending on what your dog can tolerate, is a simple way to implement an exercise routine. This can be combined with playing games like fetch or just being active with them and their toys for 20 minutes a day., You may be surprised to learn that mental stimulation can be just as important as physical exercise when trying to help your dog lose weight. Many dogs overeat either to get attention (they pester their owner for attention and the owner thinks they are hungry) or because they are bored.

Try grooming your dog or playing when they ask for attention instead of immediately feeding them.
In addition, use puzzle feeders instead of putting a bowl of food down. This makes the dog problem-solve to get their meal, which makes it more difficult to overeat. There are lots of commercial puzzle feeders available, but also consider simple strategies such as scattering the dog's kibble in the grass, or putting their food inside a cardboard box.

, Buy a canine scale, or use whatever weighing process you used before, and make a chart. Chart your dog's weight to see what progress has been made.


Your dog should also be weighed monthly by the vet until she or he is the ideal weight., If you're restricting your dog's caloric intake and making sure they are getting enough exercise, but still not getting the results that you expect, consult with your veterinarian again.There may be a need for further calorie restriction, and/or a need to increase the amount of exercise.


Your initial plan, while developed with you vet, may not be perfect for your pet's needs. Feel free to change it, with the help and advisement of your vet, if it's not working.

, There are several possible, non-medical reasons why your dog is unable to lose weight. These can include someone else in the household giving extra food or treats without you knowing about it or the dog getting into food supplies.

, There are some medical issues that can cause weight gain and also make it very difficult, to impossible, for your dog to lose weight. For example, Hypothyroidism prevents your dog from burning calories like they should while also decreasing their desire to be active. This is a double whammy when it comes to weight control.


Diabetes and Cushing's disease are also medical reasons that can prevent your dog from losing weight.

, If your dog has any symptoms of ear infection, you should take him to the vet as soon as you can. Ear infections are very painful. Some dogs will let you know they're hurting and may become more aggressive, while others don't show the pain.Either way, it's important to get treatment immediately, since untreated ear infections can damage the ears., Ear infections are often caused by yeast/fungus, bacteria, or both at the same time. Your veterinarian will probably have you apply a topical antibiotic or give an oral antibiotic to treat a bacterial infection. For a fungal infection, you will likely be instructed to use an anti-fungal ear wash, topical medication, and maybe give an oral anti-fungal medication., If you know or suspect that a foreign object is stuck in your pet's ear, this may be introducing and causing the ear infection. The ear infection will not go away until the object is removed. Never try to remove the object yourself.Instead, take your dog to the vet.


Because the ear canal is L shaped, foreign objects may be deep in the ear, out of plain sight. Specialized instruments and physical or chemical restraint are usually needed to safely remove a foreign body. This is why it's important to let your vet handle it.

, Allergies are often the primary source of inflammation in the ear, which makes the ears more susceptible to infections.While it may be difficult to determine an allergic cause, it helps to start paying attention to factors such as if new foods or treats were introduced before the ear infection flared up. If they contained a particular protein, you may want to avoid that giving your dog that protein.


Animal proteins and dairy products in food are more likely to cause allergies for pets than grains are, despite the popularity of the notion that grain free diets are better for dogs with food allergies., Specifically, put your dog on a diet trial with a novel, or new, protein, one your dog has never eaten before. New prescription diets should be fed exclusively for at least 8 weeks and ideally for a minimum of 12 weeks.Give no treats, table scraps or other food sources during this time.


This may help to determine if food proteins are the problem and home in on which are culprits. The best novel protein diets are prescription formulas because they will have the least likely chance of cross-contamination with other protein sources, but they are often the most expensive choice.

, At the end of the trial, if your dog is not showing signs of ear inflammation or skin allergies (most commonly itchy paws and sometimes itching of other areas of the body), then you can 'challenge' your dog's diet with a single type of treat or the old food. If you notice signs of irritation near the ears, feet, or skin when you re-introduce the old food or treat, then you know that this food or any food containing this protein should be eliminated.


If the ear infections tend to spring up at the same time of year every year, a seasonal environmental allergy may be causing the ear infections.

, While your dog has an ear infection, you should make sure he doesn't get excess moisture in his ears. Avoid letting your dog play in water, swim, bathe, or be groomed until the ear infection has cleared up. Extra moisture will aggravate the ear infection and make it last longer., Keep checking in with the veterinarian until the ear infection is completely gone. Some ear infections are mild and easily treated in 1-2 weeks with topical medications and cleaning. Some infections are more complicated and may take many weeks, further testing, treatments or procedures to treat.


Follow your veterinarian's recommendations about when to check in, since the vet can help you determine if the ear infection is cleared or if more needs to be done.

, Once your dog has had an ear infection, he's more likely to struggle with them throughout his life. The good news is that there are several things you can do to prevent ear infections in your dog. Here are several preventative measures:avoid letting your dog swim or bathe too frequently
plug your dog's ears with cotton before bathing him
flush your dog's ears with a product containing salicylic acid (which helps wet ear canals dry)
check and treat any allergies your dog may have
frequently clean your dog's ears

, Follow your veterinarian's instructions about how many times per day or week to clean your dog's ears. If your dog has an ear infection, have your vet check his ears to make sure the eardrum has not been damaged or ruptured. Cleaning ears that have a damaged eardrum can make them worse, not better. Cleaning the ears too often cause also harm the ears.Signs of a ruptured eardrum include pain, head tilting toward the affected side and sometimes even rapid jerky eye movements and/or dizziness.

, It is best to use a veterinarian recommended dog ear cleaning solution, but many over-the-counter ear flush options are available at your local pet store. These are often effective for routine ear cleaning but don't use them to clean infected ears if they contain alcohol or other harsh ingredients. These can be painful and irritating.


If your dog has an infection, your veterinarian may prescribe an ear flush specifically formulated to break up wax, break down bacterial cell walls, and treat yeast causing the infection.

, Have your dog sit with his back up against a wall or in a corner of a room. This will help you keep him still and prevent him from running away during the ear cleaning. Because ears can be very painful, and because you’re working with your pet's face, use a muzzle if you need to or if your pet may be likely to try to bite. It may also help to have a gentle grip over and around the muzzle to hold your pet's head still.


Remember that even the sweetest animals can and may bite when they are in pain. It may help to have an extra person around to help hold your dog in place and keep his head still.

, Pour some of the cleaner into your dog's ear canal according to the directions on the bottle. Massage his ear at the base for 20 to 30 seconds to help the cleaner move around and agitate any debris.

, Use a cotton ball to plug the ear, then repeat the massaging technique underneath the opening of the ear. This will push the cleaning fluid into the cotton ball to be soaked up. Debris should also stick to the underside of the cotton ball. Be sure to only push the cotton into the vertical canal, until it plugs the opening, but can be easily retrieved.The anatomy of your dog's ear is different from your ear. Dogs have an L-shaped ear canal, containing a vertical canal you can see into, with a nearly 90 degree turn into the horizontal portion of the canal (this is an area you cannot see).

, Remove the fluid soaked cotton ball and look at the bottom surface for wax or discharge. Use a cotton ball to wipe the dirt out of the visible, exterior parts of the ear. Gently wipe the inner ear flap and around the ear with a dry, soft towel to clean loose dirt and moisture.If there is a lot of debris on the cotton ball, then repeat the rinse, agitate, and absorb procedure again.

Compare the appearance of both ears.,
Feel the ear to see if it is hot.,
Look for signs of inflammation.,
Look for discharge coming from the ear.,
Take note if your dog has a strange, bad odor following him around.",How to Recognize an Ear Infection in a Dog1," In the early stages of an infection the swelling may not be obvious because it comes after the redness develops. One way to check for swelling is to compare the size of the entrance to the ear canal on both sides. The ear canal is the dark hole, down which you put ear drops. They should be of an identical size on both sides.If one ear canal is smaller than the other, the commonest reason is that the skin is swollen and taking up space, which narrows the canal.;
, Ear infections generate heat and inflammation. Lift the ear flap and examine the skin around the ear canal. Place your fingertips as close to the ear canal as possible, and then compare the sensations you feel with the other ear.


If the skin around the ear feels hotter, this can be a sign of inflammation and infection. Inflammation is often accompanied by skin changes such as swelling or reddening.

, The skin's response to infection is to become inflamed. The signs of inflammation are redness and swelling. The skin around the ear canal should look identical on both ears.


If one ear is redder than the other then be suspicious of inflammation and infection.

, Dog ears produce wax, just as our own ears do. This normal waxy discharge is usually scant, and of a translucent, greasy nature, rather than thick yellow-orange wax like in humans.


If there is a yellow-green purulent discharge from the ear, or thick browny-black wax, you should bring your dog to the vet. Both of these discharges are abnormal and indicative of infection. In particular, if pus is present, it is usually accompanied by an unpleasant smell.

, Use your nose to sniff around and figure out where the smell is coming from. In particular, lift your dog’s ear flap and see if the smell gets worse.


If you lift the ear and the smell gets worse, compare the smelly ear to the other one. If both ears smell the same (whether this be good or bad), your dog might not have an ear infection. If, however, one ear smells far worse than the other ear, there is a good chance that the smelly ear is infected.

Weigh your dog at home.,
Know the ideal weight for your dog’s breed.,
Consult your vet.",How to Determine if Your Dog Is Overweight3," You can also determine if your dog is overweight by weighing your dog at home. First, weigh yourself. Then, if you have a small or medium sized dog, step on the scale while you are holding your dog to get a total weight. Lastly, subtract your weight from the total to get your dog’s weight.If you own a large dog that you cannot pick up, then take your dog to the vet or a pet grooming store. These places have scales that are big enough to weigh your large dog., Once you know your dog’s weight, know the ideal weight for your dog’s breed. Visit http://www.vcahospitals.com/main/dog-care/dog-breeds to find out the weight limits for your dog. If your dog is over the upper weight limit, then your dog might be overweight.


However, be aware that even if your dog is heavier than the upper weight limit for its breed, it is not a guarantee that your dog is overweight. Therefore, use the chart as a guide only, and consult your vet.

, Once you have determined that your dog might be overweight, schedule an appointment with your vet. Your vet will be able to determine if your dog is overweight, or if your dog is just bigger than normal for its breed. If your vet determines that your dog is overweight, they will prescribe an adequate weight loss regimen.A treatment plan will most likely involve evaluating what your pet is eating, for example, treats, human food, portion size, and frequency, and making the necessary changes. It will also involve implementing changes to your dog’s exercise habits."

Look for symptoms of an ear infection.,
Have the veterinarian examine your dog.,
Clean your dog's ears.,
Recognize possible allergies.",How to Soothe a Dog's Itchy Ears2," Ear infections are painful and cause lots of irritation, so you'll notice your dog rubbing and scratching his ears a lot. You may also notice the ear is red, swollen, hot to the touch, smells bad, or discharge coming from the ear (like a thick wax or pus). Ear infections can be caused by a variety of things (ear mites, bacteria, or yeast), so it's important that the vet diagnose your dog.


If you are unsure if your dog has an ear infection, compare one ear with the other. They should both look the same. If one ear looks different or irritated, it's likely infected., Since many things could cause an ear infection, your dog should be diagnosed by a vet who can prescribe medicated prescription ear drops that contain antibiotics. If your dog has had ear infections before, the vet may swab his ears to get samples of pus to send for a culture. This will precisely identify the bacteria causing the infection and which antibiotic will kill them. Severe infections may require a combination of topical drops into the ear and oral systemic antibiotics.There are many medications available. Your vet will select the best one for your dog and give you instructions on how often to apply it and for how long. Treatment will be largely determined by your dog's size and condition.

, Choose a mild, pH balanced, emollient (moisturizing), and quickly evaporating ear cleaning product. Choose a liquid instead of a wipe, since the liquid can penetrate into the ear canal to clean away deep seated pus and infection. Place the nozzle of the bottle over your dog's ear canal and squeeze generously. Plug the ear canal with a ball of cotton and massage the side of his head. Remove the cotton and wipe up the ear cleaner that comes out. Repeat this until the ear cleaner comes out clean.


If you later notice your dog tilting his head to the side, it could be a sign that he's ruptured an eardrum and the cleaner has touched the delicate middle or inner ear. Stop using the cleaner and get veterinary attention.
Cleaning the pus from the ears can decrease the amount of bacteria and give your dog some relief from the itch. However, if cleaning the ear upsets your dog or if his ears are too sore, stop cleaning and take him to the vet.

, In some dogs, recurrent and unexplained ear infections may be linked to an allergic reaction. The dog may be allergic to something in the environment (pollen or dust mites) or an ingredient in their food. Talk to your vet about this possibility if your dog continues to get ear infections — they may recommend putting the dog on a hypoallergenic diet as a trial to see if things improve.

Look for signs of an external parasite infection.,
Follow your vet's treatment plan.,
Look for signs of an internal parasite infection (ear mites).,
Follow the vet's treatment plan for ear mites.",How to Soothe a Dog's Itchy Ears3," If you've looked at your dog's ears and the both look healthy, then your dog may be scratching because there's an external parasite infection (like fleas or sarcoptic mange mites). Check your dog's coat for fleas and their droppings (flea dirt) pushing back the hair on his ears in the wrong direction.Fleas move quickly so you don't always see them. Flea dirt looks like specks of brown dust and when you place the dust on damp cotton wool you get an orange halo where dried blood from the flea bite reconstitutes.
Sarcoptic mange mites are too small to see with the naked eye, but the dog's fur typically gets a moth-eaten appearance, especially on the ear flaps and legs.

, If you think fleas or sarcoptic mange mites are causing your dog's itchy ears, then speak to your veterinarian about an appropriate anti-parasite product to kill the infestation and relieve the itch.There are several highly effective spot-on products available that kill fleas and mange mites. Ask the veterinarian to recommend one and determine the proper dosage for your dog.

, Since it's difficult to look deep into your dog's ear, you may only notice the scratching and a thick brown wax that might also be crumbly. This wax is made by ear mites, an infection that's a common problem in dogs. Your vet will need to use magnification tools (like an auroscope or otoscope) to look for mites scurrying or by looking at microscopic slides for mites or eggs.In otodectic mange, or ear-mite infection, the ear mites feed off wax in your dog's ear canal. They infest both the vertical and horizontal ear canals.

, Your veterinarian will probably recommend that you start with non-prescription medication containing pyrethrin. Typically, you'll apply a pyrethroid ear medication to the ear canal once or twice daily, for ten to fourteen days. Pyrethrin applied topically is safe for your dog, since it doesn't pass into your dog's bloodstream easily.While pyrethrin is effective against ear mites, it's not a successful treatment for bacterial infections.
There is a theoretical risk of toxicity if your dog eats the medication or another dog licks your dog's medicated ear. The signs of poisoning include excessive salivation, muscle tremors, agitation and in extreme cases, seizures. If you notice any of these signs, keep the dog in a dark, quiet room to minimize stimulation, and get veterinary advice.

Watch your dog for scratching and head-tilting.,
Have the vet remove any foreign body.",How to Soothe a Dog's Itchy Ears4," One common problem is a foreign body such as a grass awn or foxtail getting into the ear canal. You may notice the sudden onset itchiness after your dog went for a walk. Or, he might have been fine, gone for a walk and come back tilting his head to one side, frantically scratching his ear.


A foreign body, like a grass awn can migrate down your dog's ear canal, causing intense irritation. Your dog will tip his head to the side which has the foreign body.

, You probably won't be able to see deep enough into your dog's ear to find the foreign body. This is because the ear canal is ""L"" shaped and foreign bodies worm their way deep down. The vet will need to look deep into the ear using an otoscope (which is an instrument that is part magnifier and part light). The vet will remove the irritating object using special long graspers called alligator forceps.Removing the foreign objects shouldn't take long or cause your dog any pain.

Increase food intake.,
Change the food.,
Add additional fat to food.,
Keep the diet balanced.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Keep Your Dog or Cat at Its Correct Weight3," If your pet is underweight, increase her food calories to help her gain weight. One simple way to do so is to add an extra feeding. You want to be cautious in feeding only one very large meal a day, especially in large breed dogs.


Some pets are prone to bloat after eating a large meal, which can cause an emergency condition. Watch your pet for this condition and call an emergency vet right away if your dog seems in distress., Feeding the same food to your pet might not help your pet gain weight. You may find that you might need to switch to a better, more premium brand of food. It also might be beneficial to change to a different type of food ingredient in the food, such as from a chicken based food to a lamb based food. It might also be helpful to switch from strict dry food to a wet food or mixture of both to help increase her food intake as well.


When you are looking for new food, look for a higher fat and protein food. Typically, these will be 18% for fat and 28 to 30% for protein.
Your underweight pet may gain weight healthier and faster if you feed her a higher fat food. This is because fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbohydrates does., Another way to help your pet gain weight is to supplement your pet’s diet with tasty and easily handled food. This can include a scrambled egg cooked in butter, a teaspoon or two of peanut butter, or a teaspoon of cooking oil to her food. These foods can be added to the food once a day at first. If you have a larger dog, you can add these to the food two or three times a day.

, Dogs and cats need a well-balanced supply of vitamins and minerals with their food. Most good quality commercial dog and cat foods are balanced to meet all nutritional needs of your pet. Check the ingredient’s label on the pet food containers for multiple brands. Good foods will have meat as the top ingredients. Meat by-products, if listed, should be near the bottom of the ingredient list. Grains and vegetables are all generally used in dog foods and some cats foods.


If your dog or cat has a medical condition, it is best to seek the advice of your veterinarian to make sure your pet has the best food for its health.
If you feed your pet a homemade diet, carefully balance the ingredients to make a balanced diet. Consult a veterinary nutritionist to create a balanced menu for your pet. It is extremely hard to make a balanced homemade diet for a cat, so only do so with professional help.

, Although young dogs and cats can be overweight or underweight, any dietary changes should be discussed with your veterinarian. Large to giant breed puppies need carefully planned diets so their bones grow properly. Also, elderly pets need to be under a veterinarian’s care if any dietary or weight changes are needed.

Be aware that some dogs will not show any symptoms.,
Watch your dog to see if he scratches his ear frequently.,
Look for signs that your dog is in pain.",How to Recognize an Ear Infection in a Dog2," It is worth being aware that your dog may not display the same behavioral symptoms as other dogs. However, if you see any physical symptoms, or even simply witness your dog acting differently than normally, you should consult a vet.If the first sign you see is ignored, it is very likely that other symptoms will develop as the infection gets worse. This means that your dog will experience discomfort for a longer period of time.

, Ear infections are often itchy and uncomfortable. Ear mites, in particular, tickle the ear canal, which prompts a dog to scratch or rub his ear. Another source of ear irritation is an allergic reaction. Many dogs who suffer from an allergy to something in their diet can be prone to skin inflammation that localizes in and around the ear. This inflammation prompts the dog to rub or scratch the area, causing further soreness.


A variation on the ear scratching behavior is tilting the head to one side. If your dog is doing this, you may notice that he will tip one side of his head towards the ground. For example, if your dog has an infection in his left ear, he will tip his head so that his left ear is closest to the ground., Dogs show that they are in pain in a number of ways. Some may become grumpy and short-tempered; if your dog seems snappish, do not touch the ear unless you absolutely have to, and bring him to a vet.Other dogs may wince or whimper when you gently touch the ear, or the area around the ear.
If the pain is severe the dog may lose his appetite, and seem listless. This is a non-specific sign, and if it persists is enough in itself to warrant getting him checked by the vet.

Get your equipment ready and within reaching distance.,
Place your dog on the surface area that you will be using.,
Brush out the ear that you would like to start on.,
Test the ear with your comb.,
Hold your dog's ear with your thumb over the top of the ear and your other fingers under it, forcing the ear to lay flat against them.,
With your good hand, hold your clippers like a pencil and turn them on.,
Bring your clipper down to the halfway point and gently run your clipper over the dogs ear at a constant rate and repeat till no more hair falls off (doing this too slowly or too quickly can catch the skin and cut the ear).,
Flip the ear over so that the inside of the ear is facing you.,
Now angle your clippers at a 45 degree against the ear and gently go down the ear again; repeat this process as necessary.,
Repeat the above step but now rotate your clippers the other way by 90 degrees, removing the bulk of hair from the other side.,
Repeat steps 3-10 on the adjacent ear.

,
Now your dog has tipped ears.",How to Tip Your Dog's Ear," Never put your things anywhere that the dog may kick, your tools are expensive and may be damaged if they fall.;
, Having someone else there to hold your pet secure may come in handy in this part of the segment.

, Using your slicker brush, gently brush the dogs ear from the base of the flap (where the ear meets the head on top) to the edge of the flap. You do not need to dig into the ear, but you should be able to feel the bristles run along the skin. Do not over brush your dogs ear as ears are fragile and may bleed with little provocation.

, Your comb is not to rip mats out if your dog's ear is matted, but merely to check to see if there are any tangles at all. like the brush, run your comb from the base of the ear, to the outer edge of the ear.

, Find the halfway point of the ear and make a mental not of where this is.

, If your dog is unfamiliar with this sound, let them see the clipper for a moment and introduce them by letting them sniff the butt end of the clipper (blades are sharp enough to cut a dogs tongue if they try to lick it).

, Don't worry if this doesn't' remove all of the hair, that's what the next step is for.

, You should be able to see a distinct line from where you shaved the top. Start at this line and travel down the ear to the tip. Never go backwards on an ear; you WILL cut it.

, This should remove the bulk of the hair that wasn't removed in the previous steps.

, The ears should be tipped and even.

,, Enjoy!

Rinse the wound as needed.,
Apply fresh dressings.",How to Care for a Dog's Torn Ear," This may be difficult, especially if the ear is still bleeding. You may have to have someone restrain your dog, as cleaning the injury may cause her more pain.Use warm, clean tap water to rinse the wound. You can also make a gentle saline solution by diluting one teaspoon of salt into two cups of clean, warm water.If your dog will let you, you may want to very gently massage the skin around the wound either while you rinse the ear or just before rinsing. This will remove any debris that may be stuck in or near the wound, ensuring that the tear does not heal over any foreign debris.Do NOT use any kind of household soap, shampoo, or human first aid washes like rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Using any of these could severely irritate the open wound, and your dog may react violently.;
, Hold clean gauze over the wound for several minutes, until the bleeding slows down. Apply mild to moderate pressure using your hands over the gauze to help slow the flow of blood to the wound., Once the bleeding has slowed to a manageable level, apply a new, clean piece of gauze to the wound. If you have adhesive bandage pads, layer them over the wound, leaving 1/3 of the previous bandage exposed with each successive layering.Be sure to cover some of the ear's fur in the bandaging at the perimeter of each bandaged layer, to help keep the bandage in place and prevent your dog from shaking the bandaging off on your way to the vet.Check the tightness of each successive layer of bandaging. Be sure that you can fit two fingers snugly under the bandage at any given time.Use a small quantity of adhesive tape around the edges of the bandage to be sure that the wrap will not come off., You can do this by wrapping long strips of gauze or medical tape around the head and over the ears. Just be sure not to cover the eyes or restrict breathing and make sure it's not too tight.Gently fold the bandaged ear over the top of your dog's head.Wrap any excess bandaging around the head, with one strip going across the front of the head and the other around the back, wrapping around the opposite (healthy) ear. Use adhesive medical tape if you do not have excess bandaging.Use a marker to gently mark over the bandaging/tape, indicating to your veterinarian where the ear canal begins.Wrapping too tightly around the neck can compress the dog's windpipe, making difficult for them to breathe. Take precautions to ensure the bandage is not too tight, especially around the dog's neck.

, This should be done as soon as possible. It's recommended that you take your dog to the vet within 24 hours, but it's best if you can get her to the vet on the same day the injury has occurred., Immediately after your dog injures her pinna (ear flap), it's important to put pressure on the wound for several minutes to stop the bleeding.You can do this with your hands, or use an old sock or pantyhose legging to stop the bleeding.


Cut a hole in the toe end of an old sock or stocking.Pull the sock/stocking over your dog's head, with her face all the way through the sock's hole. Be sure that your dog can see, breathe, and smell, and that the sock doesn't start to cover her head until it's past the eyes.Tuck clean gauze (if you have it) underneath the sock at the site of the ear wound, so that the sock holds the gauze in place and applies gentle pressure to the wound. If you don't have gauze or an absorbent bandage, use clean, dry paper towels or napkins.Keep the wounded ear bandaged flat against the head. If your dog has long ears, such as those of Cocker Spaniels or Dachshunds, lift the bleeding flap up and place it on top of the dog’s head so that the fur side is resting against your dog’s skull. The inner ear should be exposed to the air.Take your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Your dog should see a veterinarian within 24 hours of the injury, but it's even better if you can get her in on the same day she has been injured., You can use a clean sanitary pad to apply pressure and stop bleeding if you don't have any gauze.Apply the absorbent side of the pad to the site of the wound.
Use medical tape to hold it in place (normal adhesive tape will work in a pinch), or simply apply pressure with your hands for several minutes while you wait for the wound to stop bleeding.Be sure that the wounded ear is bandaged flat against the head to prevent further injury. If your dog has long ears, you should lift the bleeding flap up and place it on top of the dog’s head so that the fur side is resting against your dog’s skull.Take your dog to the vet within 24 hours of her injury., If you don't have bandages or tape, you can use strips of clean cloth from an old towel, blanket, or t-shirt.


Rip long strips from the cloth.
Put clean towel, gauze, or sanitary pad against the wound.Wrap the strips of cloth around the head and over the ears. Be sure that the eyes are not covered. Wrap strips of cloth around the head as necessary to put sufficient pressure against the towel or pad that is covering the wound.A long and narrow piece of fabric is ideal because it will be easier to wrap this sort of fabric around your dog’s head several times and then tuck the ends in to secure them. Make sure that you can fit two fingers in between the dressing and your dog’s neck to make sure that he does not begin choking.Make sure that the wounded ear is bandaged flat against the head. If your dog has long ears, be sure to lift the bleeding flap up and place it on top of the dog’s head so that the fur side is resting against your dog’s skull.Take your dog in to the vet within 24 hours of the injury., No matter how you create a makeshift bandage, the purpose of the head bandage is to hold the pinna pressed against your dog’s head so that the blood clot is not disturbed whenever your dog moves his head. This should not be treated as a substitute for veterinary care. If the tear is bad enough, your vet may need to suture the wound, and may recommend antibiotics. You should take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible, once the bleeding is at a manageable level., With the head bandage controlling the bleeding, you can now seek veterinary attention. Phone the vet clinic, tell them what has happened, and arrange to take the dog in to be assessed.


The vet will address issues such as wound contamination and infection, and will determine if the tear needs suturing.

, There are occasions when the bleeding will persist once the head bandage is removed. In these cases, your vet may need to sedate your dog or give him an anesthetic. The vet will then ligate the bleeding vessels and then suture the wound to protect the ligatures.

, Some tears in the ear flap heal without intervention provided the bleeding stops and the dog does not scratch the ear. However, some wounds do need suturing in order to heal. If the tear extends through the entire ear, your vet will probably recommend suturing the wound., Whether you go to the vet clinic, or decide to assess things at home, be prepared and get everything ready before you remove the dressing. You will need:


Scissors to remove the dressing.
Disinfectant.
A bowl.
Clean water.
Cotton wool.
More dressing materials to re-bandage your dog’s head.

, Before you remove your dog’s bandage, make the salt water disinfectant. Dilute one teaspoon of salt into two cups of clean, warm water.Soak clean cotton balls in the salt water and have these handy when you are ready to clean the ear flap.

, If it is not possible to unravel the dressing, or you cannot untie the fabric you used, you may need to cut it off. Take great care when using the scissors so that you don’t cut either yourself or the dog. Always cut the dressing beneath the dog's chin so that you will have no chance of cutting your dog’s ears.


To cut the bandage, slide your left hand in under the bandage to cover the dog's skin if you are right handed. Hold the scissors in your right hand and hold the long blades so that they are pointing from nose to tail. With the scissors in position, cut away the bandage.
Never cut along the top of your dog’s head. If you take too deep a snip of bandage you may accidentally cut his ear.

, Your vet will provide you with detailed instructions on how often to clean the wound, or if you should clean it at all. As a general rule, clean warm water or a warm saline solution work best for cleaning wounds., Your vet will give you specific details on how often you should change the bandages and clean the wound, but expect to change the dressings at least once a day when the wound first begins healing. You may have to change the bandages twice a day if the wound has become infected."

Assess your dog for symptoms of a ruptured eardrum.,
Pay attention to signs that the inner ear is damaged.,
Have a veterinarian inspect your dog's eardrums.,

Read the directions on the medicine.The medication tube or bottle should have directions that will tell you how much to apply, how often to apply it, and when to use the medication.,
Find a helper.,
Hold the dog steady.,
Carefully aim the nozzle’s opening toward the ear canal’s opening.,
Squeeze the tube or bottle gently.,
Massage the outside of the ear canal.,
Hold the dog steady for awhile.,
Apply medication for as long as prescribed.",How to Deliver Ear Medication to Dogs," Before you put medicine in a dog's ear you must first make sure you won't harm your dog’s ears by doing it. Therefore, before placing any medication in the dog’s ear you must make sure the eardrum is not damaged. Never place medication in a dog showing these signs, as they can indicate a possible ruptured eardrum:Unusual head tilting
Loss of balance (tipping to one side or falling down)
Vomiting
Pain when the ear is touched
Drainage of thick and/or bloody fluid from the ear;
, If you place medication into an ear that has a damaged or ruptured eardrum, the medication can damage the delicate structures the make up the inner ear. Damage to these structures are indicated by these symptoms:Head shaking
Pain
Rubbing the ear(s) on the floor
Pawing or scratching at the ear
Head tilt
Loss of balance or falling over
Turning in circles towards the damaged ear

, The only way to be totally sure that your dog's eardrums are fine is by having them examined by a veterinarian or veterinary technician. The vet, or vet tech, will use an otoscope, which is a lighted instrument, to peer into the ear canal to visually see the eardrum.It is important that the eardrum does not have any damage and is not torn. If you apply medicine to an ear with a damaged eardrum it could damage the ear further, including the risk of full hearing loss., Put the medication and tissue paper or paper towels within arms reach. Remove the cap from the medication. Most come with a long narrow nozzle that you can place on the medication container. Be sure to place this on the open end before proceeding.

, If in doubt, contact your veterinarian for clearer instructions.


There are a variety of medicines for dog's ears and they usually come in a liquid or an ointment form. Antibiotics for ear infections, for example, come in both liquid and ointment forms. Treatments for ear mites, on the other hand, usually come in liquid form.
Your veterinarian may also prescribe a veterinary ear cleaning wash. This will help clean out wax and debris from the ear, making your dog's ears healthier and allowing medication to absorb more easily., Have a helper that can help you hold the dog steady. This will make your job easier and it help the dog avoid injuring itself.


If the dog is in pain or doesn’t want its ears touched you may need to muzzle him or her. This will keep you safe and sometimes diverts the dog’s attention enough that you will be able to put the medication in its ears.
Placing a leash on the dog can also help you maintain control over a dog that does not want its ears messed with.

, Have your helper place one arm under the dog’s head so its neck rests on the helpers elbow bend. Have the helper put his or her other hand around the dog’s body, holding it steady.


If a helper isn’t available have the dog lay down. You will need to hold it steady while applying the medication. Place one arm gently across the neck and under the chin of the dog, and use the hand of that arm to hold the lower front leg. Place the other elbow on top of the dog, pinning its upper front leg to its body., Make sure it doesn’t touch any part of the canal. Hold the dog's ear flap open if you need to.This will help to keep the nozzle and medication from being contaminated before the next application.

, Deliver the proper amount of medication into the ear canal. If the medicine is liquid, this is usually specified in a number of drops from a squeeze bottle. If the medicine is an ointment, then the proper amount may be specified differently. Make certain to aim the nozzle tip towards the opening of the ear canal so the medication actually gets into this area.

, Once the medication is delivered gently massage the base of the ear to make sure the medication is evenly distributed. Use a piece of tissue or a paper towel to wipe any medication that has spilled down the ear onto the fur., A dog's first instinct when you put medicine in its ear is to shake its head.After that initial shake, try to keep the dog from excessively shaking his or her head for a few minutes in order to give the medication time to work. You can release the dog if you don't think it will go wild, but try distracting the dog with gentle play or a food treat or even a short, slow leash walk.


Once again, wipe around the ear to remove any excess drops that have drained from the ear.

, Make sure to give the medication to the dog as long as the label directions instruct. Failure to do so may result in not fully eradicating the problem and may even make the infection stronger by building its resistance to the medication.

As part of your regular grooming routine check your dog's ears. This way you will become familiar with what's normal for your dog, and be better placed to spot when something isn't right.;
, Look at the skin inside the ear first. Lift up the ear flap, if it is droopy, and inspect the skin for abnormalities or foreign objects. Then look down into the eardrum. A healthy ear should be clean and the skin should be smooth, supple, and the same color as the rest of the skin.


This is especially important after a walk in long grass, as grass awns trapped in the fur can migrate into the ear canal and cause an infection. Finding a grass awn before it causes an infection could save you a lot of money and it could potentially save your dog's life.
Smell your dog's ear. This may sound odd but when smell your dog's ear it should not smell unpleasant or rank.
Compare the state of each ear. If you can't tell if there is a problem, compare one ear to the other.If one ear looks different to the other, the chances are one ear is abnormal and has a problem.

, Your biggest challenge may be to recognize a low-grade long-term ear infection. With this type of infection the dog may have grown used to the change in hearing and so it doesn't give you any clues that there is a problem. Signs of a low grade long term infection include:


Skin thickening: The skin in the ear becomes thicker and less supple than normal. In extreme cases it can have a lichen-like appearance, which is sometimes compared to rhino hide. This thickened skin can also develop a crazed or cobbled pattern over the surface.
Change of color: Skin that is inflamed in the long term often produces pigment as a protective mechanism. Thus, if the dog normally has pink skin, the pigment may cause it to take on a grey or brown appearance.
Greasy feeling skin: Many long term infections involve the normal yeast inhabitants on the skin's surface. These yeasts overgrow which gives the skin a characteristic greasy feel, instead of the usual soft, velvety touch.
Smell: Lift the ear and sniff. If your recoil at the unpleasant smell then something is going on and the ear should be checked by a vet.
Narrowing of the ear canal: If the ear is sore and inflamed for days to weeks, the skin swells which narrows the ear canal. Compare the entrance to the ear canal, one side with the other, and the narrower one is the abnormal side.
Excessive paw or belly licking: Long term ear infections often arise as a result of allergic skin disease. If your dog chews its paws or licks its belly excessively, be especially alert to the possibility of an ear infection.

, These symptoms could indicate a variety of conditions, but they are associated with ear infections. If your dog has had ear problems in the past, note that any of these symptoms could indicate that there is a problem in the ear.


Itchiness: Some infections, such as an infestation with ear mites, are very itchy and the dog will constantly scratch its ear.Moodiness: Ear infections often cause an ear ache, which can be deeply unpleasant and make your dog unhappy. The dog may seem depressed and lose its appetite and some dogs will yelp when you touch their heads, indicating that your touch caused acute pain.Loss of Balance: Some infections occur deep within the inner ear and these can cause a loss of coordination. Your dog may stagger like it is drunk and may stumble and fall. This level of infection can also cause dogs to vomit and refuse food., Some ear infections come on suddenly and these are usually easy to catch. This is because sudden onset infections are often very painful and uncomfortable, which will affect your dog's behavior. Signs of an ear infection include:


Holding the head on one side: If your dog is repeatedly moving its head to one side, and not doing it out of inquisitiveness, then it might have an ear infection.Shaking the head: If your dog is shaking its head it may be a sign of irritation. Your dog is simply trying to rid itself of the discomfort associated with an ear infection.
Rubbing the ear: Rubbing the ear with a paw or on the ground can be a sign of discomfort.Pain: Ear infections and ear aches are painful. Your dog may seem not itself and look miserable as a response to the discomfort. In addition, it may be shy, and flinch or move away from you when you go to handle its ears. It may even vocalize its pain, or the anticipation of pain, by whining or yelping when you go to touch the ear. Some dogs will even growl or snap when you try to see what is wrong, even if that is out of character for them.

, If your dog is acting out in a way that makes you suspect it has an ear infection you should inspect its ears. Physical signs your dog has an ear infection include:


Inflammation: Reddened skin in the ear is a sign of inflammation. This often happens as a result of rubbing or from the infection itself.If you suspect an ear infection, lift the ear flap up and inspect the ear canal for reddening.
Discharge: There is often discharge from the ear when a dog has an ear infection. It may take time for the discharge to become evident, as discharge from an infection deep inside the ear will take time to build up. If you see green-yellow smelly discharge, blood-stained liquid, or thick black-brown waxy build up in the ear then your dog probably has some kind of ear infection., You do not want your dog to suffer in pain if you can get the problem solved. In the case of ear problems, you should always err on the side of caution, as hearing (and eliminating pain) is very important for a dog.

, The vet performs a physical examination looking at the outside of the ear, in much the same way you do. In addition, the vet will check the dog's lymph nodes in the throat, to see if they are enlarged, which can signal that the dog is fighting an infection. The vet may also check the dog's temperature to see if it is feverish.Next, the vet will look down the ear canal with an otoscope, which is an instrument that has a light source and a nozzle which allows them to see down the ear canal. The vet will check for objects in the ear (such as grass awns) which could set up the infection., If the cause of the problem is not immediately clear your veterinarian may suggest further testing. This will cost you more money but it could help to ease your pet's suffering.


The vet may smear a sample of any discharge onto a microscope slide and examine it for signs of yeast, bacteria, or parasites. If the vet suspects a bacterial infection they may send a sample of the discharge away to the lab for culture, to find out exactly which bugs are present and which antibiotic will be most effective at killing them.
Specialist veterinarians use small endoscope cameras which they pass into the ear canal, to record a video of what they see. This can be helpful to monitor the success of treatment and just to identify the problem.
If an inner or middle ear infection is suspected the dog may need further diagnostic tests. The most helpful of these is an MRI scan, since this provides an excellent picture not only of the structures of the ear, but of any fluid or soft tissue masses that are present within the bony chambers of the middle and inner ear.

, This treatment can vary, from letting the dog's immune system clear out a minor infection to putting the dog on antibiotics. If there is a severe problem with your dog's ears, beyond an ear infection, then your veterinarian will have suggestions about how to proceed.

Consult with a veterinarian.,
Determine how much food your dog eats a day.,
Reduce the amount of food you feed.,
Offer healthy treats occasionally.,
Make your dog work for food.,
Monitor your dog's weight loss.,
Create an exercise routine.,
Introduce moderate walking.,
Increase the dog's exercise level.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Put Your Dog on a Diet," Before you start your dog on a diet, check with the vet. Many clinics run a dog weight loss program where your pet is weighed and you can get specific instructions about how much to feed your dog. These regular weigh-ins, firm target, and moral support can make you more likely to succeed in putting your dog on an effective diet. Your vet may recommend one of the following diets:


High Fiber/Low-Fat Diet: These contain fiber which expand in your dog's stomach, making him feel full. The package instructions should clearly state how much to feed your dog based on a target (goal) weight.
Metabolic diets: These are more high tech and feed the genes that improve your dog's metabolism. Increasing metabolism can make your dog burn more calories, causing him to lose weight.;
, Pay attention to how much you're currently feeding your dog. If your dog is fed twice a day, weigh out the total amount so you know how much he's eating. However, if your dog has food constantly available, it's harder to determine how much he's eating. This makes it more difficult to know how much to cut down. If this is the case, look at the food package and see how much it advises feeding a dog at your dog's target rate.


For most dogs, the package will advise a weight range. For example, 300 to 350 grams of food a day. You'd want to choose the lower amount of 300 grams., Once you've determined how much your dog needs to eat a day, reduce the amount by 5 to 10%. For example, if you are feeding 300g of kibble a day, 10% of this is 30g, so the new amount is 270g. Feed this reduced amount for one or two weeks and weigh your dog. Hopefully, he loses weight, but if he hasn't, deduct another 5 to 10% from his daily food amount. Weigh your dog again after feeding the reduced amount for another week or two.Don't be upset or worried if the portion size looks small or your dog pesters you for food. This is a normal concern when putting a dog on a diet. If you're really unsettled, you may want to feed a prescription weight loss diet instead.

, Since you'll be cutting back on your dog's food and increasing exercise, you'll need to offer positive encourage every so often. While you can praise your dog, you can also give him the rare treat. Just be sure to offer something healthy that will also make him feel full and satisfied. Some good options include:


Bran or grated vegetable mixed with his food
French or runner beans, raw
Apples (in moderation)
Bananas (in moderation)

, Get your dog involved in earning his food, rather than just set it out in front of him. Buy a puzzle or activity feeder that you can fill with food. Your dog then moves shapes around or rolls balls around to get the food inside to fall out. This can make your dog more active and mentally engaged. Try to prevent boredom while your dog's on a diet. Keeping his mind occupied will prevent him from thinking about food.Training is also a great way to keep a dog active and prevent boredom. Of course training depends heavily on rewards, so take some of his dinner kibble and set it aside for rewards or give him lots of praising.

, Weigh your dog once every week or two so you can track any weight loss. This will also indicate whether your diet and routine are working. If he isn't losing, then you can reevaluate what you're doing. Make sure your goals are reasonable and that you're consistent with the regimen. Don't expect sudden drops in weight. Instead, look for slow and steady weight loss which is more sustainable. Smaller dogs should aim to lose no more than four ounces a week while larger dogs can aim for one pound per week.If you have a large dog or do not have access to scales, use a tape measure. Chose a point on the dog such as his girth or his waist and measure around it. Make a note of any landmarks the tape passes over, such as a particular pattern or spot, so you place the tape in the same place each time.

, While it may seem like you can simply start exercising your dog, you should make personalized exercise routine. Overweight dogs need to be gradually introduced to exercise if they were previously inactive. Jumping straight into a daily walking regimen can cause joint pain or injury instead of weight loss. Talk with your vet about what level of activity you should start your dog on.If your dog is inactive, start by putting small amounts of his food at opposite ends of the room and make him walk back and forth to eat it. You can also play simple games like rolling a ball across the floor and asking him to fetch it. When he drops the ball, reward him with some of the kibble taken from his dinner allowance., Gentle lead walks are a great way to begin exercising any unfit dog. Take your dog for a walk on his leash as far as he can comfortably walk. Make a note of how long it took him to get that far. Then, you can gradually increase the distance by adding 5 minutes to each walk once a week.For example, if your dog can only walk for 5 minutes in the first week, increase his walk to 10 minutes in the second week, 15 minutes in the third week, and so forth. If the walks are very short, take him out two or three times a day in order to build up stamina and fitness.
Make sure your dog is actually walking during your outings, not just spending most of his time sniffing.

, Increasing the duration, frequency, and intensity of your dog’s walking regimen will maximize weight loss and overall health. However, you probably want to add other activities to keep your dog interested in exercising. Once your dog is walking more comfortably, introduce one of the following exercises:


Cycling: Once your dog has a good level of fitness, train your dog to run alongside your bicycle. This can be a fun way for both of you to get exercise, but ensure that your dog doesn't become a danger on the road or to you.Swimming: Let your dog swim for short periods and gradually increase swim time. Swimming is excellent exercise for an overweight dog since it is non-weight bearing and won't strain the joints. However, make sure he wears a life vest because he may tire suddenly and there is a risk of drowning.Playing with toys: Pick up several active dog toys. Any kind of fetch toys are great for your dog like balls, flying discs, or plush toys. Pick your favorite and throw repeatedly until your dog is worn out. If you have back problems, buy a toy retrieval product to make picking up toys easier.

, Be sure to praise your dog verbally and physically before, during, and after exercise. For example, you can pet your dog or rub his ears or say, ""Good boy!"" Being positive will make exercise more enjoyable for your dog. You want him to associate exercise with reward. Your dog will be motivated, making exercise easier.Be patient with any exercise program. It may take a few months for your dog to meet the weight loss goals you've set for him, but it is possible if it's been organized and well thought out.

Towel-dry the ears.,
Use a drying solution.,
Clean out the ear canal.,
Check the ear.",How to Care for a Dog's Ears After Swimming1," Start by towel-drying your dog’s ears with a clean towel or washcloth. Soak up as much moisture as possible, and gently squeeze your dog’s ear to soak up water retained by the fur.Do not insert any portion of the towel down into your dog’s inner ear area. Use the towel for external drying only.
To get excess water out from your dog’s ear, use a cotton pad and dab gently along the opening of the ear canal. Do not force the pad down your dog’s ear canal.
Do not use a cotton swab, as this may cause pain for your dog and damage to their ears.;
, Many commercial pet ear cleaning products have drying agents in them, or you can make your own drying solution. Just squirt a small amount, between 3 to 5 drops depending upon the size of your dog, down around the opening of the ear canal.The feeling of the solution in your dog’s ear may cause them to want to shake it out. Steady your dog gently with your hands to keep the solution in as you clean.
Once you have applied the formula, massage the dog’s ear gently to help distribute the solution around the ear canal.

, Depending upon your dog’s ear size, use a cotton ball or section of a cotton ball and place it down at the opening of the ear canal. The section of cotton should be about as large as or slightly larger than the canal opening. Massage your dog’s ears with the cotton in place to absorb the solution and any additional liquids.Do not press too hard or massage too vigorously, as this may cause pain for your dog.

, Remove the cotton and check the ear to make sure there is no excess fluid. Good lighting or even a flashlight may help you better see down your dog’s ear canal.


If fluid remains, repeat the drying process one more time.
If the water maintains after the second drying, contact your vet for recommendations and further information.

Inspect for symptoms.,
Call your vet.,
Treat as recommended.",How to Care for a Dog's Ears After Swimming2," Infections due to water in the ear are common with dogs, especially if your dog spends a lot of time in the water. Check for symptoms of an ear infection, including:Redness or inflammation around the ear
Frequent head shaking or rubbing
An unpleasant odor coming from the ear
Scaly patches of skin within the ear
Black or yellow debris in the ear

, If your dog has an ear infection, you will need to contact your vet to get proper treatment. Call your vet and be prepared to describe the symptoms you notice, as well as when your dog was last in the water.Depending upon the symptoms you observe, your vet may either want you to bring your dog in, or the may recommend medication or treatment over the phone. Be prepared if your vet asks you to schedule an appointment with them.

, Once your vet provides you with a recommendation for treatment, it is important that you follow them exactly as your vet outlined in their instructions. This means administering medication and/or applying topical treatments as frequently as prescribed for as long as prescribed.Most infections will need to be treated with an antibiotic of some sort. Some medication may be applied topically, while others are taken orally. Read the instructions carefully to ensure proper administration for your dog.
If proper treatment does not help your dog’s infection during the recommended course prescribed by your vet, contact your vet to let them know and ask for other treatment options.

Visit your vet.,
Consider your dog’s breed.,
Figure out if your dog has epiphora.,
Determine if your dog has conjunctivitis.,
Screen your dog for dry eye.",How to Clean Gunk from Your Dog's Eyes1," If your dog has gunk or discharge draining from her eyes, you first need to make sure it’s not a sign of a serious health problem. Make an appointment with your veterinarian to determine the cause of the discharge before addressing the problem on your own. While you should evaluate your dog for symptoms, you should never rely on your own assessment of the problem.


Take notes on your dog’s symptoms and bring them with you to the vet visit.
If it appears something is lodged in your dog’s eye, visit the emergency vet immediately.;
, Brachycephalic breed breeds including pugs, bulldogs, boxers, and Pekingese are more likely to have eye discharge because of their flat faces, protruding eyes, and shallow eye sockets, and can suffer from issues with tear drainage and/or eyelids that don’t function properly. Saint Bernards, terriers, beagles, cocker spaniels, and bloodhounds have loose skin on their faces and, as a result, have eyelids that are more likely to roll outward. These breeds are also more susceptible to cherry eye, a condition where the gland in your dog’s eyelid slips out of its original position., Excessive tearing, or epiphora, can result in stained, stinky, and/or infected fur and skin. If your pooch’s eyes are watery and teary, she could have epiphora. There are many conditions that cause epiphora, including allergies, ulcers on your dog’s cornea, inflammation, abnormal eyelashes, tumors, glaucoma, and poor drainage of the eye by the tear ducts.If you think your dog is suffering from epiphora, take her to see the vet as soon as possible.

, If your dog has yellow or green pus, mucus, or watery discharge draining from her eyes, it could be a sign that she is suffering from conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis is when the lining of your dog’s eye becomes inflamed. It can be caused by a number of factors including allergies, distemper, tumors, injury, birth defects, dry eye, tear duct problems or foreign matter.If your dog is showing symptoms of conjunctivitis, take her to the vet immediately.

, If your dog’s eye discharge is sticky and persistent, dry eye could be the culprit. Mucus and inflammation are characteristics of dry eye in dogs. Dry eye can be caused by injury to the tear-producing gland, autoimmune response, or distemper. If your dog has dry eye, she is at serious risk for infection and/or ulcers on her cornea. If it looks like your dog is suffering from dry eye, make an appointment with her vet to get to the root of the issue and prevent future problems like infection."

Prepare the thermometer.,
Have another individual restrain the dog's body.,
Be cautious.,
Lift the dog's tail to expose the rectum.,
Insert the thermometer into the dog's rectum about 1 inch (2.54 cm).,
Leave the thermometer inserted for the right amount of time.,
Remove the thermometer gently.",How to Check a Dog for a Fever1," Lubricate the tip with petroleum jelly or water based lubricant such as “KY jelly.""Lubricating the thermometer will make the experience slightly less uncomfortable for your dog.


If you have a digital thermometer, turn it on and make sure that it is in working order before inserting it into the rectum.
Most digital thermometers can read in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Check your thermometer’s directions to figure out how to change the type of reading.
Mercury thermometers should be shaken down to the end closest to the mercury tip before inserting to ensure the most accurate reading. The mercury thermometer may have both Fahrenheit and Celsius, you will have to check your particular instrument.;
, Have the other person give the dog a “hug” by placing his or her left arm under the neck of the dog and using his or her left hand to hold the side of the dog's face against the shoulder. Your helper will then place his or her right arm under the belly of the dog just in front of the back legs to keep the dog standing.


It is not uncommon for a dog to want to sit down when they feel a rectal thermometer inserted. If your dog is comfortable lying down and stays there for the temperature taking, then you can leave them lying down.
Sitting is not the preferred position because the rectum will not be easily accessible., If you have any indication that the dog may bite or you may injure the dog while trying to restrain your pet, stop! It is better to wait and take your dog to its veterinarian to get its temperature taken than to risk injury to the dog or yourself.

, Lift from the base of the tail, rather than the tip. This will give you more control over the animals movement and prevent the dog's tail from wagging.


It may be helpful to have your helper hold the dog's tail up for you.

, Be careful not to insert the thermometer too deep, or too shallow, as this will affect the readings.Try to gently insert along the side of the rectum, particularly if there is feces present.


The anus is the opening into the rectum, which is a long tube that collects feces. The anus is a muscular sphincter that relaxes and opens to allow feces to leave the rectum. The sphincter can shut very tightly if the dog is painful or afraid. Avoid forcing the thermometer through the anus, but do aim into the middle of the pucker where you will find the least resistance for your well-lubricated thermometer.
Remember to keep your hand steady and the thermometer straight.
Be deliberate in your approach.

, If you are using a digital thermometer, keep it in until it beeps. If you are using a mercury thermometer, leave in place for approximately two-minutes., This has probably been a very intrusive and stressful experience for your dog, so be sure to use a soft touch. Clean the thermometer off after use - rubbing alcohol works well.Remember, this is the doggy thermometer for rectal use. It should not get mixed up with thermometers you use for humans.

Clean your dog’s ears with a cleaning solution the same way that you used the drying solution.Place a few drops in the dog’s ears
Massage the ears to distribute the solution
Massage a cotton ball around the ear canal opening to pick up excess solution and remove accumulated debris.

, When you have your dog groomed, add on an ear cleaning service if it is not already included. Professional ear cleanings may be able to get a bit more dirt and debris out of the ear canal, and may have more tools at their disposal to fully clean your dog’s ear.


Ask your groomer about packages that include ear cleanings, and how much it would cost to add on an ear cleaning if one is not included.
Many doggy daycares and boarding facilities also offer baths and ear cleanings. Ask your dog care facility if ear cleanings are available so that you can ensure your dog is clean and healthy when they come home.

, If your dog has stubborn wax or debris stuck in their ear, do not try to remove it yourself. Instead, go to your vet, who may be able to remove the wax with proper tools and cause minimum stress and discomfort to your dog.Let your vet know that you would like to come in for an ear cleaning as your dog has build-up in their ears that you have not been able to remove.

Clean your dog’s eyes with a sterile pet eye solution.",How to Clean Gunk from Your Dog's Eyes2," While most dogs will be okay with you cleaning gunk from their eyes, others might not. If your dog is especially sensitive, try cleaning her eyes with the help of another person. Have someone with whom the dog is familiar hold your pet while you clean the dog’s eyes.

, If your dog’s eye discharge isn’t caused by a serious medical condition like epiphora or conjunctivitis, you can clean the gunk with a damp, soft cloth or sponge. Using water that is at room temperature, wet the cloth and wring it out so it remains damp but is not overly saturated.Avoid using extremely hot or cold water as this can cause further irritation in your dog’s eyes.
Don’t use a napkin or paper towel as both can disintegrate when wet and leave harmful bits of paper in your pooch’s eyes.

, Using the moistened washcloth or sponge, gently clean the discharge from your dog’s eyes using several gentle strokes. If necessary, you can rinse and wring the cloth between strokes.

, In the majority of cases, you should not use any type of detergent, soap, or shampoo when cleaning gunk from your dog’s eyes. This can cause irritation for your pet. Instead, you should stick to water and avoid cleansers altogether., If your pet is suffering from a chronic or serious condition that causes excessive eye discharge, your vet may recommend using sterile pet eyewash to clean your dog’s eye. Gently moisten the cotton ball or pad with the solution, taking caution to not soak it. Start at the inner corner of the eye and wipe outward.Use a new cotton ball or pad for each eye, as using the same one for both eyes can spread bacteria, viruses, and infection between the two eyes.

The resulting wind can blow debris in your dog’s eyes, which can in turn cause irritation or even an infection., The fur surrounding your dog’s eyes can be a hotbed for bacteria and viruses, which can quickly turn into an infection. Make sure you bathe your dog regularly and clean her eyes using either a damp cloth or a sterile pet eye wash.

, Keeping the hair around your dog’s eyes clipped can help prevent irritation and the proliferation of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Have someone familiar with the dog hold her while you use blunt nosed scissors to trim the hair. If your dog is not comfortable with this, do not try it at home. Instead take her to your veterinarian for eye grooming."

Lift the canine's ear and gently brush aside any hair that may be in the way.,
Look for signs of an ear infection.,
Position the thermometer deep into the dog's horizontal ear canal.,
Hold the thermometer in place and wait for it to beep.,
Remove the thermometer from the dog's ear gently.",How to Check a Dog for a Fever2," This will allow you to have a clear view of the animals ear canal. Any hair that remains in the way may obstruct the thermometer and cause discomfort to your dog.


Note that while ear thermometers are less invasive to the animal they can be less accurate if used improperly., If your dog has an ear infection, do not use the ear thermometer, as it will likely give you an inaccurate result and be painful to the dog. Indications of an ear infection are redness, swelling, discharge with an odor, and shaking or scratching excessively at the ears., You may want to have another person hold the dog's head to get enough control of the animal to do this. Be sure the thermometer is deep enough or it will not produce an accurate temperature reading. .


If you don't have help, hold the dog's body between your legs to keep it still. At no time should you continue with this process if your dog is trying to bite you, as you will not get an accurate reading if the dog is fighting the process.

, This indicates a reading was successfully achieved. Depending on the brand and make of the thermometer, read times will vary.

, Remember, ear thermometers go very deep into the horizontal ear canal. Some dogs may object to the ear thermometer, sometimes even more so than to the rectal option.

Check the reading on the thermometer.,
Double check any “abnormal” readings.,
Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog's temperature is higher than 106 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Contact your veterinarian if your dog's temperature is above 103 degrees Fahrenheit.",How to Check a Dog for a Fever3," A normal temperature should be between 100 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 and 39.4 degrees Celsius).Readings above 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) are considered elevated.Temperatures below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) are considered low., If the temperature is too low, the thermometer may not be inserted far enough in the ear or the rectum, or it could be inserted into feces. If the temperature is too high and the dog is excited or really resisted handling, let the dog rest for 10 minutes and recheck.

, This is very dangerous to your animal and should be considered a medical emergency.If your veterinarian is not open or available, take your dog to the nearest emergency animal hospital.

, This is especially important if there are other indicators of illness, such as lethargy or lack of interest in food. Make an appointment to go in that day. "

Give your dog high quality food full of nutrients and minerals.,
Consider giving your dog dietary supplements.,
Talk to your vet if you think your dog may be overweight.,
Do not allow your dog to run or leap when he is a puppy.,
Take your dog on walks or runs when he is an adult.,
Avoid doing a lot of jumping activities with your dog.,
Bring your dog to the vet for testing.,
Allow your vet to do a physical exam and take x-rays of your dog.,
Discuss treatment options with your vet.",How to Prevent Hip Dysplasia in Dogs," Most vets argue that extra weight on your dog’s frame can lead to stress and pressure on his joints, especially his hip joints. A poor diet, lacking in nutrition, can also lead to poor bone growth and other joint and cartilage abnormalities in puppies and adult dogs. Manage your dog’s weight to prevent obesity and avoid putting unnecessary stress on his joints.Look for high quality commercial dog food that is preserved with vitamin E or another natural preservative. These products will have no chemicals and contain high-quality meat instead of meat byproducts. You may have to pay more for higher quality dog food that is full of good sources of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. But it will be worth it if it keeps your dog healthy and ensures he does not end up overweight.You should also look at your dog’s current physical state. Does he look bloated or overly round in his middle area? Research has proven that dogs who are kept very lean during their early, puppy years may have a reduced risk of developing hip problems. Keeping your dog thin and active can help prevent any issues associated with obesity.;
, You should ensure your dog is getting enough vitamins and minerals by giving him antioxidant vitamins C and E. You can also give him Perna supplements. These supplements contain 57 nutrients and are good for strengthening your dog’s joints.


Speak to your vet about the right supplements for your dog and the proper dosage for each supplement before you give any supplements to your dog. Often, supplements are crushed into your dog’s food so they are easy for him to consume.

, Your vet can help you develop a diet for your dog that can help to reduce his weight, or help him keep weight off. Many large breeds are susceptible to overeating, so your vet may be able to offer advice on how to better control your dog’s diet.


Your dog may also have certain allergies or other conditions that may be causing obesity. Ask your vet to check for other health issues that may be affecting your dog’s weight.

, Over-exercising your dog when he is young can lead to bone and joint issues that may lead to the development of hip dysplasia. Gentle, low impact exercises can be beneficial for puppies, but avoid letting your pup run, leap, or jump until he is physically mature.High impact sports like jumping and leaping can be hard on your puppy’s developing joints, so avoid doing these activities with your puppy until he is fully developed.

, Keep your dog active to help him stay physically fit with moderate exercise like running, walking, and swimming. Dogs with large, strong leg muscle mass may be less likely to develop hip dysplasia than dogs with a smaller muscle mass., Activities that might apply too much force on your dog’s joints, such as jumping for a Frisbee or leaping for a ball, can lead to development of hip issues. Consistent walking, running, and swimming can help your dog build muscle strength without putting too much stress on his body., Your dog may not show signs of hip dysplasia until he is between four month and one year old. There is a spectrum of symptoms, from no symptoms at all to wobbling, weaving, or an unsteady gait. Your dog may also bunny hop when he runs, or be averse to strenuous exercise or activity.


If you suspect your dog might have hip dysplasia, it’s best to bring him to your vet for testing. The earlier you get the diagnosis, the sooner you can treat your dog’s condition and help to manage any pain or discomfort he may be experiencing.

, Your vet will examine and touch your dog’s hips to feel for any looseness in the joints or any pain reactions from your dog when she flexes or extends his hip joints.


X-rays will help your vet confirm your dog has hip dysplasia and determine how serious his condition is.

, There are several different surgical procedures available to correct your dog’s hip dysplasia. However, the surgery recommended for your dog will depend on his age, weight, and size. Your vet may recommend two different surgical options:


Triple Pelvic Osteotomy, which is used on young puppies.
Total Hip Replacement is recommended for dogs with degenerative arthritis or chronic hip dysplasia.

Wash your hands before beginning.,
Have the medicine ready.,
Ask someone to help you.,
Hold your dog securely.,
Consider alternative restraining techniques.,
Gently clean your dog's eyes.,
Position the dog's head.,
Apply eye drops.,
Apply eye ointment.,
Gently massage your dog's eyelids.,
Repeat the process.,
Give your dog a treat when you finish.,
Stop your dog from rubbing its eye.,
Close and secure the medication.",How to Give Your Dog Eye Drops," This is good practice to get used to. Since you are treating an area that is sensitive to dust, grim, and foreign bacteria, you don't want to add to endanger your dog's vision. Make sure you use anti-bacterial soap.;
, Whether you are using a drop or an ointment, you’ll want to have it open and close to you. Most likely, your dog won’t want to get the treatment and will struggle. You need to make this as speedy as possible.

, It really all depends on your dog. If your dog is lazy or peaceful, you might be able to apply the medicine yourself. If you think your dog will struggle, squirm, or even bite, you’ll need another person there to help you hold your dog.

, If you are by yourself, it’s a good idea to apply the medication when your dog’s hindquarters are against a wall or a piece of furniture. This will make it difficult for your pet to back away from you.


If you have a helper, he can stand behind the dog or secure its hindquarters between his knees. With free hands, the helper can then stabilize your dog's head for you. If the dog is small enough, it might be easier to place it on a table.

, If your dog’s legs are too strong to use the medicine while it is standing up, consider placing it on its side. Have the holder pin its legs to the ground. Similarly, if your dog tends to nip or bite when you apply medication to its eyes, you may need to get a muzzle. This will limit your dog’s ability to open its mouth.Muzzle your dog if you can't hold him in a relaxed position.


Ideally, you shouldn't use either of these techniques. You don't want to stress your dog out more than you have to. If you create a pleasant experience for your dog, they'll be easier to manage in the future.

, Before applying the medication, make sure that the eye area is clean. Place one hand on the side of your dog's jaw to support its head, and tilt its head upwards. Gently wipe away any discharge with a damp cotton wool ball or a tissue.


Dispose of the items used to wipe your dog's eye promptly to avoid reinfection.

, Cradle your dog's head in your non-dominant hand and hold the bottle of drops with your dominant hand. With the thumb of the hand holding the head, gently pull down the lower eyelid to form a pouch. This space behind the lower eyelid is the conjunctival sac, and it is a good place to apply eye medication. Rest the hand holding the medication on the pet's forehead, so if the dog jerks its head, your hand will move with it., Without touching the tip of the bottle to the dog's eye (about 1/8” is a good distance), place the required number of drops into the conjunctival sac or on the eyeball.By putting the medicine in the conjunctival sac, it will spread around the eyeball easier without spilling out of the dog's eye. Try to give the drops a few seconds to disperse before letting the dog shake its head. As long as you actually get the drops in the eye, though, there's probably no need to worry if the dog does shake its head. Eye drops disperse rapidly., The procedure is basically the same as administering eye drops. Restrain your dog’s head. Without touching the tip of the tube to the dog's eyeball, apply a ribbon of medication to the conjunctival sac. Gently close the dog's eye and massage the eyelid with your finger to disperse the medication across the eyeball.If your dog flinches and you are sure that none of the medication got into the eye, take a deep breath, wipe away the ointment, and try again. If you are patient and persistent, it will get easier.

, This will disperse the treatment. Do this lightly for as long as your dog will reasonably let you. Ideally, you would gently rub your dog's eyelid for 10 to 15 seconds to make sure that the medicine has fully spread across your dog's eye., Follow your vet’s instructions. Some drops/ointments will need to be administered every two hours, some twice a day, and some once a day. The recommended frequency should be printed on the side of the bottle, if it’s a prescription drop/ointment.


If you have been asked to treat both eyes even though only one eye appears infected, follow your vet's instructions. The second eye may need preemptive treatment to prevent the infection from gaining entry to that eye.

, The more positive the experience you can make this for your pet, the easier it will be to medicate its eyes in the future. It is all about positive conditioning. Your dog will respond well., If your dog’s eyes were irritated before, the eye drops should help. Yet, in some cases, the eye drops or ointment might be a new source of irritation. Regardless, do your best to stop your dog from rubbing its eye. Your dog might use its paws to rub its eyes or it'll drag its heads on the carpet. Stay close to your dog and hold them if you need to while the medicine works its magic.

, Most medicines need to be resealed after use to retain their potency. You’ve finished applying eye drops or ointments to your dog’s eyes, but the job isn’t over until the medicine is closed and placed in a safe place.

Consult your vet about a reliable cleaner.,
Place your cockapoo in a sitting or prone position.,
Squeeze several drops of cleaner into the ear canal.,
Softly massage the closed ear.,
Swab the inner ear with a piece of cotton.,
Stand back while your dog shakes its ears.,
Inspect your cockapoo’s ears regularly.,
Watch out for yeast infections.,
Pluck hairs growing deep within the ear canal.,
Repeat cleanings regularly.",How to Clean Cockapoo Ears," Many online retailers and pet forums offer feedback regarding different canine ear cleaners, but your vet can provide specific advice based on their experience with other cockapoo owners. Next time you’re at the vet for a routine check-up or to address a separate problem, ask your vet if they have any specific brand recommendations or ingredients which you should try to avoid.


Quistel, Thornit powder, and Malacetic Aural are all cleaners which you can expect to encounter in vets’ and other owners’ recommendations.;
, Administering ear cleaner to your dog’s ears is easiest when you stand behind your dog while it sits or lays down. From this position, you can bend your cockapoo’s ear flap back in order to find the ear canal. Even better, have a family member or friend help to secure your cockapoo and provide comfort.If your cockapoo isn’t accustomed to this procedure, it might fidget or whine. You can avoid this kind of behavior by starting grooming rituals when your dog is still a puppy.

, You should aim to pour the cleaning solution directly into your dog’s ear canal, but don’t stick a bottle applicator or cotton ear bud into the ear. Rather, try to bend the ear flap so that the cleaner can travel down the surface of the inner ear and into the ear canal. If the tip of your dropper or applicator accidentally touches your dog’s ear, be sure to disinfect before subsequent use in order to avoid contamination.

, Once you’ve administered the drops, close your cockapoo’s ear and rub the area for twenty to thirty seconds. This motion breaks up waxy buildup in the ear canal and distributes the solution throughout.Don’t be alarmed if this light massage causes a squelching sound. This slightly icky sound just means that the fluid is moving through the ear canal.

, Some wax or discharge may be dislodged during the process of massaging your cockapoo’s ear. Make sure you remove this buildup—along with any excess cleaning solution—by wiping a moist or dry cotton swab under the ear flap and around the ear canal., Even if your cockapoo is well used to grooming and ear cleaning, it will probably always shake its head after an ear cleaning. This action—a reaction to the odd sensation of liquid running through the ear canal—is largely harmless, so you should let your dog do so.Pay attention if your dog shows signs of more than mild discomfort. For example, if it whines or scratches at its ears after shaking its head, this can indicate an infection or irritation.

, Even on days when you’re not planning to do an ear cleaning, you should check your dog’s ears to make sure everything looks healthy. Simply flip up its ear flaps and look beneath and around the ear canal. If your cockapoo’s ears are dry, pink, smooth, and odorless, everything is normal.Scaly skin, redness, moisture, or waxy or whitish discharge are signs of irritation and maybe even a developing infection. You should clean your cockapoo’s ears immediately and treat it for infection if the irritation persists.

, Cockapoos are prone to getting yeast infections in their ears due to the natural shape of their ear canals and the length of their ear flaps. These infections aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they can cause mild to severe discomfort, as well as some nasty symptoms such as a strong, yeasty odor, brownish discharge, or flaky, scabbed skin.If you suspect a yeast infection, have your vet advise you how to treat it.
If the condition becomes chronic, you should consider changing your cockapoo’s diet. Check the label of your dog food and treats and see if it contains brewer’s yeast.

, Like poodles and cocker spaniels, cockapoos often grow excess hair inside of their ears. This hair can trap waxy buildup and moisture, so you need to remove these hairs in order to prevent infection. Use an ear powder such as Pluck-it or Thornit canker powder to assist you in gripping and plucking the hairs with a tweezer or your thumb and forefinger.If you’ve ever plucked an eyebrow or nose hair, you know that this experience can be unpleasant. You can ease your cockapoo’s discomfort by beginning this procedure early in your dog’s life.

, Due to the cockapoo’s susceptibility to infection and waxiness, you should clean your dog’s ears every week or every other week. Use the cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian and never stick a cotton swab or any other implement into the ear canal.Just be sure not to overdo it, as cleaning too often can dry out your dog’s ears. If everything looks and smells healthy, you might want to forego using the cleaning solution and just wipe under your dog’s ear flap with a moist cotton ball."

Walk your dog.,
Step train the dog.,
Train the dog to sit, stay, shake, leave it, and any other command you think is desired.,
Remember that dogs do not think existentially.",How to Care for a Dog Blind from Birth," Dogs that are blind from birth are very adaptable and do not need a completely unmoving environment, since they develop excellent mental maps and adjust, but they do need to be away from stairs and sharp objects that they may bump into.;
, Most sighted puppies rely on feel and smell as much as a blind dog. Puppies don’t have great eyesight.

, Chicken thighs are very inexpensive and a great luxury for dogs. Gourmet preparation is not required; just bake them until they’re not pink, then cut them into tiny pieces. Training pieces are not meals.

, Sighted dogs can see how happy or upset you are, but blind dogs need to learn it by touch or treat.


Condition “Good!” (Good boy, good girl, good puppy, good Fido) with either a soft pet or a small treat. The best treat is a tiny piece of chicken for a small dog.
Blind dogs can be trained for some actions far easier than sighted dogs, because they are not distracted. Easy words and easy training are even easier for a blind dog!
Condition something negative with a sharp sound. It can be a hiss, pst, “uh-uh,” or something very short. The sound alone should be enough to deter bad behavior, but steering them away from the behavior at the same time will help.

, Sighted dogs look at your face for affection. Blind dogs can’t. Touching, petting, and rubbing are their only signs that you are affectionate towards them.

, You may not think they can understand, but they will develop an understanding of what you are doing by what you tell them. If you walk away, tell them in a simple word about what you are doing. “Laundry,” “Dishes,” “Jammies,” “Potty,” and many more daily activities are all things they can come to understand.


You can even use made-up words for activities. “Hodeeho!” could mean you are going to the car and will be right back. Feel free to make up as many words as you want. Your sighted dogs will understand these too.

, Blind dogs (who have never had sight) are even better on a leash than sighted dogs. They don’t have the distractions that sighted dogs have. They will learn, much as a horse does, that a slight tension on the leash means to turn. Keep them on a close leash so you can steer them from things they may bump into, but let them run if it’s clear and they want to.


Be lenient on your walks. Blind dogs don't heel well, since they can't see where your heel is.
Because blind dogs are denied the visual stimulation of walks, let them have plenty of time to stop and smell. Do this either on the way out or on the way back, since they should have some good exercise time too.

, This can take time for a blind dog, so be patient. Sitting by a step with the dog can help. Say, “Step!” and then put the front paws on the step. They are naturally (and rightfully) afraid of stairs and steps. Never try to stair-train a blind dog. Disorientation can cause them to tumble and fall. Blind dogs should always be carried on stairs.

, They may require more touch and chicken treats than a sighted dog to get it the first time, but will reward you with far less disobedience once they understand.

, They have no idea, if blind from birth, that sight exists. They can be fearless and blissfully happy.

Watch your dog as he moves around and see if he ‘bunny hops’.,
See if your dog has a hard time getting up or lying down.,
Monitor your dog’s activity and see if it decreases.,
Listen for an audible clicking sound when your dog moves.,
Check to see if your dog is willing to climb up stairs.,
Check your dog for rashes caused by excessive grooming.,
Look for pressure calluses and sores on your dog’s body.,
Feel your dog’s back legs to see if he has lost muscle mass.",How to Recognize Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Dogs1," Dogs that have painful hips take shortened steps and tend to hold their rear legs farther forward under their bellies. This can lead to ‘bunny hopping’, which means your dog is holding his back legs together and hopping rather than running in long strides like normal. Watch your dog to see if he:


Swivels his hips a lot when he walks.
Holds his back legs together so that when he walks his back legs hop in a bunny-like fashion.
Limps or has other abnormal movements.
Tips over easily.;
, Pain caused by hip dysplasia can get worse the longer your dog remains in a resting position. This is particularly true in the morning after your dog has slept all night.Because of this, you might notice that your dog:


Hesitates to lie down if he is standing up.
Has a harder time getting up if he is lying down.
Seems stiffer in the morning or when the weather is cold.

, A reduced amount of physical activity is one of the most common signs of pain caused by hip dysplasia.All dogs slow down as they get older, but a decrease in activity should not occur until your dog is an advanced age. If your dog is not ill or overweight, he should maintain roughly the same activity levels from when he turns one to well into his mature years. Look for:


A lack of interest in going on runs or doing other physical activities with you.
Lying down rather than running around in the backyard.
Getting tired more easily when playing fetch.
Preferring to sit rather than stand and walk when on the leash.

, The term ‘creaking bones’ can be applied to a dog with hip dysplasia. You might notice a clicking sound when your dog moves. This is his bones clicking and loosening up. Listen for this noise when:


Your dog gets up after lying down for a while.
Walks.
Runs.

, You might notice that your dog suddenly has a harder time, or is hesitant to climb, stairs that he has never had a hard time navigating in the past. This is because hip dysplasia makes it harder for your dog to climb up stairs or walk up slopes, as his back legs are stiff and he can’t control them as well as he used to.

, Inactive dogs who can’t move they want to can get bored. To pass the time, they tend to lick and groom themselves more often than normal. If you notice that your dog is spending more time grooming himself, check him for rashes or hair loss, as both of these things can be caused by excessive grooming. In particular check:


Your dog’s hips.
Your dog’s flanks.
Your dog’s legs.

, Inactive dogs often develop bed sores or calluses in areas on their body that bear the most pressure and have the least padding. This problem gets worse if the dog is constantly lying on hard floors. Check your dog’s:


Elbows.
Points on the hip.
Shoulders.

, As your dog stops using his back legs as much, it is likely that he will lose some of the muscle mass in his back legs. This condition is called atrophy. Feel along your dog’s back legs for things like:


Being able to feel his bones more easily.
Less muscle definition and tone.
Sunken-in hips.

Understand why weight management is important.,
Control your dog’s calorie intake.,
Figure out how much food your dog should be getting.,
Feed your dog a metabolic diet.",How to Treat Arthritis in Dogs1," It is an unfortunate consequence of arthritis that dogs find it difficult to exercise, and are prone to gaining weight. However, obesity places an extra burden on joints, causes further damage to the joint surface, and overweight dogs are far more likely to be less mobile.


In the early stages of arthritis, losing weight can postpone the need for painkilling medication, and weight control should be a priority for any owner of a stiff dog.;
, Weight loss is achieved either by restricting calories, or by following diets that have been specifically developed for weight loss in animals, such as the Hills Metabolic diet. Most people are familiar with the idea of dieting, so let's consider this first.


For a dog to lose weight he must consume fewer calories than he burns in a day. One way to do this is to reduce his current food to the point that he starts to lose weight.

, First weigh the dog to establish a baseline. Now feed him 10% less than his current ration. Do this consistently for 2 weeks and then reweigh the dog.


If he has not lost weight, cut the ration by a further 10%, and repeat the process until weight reduction is achieved. However, this can result in small portions that leave the dog feeling unsatisfied.
Putting the dog on a prescription calorie controlled diet such as Hills RD or Purina OM can help. These foods are calorie restricted but high fiber. The fiber stays in the stomach longer and helps keep the dog feeling full.

, Another option is to switch your dog to the Hills Metabolic diet. This diet involves feeding your dog specially-developed food which claims to increase the dog's metabolic rate. Thus the dog burns his calories more quickly, and the need for strict weighing out of food is removed.

Look to see if your puppy has a hard time getting up after playing.,
See if your pup or young dog is hesitant to jump up on things.,
Watch your young dog to see if he has a wobbling, unsteady gait.,
Look at how your puppy stands and see if he puts more weight on his front legs.",How to Recognize Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Dogs2," If your puppy has hip dysplasia, you may begin to see signs of the condition as early as 5 to 10 months of age. In particular, you may notice that your puppy has a harder time moving around that they other puppies. He may:


Take shorter steps or have less of a stride.
Hold his back legs together and use his front legs more so that he can hop with his back legs, much like a bunny.

, While playing might be fine for your puppy, you should still keep an eye on him to see how he handles resting after play. A pup that has hip dysplasia will be more inclined to lie down for longer, and may act like he doesn’t want to get up after he has rested. This is because his hips become stiff when resting after activity., If your pup has hip dysplasia, he will most likely avoid jumping up on couches, your lap, etc. This is because his back legs are not as strong as his front legs, and it could hurt him to exert enough force on his back legs to help himself jump up on to things.


Pat the couch next to you. If your puppy looks like he wants to jump up but doesn’t, or tries to and then whines in pain, he may have hip dysplasia.

, As mentioned above, puppies and young dogs who have hip dysplasia have a harder time moving around than other dogs. This might lead to your dog developing an unsteady walk that could be described as:


Wobbling.
Weaving.
Tipping over a lot.

, Puppies and young dogs with hip dysplasia tend to stand with their rear legs slightly forward, so that their front legs can support more of their weight. This can lead to their forearms being much more developed than their hind legs.When your puppy is standing:


Check to see if his hind legs are pressed slightly forward.
Feel his forearms, which may be muscular, compared to his hind legs, which might feel bony.

Take your dog to the vet for a checkup if you notice signs of hip dysplasia.,
Feed your dog healthy food that will help his bones stay strong, but do not overfeed your dog.,
Make sure your dog does gentle exercises for short periods each day.,
Talk to your veterinarian about surgery as a last resort.",How to Recognize Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Dogs3," If you notice signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet right away and have your dog examined. There are ways to prevent the hip dysplasia from getting worse, as well as supplements and medications that your dog to take to keep him from feeling pain caused by the dysplasia.


Talk to your vet about giving your dog supplements before giving him medication. Some natural supplements can help your dog regain bone strength. These supplements include omega-3, antioxidants, and joint supplements.
Your vet may prescribe a medication for your dog. Make sure to know when and how often your dog should get this treatment.

, Studies have proven that obese dogs are more likely to develop hip dysplasia. Ask your vet for a recommended feeding guide that you can follow. Most dog foods have a recommended feeding amount, and following it is sufficient. Your dog can become obese when:


The recommended daily feed allowance is exceeded.
When your dog consumes high energy snacks but doesn’t get enough exercise.

, Gentle exercises means that the exercise does not make the hip dysplasia worse. In particular, swimming is a gentle exercise that can keep your dog fit and pain-free. Break your dog’s exercise up into short exercises each day.For example, going on two short 10-minutes walks, and then letting your dog swimming for 10 or 20 minutes, is better than taking your dog for a long 30 minute walk.

, There are several different surgical procedures available to correct your dog’s hip dysplasia. However, the surgery recommended for your dog will depend on his age, weight, and size. Some examples of different surgeries are:


Triple Pelvic Osteotomy, which is used on young puppies.
Total Hip Replacement is recommended for dogs with degenerative arthritis or chronic hip dysplasia.

Understand what nutraceuticals are.,
Be aware that there is debate about the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin.,
Consider giving your dog glucosamine and chondroitin.",How to Treat Arthritis in Dogs2," A nutraceutical is a food supplements with a drug-like action. Nutraceuticals are side-effect free and therefore safer than pharmaceuticals; they also have the advantage of being non-prescription.


Two nutraceuticals relevant to joint health are chondroitin and glucosamine. These two molecules are ""synergistic"", which means they have a greater effect when given together, than either does by itself.

, The theory behind glucosamine and chondroitin is that they provide the building blocks for cartilage repair and also improve the quality of joint fluid.


The aim is to nourish cartilage and optimize its health to protect against further chips and damage. They also help to increase the viscosity (or thickness) of joint fluid, which makes for better lubrication.
However, there is a great deal of debate among veterinary scientists as to whether glucosamine and chondroitin can live up to these claims. Despite this, a lot of animals do seem to benefit, and since the supplement is unlikely to do any harm, and if cost is not a factor, there is nothing to be lost by using this supplement.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin are marketed in palatable veterinary formulations, but human supplements are also suitable for use in dogs.


A typical dose for a dog under 10kg is 500mg of glucosamine and 400mg of chondroitin, daily. Overdose is unlikely.
In arthritic animals, these food supplements must be taken for life.

This redness affects the white of the eye, but it can also affect the lining of the eyelid or the surface of the third eyelid., Since conjunctivitis leads to irritation, the eyelids may be swollen. This can be the eyelids or any other soft tissue of your dog’s eyes. It may have a puffy, enlarged appearance., Another symptom of conjunctivitis is a discharge from the eye. This discharge may appear in different ways. Becuase of the discharge, the eye may have crust around it or stick together completely.It may be clear, which leads to dampness around the eyes.
The discharge may contain mucus or pus. This may be yellow-green, or a thick, tacky, and glue-like substance coming from the eye.

, Because conjunctivitis bothers a dog’s eyes and causes swelling, your dog may squint or blink a lot. This may be combined with swollen eyelids., Conjunctivitis causes irritation in the eye. Due to this, your dog may rub her face along the ground to try to relieve it. She may also paw at her eyes often., Conjunctivitis may present along with other symptoms not present in the eye. These secondary signs include sneezing, feeling lethargic, coughing, sickness, and diarrhea These secondary signs are connected to many other conditions. Therefore, it is imperative that you take your dog to the vet as soon as you notice any eye problems.

, Many people use the term conjunctivitis to mean an eye infection, although infection is only one of several possible causes of inflammation of the eye. The most common causes of conjunctivitis are:Infection
General illness, like a respiratory tract infection
Trauma to the eye
Dry Eye
Allergies
Irritants
Foreign Bodies
Autoimmune Disease
Eyelid Conformation

, If you believe your dog has conjunctivitis, you need to take her to the vet. The vet will be able to diagnose and treat your dog., When you take your dog to the vet, you should provide him with as much information about your dog as you can. The vet will be alert for things that might have caused the conjunctivitis, like signs of trauma, such as scratches on the skin from trees or a cat fight, the vaccination history, and use of aerosol sprays around the dog., The vet will give your dog a thorough physical examination of the eye. This is enough to reach a diagnosis of conjunctivitis. The vet will check to see if the symptoms are due to another illness. He will also be alert for contributing factors, such as hair rubbing on the eye, poor eyelid conformation, and patterns or trends the dog has of recurrent conjunctivitis problems.The vet will look for any foreign objects in the eye and any damage to the parts of the eye.
If you dog is squinting or blinking a lot, the vet may have to give her an anesthetic eyedrop to help numb the pain so he can perform the exam., The vet will want to rule out other issues it could be. Respiratory tract infections can have conjunctivitis as a side effect, so the vet would want to treat the infection in addition to the conjunctivitis.In rare cases, it might be a more severe problem, like corneal ulcers. The vet checks for this by placing a special orange dye called fluorescein into the eye. This stains damaged tissue on the surface of the cornea green. The vet may also wish to rule out dry eye., If no underlying cause is found, the vet will treat the eye against infection. He may prescribe antibiotic drops or ointment that will need to be applied to the eyes.In some cases, the vet will also prescribe an oral antibiotic.If the conjunctivitis is due to an underlying condition, like a respiratory tract infection, the vet will prescribe medicine for that.


If the patient is not better at the follow up exam five to seven days later, then the vet may swab the eye and send it away for culture. This tells the vet if bacteria are present, and which antibiotics will kill them. If no bacteria are present, then an allergy is more likely and the vet may prescribe steroid drops.
In severe cases, an underlying condition, like entropion, may require surgery.

, While you can’t always monitor what your dog gets in her eye, especially when she’s outside, you can still take measures to prevent conjunctivitis. Keeping your dog away from smoke and aerosol sprays, watching her while she plays, and trying to reduce situations where eye trauma might occur can help reduce the risk of your dog getting conjunctivitis.Since conjunctivitis is associated with canine distemper, making sure that your dog has up-to-date vaccinations may lower the risk.

Since corneal ulcers are painful, your first clue that there is a problem is that the dog’s eye will bother her because it hurts. A typical sign of a painful eye is rubbing at the eye.


Your dog might do this by rubbing the affected side of the face along the ground or rubbing at the eye with a paw.;
, In addition to rubbing her eye, your dog might squint with that eye, holding it partially closed. To determine if your dog is squinting, look at the dog straight on and compare the size of both eyes. If one eye looks smaller than the other, then the dog may be squinting.

, The discomfort and pain may also cause the eye to water. Sometimes the area beneath the affected eye may be wet or damp., If the dog has a corneal ulcer, the white of the eye may look reddened. Another sign is that the normally clear surface of the cornea may take on a cloudy or milky appearance.This might look like a film over the eye., A corneal ulcer may also cause a discharge from the eye. Your dog may exhibit a bloody discharge or a pus-filled discharge.This discharge may accumulate in the corner of the eye, nearest her nose.

, Because of the pain and discomfort, your dog may display a sensitivity to light. She may shy away from bright lights, or squint when in well lit areas.Your dog may also keep the affected eye closed., All of these signs are nonspecific. This means that reasons other than a corneal ulcer can cause similar symptoms, such as allergies, infection, trauma, or inflammation.


However, they are all signs of ocular discomfort so regardless of the cause, the dog needs to see a vet in order to diagnose the problem and be relieved of pain., If you have good eyesight, then it can be useful to closely inspect the surface of the eye to look for broken or shattered reflections. If a corneal ulcer is present, the smooth surface of the cornea will have a disruption. This may be visible in good light and look like a jump, shatter, or kink in a reflection.If the surface of the eye looks misty, frosted, or you can see jumps in reflections, then the eye needs checking by a vet.

, If you believe your dog has eye trauma, take her to the vet. The vet will look at both eyes to determine which eye is the problem, and how inflamed or sore it is.The vet will also examine the eyelids and eyelashes to look for anything that might be rubbing on the surface of the cornea, such as an inturned eyelash, which could rub and cause an ulcer.

, The definitive test for a corneal ulcer is a test which uses a special dye that changes color in the presence of damaged corneal epithelia. The dye, fluorescein, is orange but turns green and stains exposed epithelia.The vet will place a few drops of fluorescein into the eye, and wipe away the excess with dampened cotton wool. The eye is then observed both with and without magnification. A corneal ulcer will stain green, and will show the size, depth, and shape of the corneal ulcer.

, Sometimes pinpoint ulcers can be difficult to see, even with fluorescein. If this is the case, your vet can perform a UV light test on your dog. Your vet will switch off the lights so the room is dark, and then he’ll shining a UV light source onto the eye. This will make the fluorescein dye fluoresce, which makes it easier to see., Some ulcers heal spontaneously within five to seven days. Treatment is needed to prevent secondary infections, which could slow healing, and because it's not possible to know if the ulcer will heal on its own.The vet will probably give your dog eye drops containing antibiotics that should be used two to four times a day, or drops which form a protective bandage layer over the surface of the cornea.It is important to prevent the dog from rubbing her eye, so wearing a cone collar may be necessary. Keeping follow-up appointments is essential since the health of your dog's eye is at stake.
A small percentage of ulcers are resistant to treatment and may require a surgical procedure., The cornea is a clear membrane made up of layers in the eye that lets light pass unimpeded into the eye for it to be processed.An ulcer is damage to the outer layer of the cornea. Untreated, this can erode deeper and if it eats through one of the inner layers, the eye may perforate.A shallow ulcer is the equivalent of a scrape or scuff to your skin. The deeper the ulcer, the more layers are damaged.

, Certain conditions can cause your dog to get a corneal ulcer. Scratches and other injury to the eye is the most common reason ulcers arise. Ingrown eyelashes, dirt and other material in the eye, and chemicals can injure the eye and cause an ulcer. Smoke and infection also can cause corneal ulcers., Since eye trauma can happen to any dog, you need to watch your dog in certain conditions. Dogs that get excitable easily can be at risk of injuring their eye. Dogs that fight, especially cats, can get an ulcer. Dogs who spend a lot of time outdoors running through underbrush, like hunting dogs, can injure their eyes., All dogs can get a corneal ulcer. However, certain breeds with prominent eyes and flat, smooshed faces are at a higher risk because of the tendency of eyelashes to irritate their corneas. The breeds at most risk are:Pugs
Bulldog
Boston Terrier
Boxer
Shih Tzu
Pekingese

Learn how much to feed your dog.,
Avoid offering too many treats or giving into begging.,
Try offering supplements.",How to Prevent Arthritis in Dogs1," Dogs that are overweight are at a higher risk of developing arthritis. Carrying extra body weight will place extra stress on the joints and bones of your dog, possibly resulting in arthritis. Make sure you are feeding your dog a healthy amount of food and that its appropriate weight is maintained.The amount of food that you feed your dog will be based on its size and activity levels.
Older dogs may not need to eat as much as younger dogs.
Exactly how much you need to feed your dog will be unique to your specific dog. Talk with your veterinarian to learn more.;
, Although it can be hard to say no to a dog looking for a treat, holding back is actually a better idea. By controlling your dog's level of food intake, you will help prevent it from becoming overweight and lower its chances of developing arthritis. Always make your dog's meal times exact and controlled to help keep your dog lean and healthy.Only feed your dog at meal times.
Avoid using too many treats when training your dog. Treats used for training should be very small, being just large enough to give your dog a taste.

, Some studies have shown that certain dietary supplements may help in the fight against diabetes. These supplements are believed to target joint health, restore lost cartilage and hold back the symptoms of arthritis. Try providing some of these supplements to your dog to help prevent arthritis:Glucosamine
Fatty acids, such as Omgea-3 fatty acid.

Understand what physiotherapy refers to.,
Massage your dog to help relieve pain caused by arthritis.,
Learn some specific massage techniques.,
Try passive mobilization.,
Apply heat to your dog’s arthritic limbs.,
Talk to your vet about transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS).",How to Treat Arthritis in Dogs3," Physiotherapy is the treatment of pain based on physical manipulation and non-pharmaceutical means. Massage, passive exercise, transdermal electrical stimulation (TNS), and heat therapy are all physiotherapy techniques than can be used at home., Massage therapy stimulates the muscles around an arthritic joint and increases pressure within the tissue. This pushes fluid out into the blood and lymph vessels, and replacement interstitial fluid is drawn into the vacuum.


This helps remove toxic irritants that have built up as a results of injury and inflammation, and irritate the nerve endings. In return, new nutrients soak the area and encourage repair of inflamed joints and sprained muscles.
An animal with sore joints has tense, stiff muscles and the tension in the muscles further compresses the joint, making inflamed surfaces rub together, and causing more pain. Massage helps the muscles to relax and stimulates the release of endorphins - a natural painkiller with a similar chemical composition to morphine.

, If, for example, the hip joint is painful, to massage the hip you should work from the extremity upwards (imagine massaging fluid back towards the heart).


Move the flat of your palm in a rocking motion, applying pressure with the heel of the hand to the thigh muscles, working upwards towards the heart.
Slow and gentle movements are soothing, whilst hard and fast movements are stimulating, so for pain relief, one motion every five seconds is ideal.
Massage the affected limb for 10-20 minutes, two to three times a day.

, Mobilization is the act of passively extending a limb with the aim of keeping the muscle conditioned, and the joint mobile. The theory behind mobilization is to stop the cycle of pain that restricts joint movement, which leads to a further loss of movement, and a downward cycle of limb under-use.


Again, taking the example of an arthritic hip, passive mobilization involves gently stretching the affected hind leg backwards, away from the head. The owner can do this with the dog in a standing, or lying down position. If both hips are sore it is better to lie the dog down since he will be uncomfortable taking extra weight on the opposite hip when one leg is raised.
To passively stretch the left hip, lay the dog on his right side, with the left leg uppermost. Slide the left hand in front of the thigh halfway down the thigh bone, and cup the cranial muscles in the left palm. Apply gentle but firm pressure in order to push the thigh backwards so that the dog's paw moves backwards. Do not force the movement, and stop if the dog gets uncomfortable.
Hold this extended position for around 40 seconds and then release. Try to do this for two, ten minute sessions a day. This helps to keep the joint supple and is pain relieving.

, The application of heat helps to dilate blood vessels and stimulate the circulation. In turn, this helps to remove noxious toxins that irritate pain receptor nerves.


A simple method is to use a wheat bag, the sort you heat up in a microwave. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to heat the bag, and with the dog lying down with the arthritic joint exposed, rest the warmed wheat bag over the joint.
Leave it there for 10-15 minutes, and then follow with some passive movement exercises.

, Transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) can be performed at home by an owner, provided they have access to basic training and the appropriate equipment.


This involves the application of a small electrical current to the skin in order to numb sensory nerves and block pain transmission. This is achieved by stimulating delta fibers which release enkephalin in the spinal cord, which in turn reduces sensitivity to pain. One twenty minute session can reduce pain for up to 24 hours.
The TNS machine is a small hand held battery-powered box attached to two electrodes, which are placed in contact with the dog's skin. Pain is blocked downstream from the electrodes, so to treat hip pain, place one electrode either side of the spine approximately six inches higher than the pelvis.

Give your dog NSAIDs to relieve his pain.,
Try relieving your dog’s pain with aspirin.,
Talk to your vet about the proper dosage for Paracetamol.,
Talk to your vet about stem cell therapy.",How to Treat Arthritis in Dogs4," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescription painkillers that reduce inflammation. They work by inhibiting the ""bad"" COX-2 enzymes that mediate joint inflammation, while allowing the ""good"" COX-1 enzymes that maintain blood flow to the kidney and stomach lining to work as normal.


These drugs have a high safety margin when used correctly, are less likely than other painkillers to cause potentially nasty side effects such as gastric ulceration, and bleeding disorders. NSAIDs commonly prescribed by vets are meloxicam (Metacam), carprofen (Rimadyl), and robenacoxib (Onsior).The maintenance dose of metacam is 0.05mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. The oral suspension contains 1.5mg/ml and so a typical 30kg Lab requires 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz) daily with his food.

, Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) provides mild to moderate pain relief. However, long-term use is associated with gastric ulceration, especially when given on an empty stomach. This happens because aspirin reduces blood flow to the gut lining, stomach, and kidney.


Aspirin should never be given in addition to a NSAID medication. When combined, both drugs are even more likely to cause gastric ulceration, with serious consequences.
If no other pain relief is available, a healthy dog can be given aspirin in doses of 10mg/kg given twice a day, with or after food. Aspirin commonly comes in 300mg tablets, so a typical dose for a 30kg Labrador would be one tablet twice a day with food.

, Another option for moderate pain relief is Paracetamol (Acetaminophen). However, take care when using this medication because exceeding the recommended dose overloads the liver with a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-aminobenzoquinonimine, which can cause liver damage, and ultimately liver failure.


A vet-approved prescription medication is preferred, but if no other option for pain relief is available, give Paracetamol with food and observe the correct dosage. The dose is 10mg/kg by mouth, twice a day, with or after food.
Most tablets are 500mg and so a 30kg Labrador can take a maximum of three-fifths of a tablet twice daily. If in doubt, always give a lower dose and for small dogs, consider using the pediatric suspension.

, An exciting new option for the treatment of arthritis is stem cell therapy. This differs from previous generations of therapy in that the principle is to encourage repair of damaged tissue, rather than merely treating the discomfort.


This therapy involves harvesting fat from the dog under anesthetic, extracting stem cells from the fat sample, activating the stem cells in a laboratory, and then injecting the activated stem cells into the joints.A few veterinary clinics are now able to offer this treatment on site. Many animals are so improved a few weeks after treatment that they no longer need to take pain medication.

Create a comfortable environment for your dog.,
Provide plenty of exercise for your dog.,
Avoid over-exercising your dog.,
Keep your dog's nails trimmed.",How to Prevent Arthritis in Dogs2," Stress on joints is a contributing factor to the development of arthritis in dogs. Your dog's home environment may be tough on its joints, increasing the risk of arthritis. Make sure you are helping your dog to care for its joints in your home and daily life.Bare floors can be slippery for your dog to walk on and can cause joint stress. Make sure you provide some carpeting for them to walk on.
Jumping in and out of cars, beds or other areas around the house can hurt joints. Try providing a small ramp for your dog to use instead.
Raised food and water bowls can make it easier for your dog to eat and drink.

, Giving your dog regular exercise can help prevent arthritis from developing later in its life. Exercise can help keep your dog strong and avoid injuries that could turn into a case of arthritis. Regular activity can also help cut down on your dog's body weight, reducing stress on its joints. Always make sure you're going for plenty of walks and getting in some good play time to help keep arthritis at bay.Taking your dog for a swim can be a great low-impact form of exercise.
Try going for regular walks with your dog.
Playing fetch is a classic way for your dog to get in some good running.
Always stop exercise if your dog looks tired, starts dragging or shows signs of discomfort or pain.

, Although regular exercise will improve the health of your dog, it can have too much of a good thing. Exercising too much or too intensely will be stressful on your dog's joints and may even cause injuries. Stress and injuries will make it more likely that your dog will develop arthritis later on in its life. Always monitor your dogs activity levels and make sure they are getting in a safe amount of exercise.


Injuries and overexertion will increase the chances of arthritis occurring in your dog.
A dog that sits around all week and plays hard only on the weekend is at risk for exercise related injury.
Exercise should stop if your dog looks tired, sore or in pain.
Overdoing exercise on a daily basis will also increase the chances of an injury occurring.

, A simple way that you can help keep your dog arthritis free is to trim its nails regularly. Nails that are too long may cause your dog to walk differently than it normally would, subtly adding more stress to their joints. This stress can result in an increased risk of arthritis. Regularly trim your dog's nails to help keep its gait natural and prevent arthritis.You can trim your dog's nails at home with a pair of specially designed dog nail clippers.
Your vet will help you trim your dog's nails if you are unsure of how to do so.
Many professional pet grooming services will trim your dog's nails for you.

Place extra padding in your dog’s bed.,
Clean your dog’s bed regularly.,
Keep your dog’s environment warm.,
Create easy access to the food and water bowls.,
Make your floors less slippery.,
Use ramps.",How to Greatly Improve the Life of a Dog with Arthritis1," Your dog may have a hard time being comfortable in their bed with joints that are stiff and painful because of arthritis. Putting some extra padding in the bed will make life a little better for your dog.For extra padding, add some extra thick blankets on top of or below the bed. You could also purchase foam pads at your local pet store.
Memory foam beds are great for dogs with arthritis.The foam will conform to your dog each time they lie down, preventing painful pressure points.;
, Dogs with arthritis may not be able to get up quickly enough when they need to go to the bathroom. If you notice your dog is soiling their bed, clean the bedding frequently with hot water. Also, clean your dog’s backside with dog-safe waterless shampoo so the fur doesn’t stay soiled.A clean and dry bed will make your dog's life better.

, Heat can make stiff and achy joints feel a little better. Keep your dog’s environment at room temperature, or even a little warmer.Also, make sure your dog’s bed is away from drafty doors or windows. In the winter, these drafts can make your dog feel cold and increase their discomfort.


Place a heating pad under your dog’s bed.Position the heating pad so your dog can move away if they get too warm.
Look for dog bed heating pads at your local pet store. You could also ask your vet for heating pad recommendations.
Look for heating pads that have an automatic cut off.

, Dogs with arthritis may struggle to get to their water bowls, increasing the risk of dehydration. To prevent dehydration, place your dog’s water bowl closer to their bed. Place the food bowl closer to the bed as well.Consider getting a raised platform for the food and water bowl.The platform would keep your dog from having to stoop down to eat and drink.

, Life may not be much fun for your dog if they slip and slide on your floors. For the non-carpeted areas of your home, make it easier for your dog to walk around. Here are some items that will give your dog more traction:Area rugs and carpet runners
Non-slip strips for your stairs
Non-slip booties or socks (available online or at a pet store)
Toe grips on your dog’s nails (available online or at a pet store)

, Did your dog like to cuddle with you on the couch or go for car rides? With arthritis, your dog won’t be able to jump onto the couch or into the car like they used to. Ramps will help your dog get to where they want to go more easily.Look for ramps at your pet store.


Being able to continue cuddling with you on the couch and going for car rides will greatly improve your dog’s life.

Joints are a wonder because they allow for a wide range of movements in a feat of natural engineering. A joint is formed when two or more bones meet in a movable joint. The important structures to worry about are the bone, the cartilage which lines the joint, the ligaments which hold the bones together, and the tendons with attached muscle which pull on the bone and causes them to move.


Lubrication is provided by a viscous substance known as synovial fluid, which also supplies nutrients to the cartilage layer. This fluid is produced by the synovial membrane lining the joint capsule and the ligaments. Both of these are important structures which basically hold the joint or bones together.;
, A joint problem can develop when any one of the pieces in the joint is damaged. For example, when the cartilage lining becomes chipped, a ligament snaps, or a muscle sprained, you dog will suffer from a joint injury.


There are certain breeds that are predisposed to joint problems. Labradors, golden retrievers, and German shepherds have a genetic tendency to hip and elbow dysplasia, which can lead to early arthritis. Giant breeds such as Leonbergers, St. Bernards, and Great Danes can grow too quickly and damage their soft bones in the process, leading to joint disease., The cardinal sign your dog has a joint problem is pain, which often shows itself as limping. If your dog suddenly starts limping, try to minimize his activity. He may also show other signs, such as awkward movements, difficulty standing, swollen joints, refusal to jump, an aversion to petting, and a bad temper.


If he has pain enough to limp or have any other symptom, further running, chasing, or walking is only going to cause more inflammation, more pain, and make the problem worse. You should also not continue to play fetch or any other game with your dog. , If your dog becomes suddenly lame, bring him home and keep him rested. If the dog shows lameness during a walk, depending on the severity of the lameness, carry him home. Do not give medications from your medicine cabinet. If he needs pain relief, contact your veterinarian. If you know which joint he has injured, try putting an ice pack on it for 10 minutes.


If he is too big to pick up, put him on the lead and encourage him to walk slowly.
If he remains lame, especially if there is no improvement after 24 hours, seek veterinary attention. Keep him rested until he's been checked out. , There are some apparent symptoms of stiffness of the muscles and joints, which is a common problem, especially in elderly pets. Pet owners often see their pet feels stiff or struggle with joint aches when they walk with a stiff gait or limp, become less active, or struggle to get up. Other symptoms are very difficult stretching, reluctance to exercise and stopping on walks, and difficulty in climbing stairs.


Some animals will also lick painful joints, making the skin infected and sore. Cold mornings after long periods of rest are often the most difficult for pets with joint or muscle problems. It can take some time for your pet to get going during these mornings., For acute (sudden) injuries, rest is essential. However, for older dogs that are stiff with arthritis it is helpful to keep them moving. If they do not exercise there is a chance their joints will seize up. However, it is critical to find the right level of exercise for your pet. This is done on a case by case basis and your veterinarian is best placed to advise you. However, try to keep the amount of exercise constant. Exercising the same amount of time every day can help with pain management and weight loss. The exercise will help encourage movement and flexibility of the limbs. Too much exercise is not recommended and too little will cause greater stiffness.


For example, do not go for 10 minute walks during the week and then make up for it with a 2 hour walk at the weekend. The dog will seize up on Monday morning and be really sore.
Several short walks a day are ideal and are better than one long walk., If you want to exercise your dog in another way, you can swim your dog. Swimming is excellent exercise for you stiff dog because the physical activity conditions his muscles and gets the joints moving. It is different from walking, however, because the joints don't have to take the dog's weight. Make sure you work with your dog because there is more to hydrotherapy than just putting your dog in the nearest swimming pool.


Not all dogs are great swimmers and he may panic and drown. It is also not terribly hygienic. If you can, attend a special canine hydrotherapy unit that is staffed by a vet tech or a veterinary physiotherapist. These pools usually have a harness so your dog is supported in the water and is at no risk of drowning.
The water temperature is carefully controlled so it is pleasant for the dog. Plus, the water is disinfected. The most sophisticated pools use water jets that brush against your dog's legs to stimulate paddling movements., If your dog's joint problems are due to weight, your vet will suggest that he lose weight. Helping your dog lose weight helps with mobility of arthritic and problem joints. An overweight dog has to carry more weight, which places additional strain on sore legs. For some dogs in the early stages of arthritis, going on a diet and getting down to a normal, healthy weight makes the difference between needing to start on medication or not.


If you notice that your dog likes to overeat, don't leave out kibble for him to eat all day. You can also limit the amount of food he eats per day, especially if he eats multiple meals of canned food. You can also buy canned and dry food specifically developed to help your dog lose weight.
Exercising your dog more will help make him lose weight. If his joints hurt too much, slowly increase the amount you walk him every day. Each little bit will help him gain strength and shed pounds.
Talk to your vet about other a safe and effective way to shed those unwanted pounds., Talk to your vet about physiotherapy treatments for your dog. If your dog is arthritic or has joint problems, he will need to warm up his joints before he starts working. Those stiff joints may even suffer further damage if he doesn't warm up before going for a walk. Try to get into the habit of doing your vet recommended passive physiotherapy with your dog at home before embarking on the walk.


Vets typically will recommend passive physiotherapy, which includes certain kinds of activities. Encourage the dog to lie on his side. Gently rub all the muscles of both uppermost limbs, working one leg at a time. Then push on his paw and gently compress the leg so that all the joints bend up but only far enough that you don't cause pain. Next, gently pull on the paw to extend the leg.
Repeat this 10-20 times for each leg. Have the dog roll over and do the same on the opposite side. Then he can go for his morning walk., There are environmental changes you can make to help with your dog's joint pain and stiffness. Many older, arthritic dogs stiffen up overnight because their muscles and joint go cold. The joints can rebel against the cold start and the dog is initially stiff. To reduce this, keep the pet warm overnight. Try strategies such as giving him a heated bed or a bed he can snuggle up in and keeps his joints warm.


If he'll let you, cover him with a blanket at night and make sure he's not in any drafts. Try to raise his bed off the floor slightly., If your dog has one or two troublesome joints, consider using heat packs. Get a microwaveable heat pack and apply the warm pack to the affected joint. Be careful not to burn the dog. If the pack seems too hot, wrap it in a towel before laying it on the joint. To assess the heat pack to see if it's safe for the dog, hold it against your own skin for a minute or two.


It should be pleasantly warm rather than uncomfortably hot. If you have the urge to remove the pack ahead of two minutes because it feels hot, then the pack is too warm. Add an extra layer of insulation by wrapping it in a towel.If your dog is in too much pain or squirming around a lot, talk calmly to your dog to reassure him. The heat will eventually do its work and make him feel better., Massage has a very beneficial effect by increasing the blood supply to muscles as well as conditioning and strengthening them. Muscles support the joints, so helping the muscles will help the joints. You should have a consultation with a qualified veterinary physiotherapist who can work out a massage regime designed for you individual dog. She will demonstrate how to give the massage so you are confident enough to do it at home.


Always seek professional advice before starting massage. It could be possible to do more harm than good if you manipulated a limb in an inappropriate manner., There are some over the counter joint supplements that you may want to give to your dog to help with joint pain. Ask your vet about glucosamine, an amino sugar that is the starting point for the production of new cartilage and is fundamental to maintaining joint function. You can also give him chondroitin, a major component of cartilage that maintains the spongy texture. This is essential to absorb shock as well as nourish and lubricate the joints.


Glucosamine and chondroitin have a synergistic effect. This means that giving both together in the same supplement has a greater effect than you would expect. Look for a supplement that contains both glucosamine and chondroitin.
Add cod liver oil to his food to help with the stiffness. However, CLO absorbs fat soluble vitamins, so giving it daily robs the dog of valuable nutrition. It is best to give CLO every other day so that his general health doesn't suffer.
You can also give your dog omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to help with the inflammation of arthritis.Always consult your vet before giving your dog any supplements.

, If your dog's situation is not improving with diet, exercise, and other methods, talk to your vet about medication. It is not the first choice for treatment, but it can be helpful if your dog is still in pain after trying other methods. Medication relieves pain and also reduces inflammation, which can decrease the chance of further damage. The drugs most widely prescribed are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, known as NSAIDs.


These drugs do not contain steroids, reduce inflammation, and inhibit pathways that cause pain. They have been through extensive safety trials and are safe for your dogs. NSAIDs are relatively safe drugs, especially when the correct dose is given with food in your dog's stomach.Your veterinarian may also want to check your dog's kidney function prior to starting treatment. Many medications are excreted through the kidney, which means they may build up in the blood stream if the kidneys aren't working properly. The main side effect is gastric ulceration, the first sign of which is vomiting.
If your dog is prescribed a NSAID and he starts vomiting, stop the medication and contact your vet for advice.Always consult your vet before giving your dog any medications that are not specifically prescribed.

Aspirin helps to relieve pain and inflammation. You should not give your dog aspirin every day, only on relatively rare occasions.Give an otherwise healthy, hydrated dog 10mg per every kilogram of weight, twice a day, with or after food. For example, a typical dose for a 30kg Labrador would be one 300 mg tablet twice a day with food.
Always give aspirin with or after food because taking aspirin with an empty stomach on a regular basis can lead to gastrointestinal problems like ulcers.
Never give aspirin to a dog who is taking steroid medication or other NSAID medications.;
, This over-the-counter medication gives mild to moderate pain relief. It is a part of the NSAID (non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs) family and will also keep your dog’s joints from becoming inflamed. You can give your dog:


10 mg per kg of weight, by mouth, twice a day, with or after food. For example, most acetaminophen comes in 500 mg tablets, so a 30 kg Labrador could take three-fifths of a tablet twice a day, with food.
The side effects are similar to aspirin. Always make sure that your dog has eaten and is hydrated before giving him this medication, because acetaminophen can cause liver damage and ulcers. Never go over the recommended dose.


, As stated above, NSAIDs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If your dog is in moderate to severe pain and needs relief every day, you should go to a veterinarian to get a prescription for strong NSAIDs or opioids (see Step 4) because these medications are safe for long term use. Prescription NSAIDs fight pain and inflammation but have less negative effects on the stomach, liver and kidneys than over-the-counter NSAIDs do.The most commonly prescribed NSAIDs are meloxicam (Metacam), carprofen (Rimadyl), and robenacoxib (Onsior).
The maintenance dose of metacam is 0.05 mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. For example, the oral suspension metacam is 1.5 mg/ml and so a 30 kg Lab requires 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz) daily on his food.

, If your dog is in severe pain, your vet will most likely prescribe an opioid. This type of medication is like morphine but does not sedate your dog or cause stomach irritation. They can be taken with NSAIDs without any ill effects.


Most veterinarians prescribe a dose of 2 mg/kg, twice daily. Tramadol, the most common opioid comes in 50 mg or 100 mg and the capsules should not be split, so Tramadol may not be an option for small dogs because you cannot give a low enough dose.
Too high a dose will result in profound sedation, which usually wears off after 6 – 8 hours.

, When a dog has arthritis, it can be hard for him to move around and maintain a healthy weight. However, the extra weight can actually make the arthritis worse, so it’s important to help your dog with weight control. Cut back the amount of food your dog gets every day and you will most likely see a drastic improvement in his condition.In fact, it has been proventhat actually helping your dog lose that burden of extra weight can relieve their arthritis so much that they don’t need to take medication anymore. It is good to keep your dog on medication while he loses weight, but when he gets back to a healthy weight, you can talk to your vet about taking him off medication.

, While an arthritic dog may have a hard time walking, it is still important to make sure that he gets regular low-impact exercise because getting no exercise can actually make his joints stiffer. Low-impact exercise helps joint fluid to circulate (keeping your dog flexible), promotes good blood circulation, and keeps up muscle strength.Your dog should exercise for the same length of time every day. A good baseline amount of exercise is 30 minutes of walking, swimming, or running every day. Swimming in particular is good because it gets your dog moving but takes the pressure off of his hips and joints.

, Heat therapy is great for getting rid of pain in a specific spot. Heat helps keep synovial fluid circulating (so that your dog can feel limber) and reduces the build-up of inflammatory chemicals within the joint (which makes your dog’s joints stiff).You can provide your dog with heat therapy by:


Getting your dog a heated sleeping pad. Heated sleeping pads both provide heat for your dog, so he is less stiff in the morning, while also cushioning his arthritic joints, making him more comfortable.
Cover your dog with a blanket on chill nights. The blanket will keep your dog warm, which will help keep his joints from stiffening up.
Get a microwaveable wheat bag. These bags can be heated in the microwave and then placed on the spot where your dog experiences the most pain and stiffness.

, Smooth hardwood floors can pose a challenge to an arthritic dog because he cannot get a good grip as he walks. Because of this, you might want to consider putting a grippy surface, such as the no-slip grip pads you put under rugs, on hardwood floors to help your dog move around.


It is particularly helpful to put carpeting or grip pads on slippery stairs if your dog goes up and down the stairs. This will help him to get up and down without falling.

, You can take the strain off sore joints by offering your dog a ramp to access the car or another level of your house. Ramps make it easier to get up and down stairs because they take the pressure off of your dog’s arthritic joints.Some dogs will ignore their pain in an effort to follow you upstairs at night, so it might be a good idea to put up a barrier at the bottom of your stairs if your dog wants to come up but you have not purchased non-skid carpeting or a ramp yet.

, Sometimes, dogs can get arthritis in their necks and spines. If your dog has this problem, you can make his life a lot easier by putting his food and water bowl on a short table or elevating it in some other way. When you do this, he will be able to access his food and water much more easily without having to put painful pressure on his neck and spine.

, Arthritis is a condition that is best treated early on. Since it cannot be cured, arthritis will need to be managed and prevented from worsening. Catching the symptoms of arthritis early on can go a long way in keeping your dog comfortable later in life. Check out some of these common symptoms of arthritis in dogs to help you spot any arthritis trouble in your own dog:Stiffness
Dragging an arm or leg or using some limbs more than others
Signs of pain
Inflexible joints
Being nervous about jumping up or climbing down stairs or steps

, If you suspect that your dog has arthritis or want to learn more about how to prevent it, speak with your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will be able to suggest methods that you can use to help keep your dog healthy and happy. They may also be able to prescribe certain medications and treatments that could prevent the worsening of any arthritis symptoms that may already be present.

Pay attention to the shape of your dog’s back.,
Look at how your dog walks.,
Check if your dog is hopping rather than walking.,
Notice if your dog doesn’t want to hop into the car or climb up the stairs.,

Allow your vet to analyze your dog’s muscle development.,
Let your vet examine your dog’s back leg joints.,
Allow your vet to look at the range of motion of your dog’s hips.,
Get an x-ray of your dog done while he is under a general anesthetic.,
Make sure your vet does an Ortolani test on your dog.,
Become familiar with the basic anatomy of the hip.,
Be ware of the factors necessary to avoid pain in your dog’s hips.,
Think about restricting your dog’s diet to combat hip dysplasia.",How to Detect Canine Hip Dysplasia," If your dog is experiencing low-grade hip pain, subtle signs like your dog’s posture and the shape of their back may be one way to detect hip dysplasia.If your dog suffers from hip dysplasia, they may have a sloping back when they stand. Their back may be arched and their pelvis may be tucked underneath them, giving the impression of a back sloping down to the pelvis, rather than a flat, level back.
Many pups who inherit hip dysplasia from their parents will show signs of the condition at less than 12 months old, so if your dog develops a sloping back at a young age, this may be a warning sign.;
, If your dog is taking short, mincing steps with their back legs, rather than long, easy strides, this may indicate he is experiencing pain or discomfort in his hips. One of the consequences of hip dysplasia is premature arthritis, so younger dogs with this condition may experience issues usually associated with older dogs, such as inflammation, pain, and bone remodeling.Your dog may also develop a habit of transferring weight onto his front legs to relieve any pain in his back legs and leaning forward, so the muscles of his forequarters will be more developed than the muscles of his rear end.

, Some dogs with two sore hips will “bunny hop” instead of walk. Rather than move each leg independently and stepping with alternating legs, your dog may move his two back legs as one unit and “hop” forward.

, Dogs with hip issues may be reluctant or unable to perform activities that require propulsive power from their back legs like climbing stairs, jumping into a car, or leaping over objects.

, Because the signs of hip dysplasia in young dogs are not very obvious, it can be difficult for you as the owner to realize something isn’t right until the dog goes completely lame. When your dog displays lameness, this may appear to be short term injury but in fact may be a more serious issue like hip dysplasia. To be certain, take your dog to the vet to get tested.

, Older dogs may have been lame at a young age and then recovered, only to have other hip problems develop later in life. If your dog has a history of hip issues, they may have hip dysplasia but missed being diagnosed or were misdiagnosed.

, Older dogs with hip dysplasia may be stiff or have discomfort after lots of running around and playing.


They may also have hind leg lameness that clears up after they rest, only for it to reoccur once they start using their muscles and exerting themselves.

, While older dogs have many other possible health issues, properly diagnosing hip dysplasia in an older dog will ensure they live a less painful and much longer life.

, Your vet will stand directly behind your dog as he walks and runs. She is looking at the degree of his pelvic roll and if one hip joint bobs up and down more than the other. She will also look at your dog run and walk from the side to look a the length of his stride, whether the hind leg stride matches the front stride, and if both back legs strike out at the same distance or if one leg takes smaller steps.

, Your vet will be checking if your dog’s thigh muscles are well-developed or if they are weak and it is easy to feel the bones beneath the skin.


If a young dog has weak muscle development, this means he is not exercising as much as he should because he is likely uncomfortable or in pain.

, Your vet will also look at each joint in your dog’s back legs to ensure the pain is localized to your dog’s hip joints. Just because a dog has hind leg lameness, this doesn’t mean the problem lies in his hips, as a sprained toe, a sore ankle, or a damaged ligament may be the source of the issue.


Once your vet is assured the other joints are sound and there is no heat or swelling on other joints, she can focus her exam on your dog’s hips.

, Your vet will extend your dog’s leg backward to test how sensitive his hip joint is. If your dog pulls against this movement, he clearly has a sore hip, as he will want to keep it as still as possible and not move it to avoid pain.


A dog with supple, healthy hips will allow the leg to be moved with almost balletic flexibility, while a dog with a dysplastic hip will move stiffly. The range of motion of a normal hip is in all directions, so a dog with hip dysplasia will have limited to no range of motion.
In severely dysplastic hips, there be the sound or impression of bone clunking against bone, as the vet manipulates the hip joints. This occurs because the joint space is uneven, allowing the bone to literally rub against another bone.

, As your dog’s hips will be too sore to tolerate the legs being held in position to get the correct view for an x-ray, a general anesthetic will be used to get an ideal position of his hips.The vet will check for landmarks on the radiograph like the angle of the femoral neck, making sure the femoral head (ball joint) joins onto the shaft of the femur (thigh bone) on a short neck, at an angle of 45 degrees. A dog with dysplasia will have an almost straight femur heading into the femoral head. A healthy joint sits deep in the socket, so another indication of a poor hip is the ball barely sits in the socket.
The vet will also check that there is even joint space between the ball and the socket and that the ball joint is rounded rather than square. Dysplastic hips often resemble a square peg in a round hole, with a block-shaped femoral head or ball sitting in a scoop shaped socket.

, Confirming hip dysplasia based on how your dog’s hips look on an x-ray is problematic, as an x-ray does not illustrate the degree of pain or lameness your dog might be experiencing. So make sure an Ortolani test is done by your vet in conjunction with an x-ray.Under anesthesia, your dog will lie on his back with his thigh bone pointing towards the ceiling and his knee flexed. The vet will put pressure on the femur via your dog’s knee. If your dog’s hip is unstable, the hip bone will slip slightly out of joint, sometimes heard or felt as a “clunk”. The vet will then press the hip toward the pelvis, relocating the hip with another “clunk”.
These “clunks” and the hip’s ability to dislocate out of the joint indicates the hip joint is not being supported properly by your dog’s ligaments and muscles, a clear sign of hip dysplasia.

, A clear sense of hip anatomy will help to better grasp how hip dysplasia can occur in your dog.


The hip is a ball and socket joint. The femur (thigh bone) ends in a ball (the femoral head) which sits in a boney cup (the acetabulum) in the pelvis. Much like a ball bearing running smoothly on a track, the perfect hip joint moves smoothly because the cup (acetabulum) is the perfect fit for the ball (femoral head).

, Even joint space, where the gap between the femoral head and the acetabulum is even all the way around and does not narrow or flare wider in certain areas, as well as the correct angle of the femoral head, all lead to healthy, pain free hips.


Maintaining a perfect angle of 45 degrees where the femoral head joins onto the femur is important because when your dog stands, they will transfer weight up the shaft of the femur to the femoral head. If the angle is too straight, which usually occurs in hip dysplasia, your dog’s body weight will not spread evenly through the joint.
Another important factor is a tight soft tissue support network. A combination of muscles, ligaments, and tendons hold your dog’s bones in their correct alignment and allow for pain free movement. If this soft tissue network is too slack, which occurs in hip dysplasia, it allows the bones to move around too freely and they can bump and grind against one another an unhealthy way, leading to serious pain for your pup.

, Studies have shown that a restricted diet for susceptible breeds can lead to a 46 percent decrease in cases of hip dysplasia. Feeding dogs to lessen their weight can also lessen the stress on their hip joints.However, a restricted diet does not alter the genetic predisposition to hip dysplasia found in larger dog breeds."

Talk with your vet about pain medications.,
Discuss the need for supplements.,
Administer treatments as prescribed.,
Look for bad side effects.",How to Greatly Improve the Life of a Dog with Arthritis2," Arthritis pain can make life hard for your dog. If your dog looks to be in pain (stiff body posture, grouchiness), take them to your vet for medical treatment.The vet will recommend medications to relieve the pain and reduce joint inflammation.


Medications called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for dogs with arthritis.Steroids also relieve pain and reduce inflammation; however, they can have serious long-term side effects.Do not give your dog any pain-relieving medications without first talking to your vet. Over-the-counter or human pain relievers can do more harm than good in dogs., Some supplements, such as glucosamine plus chondroitin and omega-3 fatty acids, can relieve inflammation and help promote joint repair.With less inflammation and healthier joints, your dog will be able to move around better and have an improved quality of life.


Purchase these supplements through your vet.

, When your vet prescribes the treatments, make sure you follow the prescription instructions. Following the instructions will ensure your dog’s pain is reduced. When your dog is in less pain, their quality of life will improve.


Many pain medications and supplements for dogs are administered by mouth. Pill pockets, which are available at your local pet store, can help you give your dog their pills without much fuss.
Some pain medications are given by injection.If your vet recommends an injectable medication, they will usually do the injections.
If you have any questions about how to administer the treatments, ask your vet.

, Pain medications can have side effects that can make your dog sick. If you notice your dog isn’t tolerating the medication very well, contact your vet. Look for the following signs that your dog’s medication is making them sick:Decreased appetite
Diarrhea
Dark and tarry feces, which indicates intestinal bleeding

Spend quality time with your dog.,
Walk your dog in a doggie wheelchair.,
Massage your dog.,
Perform physical therapy.",How to Greatly Improve the Life of a Dog with Arthritis3," Dogs love companionship. Quality time with your dog will be very important, especially now that arthritis has made physical activity a little more difficult. Some ideas for quality time include:Petting your dog when they are in their bed
Reading a book with your dog when they are on the couch with you
Gently rolling a ball that your dog can easily retrieve

, Doggie wheelchairs are great for dogs that cannot use their back legs due to severe arthritis or other orthopedic injuries. The wheelchair will prop up your dog’s backend, making walking a little easier. Having the confidence to walk will improve your dog’s life and help them enjoy their daily walks.Ask your vet for recommendations on doggie wheelchair brands.
Your vet can also help you learn how to put your dog’s back end in the wheelchair.

, What better way to spend time with your dog than to give them a massage! Gentle massage will not only relax your dog, but also improve blood flow around their stiff and painful joints.Prepare the massage area by placing a few layers of comfortable blankets on the floor and turning on some soft music.Apply light pressure around the joints so your dog doesn’t stiffen with pain or discomfort during the massage.
Talk quietly to your dog during the massage.
Move your hands in slow back-and-forth or circular motions on your dog’s body.

, Physical therapy will help relieve your dog’s pain and improve their flexibility, allowing them to have better quality of life. Perform passive range of motion (PROM) exercises at home. For these exercises, you will gently take each joint through its natural of motion while your dog rests comfortably.Depending on the joints that are affected with arthritis, your vet can show you how to perform the PROM exercises.
Using direct heat on the affected joints can also help your dog feel better. Wrap hot packs, which you can purchase at your local pharmacy, in a towel and place them on the painful joints."

Don’t fear the heat.,
Think about moisture.,
Avoid shaving a dog with a double coat.,
Consider a professional shave.,
Purchase equipment.,
Keep the clippers cool.,
Clean your dog’s hair.,
Restrain your dog by its collar.,
Shave with the growth of the hair.,
Start with the sensitive areas.,
Shave the underarms.,
Shave the groin.,
Shave the bottom.,
Shave the rest of the body.",How to Shave Your Dog," It seems intuitive that your dog’s coat will make the summer unbearable. Actually, its fur acts as insulation, cooling it down and protecting it from the sun. For this reason, the ASPCA has issued a blanket proclamation that owners should not shave their dogs.In addition to cooling it, the dog’s fur coat protects it from the sun. Without it, a dog is liable to get sunburn, and is more susceptible to skin cancer.Some – not all – experts suggest that certain dogs that were bred for extreme cold weather climates do have coats that are too thick for warm summers. Consult with your veterinarian and ask if your dog might be a bit too hairy for its own good.
Even in cases where your dog might need a bit of grooming, don’t overdo it. You should leave at least an inch of hair to protect it from the sun.;
, If there is a good reason to shave your dog, it might not be the sun, but rather the rain. Dogs can develop a condition called myiasis – an invasion of maggots into the fur – when exposed to too much moisture. This might be a concern if your dog has a thick, matted coat of fur and is outside in the rain often.Ask your veterinarian if myiasis is a serious concern for your dog. Even if your dog does have the previously mentioned risk factors, the condition can typically be prevented if you keep your dog clean and are attentive to open wounds., A double coat is an undercoat of fine, fluffy hair. It might not be readily visible under the heavier coat above, but many popular breeds have it, including the German Shepherd, Pomeranian, Chow, Husky, Malamute, and Samoyed. As these dogs get older, the likelihood increases that some of their hair will not regenerate after a shave, leaving them with a patchy, scruffy coat., Dog grooming typically costs somewhere from $30 to $90.This includes the price of trimming the dog’s hair, but also maintaining its nails and a variety of other important hygienic functions.


For some people this might be a difficult sum to raise, but generally your dog can do – and might even be better of – without the trim. Therefore, if the choice is between shaving it yourself and not shaving it at all, usually not shaving it is the better option.
When shaving your dog, there is a risk that you will injure it. When this is considered, it is quite likely that a professional grooming is the cheaper option; a vet bill will cost more than any bath and shave.

, You will need a clipper, a comb that attaches to the clipper, a brush and some lubricant. Buy a clipper designed for dogs at a pet shop or an animal grooming store.If you know that your dog is often startled by loud noises, test the various clippers available to see how loud they are. Pick one that won’t make much noise.Purchase an E comb. This comb is designed to leave an inch of hair left, which is the length typically recommended., It is easy for a clipper to overheat, burning your dog. Take frequent breaks to cool down the raiser. Apply the lubricant that comes with the clippers to prevent the device from overheating., If there are clumps in its hair, it will be hard to pull the clippers through. This could be painful for your dog and difficult for you. Wash and brush your dog to get these tangles out of its hair and get it ready for the shaving., You want to prevent your dog from moving too much while you shave it. If your dog is at all resistant, you should probably have a second person around to help secure it in place., If you shave against the growth of the hair you can create harsh lines. Use slow, gentle strokes.If you are having trouble figuring out what direction to shave, take a credit card and rub it along the hair. If you begin picking up the hair and pulling it backwards, you are pushing against the grain of the hair. You will want to shave in the opposite direction.

, As time progresses your dog might get more impatient. Begin with the hard to get spots and then move on to the easier areas.


A good order is: head, underarms, under-tail, behind the head, back, sides, belly.
Unless your dog is completely still you should skip its face altogether. Even then, stay at least an inch from the eye while shaving., When the dog is standing, lift up its arm in a comfortable position. Shave under the arm and repeat with the other arm.

, Lift your dog's leg as if it were going to go to the bathroom. Shave underneath the leg. This will keep the dog clean when it needs to go to the bathroom, especially for long haired dogs. Repeat with the other leg.

, Raise its tail and shave around the bottom. This is also to keep it clean when it goes to the bathroom. Be careful here too.

, Start behind the head and go down the neck to the back and then down both sides. Shave the belly carefully and remember to shave away from your hand.

Consult your veterinarian.,
Use diet to manage your senior dog’s weight.,
Supplement their diet with glucosamine chondroitin.,
Feed them green lipped mussel supplements.,
Give your senior dog a combination supplement.",How to Maintain Joint Health in Senior Dogs1," You should ask your veterinarian to determine if your dog is overweight and if they have any specific medical conditions that impact the joints. As your dog ages, they are more at risk of developing joint problems such as osteoarthritis and hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is seen commonly in German shepherd, golden retriever, and Labrador retriever breeds. Osteoarthritis is seen a lot in older dogs and can impact any joint in the body. If your dog is overweight, they will suffer even more from these or other joint conditions. As such, it is necessary to tackle joint problems holistically in relation to both weight and illness.


If your senior dog becomes overweight, their joints will suffer.;
, As your dog ages, they have less energy requirements and are more at risk of getting overweight. As such, it can help to feed them a low calorie diet.You can purchase a senior dog food formulation with appropriate nutritional content at most pet food stores.Ask your veterinarian if there is an appropriate diet that is well suited to your dog’s weight loss goals.


Make sure your senior dog gets plenty of water.If you feed your senior dog snacks, they should be healthy, low-fat, and low sodium treats., Glucosamine is the nutritional building block for cartilage, which is a crucial part of your dog’s joints. To improve the health of your senior dog’s joints, you should supplement your dog’s diet with extra glucosamine chondroitin.These supplements can help with joint inflammation, which is also important if your senior dog has arthritis. They come in a variety of forms such as chewable tablets, mini pellets that you put in their food, or as a syrup.


Use canine-specific glucosamine supplements. Although it is possible to use a human glucosamine supplement for a dog on the condition that there are no other ingredients in it, it is generally better to use the canine version. Canine tailored supplements are more digestible for your senior dog, whereas a human supplement may not be absorbed at all.Glucosamine chondroitin supplements derive from shellfish, so avoid this supplement if your dog has a shellfish allergy.Side effects are rare but you should watch for any symptoms of an allergic reaction to the supplement such as vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or appetite loss.Disguise the supplement so they eat it. If it is pellets or a syrup, you can mix it into their food. If it is a chewable tablet, you can wrap it in a treat.

, Green lipped mussels are native to New Zealand, where Maori Indigenous groups have used them for a long time. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of feeding dogs green lipped mussels, with joint health and inflammation significantly improved for those who took the supplement.You can purchase a variety of green lipped mussel supplements for dogs, which should help with their joint health, mobility, and any arthritic conditions.


Use a green lipped mussel supplement designed specifically for canines, as opposed to human versions of the supplement.
Retailers like Pure Pets, for example, sell a green lipped mussel supplement., You can find a variety of combination supplements for senior dogs with joint issues. These supplements typically combine glucosamine chondroitin with MSM, a sulfur for connective tissue, and other ingredients to improve the digestibility of the supplement. For example, Krill oil may be used. You can find combination supplements in a variety of forms such as pellets, liquids, or chewable tablets.


Natur vet combines glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM in a chewable tablet.Grizzly Pet sells a joint aid for dogs that combines glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, hyaluronic acid, and krill oil. It comes in pellet and liquid form."

Get your dog a good bed.,
Get a dog ramp for the car.,
Install dog stairs in your home.,
Set up your home so that your dog can stay on one level.",How to Maintain Joint Health in Senior Dogs2," Sleeping on the floor is bad for your senior dog’s joints. To ease the pressure on your senior dog’s joints, you should buy them a comfortable bed. Choose a bed that is thick and supportive. The most popular type of bed for senior dogs with joint issues is the orthopedic memory foam bed.Prices can range from $50 - $200., If your dog is having a tough time getting into the car these days because of their joint trouble, you should consider getting a ramp. A ramp will make the whole process a lot easier on you and your senior dog.If you don’t have a ramp, try using a footstool. They can jump from the footstool to the back of the car.Mr. Herzher’s pet ramp is telescoping, which makes it adjustable for different vehicles. It also has rubber ends and treading that prevents slipping., If you see your dog avoiding the couch because it is too difficult to climb up, perhaps you should get them some stairs. Similarly, if your dog is having trouble getting from one part of the house to another because of climbing difficulty, you should consider purchasing some dog stairs.If your dog is having trouble getting onto beds or couches, consider getting the solvit pup steps pet stairs. These stairs are foldable, secure, and offer a good amount of stability., If it is possible in your home, try to keep your dog’s toys, bed, and food all on one level so that they don’t have to use the stairs. If necessary, move your dog’s bed from one room to another so that they do not have to climb the stairs to sleep at night.

Give your senior dog regular exercise.,
Walk your senior dog up a hill.,
Take your senior dog for a swim.,
Identify signs of overexertion.",How to Maintain Joint Health in Senior Dogs3," To help prevent weight gain and associated joint issues in senior dogs, it is important to give your dog regular exercise. Take your dog for a walk around the park once a day. If you are unable to give your dog exercise, you should consider asking a neighbor, friend, or a dog walker.If you hire a dog walker, remember to get a police check and appropriate references. You might find this article helpful, which explains how to find a good dog walker.


, To properly exercise the back legs, remember to walk your dog up a hill. Walking your senior dog will ensure a wider range of motion, which can help your dog maintain mobility.If your senior dog is having a really difficult time, give them a break or take them on a route that is less hilly.
Try incorporating a hilly walk once a week.

, Swimming offers fantastic cardiovascular exercise. It is also very easy on your senior dog’s joints. By taking your dog for a swim, you can help maintain their cardiovascular health, keep their weight down, and lower pressure on their joints.Take your senior dog for a swim at a local lake.
Take your senior dog for a swim in a backyard swimming pool.

, If your senior dog is panting excessively or limping during exercise, you should stop and see what the problem might be. If your senior dog is limping, it is likely a sign of joint inflammation or another injury. You should stop exercise and see the veterinarian.

Skip the shampoo.,
Avoid blow drying your dog.,
Keep your dog inside more in colder weather.,

Add oils.,
Think about adding a fatty acid supplement.,
Add in flax seed to your dog's food.,
Try olive or coconut oil.,
Consider herbs or other supplements.,
Watch for sudden changes.,
Think about allergies.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Soothe Dry Skin and Coats in Older Dogs," When you give your dog a bath, try skipping the shampoo, which can be drying, and just using water. If you want to use a shampoo, make sure to pick one that's moisturizing. Check to see if it has humectants in it to better moisturize your dog. You can also use a conditioner afterwards to help decrease dryness.Make sure any shampoo and conditioner you use is meant for dogs.;
, Blow drying your dog's coat only dries out the hair and skin. Instead, dry your dog off as well as possible with towels. If you go to a groomer's, ask them to turn the heat down on the blow dryer for your dog, which will also help., When it's cold out, your senior dog may want to stay inside in the warmth more than it did when it was younger. You should encourage that behavior, as the cold air can contribute to dry skin., Brushing your dog's coat helps increase oil production from its skin. Older dogs do have more trouble producing oil, but this technique can still help to increase the oil in your dog's skin and coat.Try to brush your dog's coat every couple of days. Combs or pin-head brushes work on most dogs.
Don't use a shedding brush all the time, as that can be too harsh, especially for an older dog.
If your dog isn't used to regular brushing, try giving him treats and praise as you pet it, as it will then associate happy things with brushing., Just like you, your senior dog can benefit from moisturizer. However, don't slather your hand cream on your dog. Rather, stick to natural oils, such as coconut oil. You can apply coconut oil directly to your dog's skin and coat. Generally, once a week is enough, but you can apply it more, especially if you find your older dog needs it.Sweet almond oil is also safe for dogs.

, If your elderly dog has lost some of the gloss to its coat, it may be due to a deficiency of fatty acids, which are essential to a dog's (and human's!) diet. You can find supplements at the pet store or from your vet meant for dogs.Ask your vet before starting a supplement for your dog.

, In place of a fatty acid supplement, try adding flax seed oil or flax seeds to your dog's food. You can use 1/2 a teaspoon per every 15 pounds of dog. That is, if your dog is 30 pounds, you can use a teaspoon. Try this supplement twice a day.If you use seeds, make sure they're freshly ground. You can use 1 1/2 teaspoons per 15 pounds of twice a day.

, Another supplement that could help your dog's coat and skin is adding olive or coconut oil to its diet. You can add as a little as a couple of tablespoons a weekor as much as 1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of dog per day. It's best to start with smaller doses (such as a 1/4 teaspoon per 10 pounds of dog) and work up to larger doses to see how it will affect your dog.For instance, if your dog weighs 20 pounds, you can add 1/2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons per day.

, Other herbs may help with your elderly dog's coat and skin. You can try supplements such as kelp powder, horsetail, nettles, nutritional yeast, or alfalfa, by pouring a teaspoon or less over the dog's food. You can also try spirulina, which can be given in doses of 500 to 1,000 milligrams two times a day.Always ask your vet about supplements.

, Gradual changes as your dog ages are not as much of a concern as a sudden change. A sudden change in your dog's coat or skin is much more likely to indicate a new disease or skin condition, so make sure to pay attention to major changes.For example, if your dog's coat suddenly gets more dry or flaky, rather than over time, that could be a sign your dog has another problem.

, While your dog will not likely develop allergies in old age if it hasn't earlier in life, allergies can worsen as your dog ages. More severe allergies can lead to drier skin or changes in the dog's coat. Talk to your vet about what can help with your dog's allergies if you suspect that's the cause.Your vet may recommend a change in diet, or they may prescribe an antihistamine.

, While you may think it's just dry skin, flaky or scaly skin can be a sign of other conditions, such as mange, bacterial infections, Cushing's disease, and flea bite sensitivity, just to name a few. Therefore, it's always a good idea to get your dog checked out with a vet when you notice something like dry skin.For example, you could say, ""I've noticed my dog's skin has suddenly gotten flaky. It tends to flake off in big, yellow flakes. Do you think that could be a sign of something more serious?""

Take the blades out of the clippers.,
Brush out the blades.,
Use a cleaning solution to clean the blades.Wipe on a cleaning solution made for clippers with a cotton ball and scrub away any rust or debris.,
Gather sharpening tools.,
Spray water on the stones.,
Hold the blade at a 35-45 degree angle.,
Move the blade side to side across the coarser stone five to ten times.,
Repeat the movement across the fine 8000 grit whetstone.,
Reassemble the clippers.",How to Sharpen Dog Clippers," Before starting, make sure the cord is unplugged or, on cordless models, the switch is in the off position.The blades are held in place by one of two different methods: screws or a snap-on latch. Pushing on the tab which holds the blades to the clippers will cause the snap-on blade to “pop” open. It can then be pulled off to remove it from the clipper. Blades held to the clipper with screws usually have two screws holding them onto the clipper body. These will need to be removed before slipping the blade off the clipper.


Store the screws in a safe place so you do not lose them. Also, make sure to remember how the blades came off the clippers, so you can figure out how to replace them when you are finished sharpening them.;
, Use a toothbrush, or the brush that came with the clippers, to brush out all hair from the blades. This is also a good time to clean out the clipper head with the brush.

, Alternatively, you can soak the blades for a few hours to remove really stuck on debris or rust. Oster, Andis, Wahl and other manufacturers all make lubricating/cleaning solutions for clipper blades.


Alternatively, you can dip the blades, while still attached to the clippers, in a cleaning solution and run them for 5-10 seconds.When done, wipe the blades off with a soft, clean cloth.
Allow the blades to dry. Once they are dry you can sharpen them.

, You will need a coarse 4000 grit surface whetstone (also called sharpening or honing stones) along with an 8000 grit stone. These can be purchased from hardware stores and sometimes come in a combined stone.If you have a ceramic blade in your clippers you will need to use a diamond sharpening stone instead of a whetstone. These can also be found in many hardware stores or can be found online.

, If you spray water on the stone and the water absorbs immediately, then your stone needs to be soaked for 10 minutes. If you spray the stone and it absorbs some of the water but a thin sheen remains on the surface, then it is ready to use.

, You do not want to drastically change the angle of the blade, you just want to hone the end of it, so keep it as close to the same angle it has already as possible. It is very important to hold the blade at the correct angle, so take your time to find the right position.


The blade should be held between your thumb and your ring finger.

, Wipe it with the soft cloth to remove away the fine powder. Repeat the process with the other side of the blade.

, Keep the same angle and repeat the movement five to ten times. The blade should look shiny when finished.


Wipe the blades off when finished.

, Now that you’ve sharpened your blades it’s time to put them back onto the clipper body. Snap or screw them back into to place. Place a few drops of clippers oil (a light oil) on the blades to lubricate them. Then turn the clippers on and run the blades to distribute the oil and to make sure everything works well.

This symptom is likely to be more noticeable when your dog first gets up, as moving around a bit can ease some of the stiffness., If your dog has arthritis, it may not want to move around as much. You may notice it doesn't want to jump in the car, for instance. If that's something it used to do regularly, that could indicate your dog has arthritis., Arthritis can also present in the back, not just the legs. You may notice that your dog develops a hunch back, for instance, or that one of its back legs starts dragging a bit. You might also notice sensitivity in the neck area, where pain can develop., Another symptom of arthritis in dogs is the loss of muscle mass over time.

Your veterinarian can make sure it's arthritis and not something else, as well as provide ways to help manage pain., Part of diagnosing your dog will include the veterinarian giving your dog a physical exam. Basically, your vet will visually inspect the dog, as well as feeling the dog in several places (like joints) to help determine the cause of the pain.Your vet will also use things like your dog's past medical history and age to help determine if your dog has arthritis.

, Often times, a vet will give your dog x-rays if they suspect arthritis. X-rays can help determine how bad the arthritis is in your dog, which can help decide treatment. If your vet doesn't suggest x-rays, ask if that's an option your dog needs.

Your vet can best diagnose and recommend treatment for the specific problems troubling your dog.Prior to your vet appointment, make note of the types of symptoms associated with your dog’s joint. Take note of things like your dog struggling to walk or walking slower, the inability to get up and down off of the sofa, excessive trembling, falling, or tipping over. Also note where your dog seems to experience problems, such as around the hips or along the legs.
Also make note of any other irregular symptoms that may be accompanying your dog’s joint problems. Are they experiencing disorientation, loss of appetite, or anything else outside of their typical behavior?
When you meet with your vet, inform them of the symptoms you have observed, and ask them what types of treatments they recommend.;

Your vet will be able to recommend a proper check-up schedule.Many vets will want to see a pet every three to six months for minor to moderate conditions, and may recommend more often for dogs suffering from severe or debilitating joint problems.

, Your vet may be able to prescribe medication to help alleviate your dog’s joint pain. The type of medication needed will depend on the cause of your dog’s joint pain, so medication should only be administered after receiving a vet’s prescription.Natural supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin may help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with joint problems and help prevent further deterioration.

Before you begin, wash the dog's furnishings: legs, beard, eyebrows, chest.,
After bathing, put the dog up on the table and dry the dog with either a hairdryer or a blow dryer which is specifically for dogs.,
After the dog is dry, put some 'Biogroom Pro White Powder - Harsh Coat' into the coat (the bits that are stripped).,
Take up either your Mikki Stripping knife (red) or your Mars Stripping Knife - Medium and at an angle almost vertical leaning away from you (teeth pointing towards you).,
Take up your Grooming stone.,
For the tail, strip it back with the stripping knife.,
For the top of the head, take up your Greyhound Metal Stripping Stone 6mm and pull out all of the bits that stick up.,
Take a step back and look at the dog as a whole.",How to Roll a Giant Schnauzer's Coat," All the bits that you never remove but just shape.;
, Concentrate on the feet first. When it comes to the head which is done last (on a mini it is done first) only blow from the top of the eyebrows down in the direction of which the hair sits. The dog must be fully dry.

, You can't overdo it, it will automatically make the coat harder. This cleans the coat and makes the hair easier to pull. For starters take up your 'Mars Coat King Original 16 Blade' and while your dog is standing/lying down taunt the skin via the neck and pull the mars through all the way. Remove the hair from it and repeat. Go 2-3 times in one spot then move to another. When it comes to the side and the legs, put the dog on its side. It makes it easier.

, Repeat what you did with the Mars coat king.

, On the same angle used for the stripping knife run it over the coat. If it becomes rounded run it on some concrete to create a flat edge. It works better this way. Go all over the coat. For the ears, take the stone and rub with the hair until it sits flat against the ear. Don't bother about the back of the ear.

, If the tail is docked don't strip out a lot. It should still remain fully covered in hair. Don't worry about the tip yet.

, Do this until the hair sits flat on the head.

, Pull out any hair that is randomly sticking out of the jacket with your fingers (you can also use a 'Greyhound Metal Stripping Stone either 8mm or 13mm). If you are satisfied with the coat, take the blow dryer and blow the rest of the grooming powder out and let your dog out for a bit of a run. He deserves it. Just don't let him get too dirty.

Create a space for your dog.,
Choose the right food.,
Keep your dog warm and dry.,
Make yourself accessible.",How to Care For a Dog with Bad Joints2," Set up a space for your dog that they can easily navigate without too much trouble. This should include at minimum a dog bed selected for your dog’s comfort, nearby food and water, and a pet training pad for potty emergencies and accidents.Your dog’s bed should be soft and comfortable but not so padded that your dog struggles to get out of it. Many pet owners find that a heated bed helps greatly for dogs with joint pain.
If you have a large dog, you may want to consider a raised bed that enables them to get in and out without having bend as much. Raised food and water dishes, such as those that fit into a bench, are also recommended.

, Joint pain can be exacerbated by excess weight. Choose a dog food that will help keep your dog at a healthy weight. If you have a senior dog, opt for a senior dog food, which also often contains ingredients to help joints.If your dog is not elderly, make sure you are using a size-appropriate dog food. Larger dogs have different nutritional needs than smaller dogs.
Many pet food companies also offer healthy weight formulas, purpose-made to help nourish dogs struggling with their weight.

, Cool, damp conditions may make joint pain more pronounced for your dog. Keep your dog in warm, dry, indoor areas whenever possible.If you live in a cold climate, keep the temperature inside your house warm enough for your dog’s comfort. Equip your dog with a jacket and shoes if you need to take it out in snowy or cold conditions.
If you take your dog out in the rain or snow, towel your dog dry once you are back inside and make sure the room is warm enough to keep your dog comfortable.

, You are a major source of comfort for your dog, so it is important to make sure you are as physically accessible to your dog as you were before they began experiencing joint problems. Ensure your dog has ways to access you in the areas you permit.If you typically allow your dog on the furniture or in your bed but they can no longer get up and down from these areas, consider investing in a furniture staircase for dogs, or help your dog up and down as necessary.
If you typically do not let your dog on the furniture, take time every day to be down on the floor playing with or petting them. Your attention helps keep your dog relaxed as they transition to their new care routine.

"
"
Get some daily exercise.,
Gently massage your dog’s joints.,
Avoid physical punishment.,
Pay attention to your dog daily.",How to Care For a Dog with Bad Joints3," Joint pain may prevent a dog from going on long walks or playing for an extended period of time, but it is important to ensure that they get some exercise every day. Take your dog on short walks in nearby areas, and end the walk when you notice your dog slowing or struggling.Depending upon your dog’s overall mobility, it may be advisable to avoid areas like dog parks and dog beaches, as other well-meaning dogs may be too quick or rough for your dog to handle.
Play games such as fetch and tug-of-war in the home, too, to help keep your dog from getting stiff throughout the day.

, Giving your dog a gentle joint massage for five to ten minutes every day can help relieve some of their pain and keep them from getting too stiff. Give your dog short messages in the areas that bother them most.Gently massage your dog’s muscles in small, circular motions along the areas where they experience regular pain. Firmness should be only slightly greater than what you use to pet or scratch your dog.
Support your dog during the massage by wrapping your arm under their stomach and helping them stand, if necessary.
Try not to rub areas that currently aggravated. If you notice your dog wince or express pain, stop massaging that area immediately.

, If you are a dog owner who swats their dog for an accident or rubs their nose in the mess, adopt a non-physical form of punishment. Acting physically against your dog may rapidly increase joint pain and could cause greater damage.Eliminate physical punishment and instead opt for speaking in firm and severe tones to communicate your discontent.
You may consider not giving the dog a regular treat as a part of punishment, but never deprive them of food, water, or other basic necessities such as shelter.
If your dog has regular accidents, consider getting indoor training pad meant specifically to be thrown away after your dog to does their business.

, As your dog experiences new joint problems, the way in which you play and interact with them may change. You may have to spend less time playing rough and more time simply petting or showing affection to your dog. Regardless, you should show your dog support by ensuring they get attention every day.Spend the same amount of time you would have typically spent with you dog before they began having joint problems. You may be doing different activities, but you don’t need to cut back on time with your dog because of their joints.
If your dog is no longer able to run and play, try lower impact activities such as slow-paced games of fetch in the house, or even taking your dog for a swim.

Prepare the equipment you will need.,
Begin shearing the dog with a pair of groomers clippers.,
After you have completely trimmed the dog's torso and bottom, it is time to shave the neck and head.,
Once, the head is trimmed, you should trim the back of your pet's ears.,
Once you have finished trimming the ears, you may move on to the dog's face.,
Next, trim the areas of the chest, skirt, and legs with scissors.

,
Now, you can trim your dog's toe nails.,
Next, it is time to bathe the dog.,
Dry the dog of with a towel.,
And last, brush the dog with a soft bristled brush.

",How to Style Your Schnauzer," The process will be much smoother if you are well prepared. Everything you need should be nearby.;
, You use the clippers in the same way you would a lawn mower. Shave in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Do not change direction once you have begun. Trim all the way down to lower sides. It is up to you how thick you would like to make the skirt. The skirt is optional. Some people like to leave a short skirt that makes a straight line from the shoulder of the dog to the beginning of the back leg. I shave the thigh, tail, and bottom completely

, Do this with the same technique you used for the body. Trim from the back of the neck to the eyebrow. It may be necessary to hold the dogs head in place. It is important for the safety of the dog, that the head is kept still.

, Hold the ear gently in your hand and gently go over it with the clippers. Then, take scissors and trim the outline of the dogs ears. Be careful to not cut the dogs ear. One method is to place my finger across my dog's ears so it is impossible to cut her.

, Again, it is up to you how you trim the face. One method is to use scissors to trim the dog's bangs. Then move to the area around her eyes. Be sure to shorten the hair around the dogs eyes for enhanced visibility. Next, trim the beard. The style is up to you, some people prefer longer beards, while others prefer shorter ones.

,, One suggestion is to use a battery powered toenail trimmer. This method is much easier and safer. You simply place the dog's toenail in the hole on the top of the trimmer, and hit the on switch. Then, remove the nail when you are satisfied with the length.

, First, pour warm water over the entire body of the dog. Then apply shampoo. Lather, Rinse, and Repeat.

, (Tasha prefers a towel warmed in the dryer.) Let the dog air dry or use a blow dryer on low.

Look for signs of stiffness or pain.,
Evaluate changes in gait.,
Monitor your dog’s activity levels.,
Listen to your dog’s vocal cues.,
Examine the elbows.,
Note limb lameness.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Deal with Elbow Dysplasia in Dogs1," This most often occurs in young dogs with elbow dysplasia. When dogs stand, sit, or lay down after spending time in one position, they may make noises or strain to shift positions. Some dogs favor one or the other side, and others seem to plop down to avoid long amounts of pressure on their joints. Watch as your dog’s position changes, and make note of struggling or odd behavior., Dogs with elbow dysplasia may begin to run and walk differently. This can be a limp or simply leaning more to one side than the other. If you notice a change in your dog’s walk, this can be indicative of elbow dysplasia., If you notice your dog is sleeping more often, doesn’t want to play as much, or seems to take breaks more frequently on walks, this can be caused by a number of health concerns, but combined with the other warning signs of elbow dysplasia, this may be indicative of joint health concerns., You many notice your dog whining, groaning, panting, or even growling when weight is put on joints. Pay specific attention to your dog as it stands up and lays down as transferring weight on the elbows may be especially uncomfortable. If your dog regularly makes these noises, this may be a sign of elbow dysplasia., In most cases, one or both joints will rotate in towards the dog’s body. You may not be able to recognize this change, but a veterinarian will notice it right away. However, it’s important to take your dog to the vet if you do see this shift in position, even if your dog isn’t limping or having other difficulties. Typically, dog’s elbows point back, toward the tail. Dogs with elbow dysplasia may begin to show signs of the elbows leaning in towards the body., Elbow dysplasia is the leading cause of front leg immobility, especially in very young dogs. If you notice your dog is unable to bend or move one or both front limbs, this is a significant indicator that the dog is suffering from elbow dysplasia. You should visit the vet right away., Your pet’s doctor will visually examine the front legs, move the limbs to see if they are capable of a full range of motion, and capture x-rays. Some dogs present signs of dysplasia in x-rays even without any symptoms or resulting effects. However, if you’ve noticed your dog limping or showing other signs of pain or discomfort, the next step will be treatment planning and ongoing care in partnership with your vet."

Give your dog pain medication.,
Add supplements to your dog’s diet.,
Make sure the dog gets enough exercise.,
Keep your dog warm.,
Massage your dog.,
Get intra-articular injections for your dog.,
Make movement less painful.,
Make your dog’s bed comfortable.",How to Deal with Elbow Dysplasia in Dogs2," Over the counter or prescription pain relievers may be recommended by your veterinarian. If you choose to rely on a non-prescription medication, consider a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). You can find these in name brand and generic varieties, and NSAIDs are typically available from about five dollars a bottle. Your vet may also prescribe steroids, cortisones, or chondroprotectants.


Ask your vet before beginning any medicinal treatment plan.
Prescription medications are available in pill form or as direct joint injections.
For mature dogs, chondroprotectants have proved helpful in treating degenerative joint disorders., You can add natural supplements including glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega fatty acids to your dog’s food. You can purchase these supplements in a variety of forms in most health food stores and pharmacies.These supplements are all nutraceuticals; a combination of foods and pharmaceuticals that deliver essential nutrients via the dog's diet.
The research has not yet confirmed it, but anecdotal evidence to glucosamine and chondroitin indicate that these supplements decrease inflammation and promote joint health.
Omega 3's and other fatty acids offer pets advanced regenerative properties. That means when developmental issues or dysplasia damage bone or supportive tissues, omega 3's can help your dog rebuild them., You may want to ask your veterinarian before having your dog change or increase their exercise. Walking on a variety of up and down hill inclines can help keep your dog’s joints loose and reduce inflammation. Swimming is a low impact exercise that will allow your pet to keep joints moving without the undo stress caused by the impact of walking or running.Ask your vet for specific recommendations, but typically, if you increase the amount of exercise gradually, your dog will respond positively.
Start by adding five or ten minutes onto a walk, or varying incline during your walk.
Stop if your dog ever seems tired, whimpers, pants, or otherwise indicates discomfort.

, Allowing your dog to lay on a heating pad or blanket can significantly reduce inflammation and sooth joint pain. Simply making sure your dog maintains a consistent temperature will improve joint function. Significant changes from hot to cold cause the cartilage, muscles, and other tissues to expand and contract leading to discomfort.


Keep dogs with elbow dysplasia in a temperature controlled house, garage, or other area to ensure consistent body temperature day and night.
If you’re taking your dog outside in the cold, put a sweater or leg warmers on to keep their joints warm.
If your dog is panting, coughing, or drooling, it may be overheated. Bring your dog water and remove heat sources, if this happens., This can relieve pain and inflammation in the joints. Start by petting the area of the leg and elbow. Then, cross your hands one over the other and gently pump up and down similar to CPR compressions. Be careful and don’t push directly on the bones. After a few minutes of pumping, gently pet the joint. Then, switch to the other leg., These shots use your dog’s own blood plasma to help relieve the effects of elbow dysplasia including inflammation and assist the joints to develop properly. These treatments are best used in conjunction with other methods such as exercise therapy for younger dogs., If your dog has to go up and down stairs, this can stress or damage the elbow joints. You may want to consider having a ramp put in place to help your dog enter and exit the home. You can also purchase portable ramps that can be used to help dogs get in and out of cars as well as up and down short sets of stairs. Living in a home with carpeting or putting down rugs can also decrease impact of walking, standing, and other movements for your dog., The goal of your bet’s sleeping area should be to provide support for the joints, so there is no pressure or strain on the elbows while your dog sleeps. Cushions also reduce the pressure on elbows and other joints when your dog gets up and down from sleeping postures. A bed that’s low to the ground is best, so your dog does not overexert the elbow joints when getting in or out of their bed."
"
Keep your dog at a healthy weight.,
Change your dog’s food.,
Take your dog to physiotherapy.,
Consider surgery.",How to Deal with Elbow Dysplasia in Dogs3," Excess weight puts stress on all of the joints and can increase the effects of elbow dysplasia. Ask your vet what a healthy weight is for your dog before beginning a diet or other weight loss plan. You don’t want your dog to be undernourished. Additionally, be careful with your exercise routine as exertion may further damage your dog’s joints. Sometimes decreasing food intake or removing treats from the diet is effective. In other cases, you may have to change to a weight management food. However, many of the dog foods specifically for weight loss include high amounts of protein that can damage joints, so check the ingredients first., In some cases, too much protein has been linked to elbow, hip, and other forms of dysplasia in dogs. Making use of dietary fatty acids can dramatically improve your dog’s bone and joint development and overall health. Ask a veterinarian for recommendations of foods that will provide an adequate combination of nutrients. You can also look for foods that offer benefits for joint health and improved flexibility.Weight management dog foods typically take your dog's joints into consideration. If you find a dog food that claims to help control weight, it will likely also provide joint support.
Look for dog foods that promote omega three fatty acids, glucosamine, and other anti-inflammatory ingredients.
You may also want to consider prescription dog foods from your vet for the best results., These treatments are completed by trained professionals and can include a combination of any number of exercise therapies, massage, and medications. Your vet may recommend physiotherapy as an alternative to surgery or to help you dog recover from more advanced surgical treatments.Like human physiotherapy, the goal of physiotherapy for your dog is to restore the full range of movement to damaged joint, muscles, or bones.
Your dog's physiotherapist may recommend alternative treatments like massage or acupuncture to relieve pain. Be open to these solutions.
Canine chiropractors often offer this type of treatment planning. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations, if your dog does not experience effective relief with more traditional treatment.

, If the problem is progressed, advanced medical procedures may be necessary to relieve the pain the animal is feeling. Not every dog is a good candidate for surgery. Most juvenile or adolescent aged dogs will be recommended for surgery, as they are likely to heal from the procedure. More mature dogs whose joints are no longer stable due to arthritic degeneration will also likely be recommended for surgery as stabilizing the joints is essential to regular daily function. However, if the mature dog’s joints are stable despite the presence of elbow dysplasia, surgery may make the situation worse and is typically avoided.Total elbow replacement (TER) may be necessary in the most severe cases. It is the complete replacement of the elbow to restructure the joint correctly.
Sliding humeral osteotomy (SHO) is necessary when there is severe inflammation related to osteoarthritis. It requires the cutting of the humerus and the connection of a bone plate that repositions the elbow to fit together properly.
Canine unicompartmental elbow replacement (CUE) is an alternative to SHO or TER for mature dogs who will not respond well to a more advanced procedure. CUE smooths the bone on the inside of the dog’s elbow where the lack of cartilage has caused pain, inflammation, or joint damage."

Do nothing using bare hands.,
Find an old pair of pantyhose (or a new, cheap pair if you do not have an old pair).,
Spread your hand open while in the pantyhose foot-bed.,
Repeat this pantyhose-hand rubbing process until you have removed as many sticky seeds as you can.,
Done.",How to Remove Sticky Barbed Seeds from Your Dog's Fur Coat," Do not try to remove the sticky seed from the dog with your bare hand or it is most probable that the seeds will become more embedded into the fur. Instead, use pantyhose, which are are excellent at removing sticky seeds with little distress to your animal.
, Place your open hand into one of the legs of the pantyhose and run your hand down to the foot-bed of the pantyhose., Run your covered hand over the dog's fur. As the sticky seeds become attached to the pantyhose, move your hand to a clean area in the pantyhose leg. Repeat the process of running the pantyhose hand over the dog's fur., If there are seeds you cannot remove, then those seed might need to be removed with the tips of your fingers or, if the seeds are embedded, use a rounded tip pair of scissors to remove the remainder seeds and snip only small amounts of fur., Once your dog is seed-free, brush as usual and settle down together for a nice treat."

Determine if your dog is unwell.,
Check your dog for sore teeth.,
Consider if your dog has arthritis.,
Check to see if your dog has a greasy coat or scaly skin.",How to Make a Dog's Coat Shine," If you buy a commercial dog food, make sure it contains the proper balance of nutrients. You may want to ask your vet to recommend a product and dosage specific to your dog. A nutritionally-rich diet is important in maintaining the health and condition of your dog's coat.


If you choose to make your own dog food, talk with the vet about making sure it's got the right balance of vitamins and minerals. Making your own dog food at home is a great way to be completely sure of what you're feeding your dog.;
, Look for an omega-6 supplement or consider adding safflower or sunflower oil to your dog's food. If adding the oil, give 1 teaspoon a day to a small dog or 1 tablespoon a day for a large dog. Avoid giving too much, since it could cause diarrhea. You may also want to give omega-3 fatty acids, which have a greater anti-inflammatory effect. These are found in flaxseed and fish oils. Regardless of the supplement you choose, always follow the packaging for dosage instructions.


Omega fatty acids can reduce the itchy skin of dogs with allergies, since they have natural anti-inflammatory effects.
They also nourish the cells that are developing at the deepest layer of your dog's skin. It will take at least 28 days for these skin cells to become the top layer and reveal an extra plush coat, so don't stop supplementing before that time., You should groom your dog every few days, regardless of whether he has long or short hair. Be sure to use dog brushes and combs, since they're designed to remove tangles, mats, dead skin cells, and dander. You'll need to look for tools that are best suited to your dog's fur. Always brush with the lie of the fur to distribute the natural oils through the hair and use a comb to get rid of tangles.Grooming also improves the oxygen supply to your dog's skin. This can improve the health and look of your dog's coat.
You may want to rub a dry leather chamois over your dog's coat to buff and polish it.

, To avoid stripping the natural oils from your dog's coat, leaving him prone to dryness, shampoo your dog no more than once a month. Choose a shampoo specifically made for dogs and look for one that matches your dog's coat and skin sensitivity. For example, if your dog scratches a lot, you may want to choose a sensitive shampoo or look for one made with oatmeal since oatmeal acts as a natural itch reliever.If your dog loves to roll in mud and needs frequent washing, chose the mildest shampoo you can find, preferably one that's moisturizing.
Be sure to rinse the dog's coat thoroughly. Any residual shampoo or conditioner left in the coat can irritate the skin and make the coat look dull and lifeless.

, Thoroughly look through your dog's coat for parasites, like fleas or ticks, which can affect your dog's coat and overall health. Since ticks are larger and slower, they'll be easier to see than fleas. To check for fleas, run your fingers over several parts of your dog's coat (like behind the ears, down the back, near the tail, and on the belly). Look for small pinpoint-sized black spots, known as flea dirt. These are flea droppings that are usually concentrated in one area.


You may want the veterinarian to check for worms and other internal parasites. These can feed off your dog and rob him of nutrients, damaging his coat. Your vet can check a fecal sample and prescribe medication to treat your dog.
One parasite (cheyletiella) is known as ""walking dandruff"" because it looks like large flakes of dandruff and if you watch carefully you may see it walk. Your vet will check for this and might recommend your dog be sprayed with medication once every two weeks for 2 or 3 treatments., If your dog is sick or feeling nauseous, he may stop grooming. This leads to a dull, unkempt coat and can signal to veterinarians that your dog has a medical condition. Check in with your veterinarian if you notice any one of the following symptoms in your dog:Lack of appetite
Excessive thirst
Vomiting
Diarrhea or soft stools
Smelly Breath
Smelly ears
Lameness
Difficulty Breathing

, Sore teeth can make it harder for your dog to eat. As a consequence, he may be messier and get food in his coat. To check for sore teeth, lift your dog's lip and take a look at the teeth and gums. His mouth should look like yours, with white teeth and pink gums. If the teeth are coated in tartar (a white buildup), the teeth are wobbly, or the gums are inflamed and bleeding, then your pet needs veterinary attention.You may also notice your dog's breath smells bad and he's a messy eater. If his teeth hurt, he will drop food out of his mouth when he chews. This can contribute to a dirty coat.

, Arthritis, or inflammation of the joints, can cause stiffness and pain. Your dog may be too stiff and sore to easily groom himself. If this is the case, you'll notice your dog walking stiffly and having difficulty using stairs or jumping in a vehicle. You'll need to talk to the veterinarian about medication to treat the pain of arthritis.In the meantime, help your dog by grooming him daily. Pay particular attention to areas that your dog can't comfortably reach.

, Pay attention for scaly, dandruff prone skin or an especially greasy coat. Your dog may have a condition called seborrhea, in which the skin's follicles create too much oil. This can trigger skin flaking or dandruff. Your vet will need to determine the cause of the greasy or scaly skin in order to recommend a treatment.Your vet may recommend supplementing your dog's diet with vitamin A or zinc to clear up any skin conditions."

Get your dog's ears checked.,
Choose an over-the-counter product containing pyrethrin or permethrin.,
Alternatively, consider a prescription topical treatment.,
Apply your chosen medication as directed.,
Keep your dog away from other dogs after administering the medicine.,
Bathe your pup with an insecticidal shampoo for added protection.",How to Remove Ear Mites from a Dog1," Even when using a non-prescription medication, it's wise to consult your veterinarian to ensure that your dog really does have ear mites. In addition, your vet will check to ensure that the eardrum is intact before treatment starts. This will greatly determine which treatment is appropriate.


If the tympanum (eardrum) is ruptured, drugs may pass into the middle ear and cause ototoxicity. This manifests itself as neurological disturbances such as a head tilt, horizontal nystagmus (the eyes flick from side to side), poor balance and vomiting. These effects can be serious and difficult to reverse.;
, These ingredients, which are derived from chrysanthemum flowers, belong to a group called pyrethroids. They are neurotoxins, meaning that they work by inhibiting nerve transmission in insects.Despite the way they work in insects, topical pyrethroids have a good safety margin in dogs. This is because the drug is poorly absorbed across the skin into blood. In addition, even if some is absorbed, pyrethroids are 2,250x less toxic to dogs than insects.Many different non-prescription products with these pyrethroids are available. One such treatment is eradimite, containing pyrethrin 0.15%. The advised dose is 10 drops into each ear.

, Prescription products usually contain ectoparasiticide drugs such as pyrethrins, thiabendazole and monosulfiram. Some products have a proven efficacy at killing ear mites, but do not contain recognized ectoparasiticides; their mode of action – that is, just how they work – is unclear.One advantage of prescription products is that they contain anti-inflammatories, antimicrobials and sometimes local anesthetic, all of which can be desirable to treat and soothe a sore, inflamed ear.
Ectoparasiticides are pesticides for parasites that are found on the surface of the body. Most treatment prescribed will fall into this class of medication., Following the directions on the package or of your veterinarian, apply the drops in the instructed amount to each of your dog's ears. Massage gently, leave for a few minutes to penetrate the wax, and then wipe away any excess with cotton wool. This regime should be repeated every other day until the symptoms have resolved.


Application may be necessary for a full three weeks (which represents one complete life cycle of the ear mites). However, if there is no improvement after one week of treatment the diagnosis should be reevaluated.
Not only do topical products kill the mite, but they also are anti-inflammatories and anti-biotics, meaning they'll soothe irritation and treat secondary bacterial infections, too.

, There is a theoretical risk of toxicity if ingested, such as being licked out of the ear by another dog. Because of this, it's best to keep your dog sequestered after receiving the medication until it dries.


The signs of poisoning include excessive salivation, muscle tremors, agitation and in extreme cases, seizures. Should you notice any of these signs in another pet, keep the animal in a dark, quiet room so as to minimize stimulation, and seek veterinary advice.

, When a dog scratches his ear, he may transfer ear mites to his paw. When an active infection is present it is helpful to bathe the dog weekly with an insecticidal shampoo (such as Seleen), to decrease coat contamination, which can act as a reservoir for re-infection.You may find one or more of the following wikiHows helpful:

Notice the symptoms.,
Check for dry skin.,
Recognize skin allergies.,
See your veterinarian.",How to Prevent Coat Dryness in Dogs1," There are some common symptoms that occur when your dog has dry skin. Your dog will likely spend great amounts of time itching or licking himself. He may also rub his skin against furniture or the carpet.


If this behavior happens for long periods of time or every day, your dog likely has dry skin or another skin condition.;
, If your dog exhibits symptoms of dry skin, you should check him to ensure this is the problem. While petting your dog, gently part the fur of his coat and look at the skin underneath. If he is suffering from dry skin, the area will be flakey and look dry or dull.


If your dog's case is severe, the skin may be cracked, red, or bleeding., There are larger skin issues that can start with the same symptoms as dry skin. Allergies are commonly disguised as dry skin at first. There are additional symptoms that signify allergies instead of just dry skin. These include:


Small blisters filled with pus
Skin with a musty or unpleasant odor
Thick, leathery skin
Sores with crusts on them
Skin darkening on dog with light skin
Presence of hives or wheals on the skin, If your dog's skin issues continue despite home treatment, see your veterinarian to check for a more serious underlying cause. If you suspect allergies in your dog, you should also consult your vet to figure out the cause of the allergies.


There are more intense issues that may also start as dry skin, such as mange, Alopecia, dandruff, and bacteria infections such as folliculitis and impetigo.
If it is allergies or a large issue, the treatment will be much more involved than treating dry skin."

Use a spot-on treatment containing selamectin or moxidectin.,
Get a prescription for all of the dogs in your household.,
Be sure you know your dog's weight.,
Apply the recommended amount of medication.,
Repeat in one month.",How to Remove Ear Mites from a Dog2," Selamectin and moxidectin are ivermectin (a broad spectrum anti-parasitic drug) derivatives and have shown to be specifically effective against ear mites. These are both prescription products, and will thus need to be supplied by your veterinarian. Their mode of action is to disable the parasite by interfering with their nerve conduction. This results in paralysis and eventual death of the mite.


Selamectin, in particular, is usually effective against ear mites. This drug works specifically by stimulating release of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) which paralyzes the mites by blocking the neurotransmission of muscle fibers. Products containing selamectin are marketed in the UK as ""Stronghold,"" and in the US as ""Revolution.

, The mites pass readily between animals, and exposure to ear mites on another dog can quickly lead to re-infection, even while you are treating the affected dog.However, as a rule, no medications are licensed for use in pregnant or nursing dogs, and puppies less than 12 weeks of age. This is because the effect of the active ingredients on this group of animals has not been tested by manufacturers and cannot be verified as safe.

, Always get an accurate weight for any dog you plan to treat using spot-on remedies. Dosages depend on the dog's weight, and just making an ""educated guess"" can lead to over- or under-dosing your dog. Specifics will be printed on the packaging. Be sure to read these carefully, even if you've treated your dog for ear mites before, because proper dosages and usage instructions can vary from product to product.


Usually, around 2.5mg/kg is recommended for moxidectin (which is applied directly to the skin on the back of the neck).
Again, see the pack insert for specifics. However, the above is generally equivalent to:

0.4ml of moxidectin product for 3-9 lb. dog
1ml for 9.1-20 lb. dog
2.5ml for 20.5-55 lb. dog
4ml for 55.1-88 lb. dog
For dogs over 88 lb. an appropriate combination of packs should be used. Talk to your vet to determine the best combination for your situation.



, The placement of the medication will depend on the size of the dog and the volume of product to be applied. However, spot-on treatment will be often be applied to either the back of your dog's neck or between its shoulder blades. To apply spot-on treatment to one of the these locations: Ensure you're using the right amount of the ingredient. As stated above, different concentrations of the active ingredient are necessary, depending on the size of the dog, so you should be absolutely positive that you are using the recommended pipette strength for your pet’s weight.
Part the hair and place the tip of the tube onto a visible area of skin.
Squeeze the tube three or four times until the container has been emptied.
Avoid petting the area for a few hours after application to prevent the product from being spread to your hands.

, Some spot on treatments can be reapplied once a month for continued protection. If you find that your dog is frequently affected by ear mites, this might be a good option for you. Check with your vet to determine the best product to use in this case.

"
As a last resort, ask your vet about using an injectable agent.,
Know when this is not an option.",How to Remove Ear Mites from a Dog3," There are no licensed injectable veterinary medicines for use against ear mites. However, Ivermectin Cattle Injection can be effective in extraneous circumstances. As mentioned above, the ivermectin family of drugs acts by inhibiting nerve transmission in arthropods, causing paralysis and eventual death of the parasite.


Because ivermectin is not approved for this purpose, it should be reserved as a treatment of last resort for difficult-to-handle animals where more traditional intervention is not possible.Ivermectin 1% Injectable (cattle formulation) is usually dosed at 200 micrograms/kg body weight, given by subcutaneous injection (a shot), two weeks apart.

, Ivermectin should never be used in Collies, Australian Shepherds, Long-haired Whippets and Shelties. These breeds have a genetic mutation which means the drug can penetrate the blood brain barrier, cause CNS toxicity, non-reversible coma, and possibly death.


Certain dogs have similar sensitivities. An intolerance to this drug is not necessarily predictable by breed – all the more reason to avoid this alternative if possible.It is not advised for use in small animals because it is so potent. If your pup is small, this is not an option unless given the go-ahead by your vet. Only owners of large, difficult-to-handle dogs should entertain this option.

"
"
Clean your dog's ears regularly.,
Recognize the symptoms of ear mites.,
Know how difficult it is to spot the mites.,
Realize that all dogs in the house may need to be treated.",How to Remove Ear Mites from a Dog4," Regular ear cleaning with a ceruminolytic agent (meaning a solution that softens earwax) will help reduce the levels of wax the ear mites feed on.This makes the ear canal a less attractive environment for the mites.


The frequency of cleaning will depend on how waxy your dog's ears usually get. As a general rule, clean the ear and if the cotton wool comes away soiled, clean again the following day, and so on until the cotton wool comes away clean. Then, clean weekly (or more frequently, if necessary).

, Keep an eye out for symptoms so that you can catch a re-emergence early. Watch for signs of irritation around the head and neck such as:


Shaking and/or scratching his ears
Itchiness centered around the head and neck
A thick, dark brown waxy discharge in one or both ear canals
Excoriation around the temples
The dog holds his head to one side
You have multiple dogs in a household who have thick, brown wax in their ear canals

If you do spot any of these symptoms and/or behaviors, go to your vet as soon as possible. He or she will be able to ascertain the cause of these symptoms and make sure the culprit is ear mites.



, Ear mites are tiny parasites, measuring less than half a mm, and only just visible to naked eye. Mites are also photophobic (afraid of light) and tend to live deep within the ear canal, so you need a special instrument, called an auroscope, to see them.


Alternatively, your vet may smear a sample of wax from the affected ear onto a slide and examine this under the microscope to look for adult mites, larvae or eggs.

, As already mentioned, ear mites are easily transferred between animals. To stop a dog becoming re-infected, be sure to treat all animals that come in contact with your pet, or they may re-infect the clean animal.

Bathe your dog less.,
Use better shampoo.,
Brush his fur.,
Expose his skin to more humidity.",How to Prevent Coat Dryness in Dogs2," One common cause of dry skin is extraneous bathing. If you bathe your dog too often, you can cause his skin to dry out, even during warm weather. Unless under the advice of your vet, you only need to bathe your dog every three months. If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors, you may need to bathe him more often.


If this is the case, only bathe your dog when absolutely necessary. The extra baths will pull much needed moisture from your dog's skin., Another common cause of dry skin is harsh dog shampoo. Look for better quality shampoos with conditioners such as vitamin E, aloe vera, or tree tea oil. To avoid additional skin irritation, use warm, clean water to rinse off the suds.


No not use dishwashing detergent. These soaps have harsh ingredients that will remove protective oils from your dog's skin.Always follow label instructions on the shampoo you buy.

, In between baths, brushing your dog's hair can help keep his skin healthy. Make a routine to brush your dog every couple of days. Brushing the fur will help calm your dog and move around natural skin oils to prevent dryness.


You may need to brush him every day if his fur is long and thick., To prevent dryness in your dog's skin, you can expose his skin to more humidity. Dry air is common in certain situations where natural humidity is lacking, such as the northeast and southwest regions of the United States, during the winter months, and in houses that use central heating and air.Use a humidifier in your home, especially in the room where your dog spends most of his time. This will add moisture into the air.


Also make sure that your dog always has fresh water. His skin will also be helped through this hydration as well.

"
Feed your dog high quality food.,
Give him omega fatty acids.,
Try omega fatty acid supplements.,
Use vitamin E supplements.",How to Prevent Coat Dryness in Dogs3," The food that you feed your dog can have a huge effect on his skin health. In order for your dog's skin to have the adequate nutrients, he needs to be fed high quality food. Buy him the highest quality dog food you can afford.


When you buy foods, always read the ingredient's label. Look for foods with the first ingredient is meat, not meat by-product.
If you can't afford all natural food, look for the best food you can. Meat by-products as well as grains can be in his food, but these ingredients shouldn't appear as the first three ingredients in his food., Some nutrients can help prevent dry skin. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can help your dog's skin when the nutrient is ingested. Look for foods with these as an additive. There are some foods that are specifically made for skin and coat, so also look for those, which will have omega fatty acids in it as well as other helpful nutrients.


Since dogs don't produce this nutrient naturally, they have to get it from food., If your dog can't get omega-3s from foods, you can try giving him supplements instead. The best kinds of omega fatty acids for dogs include cold water fish oils and a few different types of algae derived oils.These supplements come in chews, liquids, and capsules and can be bought at your local pharmacy or health food store.


To give your dog the right amount, give him between 25 to 110 mgs per pound of body weight in your dog.For example, this would be about 225 to 1,000 mg of omega-3s per day for a 10 pound dog.
Never give your dog more than the upper amount. This can lead to dangerous side effects such as an upset stomach, bleeding, and wounds that have trouble healing., Vitamin E is another substance that you can give your dog to help prevent his skin dryness. These vitamins come in gel capsules and can be bought at your local pharmacy. For the proper dosage for your dog, you can ask your veterinarian for advice.


You can also use vitamin E on your dog's skin or in his bath water. It can soak in to the skin this way as well as through ingestion.
If you have a diabetic dog or he has any other disease, avoid giving him any supplements until you talk to your vet."

Purchase the right brush.,
Start brushing early.,
Set up a regular brushing schedule.",How to Keep Your Dog from Shedding1," Visit a pet store to purchase the right brushing tools for your dog. Though some brushes are designed for all coats, you may require specific kinds of tools to keep your dog’s unique coat healthy. The basic brushing tools available are:Bristle brushes, universal brushes that are god for all coats and can be used everyday
Slicker brushes, which have bent wire bristles designed to remove loose hair from the undercoat and untangle hair
Pin brushes, generally for dogs with longer hair
Mat breakers, tools to remove matted hair with minimal damage
Grooming gloves, essentially brushes designed as gloves to slip over your hand and brush dogs with short or medium length hair;
, Start brushing your dog as early as three weeks old, and make it a daily process. Use praise and petting to make it an enjoyable experience for your puppy and to keep it interested in being groomed. Use a firm, assertive voice to encourage your dog to stay still while being brushed, but avoid sounding aggressive, which could cause negative associations for your pet., Try to brush your dog every day to keep shedding to a minimum. Choose a time when your dog will be calm and cooperative (e.g. after its evening walk) and do your best to maintain the routine. Choose a brushing spot that is comfortable for both you and your pet, and cover the area with a sheet or blanket to catch stray hair."

, Let the dog smell a large towel or a small blanket. Toss it over the the dog's head, covering it completely. Start the stopwatch and see how long it takes your dog to get free. Write down the score:


30 seconds or less: 3 points
31–120 seconds: 2 points
Tries but doesn't succeed within 120 seconds: 1 point — and take off the towel for him!
Doesn't try to get free: 0 points.
You might want to practice tossing the towel over a chair beforehand. It should land in one, smooth motion., Show the dog a treat. While the dog is watching, put the treat on the floor. Lay the towel over it. Start the stopwatch and see how long the dog takes to reach the treat:


30 seconds or less: 3 points
31–60 seconds: 2 points
Tries but fails within 60 seconds: 1 point
Doesn't try: 0 points

, For this test, you need a gap low to the ground, that the dog can reach with its paws but not its muzzle. A couch might work, or you might need to make one yourself out of a pair of books and a wide plank. Weigh down the top of the plank so the dog can't easily knock it over., Place a treat underneath the plank or couch, while the dog is watching. Push it far enough underneath that the dog can't reach it with its muzzle. Encourage the dog to get the treat while you time it:


Succeeds within 2 minutes (using its paws): 4 points
Succeeds within 3 minutes (using its paws): 3 points
Fails within 3 minutes, but uses its paws: 2 points
Fails, only uses its muzzle: 1 point
Doesn't try: 0 points

, The next test is designed to challenge the dog's memory, not its problem-solving skills. To do this, the dog needs to understand what's going on. Put a treat underneath a plastic cup, then tell the dog to find it. Lift the cup to show the dog where it is. Do this about eight or ten times, until the dog learns that treats go underneath cups., Place three plastic buckets or cups upside down on the floor, a foot apart. Put a treat underneath one of the cups, while the dog is watching. Lead the dog out of the room for 30 seconds, then back. Urge the dog to find the treat.


Checks under the right cup on the first try: 2 points
Finds it within two minutes: 1 point
Doesn't find it: 0 points

, Add up all your dog's points and see how it did:


11–12 points: Canine Genius
8–10 points: Obedience School Honor Student
4–7 points: Just an Average Rex
1–3 points: I'm a Barker, Not a Thinker
0 points: You might have just tested a mop.

, This is no time to be an impartial observer, your dog's college admissions are on the line! But seriously, if the dog isn't interested, she won't even try to complete the challenges. Encourage the dog with gestures or smiles, keeping it interested but not so excited it forgets what to do.

, The dog has to cooperate to be tested. Pick a special, smelly treat to bribe it with. Soft, smelly treats are best, since the dog will notice them and eat them quickly. Cut them into small, pea-sized pieces if you plan to do all of these tests at once.


Pieces of hot dog, cooked chicken, or cheese are all good options.Use a dry, non-smelly treat when you're testing memory.

, This test works best if the dog spends a lot of time with the person testing him. A dog might not live up to its full potential if it's been living with the test-giver for less than three months., A puppy under one year old probably won't be as ""smart"" or obedient as an adult dog., Tell the dog to stay while it watches you ""hide"" a treat in a box or under a table. Once it finds the treat, hide the next one in a harder to find location. As your dog gets better at this, you can hide the treat while the dog isn't looking, and put it behind several barriers., This is a great way to challenge your dog. It works best if you've clicker trained your dog with several tricks already. Use the clicker and say ""new trick,"" then reward it for any trick it does. Repeat immediately with another ""new trick"" and only reward it if it does something new. Keep going until the dog runs out of tricks or gets confused., You can't always be around to tutor your dog. Give it some homework in the form of an interactive dog toy. These have treats hidden inside that won't fall out unless the dog solves a puzzle. Some of them even have an electronic voice to give commands, although be careful giving those to dogs with a constant chewing habit.

",How to Throw a Dog Party," Think of the occasion. Choose a theme: like lets say ""Star Wars"" and for fun make a dog parody of it ""Pug Wars"". Put pictures around of the theme and balloons.;
, If all of the party guests are toilet trained, an indoor party could work as long as you have space. If you have a securely fenced backyard, block off any precious flower beds or poisonous plants and you're good to go. You could also try a dog park or dog-friendly beach - try calling the owners and reserving some space.

, Your dog's birthday can be found by looking at his pedigree. If you don't know his big day, make one up and stick to it. Or, you could just have a party for any reason, such as Christmas or Thanksgiving. If you throw an Easter party, remember: no chocolate!

,


Make sure all the dogs you are inviting know each other, before putting all your dogs together, so that dogs won't fight, or hurt other dogs at the dog party.

, Your invitation might be a doggy bone, with a little card sent with it. Tell your friends the date, time and place, and remind them to bring their dog.


If it's your dog's birthday, you could ask for a little present to spoil Fido with.

, Disposable bowls are great for food and water. Make sure there is always lots of fresh, clean water on hand (tap water at parks may not be the best).

, What kind of party doesn't have a cake? You could just buy a white or yellow sponge (no chocolate or fudge) but that would be boring! Make a doggie birthday cake.


Treats will be needed for party games. Some treats are shaped like bones.
If you are bringing food that needs chilling, take a portable icebox or cooler with you.
Always ask owners before feeding a dog treats or food.
Remember to ask about allergies and look up foods that might be poisonous to dogs, so that you can avoid having those.

, Give the dogs the opportunity to sniff each other and get to know each other better. This will help to ensure that all the dogs get along and won't fight or be aggressive to another dog.


Tell the owners they are each responsible for ensuring the good behavior of their dog and should a dog start a fight, it either has to be separated somewhere or taken home.

, As well as the ones you provide, owners should bring their own toys, blankets and chew toys


Chew toys are just one of the many kinds of toys dogs play with. Check that the toy can't be swallowed, or harm the dogs in any way.

, You could set up a simple agility course with jumps, tunnels and hoops. You could hold a mini dog show or obedience trial. Try races (throw a stick and see who fetches first!). Give away awards for all kinds of titles (prettiest, best tugger, fastest fetch) so that every dog gets at least one.


If it's warm, include some water games. Perhaps have a sprinkler for your doggy guests to play in. Most dogs enjoy water and they can find it pleasing to run through it.
Have a tug of war.
Throw-a-Ball game requires a nice sized ball that your doggy guests can grab and fetch, because in this game, it's whoever is the fastest, who is the top dog, just throw the ball, and see who gets it first. It provides fun time with all of the dogs together! Make sure that the ball is a good chewy ball. The ball shouldn't be able to be swallowed, or even ripped apart, because some dogs enjoy to do this.

, Choose prizes to take home, such as meaty bones, treats, or simple affection.

, When it's time for your guests to leave, they'll be able to go home with your custom goody bags. This is a nice way of ensuring everyone gets to take something home. These could include:


A couple of dog biscuits or treats
Some nice-smelling dog shampoo (try buying a bottle and filling a bit into a small container for each guest)
A $5-10 dollar voucher for a local pet store
A dog bone
A piece of the doggie birthday cake
Something about dogs or dog-styled for the owner.


Alternatively, if you really want to impress, send out invites way ahead of time and plan each guest's bag individually. Try asking owners about favourite snacks, adding little essentials for particular breeds (for example, sunscreen for hairless dogs, coat whitener for white breeds or a little flannel for a drooling breed).

Watch for the last sets of incisors and premolars.,
Look for a full set of baby teeth.,
Notice the permanent teeth coming in.",How to Tell Your Puppy's Age1," Puppies who do not have teeth that have grown in yet are newborns. They also probably haven’t opened their eyes and are still spending all their time with their mother. If the puppy has no teeth, they are up to three weeks old., Canines are the four pointy teeth that dogs have. There are two on the top and two on the bottom. These are the first teeth to come in. They will start to come in between three to four weeks of age., The incisors are the small teeth in the front of the mouth between the canines. Two sets of incisors will be the next teeth that come in for puppies. They come in around four to five weeks of age., Premolars are the teeth that are right beside the canines. Between four to six weeks, the first two sets of premolars will grow into the puppy’s mouth., The last sets of these teeth come a few weeks after the first sets. The last set of incisors will grow in around five to six weeks of age, and the last four premolars will come at six to eight weeks., By eight weeks, the puppy will have all their baby teeth. They are very sharp. As the puppy grows between eight and sixteen weeks, the head and jaw will grow, which will cause the teeth to have spaces between them. They will also start to look too small for the puppy’s mouth., Between sixteen weeks and eight months, the baby teeth will fall out and be replaced with permanent teeth. They start in the front with the incisors. The teeth will be replaced in order through the mouth. The older your puppy is, the farther back the transitioning between the teeth will be.Most baby teeth are all gone by five months, and all adult teeth will be visible between eight to twelve months.

Brush your dog before bathing it.,
Choose the right shampoo.,
Shampoo your dog.,
Rinse its coat.,
Dry your dog.",How to Keep Your Dog from Shedding2," As a general rule, it is always best to brush your dog before bathing it to remove mats that will make shampooing difficult. Start brushing your pet at its rear legs and move upwards. Brush against the grain of its coat to ensure that the water penetrates it more easily. Pre-bath brushing also removes dead or loose hair that would a nuisance when washing.

, Always opt for a shampoo made for dogs when bathing your pet, available at pet stores and online. Regular shampoos are harsher than dog shampoo, which is designed with a specific PH level for dogs. Human shampoo will wash away protective, essential oils from your dog's coat, leaving it open to bacteria and parasites.To further protect your dog’s sensitive skin, opt for a dog shampoo with no artificial fragrances or colors added.

, Lead your dog into the shower and have it stand on a towel or non-slip mat on the shower floor. Wet and shampoo your dog’s coat from back to front, lathering gently. If your dog has thick fur, try using a brush to run the shampoo through its coat rather than using your fingers., Using a removable shower head or bowl for water, rinse the shampoo out of your dog’s coat. Be sure to remove all residue, which can cause skin irritation if left on the skin’s surface. Take care to avoid getting water in your dog’s eyes when rinsing., Gently squeeze extra water out of your dog’s coat. Take a step back to let it shake off excess water, then pat it down with a large towel. Turn your blow dryer to low setting and gently blow dry your dog to remove excess water. Hold the blow dryer at a distance to remove overheating your dog or matting its hair."

Visit your veterinarian.,
Check your dog for fleas.,
Feed your dog quality food.",How to Keep Your Dog from Shedding3," If your dog is shedding too much, visit your veterinarian to rule out health problems. The vet can run tests to determine if a medical issue like a dietary deficiency, hormonal imbalance, or parasites are the cause of your pet’s shedding, and treat it accordingly. Be sure to advise them about any recent changes to your dog’s diet, behavior, or living situation., Monitor your dog for signs of fleas by looking out for scratching and skin irritation, and check its fur for dark brown-black insects, which can sometimes be seen moving on your pet’s skin. When grooming your dog, run a fine comb through its fur, close to the skin, and tap it onto a white piece of paper to make fleas visible. If you see fleas, bring your pet to the veterinarian right away to find out the best treatment options., Food intolerances or allergies can cause a host of skin problems in dogs and affect the health of their coat. Regular, commercial dog food is often made with low-quality ingredients like corn, soy, and low-grade meat. Shop for a minimally-processed dog food, or supplement your dog’s regular food with whole foods to offer it a more well-balanced diet."

Look for small puppies with closed eyes.,
Notice if the puppy is just starting to walk.,

Watch for increased chewing and playing.,
Monitor the puppy’s growth.,
Watch for a change in their coat.,
Watch for behavioral problems.,
Determine if the puppy has slowed their growth and development.,
Take the puppy to the vet.",How to Tell Your Puppy's Age2," Puppies up to two weeks old are tiny in size. They haven’t opened their eyes yet. The puppies do not move around very much and stay close to their mother. They mainly only root, feed from the mother, and sleep., Puppies open their eyes when they are around two to three weeks old. They start walking and adventuring out of the litter box during this time. They appear to become more aware of their surroundings and they begin to explore on their own. This is characteristic of puppies up to around five to six weeks old., Puppies generally get their food from their mother until between five to seven weeks old. Puppies who are transitioning to eating solid foods and who are becoming independent of their mother are probably around six to eight weeks old., As the puppy grows, they start becoming more active. By eight weeks old, the puppy is acting how people typically expect a puppy to act. Because their teeth are coming in, they begin chewing on things. They also begin playing in an energetic manner and exploring everything around them.They may also start acting restless or whining due to their teeth.
They will also spend a lot of time sleeping in between playing and chewing.

, Puppies have a growth spurt between eight and sixteen weeks of age, and then they continue visibly growing over the next several months., As they age, puppies will lose their puppy coats and gain their adult coat. Puppy coats are very soft, while adult coats are denser and thicker., Puppies who are between six to twelve months old will start testing their boundaries. They get an increase in energy and are distracted easily by everything. They may start chewing more things around the house, and they love to explore and may wander off.At this age, the puppy may ignore you and forget behaviors they previously learned.

, Most puppies will have reached their full size by the time they are between eight and twelve months old. Larger breeds will continue growing for up to two years. A dog under two years is still considered an adolescent. They have some puppy-like qualities, like chewing and energy, but they may have calmed some.Puppies between eight to twenty-four months are clumsy and may develop skin problems, like puppy mange.

, If you are unable to figure out how old the puppy is based on the teeth or developmental stage, you can take them to the vet. The vet will be able to look at the size and breed, along with the teeth, and give you a fairly accurate estimated age.

Whenever you first get a puppy, you should take them to the vet to get a checkup. The vet can tell you their age during your first visit.

Look for a tag on the dog's collar.,
Feel for the microchip.,
Get a definitive answer by getting the dog scanned.,
X-ray the dog.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Microchipped1," If the dog is wearing a collar take a look to see if it has a specific tag that says the dog is microchipped. Microchips are made by different manufacturers, and these companies usually issue a metal tags to place on the dog's collar to alert interested parties that the dog is chipped.The tag is supplied in part to let anyone that finds a dog know that it is chipped in order to scan them but it is also a visual deterrent to potential thieves thinking of stealing the dog, since the dog has permanent ID as belonging to someone else.If the dog does not have an official ID tag on their collar, look for a bespoke collar tag bearing wording such as ""I am microchipped"" or ""microchipped."" Know that this is not the same as a tag engraved with the dog's name and phone number. The purpose of this tag is purely to alert the finder that the dog is chipped and should be scanned. This type of tag usually does not carry personal details.;
, If the dog has lost their collar or there is no tag on the collar, try gently feeling for the presence of the microchip. The microchip is encased in a perspex coat that is the size and shape of a grain of rice. Microchips are injected under the skin in the loose skin of the neck at the centerline between the shoulder blades. Therefore this is the ideal place to start feeling.Run your fingertips over the skin between the shoulder blades and neck. Apply gentle pressure to see if you can detect a firm rice-grain sized object just under the skin. Microchips do bed in, which means they can migrate slightly from the original implant site.
To reduce the chance of missing a microchip, work in a methodical manner working up and down between shoulder and head and then left to right working side to side from the shoulders up the neck until every inch is covered.
This is not a foolproof method. If you can't feel a chip it does not mean the dog is definitely not chipped because the chip may be present but have shifted location or is embedded too deeply to feel.

, Even if the dog doesn't have a tag that says it has a chip and you don't feel one, it's best to scan the dog to find out. It is worth scanning for a microchip if you are trying to get the contact details of a lost dog's owner.

, Microchips show up on x-ray. While this is not routinely used as a method to check if a chip is present, in cases where a chip was implanted and has stopped working, taking a radiograph of the dog is a quick and easy way to check the chip is still in place but not working.

Find the right setting.,
Get your dog’s attention.,
Try to anticipate your dog’s movements.,
Get low to the ground.,
Limit photo sessions to half an hour.,
Try different angles.,
Reward the dog.",How to Take Great Photos of Your Dog1," Many pet photographers feel that the best place to photograph a dog is outdoors because this is a very natural environment for the dog.However, you can also think about your dog’s personality when figuring out where to take the photos. For example, if your dog really loves his bed, then try taking a few photos there. Try to think of the place that your dog seems the happiest, and use that as your setting.


Don’t forget to try out a few different locations. For example, take a few pictures in your dog’s favorite indoor location, but try taking some outside too.;
, If you are taking still shots and you want the dog to look at the camera, then have the dog sit in the desired position. Once your dog is still, get him to look at you by calling his name or showing him a treat.If you have someone to help you, have them hold the treat where you want the dog to look. Use a happy tone of voice when you talk to the dog so that your dog will look happy and excited in the photo.
If you want the dog to look at the lens, you can use a treat or a squeaky toy and hold it with one hand next to the lens. If you use a squeaky toy, squeeze it a few times to get the dog to look at you.

, When taking action shots, it can be tricky to get your dog at just the right moment. Spend some time observing how your dog moves before trying to catch the perfect photo. This way you’ll be able to better anticipate your dog’s next move.For example, does your dog tend to run in short, quick bursts or does he jog along slowly? Do they make a particular facial expression when they’re about to try to catch something? Do they make a noise before they take off running? All of these will help you anticipate your dog’s next move more easily.

, You can take some pictures looking down at your dog, but this is the normal human perspective. To make your photos interesting, try getting down on your knees or on your stomach and getting a dog’s eye view of the world.You can also take pictures from various heights. Take some pictures sitting on your knees, and take some pictures while you’re laying on your stomach. You can even take some pictures lying on your back with your dog looking down into the lens.

, If you want a portrait shot of your dog, then start your photo shoot with the still shots. After you’ve taken several shots of your dog sitting still, move on to action shots. Don’t force your dog to sit still for hours. This will not be fun for the animal. Instead, start your sessions with a few still shots and then let your dog play while you capture action shots.Don’t be afraid to run around and play with your dog, snapping shots when you can. This will keep it fun for both of you, and you’re more likely to catch a shot of your dog looking happy.
If your dog isn’t cooperating, don’t try to force the situation. This will leave both of you feeling frustrated. Instead, give up for the day, and try again tomorrow. Don’t punish your dog. Taking photos isn’t something that he understands naturally.

, Getting low to the ground can help you capture great photos of your dog, but don’t be afraid to be creative. Try taking pictures of your dog from several different angles. You might capture a really great photo of your dog by doing this.For example, stand behind the dog and take his picture from behind. Take a picture with the lens pointing directly down at your dog’s face. Try lying down on the ground and take a picture looking up. You could even try turning the camera upside down and take a picture that way.

, If you are taking still shots and your dog is following a lot of commands (e.g. sitting still, looking directly at the lens, etc.) don’t forget to reward your dog with a treat. This will help your dog understand that he is doing the right thing, and photo sessions are a positive thing."

Check the scanner.,
Scan the dog's shoulders.,
Check other places on the dog's body.",How to Tell if a Dog Is Microchipped2," First, the operator needs to check that the scanner is working by pressing the 'on' button and passing the sensor over a test chip. If the scanner bleeps and displays a number it is working. If the batteries are dead the display will either remain blank or display a message ""low battery.""


If the scanner is working but has not scanned a microchip after a set period of time it displays the message ""no chip found.""

, Turn on the scanner and hold it one inch above the skin. Move the scanner in up and down sweeps from the shoulder to neck and then from side to side. When the scanner activates, make a note of the number.

, If no chip is found with a methodical scanning pattern over the shoulders, don't give up. Pass the scanner over the remainder of the body. This includes under the sternum and around the armpits, just in case it has migrated to an unusual location.

Inspect your dog regularly.",How to Take Your Dog Camping," Keep in mind that your dog will likely encounter other animals and people on your trip. Consider how well it responds to and interacts with strangers at home and on your walks together. If it tends to treat everything as a threat, choose a campground where individual camp sites are spread far apart from each other. Avoid ones where they're clustered together so your dog isn't constantly spooked by other campers.The dog’s breed can be a huge factor in this. Some breeds are natural guardians, others are hunters, while still others are more prone to barking, acting skittish, or wandering off.
If you’re unsure of your dog’s breed or natural traits, check out http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/characteristics.;
, Take your dog’s physical abilities, age, and size into account. Don’t force your dog to do more than it’s capable of. If it tires easily, has issues like joint problems, or is built pretty low to the ground, favor campgrounds where: Trails are short and/or close to your campsite so you won't have a long walk back.
The ground is relatively level, with fewer hills to climb and descend.
The terrain is relatively smooth and soft (i.e. grass or dirt trails rather than rocky ones).

, If you have a specific camping ground in mind, call their office or visit their website. Confirm that pets are allowed before you show up with yours. Be aware that not all sites allow dogs, and those that do may have specific rules for them., Even if your dog is already well trained, spend extra time reinforcing its obedience. Reward it with treats each time it obeys so that it associates obedience with good things. Focus on the essential commands (or your personal variation of them):Stop
Stay
Come
Leave it
Relax

, Depending on how far you have to travel and how much walking you’ll be doing while camping, start building up your dog’s endurance. Take it for longer car rides if it isn’t used to being confined in the car for very long. Also take it for longer walks so it can grow accustomed to the exertion and tire less quickly.Doing so will also help you plan your trip. For instance, you can gain a sense of how often you’ll need to take breaks while driving or hiking.
If you have woods, parks, or trails nearby, take your dog for walks there so it can grow used to the same stimuli that it will encounter later on.

, Before you go, set your tent up in the backyard. Spend time with your dog in and around it so it associates it with home and safety. Do the same with anything else that you’re going to bring if it isn’t used to it already. For instance:If you plan on crating your dog at any point on your trip, start training it to enter and stay inside (with plenty of treats as rewards) if it isn't already accustomed to a crate.
If you're bringing a canoe or other boat along, spend time with your dog onboard while it's docked or on its trailer before taking it out on the water.
If your dog isn't used to camp fires, build one in your backyard or spend time in front of a fireplace so it grows used to the sight, smells, and sounds without getting spooked.

, Keep in mind that dogs grow very accustomed to set schedules. Expect them to behave differently when those schedules are upset. Before you introduce it to strange environments and different routines, test its ability to adapt to them by:Feeding it at different times than normal.
Going to places it’s never been before.
Spending more time outside than it’s accustomed to.
Upsetting its sleep schedule.

, Bring it in for a checkup to confirm that it’s up to the challenge. If your dog is due for any recommended vaccinations, have it done now. Also ask your vet if they recommend any additional vaccinations or medications for your specific trip. Particular concerns for dogs include:Fleas
Heartworm
Lyme Disease
Rabies
Ticks

, First, bring enough water for both you and your dog for the car ride there. Also contact the campground and find out if it offers a clean water source. If not, bring enough to last the whole trip. Don’t let your dog drink from any bodies of water onsite, especially if it’s standing water, since this could lead to illness.Play it safe and bring more than you think you’ll need in case of emergencies.

, First, be sure to pack one or more dishes for your dog to eat and drink out of so it doesn’t end up eating something on the ground that it shouldn’t ingest. Additionally, if you intend on leaving your personal campsite for extended periods of time, pick up some water bottles to fill up for both you and the dog so you don't dehydrate while hiking or doing other activities., Expect a switch-up in diet to possibly stress out your dog. Keep it happy by packing the same food and treats that it eats at home. As with the water, err on the side of bringing too much just in case you end up needing it., First, pick up a regular first-aid kit for yourself, as well as a pet-specific kit for your dog. Also purchase a book on first-aid instructions for pets. Follow its recommendations regarding any other emergency supplies that you should to pack for your dog if they aren't already included in its first-aid kit., Even if your dog behaves itself off-leash, bring one anyway to keep control in unforeseen circumstances. Also keep in mind that the campground may require all dogs to be leashed. Additionally, bring along a muzzle, or something that you can fashion into a makeshift one, like a bandanna or cloth napkin. You may not think you need one, and you could very well be right, but play it safe and assume you will., First, update its tags and microchip profile, if needed. If it doesn’t have either, at the very least have one or more tags listing its name, major medical concerns, and your phone number. Also fill out and laminate a card with the following information for backup:Both of your names.
All of your contact information.
Your dog’s medical history and vaccination records.

, Keep in mind that your dog is probably accustomed to sleeping on something softer than the ground. Bring a cushioned sleeping pad or something similar for it to curl up on at night. Ensure that it sleeps comfortably so it won't be all achy for the next morning's activities., Whatever activities you have planned, keep your dog’s needs in mind, too. This will depend entirely on where, when, and what you plan to do, but for example:If you’re camping in cold weather, bring blankets, coats, and jackets for your dog.
If rain is likely, bring towels and waterproof jackets.
If you’re going out on a boat, bring a floatation device for your dog, even if it’s a good swimmer.

, Find out what they are before you go. Once there, follow them to the letter. Don’t ruin your trip by getting kicked out. Possible rules may revolve around:Disposing of dog poop.
Dog-free zones within the campground.
Leash- and off-leash zones.

, If it’s allowed to go off-leash, don’t let it roam out of view. Supervise your dog at all times for its own safety. If necessary, leash it to prevent it from leaving your sight, even if the campground allows it to run off-leash., If your campsites are crowded together, keep your dog leashed at yours so it doesn’t wander into someone else’s site. Allow others to pass you on trails while you and your dog make room for them and wait for them to pass. Remember that other people may have no interest or even feel threatened by dogs, so always pay them deference unless they show genuine interest in interacting with your dog., Give your dog a thorough check periodically throughout each day. Definitely do so after each hike or whenever it has wandered through high vegetation. Look for and deal promptly with issues like:Thorns, burrs, or anything else that might be causing your dog pain.

Ticks and other insects.

However, dry food isn’t as tasty as wet food so some dogs reject them or don’t eat as well. Make sure the dog has access to fresh water, as he won't derive any moisture from the food.;
, Canned food are much tastier for dogs to eat and have the added benefit of adding extra moisture to the diet. However, owners that feed canned food have to be vigilant with their dog’s teeth as these types of food tend to lead to an increase in plaque and dental tartar build up.


Canned food tends to be a bit more expensive than dry foods.
You will have the added mess of disposing of the can.

, Semi-moist foods aren’t as prevalent as canned and dry foods. They are a little easier to store and clean up after than canned foods, but liked canned foods they can lead to plaque and tartar build up on the teeth. They can also be more expensive to feed as dry foods.

, Raw diets are fine for dogs as well, although a bit more time consuming to prepare and store correctly. If you want to feed a raw food diet for your dog, it is absolutely vital to contact an animal nutritionist. Make sure your dog is receiving all the nutrients he or she needs.Dogs do have different nutritional requirements than humans.

, There are many kinds of foods suitable for humans that should never be fed to your dog, since they are toxic for dogs. These include:


Alcohol
Avocados
Grapes and raisins
Chocolate
Any food containing the sweetener Xylitol
Coffee and tea
Fruit pits or apple seeds
Garlic and onions
Walnuts and macadamia nuts
Dough made with yeast

, The most important factor is that the food is high quality. This means being able to read and understand the label. Most dogs will do just fine on a commercial dog food as long as you remember to read the ingredient list on the can or bag to ensure the food is healthy. These are listed in order of the most prevalent food in the food.


Meat should be the number one (and preferably the second) ingredient on the list, followed by a grain. By-products are fine but they should be far down the list.
You can always ask your veterinarian for advice in choosing food for your dog.

, By far the biggest nutritional problem seen in pet dogs is obesity.You should always follow feeding recommendations from the food manufacturer when feeding your dog. This means actually using a measuring cup to measure the correct amount of food on a daily basis. There is usually a recommended feeding allowance on the food can or bag.


Follow this advice and limit treats to one or two a day and your dog should remain fit., Adult dogs over a year should be fed two times a day. Dogs older than two years can be fed once a day.


Large breed dogs or dogs with large chests should be fed small meals two to three times a day to prevent bloat, and never exercised immediately after eating. This can be a serious medical issue for some dogs.

, Puppies younger than three months need to be fed their daily allowance split into three or four feedings. Puppies younger than a year need to be fed two to three times a day.

, By watching your dog’s body condition you can gauge if your dog is at its ideal weight or if it needs to lose a few pounds or, more rarely, gain a few pounds. A dog at its ideal weight will have a “tuck” in its abdomen. Looking from the side its abdomen will slope up towards its back legs. Looking from the top it will have a healthy hourglass figure. When you feel the ribs with your hands you will easily feel each rib through a modest fat covering.


Thin dogs will have an extreme tuck and you will be able to easily feel the ribs--in dogs with short hair you will be able to see the ribs. If a dog is thin try adding 10% of its normal food allowance to its daily diet.
In overweight or obese dogs the tuck will disappear and the ribs will be difficult to feel (overweight) or nearly impossible to feel (obese). If a dog is overweight or obese take away 10% of its normal food allowance.
Check your dog’s body condition score again in four weeks. If it’s still thin or fat, adjust the diet by 10% again.
Consult your veterinarian if you have any concerns.

, In addition to a healthy diet, exercise will also keep your dog fit and give him good mental and physical stimulation. At a minimum, your pet pal will appreciate a twice daily walk. Pay attention to the dog during walks, and interact and play with them. Make the walks interesting by going to different locations.


The length will depend upon the age and breed of your dog: puppies and small breed dogs will need shorter walks (about 15 minutes maximum), while larger breeds or more athletic dogs may require up to one hour of exercise a day.
Brachycephalic dogs (think of dogs with pushed-in noses like bulldogs) do best with short walks (about 10 minutes) three to four times a day.
Of course, no dog should do much exercise until it has been conditioned to exercise just like a human athlete., If your dog suffers from a medical condition such as arthritis or diabetes, take care with exercising. An arthritic dog’s joint pain may make him less inclined to go for a walk. Talk to your vet about light exercise regimens, as well as treatments or pain-relievers for your dog.


Older dogs with arthritis would do best with short walks (about 10 minutes) three to four times a day.

, Another fabulous way to exercise a dog and have fun at the same time is to play interactive games. Fetch the ball is a great game to play as long as it is inside an enclosed park or yard to make sure your dog can’t run away during the heat of the game.


Blowing bubbles for your dog to chase is another fun game where you don’t have to expend much energy.

, Make sure the weather is not going to adversely affect your dog when you go out to exercise. If it is too hot, your dog may be at risk of heatstroke. If it’s too cold, your dog can be susceptible to frostbite., If you have a puppy, he should have his first veterinarian visit by 8 weeks of age. If your puppy or dog is older than this and hasn’t been to the veterinarian yet, now is the time to schedule an appointment for an examination and to start or update vaccinations. This is important for your dog’s health. Make sure you vaccinate your dog against rabies, as this deadly disease can be caught by humans. It is a legal requirement of many states to vaccinate against rabies.

, For the first vet visit, you actually need to schedule two appointments. The first appointment will be an initial vaccination, followed in three to four weeks (depending on your vet’s recommendations) by a booster vaccine. This will ensure that your puppy’s immune system is “primed” to fight any invading diseases.


The veterinarian will discuss vaccines required in your area. The basic vaccines include distemper, rabies, and possibly Lyme vaccine.
Vaccines are generally boostered at intervals of every year or every other year. Veterinary clinics will usually send you a reminder in the mail or via e-mail a few weeks prior to the due date for routine vaccinations after the first one is given.

, Another important health concern is heartworm disease. This nasty pest is spread by mosquitoes and lives in dog’s hearts, causing misery and ill health. Your dog will need a test to make sure it is free from this pest. Heartworm preventative should also be started as soon as possible to prevent this disease if your dog is given the all-clear. This is either a shot that will protect your dog for up to six months, or a monthly heartworm pill that your dog eats.


If your dog tests positive for heartworm, the veterinarian will discuss treatment options which generally consists of further blood work, heart X-rays, and a (painful) treatment consisting of shots of a harsh medication and oral medication.

, Your veterinarian will also recommend routine de-worming for your dog. Puppies generally will be given a deworming treatment at their vaccination appointments to make sure they are free of roundworms and hookworms, two common intestinal pests of puppies.


Your dog’s stool will be examined at follow-up vaccination appointments to make sure your dog is free from intestinal parasites.

, This operation helps control dog overpopulation and prevents some problems: male dog fighting, reproductive tract cancers, and stops male dog roaming. If your dog isn’t already spayed or neutered, schedule this procedure with your vet.

, Dogs, just like humans, build up plaque on the teeth and need to have it removed.Get a dog toothbrush from your vet or a pet supply store, along with dog toothpaste. Don’t use human toothpaste, which usually contains fluoride and can be harmful to dogs.


Place a small amount of dog toothpaste on your fingertip. Gently run your finger along the gums of the upper teeth to get the dog used to the toothpaste.
If your dog accepts this, the next day do the same with a bit of the toothpaste on a dog toothbrush. Get the bristles of the brush along the gum line of the upper back teeth and angle slightly up, so the bristles get under the gum line.
Work from back to front, making small circles along the gum lines for about 30 seconds.
Ideally, you should brush your dog’s teeth every day. At least, aim for several times a week.You can also try special dental food which is formulated to be able to grind off the plaque as the dog chews. Treats like rawhides or dental treats work in the same manner.

, Have a veterinarian or technician demonstrate on your dog how close to the quick (the growing portion) you can trim the nail before you try to do so yourself. The quick contains blood vessels and nerves which will painfully bleed if clipped.


Have someone hold the dog still for you the first few times you clip the nails.
Start with the back nails. These nails are usually shorter and dogs are more comfortable with having the back paws handled.
Locate the quick or approximate area before trimming off the end of the nail. Carefully work your way back towards the quick. Trim at least two to three millimeters in front of it.
Proceed with the rest of the paws, giving plenty of praise as your dog behaves for the process.

, Dogs need a good brushing regardless of their coat length. This is a good way to bond with your dog. It also gives you a chance to monitor the health of your dog’s skin.


For long-haired dogs, purchase a stripper type of comb to help remove hair that is being shed. Comb through your dog’s hair at least every other day, if not daily. Otherwise, your dog’s fur may form painful mats. These just aren’t ugly to look at, as they can also cause the skin underneath it to get infected.
For short-haired dogs, use a soft-bristled brush to remove loose hair and stimulate the skin.

, Brushing time is the time to check your dog’s skin for parasites (fleas), lumps or bumps. You can also check for hair loss, inflammation and scratches or other injuries as well.If you see fleas, act immediately to treat your dog, its bedding, and your house before they get out of hand. Topical treatments and household insecticides are the best ways to curb an exploding flea population. Veterinarian office staff or pet store staff can give you great advice to kill fleas both on your dog and in your home.

, If your dog needs a bath, use an all-purpose dog shampoo. Follow the directions on the bottle. Don’t go overboard with bathing your dog. Most dogs only need a bath once a month at most. A dog’s skin can dry out from more frequent bathing.


If you have a dog that gets dirty or smelly more frequently, you may need to bathe it more often. Use your discretion, and contact your vet with any questions.

, The most important lesson you can teach your puppy or dog is to relieve himself in a designated spot. This is preferably outside in an out-of-the-way spot.

, As you start house training your dog, give your dog lots of opportunities to relieve himself. Take him outside frequently, up to every half-hour. Puppies especially have small bladders and need to go often.

, Carefully watch your dog or puppy to see when he needs to relieve himself when he’s inside the house. You may observe panting, packing, sniffing around, or barking. Immediately take your dog outside if they make moves like this.


Make sure to go overboard with the praise when he does relieve himself outside.
If your dog has an accident inside, don’t scold or hit him. Just quietly clean up the mess and try again.

, When your dog relieves himself outside, lavish him with praise and pet him. Give him a treat. Make sure to do these things right away so that your dog associates them with going potty.

, Make sure to always keep baggies to clean up any solid dog waste immediately. There is no excuse for not cleaning up after your dog. Besides being disgusting, leaving solid waste around is a way to spread disease.

, Until you can be sure your puppy or dog is house trained, confine her to a small space (bathroom, mud room, laundry room) with an easily cleaned floor.


This is especially important if you can’t keep constant track of your puppy. House training puppies requires constant supervision.

, Crate training uses a dog kennel to keep the dog in when you aren’t around. Don’t worry: if the dog is trained to use the crate, he will generally view it as a safe haven from any daily hubbub. Place the crate in the living room with the door open and a comfortably blanket inside. Encourage the dog to go into the crate on its own by tossing a treat inside. After a few times of doing this over the course of a couple of days, shut the door behind the dog and leave it closed for 10 minutes. Gradually increase the amount of time the dog goes into the crate like this until he is fine with staying in there (no whining or crying) for up to four hours.


Make sure the crate is appropriately sized for your dog. He should be able to stand normally without a hunched back inside the crate. The crate should also be roomy enough for him to turn around comfortably inside it.
Never leave a dog in a crate for longer than four hours. Don’t use it as a punishment or he will not willingly go inside the crate.

, Dogs need to learn to get along with other dogs—and humans—in order to have a good life. As an owner, it’s up to you to train your dog to be a good canine citizen. Unfortunately, bad behavior is the top reason that dogs are given up and dumped in shelters. The best way to train a dog is to use the reward system. In this system, a dog is rewarded for complying with its owner’s request through use of a small treat and a ton of praise.


Dogs are loyal and love to get in the good graces of their people. The reward system is an excellent method of training a dog quickly.
Inappropriate behavior or bad behavior is ignored for the most part, unless it poses a danger to the dog or others.

, Dog socialization means learning to be a part of human and dog society in a healthy manner. Begin socialization early in your puppy’s life by introducing them to normal household noises and activity in a non-threatening manner.Don’t chase your dog with the vacuum cleaner or swat him with a broom.
Take him for car rides to get him used to riding in vehicles and to introduce him to the sights through the windows.

, Dog parks are another good way to interact with other dogs and humans. Keep your dog on a leash, especially for the first few times you visit the park. DO NOT let your dog off leash unless you are certain that he gets along with other dogs and humans.

, One of the most productive ways to introduce your puppy to other puppies, humans, and normal sights and sounds is to take him to puppy socialization class. These classes are held by community education, 4-H clubs, or pet shops and give the dogs and owners a safe place to learn together. Look through your local newspaper or on-line to find classes near you.


If you need to work on socialization for your older dog, try enrolling him in an obedience class.

Choose Al Servo mode.,
Set your shutter speed.,
Choose the exposure level.,
Don’t forget that you can edit your photos.",How to Take Great Photos of Your Dog2," Sometimes it can be hard to catch your dog sitting still. Unless you are taking photos where your dog is sitting still, you will probably want to use Al Servo mode on your digital camera. This mode causes your camera to lock onto the subject, but keeps refocusing so that moving shots won’t come out blurry.If you are photographing your dog when he is sitting still or when using flash, you should use One Shot mode.

, If you are trying to catch your dog in a quick movement, such as in the middle of a jump, you’ll probably want to set your shutter speed to at least 1/250. This will keep the image crisp, and you can capture your dog doing something really cool.Slower shutter speeds may make it difficult to catch your dog in the middle of an action.
Keep in mind that a faster shutter speed will not work well in low light conditions. If you want to take action shots, try to have your photo session on a nice sunny day.

, Most photographers recommend choosing aperture priority mode when trying to photograph pets. This will bring your pet into sharp focus and the less important aspects of the photo (e.g. the tree in the background) will be less focused.On the other hand, if the background is important for the photo, you can always turn aperture priority mode off so that the camera will keep everything in focus.

, You might get a really great shot that is just a bit too dark or that has just one small flaw. Most professional photographers edit their photos using software such as Adobe Photoshop. If you’re not too familiar with all of the settings of your digital camera, you can always set it to Auto and then use an editor to make the photo just right.Be aware, though, that if you set your camera to auto your shutter speed will probably be too slow to catch any action shots. Auto will probably work great in good lighting for portrait shots, but not so well if you’re trying to catch good shots of your dog playing.

Have your phone ready to go.,
Keep it simple.,
Take photos at the right time of the day.",How to Take Great Photos of Your Dog3," You may see a great photo opportunity, but miss it because you couldn’t get your phone out fast enough to catch it. If you are able to keep your phone ready, you’ll be sure to catch any great shots of your dog.For example, try keeping your phone in your back pocket or in your hand with the camera application open.
Obviously, it wouldn’t be practical to do this all of the time, but if you’re out playing with your dog or if your dog is in a particularly playful and happy mood, then keep your camera handy.

, When you are using a digital camera, you can do lots of interesting things like zooming in on a specific part of your dog, such as the nose or eyes. Unfortunately, with a smartphone, those tricks don’t work as well. You can still get great photos, but try to keep your photographs simple and straight forward.If you want to take a close-up of your dog, get close enough so that you can see your dog’s eyes and facial expression clearly, but don’t try to focus in on a specific feature.

, With a professional camera, it is easier to work with different types of lighting, but you don’t have the same control with a smartphone camera. Try to take the photos so that your dog faces into the sun; this way that will be bright and easily visible. If it is very sunny, try taking the picture in the shade so that your dog isn’t washed out.The best time of day to take photos with a smartphone is the morning and late afternoon/early evening. During this time, the sunlight won’t be too harsh.

Dose the dog correctly.,
Give it with food, if possible.,
Apply it topically as needed.,
Watch for a reaction.,
Discuss it with your vet.,
Treat anxiety with Benadryl.,
Use Benadryl for allergies and bug bites.,
Give Benadryl to your dog for insomnia.,
Ensure your product only contains diphenhydramine.",How to Give a Dog Benadryl," Generally, you give a milligram per pound of dog. You can give it every 8 hours or so. So if your dog weighs 14 pounds, you can give 14 milligrams of Benadryl every 8 hours. However, it's always best to check with the vet for an appropriate dose.Using children's Benadryl can make dosing easier, as it comes in smaller doses.
In severe allergic reactions, a slightly higher dose may be appropriate, such as 2 milligrams per pound.
Pills are usually easiest because most dogs don't like the flavor of the liquid. However, you can use liquid Benadryl (the children's formula). Usually, every 5 milliliters of liquid has 12.5 milligrams of Benadryl.;
, You can give Benadryl without food. However, using food will lessen the chances of drooling and vomiting.Plus, it will make it easier to get your dog to take it. For instance, you can place the pill on a small piece of bread smeared with peanut butter, which your dog will likely gobble down.

, Another option is to apply the Benadryl to the skin. You can use a spray, cream, or stick. However, be sure not to apply more than a couple of times a day, and don't combine it with oral Benadryl, as that can lead to overdose.It's not as effective as an oral medication, but it can help some., While Benadryl is generally safe, any medication can cause a reaction if your dog happens to be allergic to it. Watch for stomach issues such as diarrhea and vomiting. Also notice if your dog is less interested in eating or is having trouble breathing. Agitation or a fast-beating heart is also an issue. Call your vet if you notice any of these side effects.Also, some sleepiness is to be expected with Benadryl. However, if your dog seems to be having trouble waking up or is non-responsive, you should call your vet.

, While Benadryl is generally safe for dogs, every dog is different. It's best to talk to your vet before giving your dog Benadryl, to make sure it will be safe and to get a dose recommendation.Technically, Benadryl hasn't been approved by the FDA for cats and dogs, but most vets agree it's safe.
Discussing dosage with your vet is important because dogs can overdose on Benadryl., One use for Benadryl is treating anxiety in dogs. For instance, some dogs have storm anxiety, and Benadryl can help calm them down. Often, it works best to give them Benadryl ahead of the storm.Similarly, it can also help out in the car. It can calm anxiety, and it will also assist with nausea from motion sickness., Another common use for Benadryl is to treat allergies. Dogs with allergies tend to scratch more, and if your dog has been diagnosed with allergies, Benadryl can help alleviate the symptoms.However, some experts question the effectiveness of Benadryl for general allergies. While it can be helpful for reactions like bee stings and hives, it may not help as much with the itchy skin that comes with canine allergies., One of Benadryl's side effects is drowsiness. In fact, it's used in many over-the-counter sleep aids. That's why it can help your dog with insomnia if you give it to the dog before bedtime., In the United States, most products with the Benadryl label only contain diphenhydramine. However, this ingredient has fallen out of use in other countries. For instance, in the UK, cetrizine is the active ingredient instead. While this ingredient is also dog-safe, it won't have all the same effects."

Determine whether tumor removal is necessary.,
Talk about surgical tumor removal with your vet.,
Prepare your dog for surgery.,
Have your vet surgically remove the fatty tumor.,
Place an Elizabethan collar on your dog.,
Check the incision site.,
Clean the drain.,
Administer pain medications as prescribed.,
Follow your vet's instructions.,
Take your dog back to the vet.",How to Get Fatty Tumors Removed in Dogs," To diagnose a fatty tumor in your dog, your vet will use a small needle and syringe to remove a sample from the tumor and looked at it under a microscope.After the diagnosis, you and your vet will need to decide if the tumor should be removed. Usually, a fatty tumor can be left alone. Below are some reasons why a fatty tumor would need to be removed:Tumor is growing rapidly, or growing again after a period of no growth
Tumor has changed appearance (smooth to lumpy) or texture (soft to hard)
Body functions are affected by tumor size and location (difficulty walking, breathing, or swallowing) or causing pain (from pressure on the nerves)
Tumor location (paw, armpit, thigh) makes removal difficult because there may not be enough skin to close the surgical wound
Dog is bothering the tumor (biting, scratching), potentially causing skin damage and infection;
, Frequently, surgical removal of a fatty tumor is a straightforward procedure. It is unlikely that your vet will encounter problems when removing the tumor. Prior to the surgery, your vet will take a blood sample to ensure your dog is healthy enough for surgery. Below are some questions you can ask your vet about the procedure:


About how long will the surgery take?
Will someone contact me after the surgery is over, or if there are problems during surgery?
Can I pick up my dog on the same day of surgery?
What care is needed after surgery?
Do we need to come back to have the sutures or staples removed? If so, when?
Are there any exercise restrictions (e.g. cage rest, leash walks only, no swimming)?

, If you and your vet decide on surgical removal, you will need to prepare your dog for surgery. Stop feeding your dog 12 hours before surgery. Also, do not allow your dog to drink water for eight hours before surgery. Your dog should have an empty stomach to prevent vomiting during surgery.If your dog vomits during surgery, the vomit could enter the lungs and cause a serious condition called aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia requires veterinary treatment.
Before surgery, make sure your vet is aware of all medications your dog is taking.If your dog has a medical condition, ask your veterinarian about any special pre-surgical preparations, especially if your dog has diabetes and takes insulin.
Your vet will provide you with other pre-surgery instructions, such as when to give your dog vital medications (heart disease medications, insulin) and what time to bring your dog in for surgery.Follow all instructions to ensure your dog is prepared for surgery.
If your veterinarian does not provide you with any guidelines for preparing your dog for surgery, take it upon yourself to ask.

, Fatty tumors are usually situated between the skin and underlying muscle, making surgical removal easy. If the fatty tumor is large, there may be a large empty space where the tumor used to be. To prevent this space from filling up with fluid and causing post-surgical problems, your vet may place a surgical drain in that space.Surgical drains are typically left in for three to five days.Expect your dog to have sutures (either just under the skin or on the skin) or staples that close the incision. Sometimes a pressure wrap or bandage is used to prevent buildup of fluid in the space where the tumor was removed.

, This is very important! Your dog will probably want to lick or chew at the surgical incision. However, doing so could delay healing and possibly infect the wound. An Elizabethan collar, commonly known as an e-collar, will prevent your dog from reaching the incision.Your dog will need to wear the e-collar until it’s time for a follow-up visit with your vet.


Most e-collars are plastic and shaped like a hood. Others are fabric and not shaped like a hood. Your vet will probably place the e-collar on your dog shortly after surgery.
E-collars can be awkward for dogs. If your dog is having trouble eating with the e-collar on, consider taking it off during your dog's mealtime. Just make sure you watch your dog to ensure they don't begin licking the wound.
Plastic e-collars can also get dirty over time. If your dog has a plastic e-collar, wipe the inside of it with a damp cloth when it gets dirty.

, It is normal for a surgical incision to look a little red for a few days after surgery. When you examine the incision, make sure it is clean and that its edges are touching each other. If the incision site is extremely swollen or is continuously bleeding, contact your vet.Examine the incision site at least once each day.
Other than swelling or bleeding, check for green or yellow discharge coming from the incision site. Green or yellow discharge indicates infection. Redness and warmth around the incision site can also indicate infection.

, If your vet inserted a surgical drain, you may need to clean it at home to keep it from clogging. If your vet advises you to clean the drain, do so twice a day. Use a damp cloth to gently clean the drain with warm, slightly salty water (not soap).Sometimes, the fluid seeping from the incision can irritate the skin around the drain.Gently clean the skin around the drain with warm, soapy water and a damp cloth.Your vet may tell you to just examine the drain without cleaning it.

, After surgery, your dog will probably be in some pain. Your vet will prescribe a few days' worth of pain medication for your dog.The medication will either be in pill form or liquid form.


If you have to give your dog a pill, try hiding the pill in a tasty treat.
For liquid pain medication, your vet may either pre-fill the syringes or prescribe the amount that you should draw up into the syringes.
Place the medication-filled syringe in one of the corners of your dog’s mouth. Once your dog’s mouth opens, gently empty the contents into your dog’s mouth, allowing your dog to swallow the medication.
If your dog will not take their medicine or if you think the medication is making your dog sick (vomiting, not eating, diarrhea), stop giving it to your dog and call your veterinarian for advice.

, Carefully following your vet's at-home care instructions will help your dog make a full recovery from surgery. If you are unsure about any of the instructions, such as cleaning around the incision or administering the pain medication, ask your vet to show you the proper technique.

, A follow-up appointment after the surgery will allow your vet to remove the sutures (and surgical drain, if necessary) and closely examine the surgical site. If you notice any problems with the incision or drain, do not wait until your scheduled follow-up appointment — take your dog to your vet as soon as possible.


During the follow-up visit, consider asking these questions: Will the fatty tumors come back? Is there any way to prevent more fatty tumors from forming? What should I do if I see more fatty tumors? Does my dog have to keep wearing the e-collar?

Apply for a rabies exemption.,
Familiarize yourself with the appropriate time frames to vaccinate for rabies.,
Acquire the vaccine from a reliable supplier.,
Find a vet who does at-home visits.,
Prepare the vaccine.,
Ready the syringe.,
Give your dog the injection.,
Understand what reactions are normal.,
Monitor your dog for any effects.,
Seek medical care, if necessary.",How to Give a Dog a Rabies Shot at Home," Laws regarding rabies vaccines are strict in most states. In order to vaccinate your dog at home, you'll need your vet to apply for a rabies exemption. This is an order that grants you the authority to have the rabies vaccination performed in your home in lieu of a vet's office. Not that this exemption may not be allowed in your state.


All 50 US States require a rabies vaccine and the vast majority require dog owners to have the vaccine administered either in a vet's office, at home but under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, or by animal shelter workers, kennel owners, or other competent individuals who work with dogs professionally.Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, and North Dakota require rabies vaccinations, but have no specific laws dictating who can perform the vaccine. If you live in one of these states, you may be able to perform the vaccine yourself without supervision of a veterinarian. This is not recommended, unless you have extensive experience in veterinary care, you should hire professional help.Quite a few states allow an individuals to administer the rabies vaccine at home, if supervised by a veterinary professional. The following states allow this: Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont.However, in other states, be aware that giving the injection yourself may invalidate any rabies certification. If you need proof of rabies vaccine for travel or the like, giving the injection yourself may make it invalid.
If your state allows you to administer a vaccine at home, you need your vet to apply for a rabies vaccination exemption. Usually, if your dog has documented behavioral or health issues that make an office visit difficult, your veterinarian will probably be willing to file for an exemption if local laws permit and if you agree to follow proper protocol. If your vet is unwilling, you can find another veterinarian. Veterinarians open to more holistic medications and treatment options might be more willing to file for an extension.;
, Timing is important in a rabies vaccination. Giving the vaccination too soon could render the vaccine ineffective and waiting might leave your dog susceptible to the virus. Your puppy should be get the rabies vaccine between 12 and 24 weeks.


If you have a puppy, do not vaccinate him before three months of age, as maternal antibodies may interfere with vaccine uptake and prevent it from being effective.
Aim to vaccinate early in the morning, at a time when you can monitor your dog for at least an hour to watch for signs of serious allergic reactions.Your dog should get vaccinated ever one to three years, depending on the laws in your state.

, A vaccine is the biological substance that improves immunity against a specific diseases, so a good quality vaccine is necessary for the successful treatment of your dog.


Your local veterinarian is the best person to refer you to the best suppliers of rabies vaccines. In fact, as you'll likely have an at-home vet visit you can simply have the veterinarian safely transport the proper vaccine to your home.
You can also purchase the vaccine from online sites, but they may be of questionable quality. As certain temperatures can make the vaccine less effective, delivery and storage is tricky. If you do purchase a vaccine online, consult your vet to make sure the supplier is respected in the veterinary community and follow all instructions on the box for safe storage.
If you're worried about a reaction and are striving for a more holistic approach to vaccinations, ask your vet about Thimerosol-free vaccines. Thimerosol (mercury) has been linked to more adverse reactions in some dogs and many suppliers manufacture mercury-free vaccines., It is not recommended you perform a rabies vaccination without supervision. Legally your dog will not be considered vaccinated in the vast majority of US states if the vaccine is not administered by a veterinarian professional.


Ask your vet if she is willing to do a home visit. Many vets will do so, especially if they know your dog has issues that make an office visit difficult. You can either have your vet administer the vaccine at home or supervise you as you do it yourself.If your vet is unwilling to do home visits, or something in her license prevents this, ask her for a referral to another vet. With your permission, your vet can share your dog's medical records to assure a different veterinarian can safely vaccinate your pet against rabies.Remember, the vast majority of states require veterinary assistance during rabies vaccines. Having a dog that is legally considered unvaccinated has many repercussions. First of all, as rabies vaccines are required in every state, you could face legal penalties that vary from state-to-state. Second, unvaccinated dogs are not permitted in kennels and most animal shelters ban adoption if you have an unvaccinated pet at home.

, Read the manufacturer's manual to understand all the intricacies of your particular vaccine brand, and inspect the expiration date of your vaccine. With supervision of an at-home vet, properly mix the vaccine.


Most rabies vaccines come in the form of a powder and a liquid solvent, which need to be mixed properly before the vaccine can be administered. The manufacturer's label should inform you of proper dosages and you can also ask your at-home vet.First, insert the needle of a clean syringe into the vial of liquid. Draw out the necessary amount and then remove the syringe from the bottle.Inject the liquid into the bottle containing the powder. Make sure all liquid is drained from the syringe before you pull the needle out.Shake the vial well. The powder should completely dissolve. Make sure there are not clumps and there is no powder resting on the bottom of the vial., Now that the vaccine is properly mixed, you can prepare the syringe for the injection.


Reinsert a fresh, clean syringe into the vial. Pull up the plunger until you have drawn the exact amount of vaccine needed. You can ask your at-home vet for help if you're confused about how much of the vaccine you need.Make sure there are no air bubbles. If you notice any air bubbles, empty the vial and try again. You might have to make several attempts before you draw a vaccine clear of air bubbles.Alternatively, if you'd rather have your vet draw the amount you can do that as well. Your vet likely has more experience with these things and might be quicker and more efficient at preparing the syringe., Once the syringe is prepared, you can vaccinate your dog. The vaccine should be delivered via subcutaneous injection, as this less technically demanding and less likely to harm the dog.


Have someone hold the dog still while injecting the vaccine. Pull the skin up from your dog's shoulder blade, creating a ""tent"" of loose skin.
Angle the needle at 90 degrees to the flat tented surface of the skin. Push inward to form a small pocket of skin and slowly push the plunger down until the syringe is empty.
If you're not doing the injection, you can hold your dog while your vet performs the vaccination., Many dogs, even if they're in otherwise good health, may have a reaction to a rabies vaccine. This is usually normal and symptoms should clear up within a week.


Anaphylactic, or allergic reactions, are the most common types of reactions. They usually occur during booster shots and after the 2nd or 3rd round. Your dog might become lethargic and show a mild fever and have swelling around the site of the vaccination. Your vet might recommend antihistamines as treatment if the reaction is severe. Severe reactions, while rare, can be fatal. If you live some distance from a vet then you need to be prepared to accept this risk if considering vaccination yourself at home.Local reactions are swelling, redness, and itching about the site of the injection. They occur shortly after a vaccination and are usually not serious. They tend to pass within a few weeks.Systemic reactions are things like fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. They are common, appear shortly after an injection, and tend to pass within a few days.A serious reaction will occur within 10 to 30 minutes of the injection. The dog may collapse and go into shock and will have pale gums, a racing heart, and may lose consciousness.

, Please monitor your dog for a while after vaccination for any adverse effects.


Immediately after a vaccine, keep an eye on your dog for about an hour. Bad reactions might occur in this timeframe and medical care might be needed.
Be careful handling your dog in the days following a rabies vaccine. He will probably be sore around the site of injection and you'll want to avoid touching this area.

, Occasionally, reactions can get quite serious. If you follow proper protocol, this is rare. However, know when medical care might be needed in the event of a serious reaction.


Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is an immune response that triggers the release of red blood cells. It is unlikely to occur in response to a rabies vaccine, but not impossible. Signs include lethargy, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and diarrhea. Autoimmune reactions can be quite serious and warrant medical attention. If you notice any of the above symptoms, seek immediate medical care.If local reactions, such as swelling, or systemic reactions, such as a fever or lethargy, do not go away on their own within a few days, take your dog to see a vet to determine why the reaction is so persistent."

Relax your dog.,
Slow your dog's eating and drinking down.,
Accept that hiccuping occasionally is normal.,
Make sure your dog’s vaccinations are up to date.",How to Get Rid of Dog Hiccups1," Just as with hiccups in humans, there is no clear way to stop hiccups in dogs. However, some people swear by total relaxation as a way to eliminate hiccups. Put your dog in a comfortable spot and pet it repeatedly until it is calm. Perhaps if it is relaxed enough the hiccups will end.;
, While the underlying cause of hiccups is unknown, some argue that eating quickly, and thus taking in an excessive amount of air when you eat, can increase the likelihood of hiccups. If your dog has a tendency to eat too fast, you can purchase dog feeders designed to slow your dog's eating.There are special dog dishes that make your dog pick up their food one piece of kibble at a time. For example, the “green egg” design with solid plastic flat finger like projections is made specifically to slow a dog's eating down.
If your dog drinks too fast, dishes have been designed with plastic projections that force the dog to lap their water slowly.
Consider using a DIY solution. Find a large rock (baseball sized or larger) that you can scrub clean and place it in the center of your dog's dish to slow the dog’s eating or drinking. Only do this if your dog won’t take the rock out and play with it, as rocks can damage a dog’s teeth.

, For the most part, some hiccuping sessions in dogs are unavoidable. Just remember that the hiccups will eventually run their course without causing any harm to your dog.


Hiccups are especially prevalent in puppies. It is perfectly normal for your puppy to hiccup quite a bit., If you are worried about your dog's lung health, then get the dog checked out by a veterinarian. This way any respiratory illnesses, such as kennel cough or dog influenza, won’t be exacerbated by the hiccuping sessions.

"
"
Learn about what is happening when we hiccup.,
Differentiate between hiccups and reverse hiccups (or sometimes called reverse sneezing).,
Accept that we don't really know why hiccups happen.Some people believe that hiccups are caused by air being swallowed by the dog when it eats or drinks too fast.",How to Get Rid of Dog Hiccups2," Hiccups occur when the diaphragm, a large muscle that is central to breathing, is irritated and starts uncontrollable spasming. These spasms make the dog take a breath in at the same time as the glottis (the opening above the vocal cords) is closing. This stops the inflow of air and a hiccup occurs., Reverse hiccups are generally caused by an irritation to the throat or the sinuses.The dog takes a number of loud, involuntary breaths to clear the irritation or the sinus passages and it sounds like the air intake that happens at the beginning of a normal hiccup.


You may want to get your dog's sinuses looked at by a veterinary professional to rule out a medical condition, such as a sinus infection or a tumor, as the cause., In addition, it is thought that becoming overly excited, tired or stressed can also cause hiccups. Whatever the cause, hiccups are a natural bodily function that is not a problem under normal circumstances.


Reverse hiccups can be caused by minor tickles or irritants to the throat or sinuses or by infections or diseases of the sinuses or upper respiratory tract.

Get a splint for your dog’s foot.,
Walk your dog on a leash.,
Keep your dog in its crate.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Heal a Hunting Dog's Foot Pads1," You can help your dog heal more quickly from any kind of foot wound by limiting its activity for at least five to seven days after its injury. Get a splint for your dog’s foot to keep the pad from touching the ground and to keep weight off the pad. This can help abrasions and bruises heal more quickly., Until the foot has fully recovered, you should only take your dog on leash walks. Doing so will allow you to control what your dog is walking on, how long it is walking, and the pace at which it is walking. Limiting these things can help cut down on the likelihood that your dog will reinjure its foot before it is completely healed., It may also be necessary to keep your dog in its crate for the majority of the day while it is healing. Doing so will restrict its movement and keep it off its feet more than if it is allowed to go anywhere in the house. Again, do this for about five to seven days after the injury.


Make sure your dog has plenty of toys to play with in its crate, as well as access to fresh water at all times.
If your dog loves attention, place its crate in a high traffic area of the house. If your dog is shy or nervous, however, placing its crate in a quiet room might be better.
If you are crating your dog during the day when no one is home, you can make your dog feel more comfortable by leaving a radio playing softly or leaving the TV on while you are away.Don’t leave your dog in its crate for too long at one time. If possible, allow your dog to leave the crate every few hours. When it’s not in its crate, you can keep your dog from walking too much by using baby gates or closing doors to limit its access to just one or two rooms., Many paw pad injuries will heal significantly with rest. However, if your dog’s injury doesn’t seem to be getting better with rest and you’re not comfortable trying to treat the dog’s injuries yourself, take your dog to the vet. The vet can diagnose your dog’s injury and take care of the initial treatment.

Look for certain signs of anal gland issues.,
Have a veterinarian demonstrate anal gland expression the first time.,
Gather your materials.,
Recruit a helper if you can.,
Put on old clothes.,
Secure the dog in a small room.,
Position the dog in front of you in a standing position.,
Lift the dog's tail, rolling it up to expose its anus.,
Try not to frighten your dog.,
Locate the anal glands.,
Milk the glands upwards and inwards toward the anus.,
Watch the dog's bottom for expressed liquid.,
Stop after a few tries if nothing comes out.,
Continue to milk until the glands have emptied.,
Wipe your dog's bottom with a paper towel.,
Give the dog a treat.,
Wash the dog's rear end.,
Don't express the glands more often than necessary.",How to Express a Dog's Anal Gland," When there's a problem with the anal glands, may dogs exhibit certain symptoms, which you should learn to recognize. Be sure to ask a veterinarian if you've never had this issue before: these symptoms may be a sign of other underlying issues, such as parasites, a sore bottom from diarrhea, or a food allergy, so it's a good idea to let a vet examine your dog. This way you can either rule out these issues, or get your dog the treatment it needs.The typical signs of anal gland issues include:


Scooting
Excessive licking of the anal area
Occasional release of anal gland contents at inappropriate times (other than defecation) - you may notice a fishy odor on furnishings or coming from your dog's anus
Red skin in the anal area
Bleeding or pus drainage around the anus (this is a sign that you should call your vet as soon as possible - do not attempt anal expression);
, If you've never expressed your dog's anal glands, ask your veterinarian for a demonstration. She can do the first gland, and then you can try expressing the second one in her presence., Typically, three to four damp paper towels and a pair of latex gloves will be sufficient. If you want to wash the dog, also have ready whatever shampoo or other dog-friendly soaps you use, as well as plenty of towels.


Latex gloves are preferable to household rubber gloves as they are thinner and more sensitive, allowing you to accurately palpate the glands., While you can do this process on your own (if your dog is cooperative), it may help to have someone there to hold the dog as you work.

, The pheromones secreted by the anal glands are very stinky. It's a good idea to wear old clothes that you can take off and wash easily., Often, the bathroom works well for this purpose, especially if you bathe your dog in the tub. You just want to make sure the dog can't struggle free and run off during the process.


The dog should be on an easy-to-clean surface.
Since the process can be somewhat messy, pairing an expression with a bath is usually a smart idea.

, Its rear end should be facing you. If you have a partner, they should secure the dog by wrapping one arm around the neck and the other at the side of the body, hugging the dog close to them., You should be at level with the dog's bottom, in a position that is comfortable to maintain.


While the process shouldn't take too long (about five minutes), the first time may require a little extra time and patience. Make sure you're in a comfortable position.
The procedure won't hurt your dog, but if the glands are particularly swollen or impacted, your pet might be guarding their backside more than usual. Be careful and pay attention to your pet's body language.

, Talk to it, stroke it, and attempt to keep things as relaxed as possible.You yourself should stay relaxed, as well: this will help things go smoothly.

, Place two fingers (thumb and forefinger) on either side of the anus. The anal glands are beneath the skin, just under the anus, at approximately 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock. If the glands are full, you will feel a slight bulge, about cherry-sized, when pressing inward just below the anus.


Emptying the glands depends on pressing in the right place. If you can't feel the ""cherries,"" you are either in the wrong place or the glands don't need emptying.
Sometimes only one gland may be full. This could be a sign that the glands were functioning normally but that one has become infected or impacted. Call your vet before attempting to express the sac. This could require a round of antibiotics., Keeping your thumb and forefinger on the glands, gently apply pressure up and in, in the direction of the anus. You should not squeeze continuously, but rather in gentle pulses.Don't apply too much pressure: no more than you would apply to your own closed eye., If you're milking correctly, the liquid should be coming out in slow drips.


If nothing is coming out, try adjusting the position of your fingers.
The liquid smells strongly of fish and may be anything from a clear, smooth consistency to a brownish, grainy substance.If the discharge is bloody or especially pasty, do not continue. See your vet as soon as possible about a possible impaction or infection.

, You may want to try again another day. Repeated milking can be painful and cause bruises, which only exacerbates the issue.Or, the glands may be impacted, which requires veterinary intervention.Don't force the expression. It may be difficult to express the anal sacs of large dogs because they are located deeper internally. If this is the case, don't persist and hurt the dog. Seek veterinary attention because the sacs may need emptying via an internal procedure (placing a gloved finger in the rectum, which is best done by a professional!).

, You'll know they're empty when the sacs are barely palpable and there is no more liquid being expressed., Do this gently, as your dog may be feeling discomfort associated with the swollen glands., Praise your dog, pet him, and reward him for his cooperation.

, Wipe the dog's rear with a clean paper towel and thoroughly bathe the dog.If your dog won't tolerate a bath at this point, make sure you at least wash and rinse his bottom before letting him loose.

, Too much expression can do more harm than good, leading to irritation and loss of muscle tone in the gland (reducing its ability to function normally).You shouldn't need to do this more than a few times a year. If your dog has frequent troubles with his glands, see your vet.
Although dog groomers may practice regular anal gland expression, this is not recommended unless there is a problem with the glands."

Remove the foreign object.,
Wash your dog’s paw.,
Apply antibiotic cream.,
Wrap your dog’s paw.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Heal a Hunting Dog's Foot Pads2," If your dog’s paw pad has been punctured by a foreign object, like a piece of glass, rock, or thorn, remove the object before treating the wound. To remove the object, grasp it firmly with your fingers or a pair of tweezers, and pull it out quickly. Try to pull the object straight out to avoid causing any more damage to the pad.Foxtail punctures are a particularly common injury in hunting dogs. Foxtails are arrow-shaped, pointed weeds that grow outdoors. These can become lodged in between your dog’s toes or in the pad of its foot and cause great discomfort or an abscess. Do your best to avoid walking your dog through foxtails while you are hunting., Once the foreign object has been removed, wash your dog’s paw with an antibacterial soap, paying special attention to the affected area. Be sure you wash the affected area thoroughly, even if it seems like it is making your dog uncomfortable.Nolvasan or Betadine are two good antibacterial soaps you can use on your dog., Once you have washed the foot well, apply an antibiotic cream to the cut or abrasion. Rub the cream into the area well so that your dog cannot lick it off.If your dog is licking incessantly at the cream, despite rubbing it in, it might help to get a cone to put around your dog’s head. This will prevent it from being able to lick its feet.

, It is also a good idea to wrap your dog’s paw after you apply the antibiotic cream. This will help prevent your dog from licking the antibiotic cream off and further irritating the injury. To wrap your dog’s foot, wrap clean gauze from the joint around your dog’s ankle down around the pad of its foot, and then back up the leg. You can apply white tape wrap over the bandage to help ensure it stays in place.


Be careful not to wrap the bandage too tight. If you do, your dog’s leg will swell. If you notice swelling, unwrap the bandage and rewrap it so it is not as tight on your dog’s leg., You should take your dog to the vet for any puncture wound, as these can cause damage underneath the pad as well. In addition, if you have treated your dog’s cut or abrasion as recommended, but it does not improve within a few days or your dog is still limping or favoring one leg, take your dog to the vet to ensure there is not a bigger problem."
"
Take your dog to the vet.,
Soak your dog’s foot in warm water.,
Apply softening or antibacterial ointments.,
Place a sock or bandage on your dog’s foot.",How to Heal a Hunting Dog's Foot Pads3," There can be numerous causes of cracked or irritated paw pads, so you should take your dog to the vet if you notice it has this type of injury. Your vet can help you determine the cause of the irritation by first ruling out any health disorders, like allergies, and can recommend the best way to treat it.


If it is determined that the drying and cracking is due to contact irritants or food allergies, you should do your best to avoid walking your dog through these irritants and remove the items your dog is allergic to from its diet., If you’ve determined your dog’s cracked paw pads are not the result of a larger health problem, you can treat them at home. Antibacterial creams and ointments are better absorbed after soaking your dog’s foot in warm water for a few minutes. To do so, fill a small tub with warm water and completely submerge the affected foot or feet for several minutes., After soaking your dog’s foot, apply ointments like Vaseline or Neosporin to help soften the pad and keep away infection. Make sure you apply the ointment to the entire pad and rub it in well., To keep your dog from licking off the ointment, place a clean sock or bandage on your dog’s foot after you’ve applied the cream. You can use gauze to bandage the foot from the joint above your dog’s ankle, down and around the entire paw pad, and back up the leg.


Keep the sock or bandage on for several hours so the ointment can be absorbed into your dog’s paw pads. Continue to do this until your dog’s pads are back to normal and no longer cracked or excessively dry."
"
Keep your dog off its feet.,
Ice your dog’s paw pad.,
Hold a hot wash cloth against the bruise.",How to Heal a Hunting Dog's Foot Pads4," Most bruises will heal on their own within five to seven days. You can help expedite this process by keeping your dog off its feet as much as possible during this time. Limit its time outside its crate and keep it on a leash if it needs to go outside.

, Apply ice to the affected area at least once a day. Doing this will help the broken blood vessels constrict, which can help to expedite the healing process.Wrap the icepack or bag of ice in a towel before holding it to your dog’s paw pad. An icepack or bag of ice on its own may be too cold for your dog to bear.

, Applying heat to the bruised area can help reduce the pain your dog feels from the injury. It won’t necessarily help the bruise heal faster, however. Do this once a day, or as needed, until the area appears to be back to normal and your dog seems to no longer be in pain.Test the hot wash cloth on your skin first. If it is too hot to hold against your own skin for a few minutes, let it cool down before holding it against your dog’s paw.

Inspect your dog’s paws daily.,
Look between your dog’s toes, on the top of its feet, and between its paw pads.,
Push firmly on your dog’s paw pads.,
Inspect your dog’s nails.,
Watch for limping.,
Watch for excessive licking or chewing of the paws.",How to Heal a Hunting Dog's Foot Pads5," You can reduce the seriousness of a paw pad injury by checking your dog for any signs of an injury daily. You should examine your dog’s paws every time it comes in from the outside. In addition, check your dog’s paws for injuries before taking it out on a hunting trip. The type of injury your dog has will determine what kind of treatment it needs., When you are checking your dog’s feet for injuries, make sure you check the entire foot closely, looking for any red, irritated areas, lacerations, objects stuck in its feet or in between its toes and paw pads, and cracked or blistered paw pads., In addition, push firmly on your dog’s paw pads to determine if your dog is feeling any discomfort that is not visible. Discomfort when you do this can indicate your dog has a bruised paw pad. It can also indicate a puncture wound that is covered over and infected. If the pad feels hot or your dog has a temperature, this may be an infection, not a bruise., Also check your dog’s nails for any signs of infection. Look carefully to identify any discoloration in the nails (like a white nail with a brown center), and swelling or redness where the nail goes into your dog’s toe., If your dog is limping, this is a good indication it has some kind of injury. If you notice your dog is not using one of its legs, or is using it very gingerly, inspect that leg, including the paw and paw pads., Another indication that your dog may have a paw pad injury is if it is licking, chewing, or biting at its paws more than normal. If you notice your dog doing this, give it a thorough examination of its paws."

Seek out veterinary advice.,
Consult with a specialist.,
Explore therapy options.,
Assess whether movement therapy might be helpful.,
Take your dog to get passive range of motion therapy.,
Take your dog to do coordination and balance exercises.,
Assess whether massage therapy may be helpful.,
Assess whether water therapy may be helpful.,
Assess whether continued therapy at home may be helpful.",How to Get Canine Physical Therapy," If your dog has or had an injury that is currently impacting its movement, then you should consult with your veterinarian about solutions. Your veterinarian should be familiar with your dog's particular health issues, allowing the vet to understand your dog's underlying issues and what type of continued treatment might be beneficial.It is never too late to attempt to get your dog physical therapy for movement issues. For instance, if you adopt a dog that has limits to its mobility, it's a good idea to get it physical therapy, no matter how old it is or how long ago it was injured.;
, If your primary veterinarian has not been able to fix your dog's particular issue, then you may need a more specialized expert opinion. Search out a certified canine rehabilitation therapist if your dog needs specialized care.Ask your veterinarian for a referral to a rehabilitation specialist in your area. If your vet doesn't know of anyone in your area, do a search online or ask friends and acquaintances that have dogs if they know of anyone in your area.
One reason to get expert help is that unlike people, dog's can't always clearly communicate when they are in pain or when they are uncomfortable. A professional trained in physical therapy for dogs will not only be able to recommend and complete a beneficial treatment, they should also be able to gauge your dog's physical limits when it comes to therapy., There are a wide range of therapeutic options that can be used to help your dog's movement. The effectiveness of these therapies relies largely on whether the strengths of the particular therapy you choose aligns with the specific injury that is impacting your dog's movement.


Your veterinarian may have suggestions for what type of therapy to explore, based on his or her understanding of your dog's movement issues.
Do online research so that you understand the strengths of each type of therapy. This will help you to figure out what type of physical therapy will be most likely to help your dog.

, This type of therapy includes range of motion work, as well as coordination and balance exercises. This type of therapy can help dogs with conditions that are limiting their movement, such as degenerative diseases, as well as dogs that are obese or have injuries they are recovering from.


If your dog has one of these issues, research therapists in your area that do physical therapy.

, Passive range of motion exercises allow your dog's muscles and tendons to be moved without the dog putting pressure on them or the dog exerting pressure on them. Basically, the dog's limbs are moved by the therapist so that range of motion is not lost while the dog is recovering from an injury or surgery.Often, this type of therapy is used during recovery from an injury to the legs, feet, and hips.This type of therapy may require that your dog be held down, so that it does not resist the movement. The therapist should be trained on how to hold a dog without hurting it.

, In addition to range of motion exercises, your dog may benefit from coordination and balance exercises. These exercises will increase your dogs agility and will focus on increasing mobility and flexibility. Common coordination and balance exercises include walking your dog in figure eights, leg lifts, walking stairs or inclines, or simply having your dog go from sitting to standing repeatedly.In order to do coordination and balance exercises, your dog needs to have the ability to stand and move its body weight to some degree, even if that ability is limited.

, Massage therapy is usually used in combination with other types of physical therapy. Massage can help your dog's muscles and tendons to remain flexible, as well as helping to prepare the muscles for movement. If your dog is very stiff, for instance it is suffering from limited mobility in later life, massage before exercising or movement based physical therapy can help limit pain and uncomfortableness.


While you can massage your dog yourself, a trained canine physical therapist will better understand how to incorporate massage into an overall physical therapy plan.In addition, they will know what to massage and what not to massage when dealing with an injury.

, Water therapy can be used to help dogs with mobility issues or dogs recovering from surgery to get much needed exercise.Dogs that are obese, are missing limbs, or are recovering from a health issue may benefit from this type of therapy.This is because exercise in water allows for easier movement due to buoyancy, and thus limited weight being placed on the dog's muscles.


Hydrotherapy requires specialized equipment, which can even include an underwater treadmill. Don't just assume that you can replace professional hydrotherapy by taking your dog swimming.
Older dogs with limited mobility can really benefit from hydrotherapy.

, Your canine physical therapist may suggest that you complete additional exercises and stretches at home, in addition to those done with the therapist.These are usually simple exercises that can be done on a daily basis with ease.


The exercises your physical therapist assigns may be variations on the exercises he or she does with your dog at the clinic. This could be strength exercises, such as having your dog gently roll from side to side, or range of motion exercises, such as moving your dog's limbs without putting the dog's weight on them.If you are unsure how to complete physical therapy exercises at home, ask your physical therapist to show you how to do them. They should be willing to give you pointers and to show you the exact techniques needed.

Love your dog.",How to Figure out Dog Years," This is the starting point. Get it from the breeder or pet store. They should have a record.


If you don’t know the actual age and can’t find it, you could estimate the dog’s age by his or her teeth. By 8 weeks, dogs have all of their baby teeth. By 7 months, they have all permanent teeth, and their teeth are white and clean. By 3-5 years, you will see some tooth wear and tartar buildup.
By 5-10, teeth show signs of disease. By 10-15, teeth are worn, with heavy tartar buildup and some are missing. A vet can also help you guess the dog’s age with a thorough physical examination. Older dogs often have cloudy eyes, gray hair, loose skin, and stiff legs.;
, Some breeds live longer than other breeds do. This will help you understand how to put your dog’s age in context.


For example, Bulldogs live about 7 years and Great Danes live about 8.5 years. You can find charts listing life expectancy for all breeds online.Smaller dogs can live a lot longer. Miniature poodles can live up to 15 years. That’s about the highest age you will see a dog live to.

, Small dogs are generally 20 pounds or less. Realize that the size and breed can matter. Small dogs usually live longer than large dogs do, although they might age more quickly in the first few years of life.


A large dog will probably reach middle age around the age of 5. Tiny dogs probably aren’t old until they are about age 10. Medium-sized dogs fall somewhere in between.
Medium dogs range from 21-50 pounds, large dogs from 51-90 pounds, and giant dogs are generally over 90 pounds.
This will matter when looking up online charts of dog ages, which sometimes break down the age estimates by dog size., The first and second years of your dog’s life equal about 10.5 human years for each year for a medium dog, 9 for a large dog and 12.5 for a small dog (a range of 18-25 that also depends on breed).


There aren't as many differences among breeds for the first few years. Basically, your dog is about 21 years old at age 2.Dogs reach full sexual maturation even after only a year in some cases. Smaller breeds mature faster than large breeds do., Every year after the first two years equals about 4 human years. You can find charts online that show the age estimate in human years for dogs.


People often mistakenly think that every dog year equals 7 human years but this discounts the complexity of the calculation. It varies by breed and size, as noted.Dogs age more quickly toward the front end of their lives and slower toward the end., You can find many of these on the Internet. Typically they all work the same way and will do an instant calculation of your dog’s age. This is probably the best way to know for sure because you can often narrow the calculation by breed and size.


These calculators usually ask you to select your dog’s age and then to select your dog’s breed. Hit “calculate” to learn the dog’s human age. Some calculators allow you to do this in reverse too: you can calculate your age in dog years. You're probably the equivalent of a giant dog!To give you a sense, at age 8, a small dog is roughly 48 in human years, a medium-sized dog is 51, and a large dog is 55. At age 10, the numbers are 56, 60, and 66. At 15, the numbers are 80, 87, and 120. , Regular checkups are necessary for dogs just like it is for human beings. Yes, it can be expensive, but if you want to have a dog, taking care of him or her is essential.


The vet will recommend regular vaccines and preventative care that can help a dog live longer.
When you first buy the pet, take the pet to the vet for a thorough health screen., Dogs need exercise. They can’t get that if they are always sitting around. Try to take the dog for a walk once a day.


A good rule of thumb is to walk the dog for 20 minutes every day. Hey, it will also walk you, which can’t be a bad thing for your health, either.
If you don’t have time to walk the dog, make sure he or she gets some time to at least run around the yard.

, Obesity in dogs is associated with lower lifespans. So you might think you’re helping the dog by feeding him or her table scraps, but you’re not.


Research actually shows that a restricted calorie diet can help dogs live longer. Keep track of the calories your dog eats, including from pet treats, and ask the vet what the dog’s ideal weight is. Even eating 25 percent less can add 2 years to a dog’s life.
It sounds counter intuitive, but you should be able to feel your dog’s ribs. Being lean is one of the key ways that dogs can live longer., Dogs are sensitive creatures, and there is evidence that they feel stress. They are loving creatures, usually, if you love them back.


Pet your dog, cuddle with him or her, and spend time with the dog.
If the dog is a sociable breed, make sure that the dog has other dogs around for company, even if it means registering the dog in doggie daycare.

The blood may either be fresh (bright red) or digested (dark ‘’coffee grounds’’ appearance).An ulcer erodes the lining of an organ, causing irritation and bleeding.;
, If your dog has a GI ulcer caused by an MCT, its feces may look black. This black color is due to digested blood in the feces, caused by hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) in the GI tract. These black feces, called melena, will also have a tar-like consistency.Dogs with GI ulcers from MCTs can also develop diarrhea., GI ulcers can cause abdominal pain.If your dog has abdominal pain from the ulcer, it may stretch out its body into a ‘praying’ position to relieve the pain.The ‘praying’ position is when a dog holds its head close to the floor and raises its hind end in the air.Your dog may not want you to touch its belly because it hurts too much.

, With a GI ulcer from an MCT, your dog will not feel like eating much, if at all. With your dog eating less, or not eating at all, it will lose start losing weight., Sometimes, excessive drooling can indicate a GI ulcer in a dog with an MCT.Observe your dog to see if it is drooling more than usual.

, If you suspect a GI ulcer in your dog, take your dog to your vet for further examination. Your vet will be able to detect a sensitive and painful abdomen. They may also see pale gums if the ulcer has caused a lot of GI tract bleeding. However, the physical exam likely won’t provide specific clues indicating a GI ulcer.During the physical exam, give your vet a detailed history of the symptoms you’ve seen at home, including when you first noticed them and how long they’ve been going on.

, Asking questions will help you understand what is going on with your dog and what to expect next. Below are some questions you can ask:


How will the ulcer be treated?
How long will ulcer treatment last?
How will I know the ulcer is gone?
Will the ulcer come back after the end of treatment?

, A blood sample will help your vet look for indications of a GI ulcer. Below are blood work results suggesting an ulcer:Low red blood cell count, indicating anemia
High white blood cell counts, indicating inflammation
Low protein levels

, A physical exam, history of the problem, and blood work will give your vet important clues suggesting an ulcer. However, the only way to definitively an ulcer is by visualizing it. To do this, your vet will perform either abdominal surgery or an endoscopy.Because abdominal surgery is expensive, invasive, and can have serious complications, your vet will likely recommend an endoscopy.


To perform an endoscopy, your vet will anesthetize your dog and insert a thin endoscopy tube either down your dog’s throat or up through the large intestine. The tube has a camera at the end.

, After diagnosing the ulcer, your vet will make treatment recommendations for treating the ulcer. The sooner you decide on a treatment plan, the sooner your dog can start feeling better.


When treating a GI ulcer, no matter the cause, it is important to treat the underlying cause.Since your dog has an MCT, treating the cancer will also help treat the ulcer.

, Medications to treat GI ulcers focus on reducing stomach acid secretion and protecting the GI lining from further ulceration. With less stomach acid being released, the lining of the stomach and small intestine can heal. Examples of medications are omeprazole and sucralfate.Ulcer medications are oral. If your dog doesn't like taking pills, try hiding them in a tasty treat.
Follow your vet's prescription instructions carefully.

, Sometimes, GI ulcers do not respond well to medication. If your dog is continuing to have GI ulcer symptoms despite treatment, contact your vet. They may recommend surgery to remove the ulcer."

Change the dog’s diet.,
Try bland food.,
Keep the portion size small.,
Let the dog eat grass.,
Choose foods that have an odor.,
Give your dog wet food.,
Talk to your vet about a special diet.",How to Feed a Sick Dog1," If your dog isn’t interested in her usual food, try giving her something new and special. This might encourage her to eat. Just make sure to think about the underlying illness when choosing foods. Try giving your dog:


Canned pet food
Carrot sticks
Boiled chicken, hamburger meat, tuna, sandwich meat, or other mild meats
Meat-flavored or other flavored baby food
Peanut butter
Pet snacks or treats
Small amounts of cat foodRiceVegetables, like mashed pumpkin or sweet potato
No-salt added chicken brothCream of wheat or oatmeal;
, If your dog has diarrhea, nausea, or is vomiting, you need to feed her bland foods. Rich or fatty foods won’t be good for a dog with these symptoms. Instead, feed her vegetables, cream of wheat or oatmeal, boiled chicken, or no-salt-added chicken broth.Be aware that hamburger meat can be too greasy if your dog has stomach issues. Don't feed her greasy foods if she's dealing with these symptoms.

, When a dog refuses to eat, getting nutrients into her is important. Try feeding her smaller amounts, just one or two spoonfuls to start. Little and often is ideal, so offering a spoonful (depending on the size of the dog) every hour, rather than one big meal a day, can do the trick., Eating grass is an instinct for dogs when they’re feeling sick. The grass may stimulate her to be sick. This is nature's way of cleansing the system and purging it of toxins.If your dog vomits more than a couple times, or eats grass and vomits every time she goes outside, call the vet.

, Sometimes, a dog doesn't want to eat because she is old, has aches and pains, or can't smell the food. Scent plays a big part in encouraging a dog to eat, so offer something that is naturally smelly, such as fish. You can also try warming the food up slightly so that it gives off an odor., Sometimes, dry kibble is not appetising to a sick dog. Dry food can cause pain, irritate the dog’s throat, or hurt the teeth and gums. Switch to a moist food while your dog is sick. Wet food can be easier for her to digest.You can also mix in broth, beef bouillon, tomato soup, or tomato juice with the dry kibble to make it moist and easier to eat and digest.

, If your dog is only taking in small amounts of food, speak to your vet about special prescription diets that are energy dense. These foods are packed with nutrition for the dog and often contain four times the calories of an equivalent sized can of food. However, they may not be suitable for all dogs, depending on the nature of the dog’s underlying problem."

Notice if your dog appear constipated or is not urinating.,
Check if your dog has a lack of appetite and a fever.,
Notice if your dog has a stiff walking pattern.,
Look for any signs of lethargy, depression, or pain.",How to Diagnose Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs1," One of the most common symptoms of prostate disease in dogs is straining to pass feces or drops of blood at the tip of the dog's sheath.You may also notice that when your dog does go to the bathroom, there is blood in their urine. This is another possible symptom of prostate disease.
These symptoms occur when your dog’s prostate becomes so enlarged that it squashes the rectum which lies directly above the prostate, or else the enlarged prostate weeps blood into the urethra (the tube through which the dog urinates). Your dog may struggle to defecate because his enlarged prostate is putting too much pressure on his rectum.;
, Prostate disease comes in different forms. The commonest has a slow onset and is typified by straining to pass feces, however, if the prostate becomes infected the dog may develop a fever. The commonest form of prostate disease shows few symptoms initially, and then the dog appears constipated or takes a long time to pass feces. If your has an infection in the prostate gland, which is much less common, he may be feverish, seem stiff on the back legs, and not want to eat much or he may not eat at all for several days. This could be a sign he is in pain and needs to be examined for prostate issues by your vet.You should also check your dog’s temperature for any signs of fever, as a high temperature is often a sign of a disease or an infection, of which one source of infection could be the prostate. You may use an animal thermometer to take his temperature and confirm it is higher than normal.
Know that many dogs have BPH without the owner being aware, and it's only when the prostate is so enlarged it presses on the rectum, that symptoms develops. These dogs are usually well in themselves, but prone to straining.

, For the more unusual forms of prostate disease, you should also observe your dog’s walking pattern and notice if his limbs appear stiff when he walks around. He may limp to one side, walk slower than usual, or have several stiff limbs.Watch your dog walk around your home or yard. If you notice his limbs are stiff and he is not moving as fluidly as he usually does, he may have a prostate issue.

, Prostate disease commonly has a slow onset and the dog may be perfectly normal and only start to show signs once the prostate reaches a critical size. However, a dog with prostate infection may also start to appear lethargic and very low energy. He may even appear depressed or sad, with no energy to go for walks or play with you. You may notice your dog does not seem as excited, happy, or outgoing as he usually is.Some dogs with advanced prostate cancer will experience pain in their abdomen area. You may notice that your dog is sensitive to any touching or stroking of his abdominal area due to pain.

Do not force the dog to eat.,
Try feeding in a new room.,
Introduce food slowly.,
Hand feed your dog.,
Give your dog praise while eating.,
Be patient and gentle with your dog.,
See the vet.",How to Feed a Sick Dog2," It’s important that you don’t force your dog to eat. The dog could feel nauseous and might vomit if she eats. Instead, let the dog do what she feels is natural. A dog not eating for up to 24 hours is no cause for concern. Even 48 hours without eating is okay if she is drinking water., Feed your dog in a room she doesn’t normally eat in. The break with routine, curiosity factor, and the fact that she has no previous associations with nausea in the room can help kick start her appetite., If you are changing your dog’s food, it could make her sick. Instead of making a sudden switch, phase in the new food as you phase out the old over a week. Watch your dog carefully to make sure the new food is agreeing with her and not making her sick., Sit beside your dog, dip your fingers into the canned food, and then offer them up to her mouth. This often does the trick. Try dabbing a bit of the food on the dog's nose or lip, so that she licks it off to clean herself and gets a taste of the food in her mouth. Sometimes tasting the food helps the dog to realize she is hungry and makes her want to try the food., Praising your dog while she eats may encourage her to start eating again. If she licks food from your hand, eats a bite from a spoon or bowl, or ingests anything else, give her lots of praise so that her good behavior is rewarded. You can also scratch your dog’s head or neck while feeding her.However, only reserve this for genuinely sick dogs, or you may accidentally train your dog only to eat when hand fed.

, The most important thing is to be patient while your dog refuses to eat. It is frustrating when she refuses food, but venting your feelings will do nothing to help the dog's appetite. Don’t take your frustrations out on your dog., If none of these tips work, take the dog to the vet. If your dog hasn’t eaten in 24 to 48 hours, take her to the vet. Also, take her to the vet if she has been vomiting a lot or has persistent diarrhea."

Share your dog’s medical history with your vet.,
Let your vet examine your dog’s prostate.,
Allow your vet to run tests on your dog.,
Get a treatment plan.",How to Diagnose Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs2," When you bring your dog into the vet, you should give them a thorough summary of your dog’s medical history. Note any previous health issues your dog may have had as well as details of when the symptoms of prostate disease started to appear. You may also note any incidents that could have caused the condition or made it worse.For example, you may tell your vet, “My dog stopped eating a few days ago and is very lethargic, with a high fever. He has never been like this before and I am worried he may have prostate infection as he is an older, intact dog.”

, Your vet will start by doing a full physical exam on your dog, including a close examination of his prostate. They may insert a gloved finger into your dog’s rectum to feel their prostate gland. If your dog reacts with pain or the prostate feels larger than usual, your vet may suggest a biopsy of the prostate gland for testing. Your dog may be sedated during the biopsy so he does not feel any pain or discomfort.This is done to assess the size of the prostate, if it is symmetrical, and if it is painful or not.


If your dog reacts with pain or the prostate feels larger than usual, your vet may suggest a prostic wash to harvest a sample of cells from the prostate. Biopsy of the prostate gland is tricky as the gland is difficult to access, and so your vet will carefully assess if this is necessary or not. Your dog will be given an anesthetic during the biopsy so he does not feel any pain or discomfort.
In some dogs, their prostate may recede too far into their abdominal area to be felt in a physical exam. If this is the case, your vet will suggest an ultrasound on your dog’s abdominal area to get a better look at his prostate.

, Your vet will then run standard laboratory tests on your dog, including getting a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your vet will need a sample of your dog’s urine to run the urinalysis. The urinalysis will help your vet determine if there is blood in his urine, this could be a symptom of prostate disease., Once your vet has completed a physical exam of your dog and ran the necessary tests, they will determine the cause of the issue and suggest a treatment plan. If your dog’s prostate disease is due to a hormonal imbalance, your vet may recommend castration or hormone-blocking medication to reduce your dog’s symptoms. If your dog’s prostate issue is caused by a bacterial infection, your dog will be given antibiotics.If your dog’s symptoms are severe and he has a ruptured, abscessed prostate, he may need surgery on his prostate. Your vet will let you know the timeline for the surgery and give your dog antibiotic therapy to stabilize his condition before the surgery can be performed.

Ask your dog’s veterinarian about treatment options.,
Give your dog the necessary medication.,
Do not let your dog mate until he has recovered.,
Bring your dog to your vet if his symptoms recur.",How to Diagnose Prostate Disease in Intact Male Dogs3," Treatment options for your dog’s prostate disease will depend on his specific diagnosis, so it is important to discuss the options with your dog’s veterinarian.There are several different options for medical management prostate disease, such as BPH, including Suprelorin implants (which is a slow release drug injected under the skin which is a reversible form of chemical neutering), Ypozane (a tablet which blocks receptors in the prostate from registering testosterone), and also older hormone therapy injections such as deelvosterone. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses, so talk with your dog’s veterinarian about the treatment options available for your dog. Indeed, surgical desexing may be the most effective long term option.

, Your vet will recommend a specific dosage of antibiotics for your dog for a set period of time. Make sure you follow your vet’s dosage instructions and find ways to give your dog his medication so he can recover successfully.If your dog has been castrated, your dog will likely recover with five to seven days of the surgery. His prostate gland will likely return to a normal size within several weeks.

, It is very important that if your dog is not neutered due to his prostate issue, he still abstain from mating with other dogs while he recovers. This is especially important if your dog has prostate disease due to a bacterial infection.Make sure your vet does a prostatic fluid sample to confirm your dog no longer has bacterial prostatitis before you allow him to mate with other dogs.

, If you notice your dog is exhibiting symptoms of prostate disease despite the treatment, such as difficulty urinating, lethargy, high fever, and abdominal pain, you should bring him into the vet right away. These may be signs that the disease has not been treated successfully or is recurring and chronic.Depending on your dog’s medical situation, your vet may recommend a stronger course of medication or another form of treatment for the prostate issue.

Check for dehydration.,
Do not force your dog to drink.,
Feed your dog broth.,
Give your dog Pedialyte.,
Let your dog lick water from something.,
Add ice to the dog’s water.,
Take the dog to the vet.",How to Feed a Sick Dog3," When a dog isn’t eating, oftentimes she isn’t drinking either. Dehydration is a major concern and can cause serious problems. Keep an eye on your dog to make sure she doesn’t become dehydrated. To do this, check her gums. They should be pink, wet, and slick, not dry. You can also press a finger to your dog’s gums until they change color. When you remove your finger, the color should return immediately. If it takes a few moments, the dog may be dehydrated.Dogs who are vomiting or who have diarrhea are at a high risk for dehydration.

, Never try to force water down your dog’s throat. Forcing water down her throat can cause more problems if she doesn’t swallow. Instead, try techniques to encourage her to drink on her own., If your dog has been vomiting, solid food probably will make her sicker. Give her salt-free broth or beef bouillon three to four times a day. This will help keep her hydrated while giving her needed nutrients.Homemade broth is better than canned broth., Unflavored Pedialyte, which is a drink for children containing electrolytes, can help your dog if she has not been eating or drinking. The Pedialyte can help replace much needed electrolytes., Sometimes, you can get your dog to lick a wet surface so she can get some water. See if your dog will lick water from your hand or fingers. You can also try to see if your dog will lick an ice cube., Sometimes, adding an ice cube to your dog’s water can help. She might be more willing to drink it with the ice cube inside, which makes the water cooler.Some pets like to drink running water instead of still water, so also try a drinking fountain to encourage your dog to drink., Dehydration can cause serious problems. If your dog refuses to drink anything, take her to the vet. The vet can give her fluids through an IV and find out if there is an underlying condition."

Encourage your dog to drink.,
Add moisture to your dog's meals.,
Make water more attractive to the dog.,
Give unlimited access to water.,
Bring water directly to your dog's mouth.",How to Get a Sick Dog to Drink," When a dog is sick its behaviors can change drastically. Pay attention to your dog's eating and drinking routines, looking for large changes. You want to catch dehydration early, before it causes an additional medical problem for your dog.;
, Give your dog a specific amount of water and see how fast it drinks it. While there may be variation, for the most part each dog requires from 44-66 mL of water per kg of body weight. That is ½ to 1 ½ ounces of water per pound of body weight.In other words, a 10 pound dog should drink roughly a cup of water a day or a large 60 pound dog should drink 2 quarts of water a day.

, You will need to take into account a few things when estimating your dog’s water needs. In hot and humid weather a dog will need to drink more water. In addition, if your dog is exercising heavily it will need more water. When a dog pants to cool off it loses more water than if it is at home relaxing on your couch.


Dogs in these conditions may need twice the amount of water as normal.

, Sometimes treating the disease adequately will make your dog feel better and have a healthier appetite for both food and water. In these cases the dehydration will usually clear up on its own.


Be aware that some medications used to treat congestive heart failure, like diuretics, will make monitoring water intake on your dog very important. Diuretics can cause severe dehydration.

, Try to lure it nicely to its bowl. If you have a dog that is sick there is chance that it won’t be interested much in eating or drinking. For some illnesses, such as simple gastrointestinal upset in a normally healthy dog, this isn’t too worrisome. As long as your dog doesn’t go on much longer than a day without drinking water it should be ok.


If your dog is refusing water after a day you need to consult with your veterinarian for a diagnosis as to what is causing the problem.

, For example, switch to feeding a wet or canned version of the food your dog is currently eating. Canned food is approximately 70-80% water, while dry food is generally around 10% water.You can also add a low-sodium meat broth to dry dog food or make a 50-50 mix with water.

, Try freezing low-sodium meat broth into ice cubes using a 50-50 mix with water. Some dogs enjoy eating plain ice cubes as well.


Use bottled water instead of tap. Sometimes the chemicals used to treat tap water are disagreeable to dogs.
Clean your dog’s water bowl with soap and water and rinse well. Refresh the water two or three times a day by pouring out the old water and replacing it with fresh water.

, Pet fountains are an attractive option for many dogs. These “bubblers” or “streamers” can keep the water aerated and from becoming flat.


Leaving the bathtub faucet dripping. This achieves the same result as a pet fountain, although it is a bit wasteful.
Place bowls of water in a few places around the house especially if your dog tires easily or finds it hard to move.

, Using a clean cloth moistened in water, place the moist towel in the edge of your dog's mouth. Wiping along the dog’s gums or tongue can encourage your dog to drink.


Use a syringe to give your dog water. Shoot water gently into your dog's mouth and it will be forced to swallow at least a little of it.

Ask your vet for advice.,
Discuss grooming techniques.,
Get a referral for a groomer from the vet.",How to Learn the Grooming Requirements for Your New Dog2," If you are not sure how to groom your dog properly, ask your vet for advice on grooming. Your vet may be able to give you guidance on how you can best groom your new dog as part of your overall care for the dog. Bring your dog with you to the vet so they can show you different techniques.


For example, you may ask your vet, “Can you give me some tips on grooming my new dog?” or “How can I best groom my new dog?”

, Let your vet demonstrate different grooming techniques on your dog. They may give you a list of grooming items you can get as well as how to prepare your dog for grooming. They may show you how to groom your dog using certain grooming tools.


Listen closely to what your vet instructs you to do. You may need to practice the grooming techniques a few times in front of the vet before you pursue it yourself on your dog.
For instance, your vet may tell you to groom your Terrier dog by plucking their wiry hair twice a year. If your dog has a short-haired coat, such as a French Bulldog, they may just require brushing once a week., If your vet does not have any advice on grooming, they may be able to suggest a groomer you can go to. Ask your vet for a referral for a good groomer for your dog if you would prefer a professional groomer rather than doing it yourself.


Most vets will know good groomers in the area. Outline your budget so your vet can recommend a groomer that fits your budget.

Let the groomer show you grooming techniques.",How to Learn the Grooming Requirements for Your New Dog3," Look for a professional groomer online by searching for “groomer” in your neighborhood or general area. You can also search for a professional groomer in the classifieds, online or in your local newspaper.Another option is to ask other pet owners you know to refer you to a good professional groomer. They may be able to recommend their own groomer as an option.
Search for a groomer who works with your dog's breed and has a high level of experience grooming your dog's breed. A groomer who works on Golden Retrievers, for example, may not be as skilled at grooming on other breeds like a Bernadoodle or a German Shepherd.

, Once you talk to a professional groomer, ask them for guidance and advice on grooming. Depending on the groomer, they may ask for a consultation fee or agree to give you advice free of charge.For example, you may ask the groomer, “How often do I need to groom my dog?” “What types of grooming tools will I need?” “Can you tell me the best way to groom my dog on a regular basis?”

, If the groomer is willing, have them demonstrate grooming techniques on your dog directly. Listen to them as they explain how to groom your dog so you can repeat the techniques yourself when you are at home.


You may ask the groomer to show you specific techniques, such as how to trim your dog’s fur or how to cut your dog’s nails. Or you may ask the groomer to teach you how to maintain your dog’s coat on a weekly basis as part of the grooming.
For instance, the groomer may show you how to trim your Golden Retriever's hair properly and tell you to never shave their hair. They may also show you how to groom your retriever's tail so it looks like a fan so the dog appears healthy and clean."

Save one towel for drying your pup later.You can also use an outdoor space for grooming as long as it is fully enclosed (like a fenced-in yard or garage) to ensure your dog can’t escape. But be mindful of weather conditions. You don’t want to groom your Yorkie Poo outside if it is too cold or rainy.

, Begin with your dog’s face and gently work out any tangles in the dog’s beard with the brush. Then move on to your dog’s back, legs, and belly. Brush smaller sections at a time to keep your pet comfortable. Bring the brush to the base of the coat and comb it through the full length of the hair to make sure you get all of the tangles out.Brushing your Yorkie Poo regularly is the single best thing you can do to keep up with your at-home grooming regimen and keep your dog looking its best.
You can brush your Yorkie Poo as often as every day, but be sure to do it at least once every three days or so. The longer and curlier your Yorkie Poo’s hair is, the more frequently you’ll need to brush it.

, After you have brushed out your dog’s hair, you’ll need to dampen its coat with water. Use lukewarm water to wet down your dog’s hair in the sink or bathtub. Run your fingers through the dog’s hair as you pour the water to ensure that the hair is getting fully saturated all the way to the base.Use water that is slightly warm – never cold or too hot.
Be sure to put down a nonslip surface in the bathtub to help your dog with traction and to prevent slipping.

, Use a small amount of dog shampoo (probably about the size of a quarter) to lather up your dog with suds. Gently rub the shampoo into your dog’s hair, making sure to soap up the entire coat.Be careful to avoid getting shampoo in your dog’s eyes, ears, and nose. This can be stressful and uncomfortable for your dog.
Again, be sure to only use shampoo that is specially formulated for use on dogs.

, After you’ve finished shampooing your Yorkie Poo, it’s time to rinse all the soap out. Pour warm water on your dog’s fur and use your hand to gently rub and get the soap out. Begin with your dog’s back, then move to the dog’s face. Finally, rinse the shampoo from the dog’s legs, belly, and tail.Make sure that you thoroughly remove all of the soap and soap residue. Any remaining on your dog’s skin could cause irritation.

, When you are done bathing your Yorkie Poo, you should use a towel to soak up any excess water remaining on the dog. Gently towel dry the dog and then set it down on the ground so that your pup can shake off some additional excess water. At this point, you can either let your dog air dry or use a hairdryer to fully dry your dog’s coat.Be sure to use the blow dryer on the lowest/coolest setting available to ensure you don’t burn your pup’s skin.
Most dogs are initially frightened by the sound of the hair dryer. But, over time, your dog should grow accustomed to it. Try introducing the dog to the noise slowly at first and building up to longer sessions.

, Hold your dog firmly so that it doesn’t wiggle free or feel nervous. Take the nail clippers and insert each nail into the hole, one at a time. Make a swift cut with the nail clippers to get a clean cut with minimal breakage. Be sure to cut from the underneath side so that you have a better visual. And only cut the white part. The pink part is the quick, which is living tissue and will cause bleeding if it is cut.If you accidentally make your dog’s nails bleed, don’t feel too bad. This even happens to professional groomers from time to time. Make sure you have some styptic powder or cornstarch on hand to dip the nails in if they start bleeding. This will help coagulation.

, If you want to keep your Yorkie Poo’s coat short and stylish, you’ll need to use some electric hair clippers. A typical Yorkie Poo haircut includes a shaggy face with a slightly trimmed beard and a shaved back that tapers into longer leg hair. You can adjust the style however you like.Use a Number 10 blade on the clippers to avoid cutting your dog’s skin.
Be sure to purchase hair clippers made for dogs – they have more teeth than human hair clippers, which works better for the thicker hair in a dog’s coat.
Make sure your Yorkie Poo is secured to something during the grooming process so that it doesn’t fall and hurt itself.

, In order to keep your dog healthy and looking its best, it’s important for you to stay on top of the dog’s dental health. A well-groomed dog should have healthy looking teeth and steer clear of bad breath.Give your Yorkie Poo doggie treats that are intended for promoting canine dental health. Chewing on these will help clean your dog’s teeth each time it eats one.
You can also brush your Yorkie Poo’s teeth. Some dogs don’t like this, but they can grow accustomed to it over time. Use a double-headed toothbrush and toothpaste that is meant for dogs. Do not use human toothpaste as it contains fluoride, which can be toxic to dogs.
Additionally, ask your veterinarian to check your Yorkie Poo’s teeth at your annual checkup.

Wipe eyes daily.,
Brush fur daily.,
Examine for any excess hair.",How to Groom Maltese Dogs1," Soak a cotton ball or clean washcloth with warm water and wipe the eye area. Use one cotton ball for each eye. Wipe the area right under the eye where stains are most likely to occur.This daily wiping may help prevent the tears from staining in the first place.
Once you have finished wiping, place a small amount of Vaseline in the area. The Vaseline may also keep the tears from staining the hair.

Prevent dental issues.",How to Groom Your Dog at Home Between Professional Groomings," In order to do your grooming at home, you’ll need to buy some shampoo that is specially formulated for use on canines. Don’t ever use human shampoo on your dog.You can purchase canine shampoo that focuses on different issues too – like flea prevention, sensitive skin, brittle coats, or puppy formulas.
You can buy dog shampoo at most pet stores, veterinary offices, grocery stores, and even at online retailers.;
, One of the most important items you will need to purchase to maintain most grooming styles at home is a hair clipper. Dog clippers have more teeth than human hair clippers, so they are better suited to cutting a dog’s thicker coat. You can find a variety of options for clippers at any pet store.Remember that not all dogs should have their coats trimmed. Some breeds, like Border Collies, have double coats that keep them cool in the summer and warm in the winter. These coats should not be cut with hair trimmers as they may not be as effective and full when they grow back.
When purchasing your clippers, you’ll be able to choose between corded and cordless options. A cordless clipper will give you a greater range of movement, but they may have less power than the corded varieties.

, Purchase some nail trimming clippers to use in cutting your dog’s nails. You should also buy some styptic powder (or another kind of clotting powder) to use in case you accidentally cut the nails too short and they bleed. There are several different styles of trimmers you can purchase, depending on what your dog’s specific needs are. The different types of trimmers include:Guillotine-style clippers. These are the easiest kind to use and are especially effective for small breeds.
Pliers-style clippers. There are usually better for larger breeds of dogs.
Scissors-style clippers. These are best for longer nails that have not been trimmed in a while.

, In order to keep your dog’s coat clean and free of pesky matted or knotted hair, you should brush or comb your dog’s coat regularly. Buy a brush intended for use on dogs and use it at least once every two days.This is important for dogs with all types of coats. Even shorthaired dogs can benefit from regular brushing.
There are many different types of dog brushes. The most common type is a curry brush that typically has rubber (sometimes plastic) teeth. These are good for dogs that shed a great deal.
For dogs that shed an enormous amount (like German Shepherds), you may want to invest in a shedding blade. This is a rounded metal blade with dull teeth on it that is used to remove dead hair still embedded in the dog’s thick coat. It is considered a type of brush as it does not actually cut the hair.

, Once you have the proper tools, find a spot to do the grooming in your home that will be comfortable for you and your dog. Try to elevate your pet to protect your back. But make sure you find a place in your house where you can minimize the mess – like the bathroom or outside in the garage.A small breed can be placed on top of a washer or dryer or even a counter, if you place a rubber mat down to give them secure footing. Look for a ""sink mat"" in your local drugstore.

, Armed with the correct tools and a good grooming spot, grab your dog and get to work. Make this a fun, pleasant experience for both of you by talking to your dog, petting it, and praising it.You can even use treats to show your dog that you appreciate its behavior when it acts correctly. If your dog is being very good during the grooming process, give it a treat as a positive reward.

, Before you bathe your dog, give it a good once over with the dog brush. Shorthaired dogs often shed more than the longhaired breeds. With a firm hand, brush against the grain of the hair growth. This will get under the hair and remove more of the dead stuff. Be sure to praise your dog and keep it fun.If your dog has a long, thick coat, it is easier to do the brushing in sections. Lift the top layer and secure with hair clips or clothespins to keep out of your way so you can begin brushing underneath.
With gentle pressure, place your free hand against the dog's skin where the hair is attached. This helps relieve any pulling on the skin from mats or snags you might run in to. Brush in a downward motion.
When it seems the brush is going through the coat smoothly, repeat with a comb and move on to the next section.
With a large dog, it may be better to tackle a different section each day in order to keep it fun.
If you plan on bathing your dog, never bathe first. Always brush out mats or ""undercoat"" before getting your pet wet. If you don't, the water tends to ""set"" the extra coat, making mats and tangles even more difficult to remove later.

, Use the dog shampoo to give your dog a bath and get its coat nice and clean. Depending on the size of your dog, you can use a bathtub or shower, a hose outside, or even the kitchen sink to bathe your dog.Rinse your dog with water to get its coat nice and damp, then lather in the dog shampoo. Rinse your dog’s coat thoroughly to get all of the soap out.
Then towel dry your dog to get rid of any excess water.
You can either let your dog air dry at this point or use a hair dryer if your dog will tolerate the noise. Make sure to use the cool setting on the blow dryer.

, To cut your dog’s nails, hold the nail clippers in the palm of your hand and use your fingers to manipulate the moveable pieces that control the trimming. Bring the clippers to the dog’s paw from the underneath side (never clip from above) and put the nail into the hole in the clippers. Squeeze the clippers quickly so that they make a swift cut. Do this to each nail.Be sure to only cut the white part of the nail, not the pink part that contains live tissue.
Keep an anti-coagulant powder on hand in case you do cut one too short. Cornstarch or flour will also do the trick.
This can be a tricky skill to master, but it can help in avoiding a myriad of problems. Nails that get too long and begin to curl are not only uncomfortable for your dog, but can snag on rugs, blankets, etc.
They can also get torn off and infected or make it difficult, or even painful, for your dog to walk properly.

, Talk to your groomer about which grooming tools are the ones best suited for your pet's coat. The long, thick coat of a Collie demands a totally different brush than the Labrador. Many breeds require more than one style of brush to do the complete job.Your groomer can also recommend other ways that you can help maintain the groomed effect in between professional grooming sessions.

, If your dog is prone to aggressive behavior or lashes out while being groomed because it is scared, you need to make sure you take steps to prevent yourself from being hurt. These measures will also help keep your dog safe.Consider wearing a pair of bite-proof gloves to protect your hands from your dog’s teeth.
You could also put a muzzle on your dog to keep it from biting or snapping at you during grooming.
Consider restraining your dog so it doesn’t fall and hurt itself. You could use its leash to keep it upright and stationary.

, Since dental problems can be traumatic for dogs – even requiring anesthesia to fix relatively minor issues – it’s important to maintain dental health. This will help your dog’s teeth to remain bright, white, and shiny to add to the freshly groomed look.Give your dog chew toys that are intended for dental care. These treats will help protect your dog’s teeth and gums over time.
Additionally, choose to give your dog dry dog food  instead of wet. The process of chewing the hard kibbles helps cleanse your dog’s teeth every time it eats.
You can also try brushing your dog’s teeth with a double-headed toothbrush and toothpaste specifically formulated for dogs. Do not use human toothpaste as it contains fluoride, which can be toxic for dogs.
Have your veterinarian inspect your dog’s teeth at their yearly vet checkup. Your vet may recommend some other type of dental care for your pup.

Be very careful washing the fur around their faces. Shampoos can be irritating to your dog’s eyes so do not get it directly in their eyes. It may be easier to use a damp washcloth to wipe their faces so you can avoid getting shampoo in their eyes., After you have washed each part of their coat, you’ll use lukewarm water to rinse out the shampoo from their fur.


Make sure you avoid getting water directly in their eyes, ears, and nose again. You might have to rinse them a few times to make sure that all of the shampoo is washed out of their fur.

, You can use either a cotton towel or a blow dryer to dry your dog off after their bath. Some people swear by blow drying their dog’s coat, while others prefer to use towels.The choice is yours, but remember to use the blow dryer on a low or no heat setting if this is the option that you choose.


If you use a towel, rub your dog’s fur gently. You do not want to pull the hair and create tangles by rubbing vigorously.

Choose the right brush.,
Place your dog on a table.,
Brush your dog’s torso.,
Brush your dog’s head.",How to Groom a Short Haired Dog1," For most smooth-haired dogs, a hard rubber brush or a mitt with rubber nubs is going to be your best choice. If your shorthaired dog has thicker fur, you may want to opt for a bristle brush. Consult your veterinarian to select the best brush for your dog., In addition to bathing, all dogs benefit from being regularly brushed. Brushing helps to remove excess fur and allow your dog to feel comfortable. Begin by placing your dog on a kitchen table, counter, or grooming table.Set out any grooming tools before you begin.
Do not leave your dog unattended.

, Moving in one direction, carefully run the brush over your dog's body, starting at the neck and ending near the tail. Start with your dog’s back, and move on to their belly. Work to remove any loose or excess fur.This should be repeated 1-2 times per week.
Create positive associations with grooming by offering your dog a treat

, You should wait to brush your dog’s head last. Once again, moving in only one direction, brush the top of your dog’s head, removing any loose fur.Be sure to brush your dog’s ears very gently.
Avoid your dog’s eyes.
This should be repeated 1-2 times per week.

Use a ‘slicker’ brush on its entire coat.,
Comb through its fur with a ‘greyhound’ comb.,
Break apart mats.",How to Groom an Affenpinscher1," The first step to grooming your Affenpinscher is to remove any knots, debris, and loose hairs with a soft bristle ‘slicker’ brush. To do so, start brushing under your dog’s chest, working upwards to its chin. Next, brush under its belly and down the inside of each leg. Then move up to its spine, brushing vertically down each side and continuing down the outside of each leg. Finally, brush the hair on your dog’s head, including its cheeks, whiskers, beard, and the hair on top of its head.


Brush your dog’s coat in layers, starting with the hair on the outermost layer and working your way in, toward the skin.
When you’re brushing the hair on your dog’s cheeks, whiskers, and beard, brush forward, moving toward the mouth. Brush the hair on its head forward as well, moving your brush from the back of its head toward the nose.Affenpinschers’ coats don’t need too much maintenance, so brushing it once a week is usually enough.;
, Once you’re finished brushing, go over your Affenpinscher’s coat with a ‘greyhound’ comb. A greyhound comb has both fine and medium teeth to allow you to groom both the body and face. Comb your dog in the same order you brushed it, starting with its chest and chin, moving next to its belly and the inside of its legs, and then its back and the outside of its legs. Finish by combing the hair on its face., If you run into any mats while combing your Affenpinscher, stop and break them apart before continuing. To get rid of the mat, break it apart with your fingers as best as you can, gently pulling small pieces of fur out of it, starting from the outsides of the mat. Then use the teeth on your greyhound comb to go through the mat, combing it out piece by piece."

Form positive associations with bathing.,
Avoid bathing your dog too often.,
Fill a tub with lukewarm water.,
Apply shampoo.,
Rinse your dog.,
Dry your dog’s fur.",How to Groom a Short Haired Dog2," Some shorthaired dogs may be scared of the bath. Fortunately, you can help your dog experience positive bath time associations by performing a few simple actions.Start by placing your dog in the bathtub without water. You can do this several times prior to an actual bath.
Bathe them in less water. Work up to pouring water over them.
Offer your dog a treat whenever you bathe them!

, Unless they are very dirty, shorthaired dogs only need to be bathed around once per month. Bathing your dog much more than this can remove oils from their coat and create skin irritation., Just like people, dogs are sensitive to water temperature. They like it to be warm, but not too hot. Fill a tub (or sink if your dog is small) with lukewarm water. You want the water to come up no higher than your dog’s belly.

, Distribute a dollop of shampoo into your hands and work this into a lather. (The amount you use will vary by the size of your dog.) Then apply this to your dog’s back, chest, and top of their head. If your dog tends to squirm in the bath, ask a friend to help you to keep your dog stable and calm.Use only dog shampoo for this purpose.
Look for a product formulated for shorthair dogs.

, Using a detachable shower head or bucket, gently pour water over your dog’s fur to remove shampoo. Run your hands over your dog to help rinse them. Repeat this until the water runs clear.Wait to rinse the top of your dog’s head last.
Avoid getting soap in your dog’s ears or eyes.

, Using a fluffy towel, remove your dog from the tub and dry them off. Your dog will probably want to “shake” to remove some of the water. If your dog doesn’t mind, you can also use a hair dryer on a low setting."

Pluck any long, unruly hairs.,
Go through your dog’s coat with a stripping knife.,
Trim around its tail.,
Trim the hair around its legs.,
Trim the hair around the anus.",How to Groom an Affenpinscher2," Most Affenpinscher’s coats need trimmed only every couple months. In general, you’ll want your Affenpinscher’s coat to stay about one inch in length on the shoulders and body. Its coat should be longest between its shoulders and shortest around its rear end. Brushing and combing your dog’s coat will take care of most of the long, unruly hairs, but you’ll need to pluck any remaining ones that did not come out. To do so, separate any long hairs by lifting them up with a comb so that you can grab them with your index finger and thumb. With the other hand, pull the skin around the hair you’re working with taut. Then, with a quick motion, pull the long hair towards you, removing it.


If you have trouble grasping the long hairs, try wearing a pair of latex gloves. This will allow you to get a better grip on the hairs.
The long hairs you’re pulling out are dead, so plucking them won’t hurt your dog., A stripping knife is a grooming tool that helps to remove any loose hairs and trim your dog’s coat without making any blunt lines. Once you’ve plucked any long hairs from your dog, take your stripping knife and work through its coat, starting at the base of its neck and working your way back to the base of its tail. Move your stripping knife along the natural lay of the hair, which is usually vertical down the back, but may vary around your dog’s neck and tail.


Blend its coat as you go, keeping the hair around its shoulders and rib cage longer and the hair around its rear shorter.Use the stripping knife in a raking motion, moving your arm from the shoulder without flexing your wrist. Position the knife at a 45 degree angle to your dog’s coat with the teeth facing in the direction you are raking.Depending how you want your dog’s coat to look, you may only need to do this every six months or so., Affenpinschers can have either docked or undocked tails. If your dog has a docked tail, take small trimming shears and trim the hair closely around the tail, moving along with its natural curve. If your dog has an undocked tail, hold the tip of its tail between your fingers and gently pull it over its back, toward its head. Using your scissors, trim the hair on the underside of its tail in the shape of a crescent moon., Next, brush the hair on the inside of your dog’s legs toward the middle of its body. Use trimming shears to trim the hair in this area, making it an even length around the entire leg. Your dog’s legs should look rectangular in shape, like small columns., Using blunt-nosed scissors, trim the hair around your dog’s anus. Make sure you get any areas that are soiled or starting to mat."
"
Trim around its eyes.,
Groom your dog’s eyebrows.,
Cut the hair on top of its nose.,
Trim around its ears.",How to Groom an Affenpinscher3," To trim the hair around your dog’s eyes, brush the hair on top of its head forward, toward the nose and over its eyes. Using small trimming shears, make an upside down “U” shape, starting at the outside corner of one eye and moving to the outside corner of the opposite eye.Hold your dog’s head still while you’re trimming by firmly grasping underneath its mouth with your other hand. Make sure you’re not holding too tight, but that your dog isn’t able to wiggle its head.
The hair on top of an Affenpinscher’s head (from the bridge of the nose to the back of the skull) is usually kept to about three-fourths of an inch to an inch-and-a-half long.
Clean up any hairs that are touching your dog’s eyes as well. This will help prevent eye problems. To do so, simply grab the hairs with your thumb and index finger and pluck them out., To trim your dog’s eyebrows, comb the hair on them forward with a small comb. Then, using a small pair of scissors, trim the hair so that it is short enough to stay out of your dog’s eyes., The hair on top of an Affenpinscher’s nose often grows quite long, which can block its eyes. To keep its eyes exposed, cut the hair on top of its nose when you groom your dog. To do so, smooth the hair above its eyes back, holding it on top if its head, and out of your way, with your non-dominant hand. Then, using small trimming shears, trim the hair on top of its nose like a fan, starting at one end and making a half circle to the other side., Using blunt scissors, trim the hair around your dog’s ears. This hair should be trimmed close to the actual ear, taking care not to cut your dog’s ear in the process.Sandwich your dog’s ear in between the index and middle finger on your non-dominant hand (keeping both fingers straight so they run along the edge of the ear) to ensure you don’t cut the skin.


Trim hair from the inside of your dog’s ears with forceps or blunt scissors. Using the forceps or scissors, grab a small patch of hair, twist it, and pull it out. Repeat these steps until all the excess hair inside your dog’s ears has been removed. Apply ear powder to your dog’s ears first to help provide added traction for you to get a hold of the hairs."
"
Wrap your dog in a towel or blanket.,
Cut the nail in small snips.,
Trim the hair on your dog’s feet.",How to Groom an Affenpinscher4," Most dogs don’t like getting their nails trimmed, so you’ll need to take extra precautions to ensure your dog stays still during the process. To do so, swaddle it in a blanket or towel so it cannot wriggle around while you are trimming its nails. To swaddle your dog, first lay it on its back on top of the blanket. Wrap each side of the blanket up and over your dog’s belly, tucking it securely underneath your dog on the opposite side of its body. Leave only one leg exposed at a time., Using a small nail grinder or nail trimmer, take small snips out of your dog’s nail until you have cut them back to just before the quick, or the small white or pink vein that runs between your dog’s toes. Repeat this on each nail until you’ve trimmed them all.


Accidentally cutting the quick can cause quite a bit of bleeding. If you do cut it, apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding., When you are finished trimming its nails, cut the hair around your dog’s feet. Using small scissors, cut the hair on the bottom of its feet so that it is even with the pad. Then, trim the hair around the outside of its foot so that your dog’s foot looks round."
"
Place your dog in a basin or tub.,
Wet your dog’s coat.,
Apply shampoo.,
Rinse your dog.,
Dry your dog’s coat.",How to Groom an Affenpinscher5," In general, dogs only need bathed once every few months. When you do bathe your dog, place it in a basin, laundry tub, or the bath tub. Make sure whatever you decide to use has a slip-resistant bottom so your dog is not sliding around. If it does not already, you can get a slip-resistant mat to put down., Use a hose attachment to wet your dog’s entire coat with warm water. You can also use a bucket to pour water over it if you do not have a hose attachment. Make sure that its entire coat, including the layers closest to the skin are saturated with water.


When wetting your dog’s face, place the sprayer close to the skin so you are spraying just the areas you need to wet, not in its eyes, nose, or ears., Once your dog’s coat is saturated, apply an all-purpose dog shampoo all over its body. Use your hands to work the shampoo into a lather, making sure to get the underlying layers of the coat. When shampooing its head, be careful you don’t get shampoo in its eyes, ears, or nose. It is a good idea to use a tearless shampoo on your dog’s face, just in case., Finally, rinse your dog’s coat using the hose attachment or buckets of water. Work your hands through its coat to help work the shampoo out. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. When rinsing around your dog’s face, hold the sprayer or bucket close to its skin so you can better control where the water is going., Once all the shampoo is rinsed out, use a towel to squeeze as much excess moisture from the coat as possible. Then use a hair dryer to finish drying your dog’s coat. Put the hair dryer on a medium heat setting and hold it at least six inches away from the dog at all times. Brush your dog’s hair in the direction it naturally lays while you blow dry it."

Research a shelter.,
Check out the rescue's website.,
Look into a breeder.,
Check with the original shelter.,
Never dump your dog.,
Be cautious about another home.,
Surrender the dog.",How to Surrender a Dog1," If you want to give your pet to a shelter, research the right one for your dog. Most shelters are overrun with pets, which means that they have no room for new pets. Make sure the shelter you are looking into has a no-kill policy. Shelters that have kill policies typically can only give new pets seven days to find a new home before they are killed.


There are other shelters that have a policy where every dog over four years old will be killed.;
, Most rescue organizations have a list of requirements that have to be met before they can accept a dog. This includes making sure you dog has certain vaccinations. Many organizations also require your dog to be fixed.


If your dog has not been fixed, there are some charities or animal organizations that may be able to help or offer low cost options.You should also ask your vet for a copy of your dog's medical history. This will give the rescue organization a full background on your dog. Even if your dog is and has always been healthy, any potential new owner will need to see that your dog is up to date on his shots., If the dog you can no longer handle is a purebred, you may want to look into a breeder that is specific for that breed. You can go back to the breeder that you bought the dog from or ask your vet about other breeders in the area for that kind of dog.


You may also be able to look specifically for a breeder rescue society. These societies help arrange foster homes for specific pedigreed dogs and typically have a higher success rate than normal shelters., If you got your dog from a shelter to begin with, you may be able to return your dog to that shelter. Sometimes this is written into the shelter contract when you get the dog originally. Look back at the paperwork you have on them or call the shelter to ask., If you cannot keep the dog and have no other options, do not dump your dogs on the side of the road. This is not good for your dog or the animal population. Also never dump your dog at a shelter either. Just call the shelter and explain your circumstances. They may take him in if you explain your circumstances.


Some shelters do charge fees to take ward the dogs., If you are looking into giving away your dog to a good home, make sure you know the person you are giving your dog to. Instead of giving him away on the side of the road, try to give the dog to someone you know or a friend of a friend that you know will give him a good home.


You don't know the intention of some of the people who may be adopting a dog off the side of the road. The new people may want your dog for dog fighting or some other bad purpose.

, Once you have decided a shelter to surrender your dog to, you need to find out if you need to fill out any necessary paperwork required by the shelter. These forms act as the official surrender documentation that legitimizes the ownership transfer process. You may also have to pay a fee to help with housing and rehoming costs. Once the forms are filled out and you have the fees, you should take your dog to the shelter and hand it all over.


The forms are also used by the shelter or rescue to get to know your dog, so they can provide the best care while he is there as well as help find him a good home.Breeders may have a similar form or paperwork that is required for official surrender. Ask whatever facility you found to surrender your dog about their specific requirements.

Remove “tear build up.” Many dogs have a condition known as epiphora.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,
Clip their nails.",How to Groom a Short Haired Dog3," Keeping your dog’s ears clean is an important aspect of grooming. This is especially true if your shorthaired dog has floppy ears. To avoid getting soap or water in your dog’s ears, it is best to clean the ears outside of the bath.Moisten the corner of a washcloth with warm water and wipe around the ear opening.
Do this 1-2 times per month.
Avoid going too deep into the ear.

, This means that excess tears flow their eyes, creating a stain on the fur. If your dog has this common condition, you will want to remove this “tear build up” regularly.You can use a commercial product (such as NaturVet) on a cotton ball (available at pet stores).

Work on bad behavior.,
Talk to your new landlord.,
Apply for dog welfare.,
Have your dog checked.,
Look into emigration assistance.,
Consider options for a sick dog.",How to Surrender a Dog2," If you want to rehome your dog because of bad behavior, there are other options you can look into before you get rid of your dog. Before you give away your dog, look into a pet behaviorist. Ask your vet to give you a referral for a trained and qualified behaviorist.


Typically, dogs that behave badly do so because they are anxious, they lack training, or they don't really know what you want them to do. A behaviorist can come into your home and help you figure out the root of your dog's problem and how you can help him change his behavior and make him easier to live with., If you are moving to another house that has a no pets policy, try to talk to landlord to show what a good dog yours is. Consider putting together a portfolio that shows how well behaved and nice your dog is. Put pictures of him with your family to show that he is sociable and well behaved.


Also put together all his vet records that shows he is healthy and up to date on his vaccines and other shots.
You can even have someone who knows your dog to write a canine character reference that may sway your landlord's mind. , If you are thinking of rehoming your dog because of financial problems, there are different charities to help you. They may be able to help you with vet bills or food bills. There are also dog food banks that may be able to give you food for your dog if you can't afford it and your dog is in genuine need.


If you need help with vet bills, try the Pet Fund, which is a charity that helps cover dog costs.
You can also take out a credit card specifically for dog healthcare, such as Care Credit. This could help your dog's treatment be easier to manage over time.
The Humane Society also has an extensive list of organizations that can help you with your dog costs., There may be a medical reason for why your dog is irritated or aggravating to you. Take your dog to the vet to see if he is suffering from a medical problem that might be causing problems.

, If you are considering getting rid of your dog because you are emigrating to another country, there are some things that might help you. Many countries have Pet Travel systems that can help your move your dog into their country. This requires you to provide certain documents that prove he is free from disease before he can enter the country.

, Most likely the dog will not have a collar. If this is the case check the dogs age. It is easy determine if it is a puppy or an adult. There are many other stages of dog hood but these are the most important.

,


If the dog is a puppy head straight to the store. You will need loads of dog food. Puppies eat more food than you could imagine. You could also buy a bed but it isn't necessary. A fuzzy blanket and cardboard box is all you need. Lastly you will probably need a chew toy or two. Puppies will chew anything they can get to. I'm sure you rather have the puppy chew a chew toy than your favorite heels.
If the dog is an adult you will need to go to the store. Food is all you will need. Dogs are easier to care for than puppies. As with the puppies you can but a bed but it is not necessary. And a chew toy isn't a bad idea.

, These are a must for every dog and puppy. Make sure the puppy is old enough to take the medication. There is an age minimum of six weeks. But it could be longer so make sure to check the packaging.

, A couch is probably the best thing you can use. Lay many old towels across the couch. It is a good idea to make many layers. Next lay an old blanket over the towels. The blanket will comfort the dog and if it is a puppy the the blanket and towels will prevent your couch from getting soiled from the pup.

, Think about it that animal didn't just magically appear on your doorstep. It has been through a lot and needs someone to feel safe with.

, Keep fresh food and water available at all times. I know the experts say to feed at a certain time but that is not a good idea. The dog can't talk so you don't know when he's hungry, be humane and keep food available at all times.

, Do you want to give the pet away, do you want to find the owner, or do you want to keep it? If the dog is and adult or adolescent you should try to fin the owner. If it is a puppy keeping it or giving it away is a better idea.

, Make signs and flyers leave your number so the owner can call you.

, Posting adds in the newspaper is also a good idea to.

, Also take the dog to the vet and get its shots up to date and get a check up. Make sure to give the dog lots of love and always be a responsible pet owner.

Petfinder
Center for Lost Pets
Lost Dogs of America
Lost Pet USA
Missing Pet Partnership
Your social media accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.

, Someone might call and claim to have found your dog. You shouldn’t immediately believe them. Instead, ask detailed questions, especially if you are offering a reward for the dog.For example, have the caller describe your dog’s distinguishing characteristics.


Try to meet the caller and the dog in a neutral, public place that is busy. Meeting will give you a chance to confirm the dog is yours.
Take a friend with you.You’ll feel safer with someone else around.
Hand over the reward only when you have your dog in hand. Never give the money beforehand.

Identify your dog with tags and a microchip.,
Avoid bragging about your dog.,
Place your dogs with good homes.",How to Report a Stolen Dog3," When not at home, lock your dog inside. When you do let the dog outside, you should supervise where he or she goes.Of course, constant surveillance isn’t always possible.


Consider building a shelter attached to your garage, or keep the dog in a fenced-in area which is not accessible from the road. Preferably, the yard should be behind the house, so it is not even visible form the street.

, If you let your dogs outside, then you’ll want to keep them from roaming far from home. A dog that runs away from home is vulnerable to being stolen. Do the following:Put them on a leash, especially if you can’t supervise where they are going or don’t have a fenced-in area.
Avoid tying their leash to a lamp post or mailbox when you run into a store.Dogs can get free or, worse, become ripe targets for thieves.
Spay or neuter your dog, which will reduce the desire to roam. Also sterilized animals are less valuable to thieves.

, Your dogs should have a collar with an identification tag that includes your name, address, and phone number. Also get microchips for your dogs.Microchips are about the size of a grain of rice and are inserted underneath the dog’s skin.


The microchip contains important information about your dog. When someone passes a scanner over the chip, it can read the unique code. The person scanning your dog then calls a registry and retrieves your contact information.
It costs around $45 to have a microchip implanted. The chip should last the entire life of your dog.Implanting a microchip causes no more pain than a regular vaccination so don’t avoid a microchip out of fear of hurting your dog.

, If you have a purebred dog, you might be tempted to tell other people. You should avoid doing so. Bragging about your dog might only serve to temp other people to steal it.If you want to brag about your dog, then brag about how loving and loyal it is. Don’t mention how much you paid or how rare your dog is.
Most dogs are stolen for profit motives. For example, they may be sold to puppy mills to act as breeders.The less you say about the dog's monetary value, the better.

, Avoid giving your dogs away for free, since scammers will jump at the opportunity. Charging even a minimal amount (such as $25) will weed out the dishonest buyers.Also do the following:


Ask for and check references. If someone approaches you without references, then you should reconsider placing a dog with them.
Visit the new owner’s home. Drop by casually by check to see that the conditions are safe.

Learn why you should register your dog.,
Determine where you want to register your dog.,
Avoid suspicious or non-reputable dog registries.,
Fill out and submit the application.,
Wait for your registration certificate.,
Check the accuracy of the registration certificate.",How to Register Your Dog," Regardless of which dog registry you are considering, it is important for you to understand the benefits of dog registration. For example, registering your dog provides valid proof that you are his owner.Obtaining this proof is one of the first steps towards becoming a responsible pet owner.If your dog is purebred, registering him helps ensure that his pedigree remains intact from one generation to the next.Purebred dog registries provide other benefits, such as maintenance of birth records.You can still enjoy the benefits of dog registration even if your dog is not purebred. Registries such as the Dog Registry of America and the National Hybrid Registry accept non-purebred dogs.Remember that registration is not proof of breed quality.This is more applicable if you are looking to purchase a purebred dog, rather than registering your own.
If you are only interested in registering your dog for proof of ownership, then getting an Identichip/microchip implanted in your dog is best. If your dog gets lost and is picked up by a rescue, the shelter will scan the chip, pick up the unique number, and be able to reunite the two of you.;
, The three most reputable and well-known all-breed registries in North America are the AKC, the United Kennel Club, and the Canadian Kennel Club.It may be helpful to start your search with these registries to determine if your dog is eligible for registration.


The website http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dogregistry/dogclubsregistries.htm provides a comprehensive list of dog registries for both purebred and non-purebred dogs.
If you have a service dog, consider registering him with a service dog registry, such as the United States Service Dog Registry.Some dog breeds are so rare that they are not listed on the more common dog registries. The American Rare Breed Association has a registry for rare dog breeds (e.g., wirehaired Vizsla, miniature American shepherd).There are also breed-specific registries, such as the registry associated with the Australian Shepherd Club of America., Not all dog registries are created equal. Dog registries that primarily cater to puppy mills are not reputable and should be avoided. Also, be suspicious of dog registries that do not require a valid proof of pedigree.


Do not use dog registries that require only a photo of your dog as proof of his pedigree.
Reputable dog registries are non-profit organizations. Be wary of dog registries that are for-profit companies.
Avoid dog registries that do not have a code of ethics or set of standards that registrants must follow.
Some online registries may be especially unscrupulous by charging unreasonably high fees or disappearing after receiving your payment.Consider speaking with your veterinarian, other dog owners, or a reputable breeder for recommendations on respectable registries.

, Although the application format itself will vary from one dog registry to another, the required information is generally the same. For example, you will need to provide your contact information and specific information about your dog (breed, name, sex, date of birth).Other registration requirements may include information about your dog’s breeder, photos of your dog, and a three-generation pedigree certificate.Requesting the three-generation pedigree certificate will probably require additional payment.To register your dog through the AKC, you will need to obtain the registration application from the breeder from whom you purchased your dog.If you are registering your service dog, you will likely need to provide valid proof of your disability.If payment is required, be aware that your payment may be nonrefundable.Some dog registries will have applications that you can fill out and submit online. For others, you may have to download the application from their website and fill it out by hand.

, The length of time between submitting your application and receiving your dog’s official registration certificate will vary between dog registries. For example, the registration process usually takes about three weeks for the AKC.Consider contacting the registry if its website does not provide information on when you can expect to receive the registration certification following submission of the application.

, It is important to carefully read through the information on your dog’s registration certificate. Contact the registry if you notice any errors or inaccuracies on the certificate."

Figure out what type of the care the dog needs.,
Create a temporary home for the dog.,
Bring the dog to adoption events.,
Be prepared to give up the dog if a permanent home is found.",How to Save a Dog Whose Owner Is Relocating1," If you decide to foster the dog, where you care for it temporarily until a permanent home is found, you should still register the dog with a shelter or rescue group. You will need to provide basic information about the dog, such as its breed, its age, its gender, and its name. You may also need to get the dog’s owner’s approval to foster the dog until a home is found for it.The shelter or agency may also require you to fill out an application for fostering so they can ensure you are a good foster candidate. You will need to note that you have a permanent place of residence where the dog can stay as well as the time and energy to care for the dog.;
, A big element of fostering is dog is that you are only meant to have the dog in your care for a set amount of time. Most fostering agencies ask you to agree to at least two weeks of care for the dog. You may opt to foster the dog for a longer period of time, especially if you start to bond with the dog and there is no available permanent home for it yet.You should find out exactly how long the rescue group or shelter needs you to foster the dog. Then, you can decide on your own if you want to extend this time so you are caring for the dog for longer than the agreed upon time.

, You should also determine what you will need to provide for the dog as its temporary caretaker. Find out if the dog is house trained or if you will need to teach it this skill. Determine if the dog has any medical issues that need to be addressed by speaking to the dog’s current owner or by bringing the dog to the vet.If you foster the dog by going through a shelter or rescue group, they may offer to cover any medical care the dog needs so it stays healthy enough to be adopted later. Talk to them about this option.

, As the temporary caretaker for the dog, you should set up a sleeping space and a play space for the dog in your home. You should also create a walking schedule for the dog so it gets enough exercise every day. You may take any toys the current owner has and bring them into your home for the dog to play with.You should also ensure the dog gets along with any pets you may already have in your home, such as other dogs, cats, or birds. You may need to keep the dog in a separate area or room so your other pets can get used to it over time.

, As a foster parent, you will need to be willing to set aside some time on the weekends to bring the dog to adoption events. These events will help introduce the dog to potential owners and increase its chances of getting adopted.Many adoption events are held on the weekends at local pet stores or pet friendly venues. The shelter or rescue group should provide you with information about these events.

, Though you may enjoy fostering the dog, you should be prepared to give the dog to a permanent owner if one is found. You should prepare yourself emotionally for this moment, as you will be required to do it as a foster parent to the dog.If you bond with the dog, you may decide to adopt the dog yourself. You may also consider adoption if it has been months and the dog still has not been placed in a forever home.

Give your dog a name.,
Designate an area for your dog to sleep.,
Pick a dog food for your friendly friend!,
Make sure your dog has a source of water available at all time.,
Provide playtime for your pet.,
Give them a collar and tags.,
Vet checkups.",How to Own a Dog," This is something that will affect your pet for life. Don't name it something too long or something that you don't like. Don't name her Kitty just because your sister made you for revenge on not getting a family cat! It's important that your dog has a nice name for tags and a word to respond to when he or she gets lost.;
, The first night must always be prepared with one simple question: Where do they sleep? Will they sleep in a dog bed in your room or in the garage? Or maybe the backyard? Wherever it may be, make sure it's warm during the winter and cool during the summer so they can sleep comfortably. Make it protected from possible dangers and the possibility of escaping.

, Make sure not to feed it chicken and leftovers as a daily meal. They are unhealthy and can lead to obesity or diabetes, and we don't want unnecessary vet bills to pile up.

, Put two water bowls available: In your backyard and in your house. They need something to drink out of. Pick a specific spot to place the bowl. Make sure it is refilled with fresh, cool water daily. Don't move the bowl to a new spot everyday, that can cause confusion to your dog. If your dog knows the bowl is in one spot, he'll know it's there for him when he needs it.

, Each day you should designate at least one hour of playtime, let it be day or night, rain or shine. Exercise can mean many things considering the size of your dog. A medium sized dog could do just fine with a 20 minute walk and some throw toys. A small dog could be happy with a 30 minute game of fetch and a short walk. A large dog will probably need a long walk, a game of fetch, and some chew toys. Please provide playtime for your dog at least once a day. Don't forget or be too lazy. It only makes your dog unhappy.

, At your local pet store there should be a machine that provides pet tags for your dog. All dogs need a collar and tags to go on it. All the tag should say is the dog's name and an email or phone number to call if they are lost. If you think this step is not important, do your research! As smart as your dog might seem to be, curiosity can overcome the voice in your dog's head that tells them ""No, don't do it"". Dogs will get loose at some point in their life, and with no tags there is no one to figure out who their owner is. You will be saving your dogs physical and mental wellness by getting them tags. Microchips cannot be seen and plenty of people don't look for it or get the stray scanned for one- they only look for what's visible. So the tags are extremely important and should be taken care of right away.

, If you can't afford a monthly checkup, at least do it every so often. Even if it's just once, make sure you can do it. Give them their shots and make sure they are healthy. If you see any signs of illness, report to a vet immediately to make sure your furry friend is not in pain!

Limit outdoor time in the yard during the last two to three weeks before moving.,
Walk your dog twice a day during the last week before the move.,
Spend time playing with your dog indoors every day.,
Introduce your dog to training pads.,
Purchase training pads and other supplies before moving to the apartment.",How to Prepare Your Small Dog for Apartment Living1," Outdoor space will be limited in the new apartment. Taking your small dog out in the yard less often before moving will help it get used to no longer having a yard for running around.


Try not to abruptly stop taking your dog out in the yard. Make the transition gradual. This will give your dog time to adjust.
Try shortening outside time a little more every few days. If your dog is used to being outside for two hours total every day, try shortening the time to an hour and 45 minutes. After three to four days of that, cut the time down to an hour and a half. Continue cutting the total time until the move.
You can start shortening time outside in the yard each time you take the dog out to use the bathroom. Rather than let the dog run around, bring him back in as soon as he’s done.;
, Small dogs need exercise just like larger ones, but the opportunity to be outside will be limited in the apartment. A walk in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening will give your dog the daily exercise it needs. Plus, starting the walks before the move will help your dog adapt to its new routine after the move.

, Once you move, you’ll no longer be able to play with your dog out in the yard whenever you want. Getting your dog used to indoor playtime before the move can help it more easily adjust to the new apartment. After the move, your dog will probably look forward to indoor playtime together.


Play fetch with a soft toy that won’t knock over any breakable items in your apartment.
Play hide and seek with a bone, ball, or dog toy. Show your dog the item, then hide it somewhere and let your pooch find it.
Practice old and new tricks, such as sit or roll over. Let your dog proudly show you he’s still good at tricks he’s already learned. Then challenge him by teaching a new trick.
Create a small obstacle course for your dog to navigate. Choose an area with the most open floor space, such as the living room. Then set up a few items for the dog to climb or jump over, or to go around or crawl through. You can use boxes, crates, chairs, baskets, or anything you have on hand.

, Training pads work great with small dogs. The pads can absorb any accidents your dog might have in the new apartment. You can also choose to train your dog to intentionally go on the training pads all the time since you won’t have a yard for the dog to go in.


Place training pads in areas of your home similar to where you plan to have them in the apartment. For instance, keep one in or near the bathroom and do the same once you move. This will help your dog more easily find the pads after moving to the new place.

, Gathering many of the items you’ll need for your dog in the new apartment ahead of time will make things easier on you after the move. You and your dog will both be better prepared for life in the apartment.


Items you might need for your small dog in the apartment include training pads, a leash for walks, and toys for indoor playtime.

Consider the age of the dog.,
Play fetch.,
Play tug-of-war with your dog.,
Blow children's soap bubbles for your dog.,
While playing with your dog it should always be a group activity, keeping your dog stimulated and entertained when he is alone is also important.",How to Play with Dog Indoors," Puppies (which, depending on the breed, can be up to 2 years of age) will often be rambunctious and enjoy roughhousing. Older dogs on the other hand (depending on breed) rather do something quiet or maybe a calmer game.;
, Some breeds of dogs generally enjoy fetching more than others. Find an open space and throw a tennis ball or a Frisbee, and hope that Rover will bring it back. (Be attentive to puppies who may be in their ""chewing phase"" because they can end up tearing the fuzz off a tennis ball or chew plastic Frisbees and end up swallowing materials to throw it up again. If your dog does not drop it, one option is to bring two fetch toys. Throw the second one to get the first one.

, Don't be scared of some growling, as long as the dog's tail is wagging. It is a common misconception that one should never let the dog ""win"" a tug. Whether or not to allow the dog to win is dependent on the temperament of the dog. Some dogs are confident and spirited and do not need much encouragement from their owners. These dogs should not be allowed to win, as winning the tug is a simple way of establishing the proper hierarchy. However, many pet dogs are submissive, anxious, and lacking in self-confidence. It is healthy, and recommended, to allow these dogs to win tugs. It helps boost their confidence and drive. Playing (and losing) tug-of-war with a low-drive dog is a common technique used by professional trainers to build a dog's self-worth. Just imagine how you'd feel if you were asked to play a game you always lose.

, Many dogs love to chase the bubbles, jump and ""catch"" them in mid-air.

, Some important things to keep in mind are:

"
"
Establish yourself as the leader.,
Be consistent.,
Socialize your dog.,
Speak in your dog's language.,
Teach the dog good behaviors.,
Use a calm tone.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Reprimand, don't punish.,
Give your dog affection at the proper time.,
Pet your dog.,
Give the dog treats.,
Exercise your dog.,
Spend time with your dog.,
Be near your dog.,
Give your dog outlets.,
Feed your dog.,
Groom your dog.,
Give your dog belly rubs.,
Get down on your dog's level.",How to Make Dogs Love You," To gain a dog's respect and to make it feel happy and secure, establish yourself as the leader. This helps your dog understand the pecking order of your home. If you have children, he should be below them in the house hierarchy. The owner or primary caretaker of the dog should be at the top, and your dog should respect this leader. This will ensure a happy home where both you and your dog are safe.


Dogs are pack animals who feel secure when they are being taken care of by someone they respect. This means they can follow someone else's orders and someone else will make the decision while taking care of them and keeping them secure.;
, There's nothing more frustrating for a dog than an owner who can't make up their mind. Dogs like structure and rules so things are predictable, and therefore, less confusing or stressful.By establishing boundaries for your dog, they feel secure and loved. By praising your dog when he consistently follows the rules, you increase his confidence, show him he's loved, and make him eager to please you.By being consistent and establishing boundaries for the dog, he will come to respect and love you.


Dogs don't understand exceptions. If you don't want your dog eating human food while you're at the table or laying on the furniture, don't let him do it at all. Your dog won't understand the concept of a special occasion.
Don't let a dog up onto the bed one day and then get mad when he jumps up on the bed the next day while muddy. The dog doesn't understand the difference.Use single word commands like ""sit"" and ""stay"" and stick to them. Don't use ""stay"" one day and ""wait"" the next. If you teach a dog to lie down by saying ""down,"" don't teach him to get off of the couch by saying ""down."" He'll think you want him to lie down; use ""off"" instead.

, Dogs are social, so they need to be socialized with other people and other dogs. They love going places with you, and taking them along to meet people and animals shows that you love them.Plus, he will learn to be friendly to both if he is familiar with them.


Dogs are pack animals, and they love being with their pack. Take them on rides in the car, take them to the park with you, and even take them on vacation. This not only helps the dog not be bored, but shows him you love him., Dogs don't communicate the way humans do. They don't understand words, beyond a simple command. They understand body language. Learn how to read your dog's body language. More important, pay special attention to your body language. This is especially important when you are training your dog. Your body will speak louder than your words., One way to bond with your dog is to teach him good behaviors. This includes things like ""sit"" and ""stay.""


You also want to teach the dog not to do negative behaviors. This may include not biting another dog or person, not running off, or not being aggressive., Talk to your dog. When you speak to your dog, talk in a warm, calm tone. Don't yell or be angry. Let the dog hear and sense affection from your tone of voice.Remember that dogs pay as much attention to body language as words. Make sure you always pay attention to what your body is doing while you are interacting with your dog., When training your dog, use positive reinforcement instead of punishment. Dogs learn much better this way. Always reward good behavior. Give them praise, petting, and treats when they do something correctly. They will choose these behaviors and feel secure and happy knowing what to do. Make sure to do this quickly. Don't fawn.Giving dogs treats as a reward encourages them to behave well if the treats are connected to good behavior. Be sure to use a variety of rewards - not just food treats, but toys, attention, games, and activities. Use positive praise with a happy voice and back scratches.

, When the dog does something wrong, or if he does not perform a command correctly, don't punish him. He might not understand what you mean. Instead, show the dog the correct action. Use scolding or corrections, but never raise your voice or hit the dog.Don't hit the dog either. Your hands shouldn't be used for hitting. Shake the collar, give a leash correction, or help the dog into the correct position. Make sure to give the reprimand with authority. When the dog does what you want, praise and reward him.Be fair and tough. Think about it as tough love. Don't get angry, but expect the dog to obey you.
For example, if your dog starts barking and you say no and it stops, don't punish the dog for barking. Instead reward the dog for stopping.

, Any affection you give your dog needs to be given at the proper time. You should use affection as positive reinforcement for good behavior. If you give affection when the dog is doing bad behavior, you will be teaching the dog that bad behavior is okay.


Give your dog affection after exercise, feeding, obeying a command, changing a behavior, or calming down. Don't give affection when the dog is angry, irritated, whining, begging, or breaking rules., Petting your dog is a great bonding experience, but make sure you do it correctly. Most dogs don't like being patted or touched on the head because this is a show of dominance. Instead, scratch the dog behind the ears. Or pet the dog on the back or rear right near the tail.You can also try scratching your dog under the chin or on the belly.Exercise caution when hugging your dog. Many dogs will take that as a sign of dominance and feel threatened. Other dogs may love it. Watch your dog's body language to figure out which he prefers.

, One way to make your dog love you is by giving him treats. Remember, you should only give dogs treats as a reward for good behavior. Before giving the dog a treat, ask him to sit, stay, or obey another command. Treats should be used as positive reinforcement.

, Dogs with pent up energy tend to become destructive and depressed. You want to make sure you walk him every day.When you go for a walk, keep the leash loose so the dog knows you are calm and relaxed. While you two are walking, let the dog smell and explore. On these walks, go slower and longer. This gives your dog some mental and sensory stimulation he craves and enjoys.Dogs need daily exercise to keep them healthy. But it is also an activity they enjoy. Taking them outside for walks, playing games with them, and allowing them to exercise shows that you love them because you let them do fun things. This also helps keep your dog mentally stimulated and healthy, which keeps him happy and shows you love him., It is important for you to do joint activities with your dog. This includes daily exercise, obedience classes, grooming, or playing.Play controlled running, chasing, and fetch games with your dog.
Don't tease your dog by covering it with a blanket or pulling its tail., Spending time with your dog doesn't always mean cuddling. They love to sleep next to you or by your feet. They also love to cuddle. Balance how you spend time with your dog so they always feel loved., Just like you, your dog gets stressed, bored, or frustrated and needs an outlet. Get your dog safe chew toys. Try hiding treats or cheese bits in them when you are gone to work to give him something to do.If he digs, make him a ""dig box"" (a wooden frame in the ground, filled with soft dirt, this saves your yard!).

, Feeding your dog is an essential chore, but you can make it a bonding experience. Give your dog healthy, tasty food. This shows that you care and love the dog. Even try cooking for your dog if you have the time and interest., Another way to bond with your dog is to groom him. Give him baths, brush him, and keep him clean. Grooming is a way for you to spend time with your dog and a way for you to touch your dog, which shows affection., Your dog loves to be touched. It's one of the ways he communicates. Give your dog a belly rub to show him you love him. If you have some extra time, give him a massage. Start by rubbing his coat and skin below the neck in circles. Make your way down his back and flank. He'll love you for it., Show your dog you love him by getting down on the ground to play with him. If you're always standing up and over him, it makes you dominant and could cause stress. Getting down on your dog's level shows that you trust your dog, which can help build his trust in you.Some trainers think this is not a good idea. They believe you should always assert your dominance over your dog and never get on his level. Decide for yourself if you feel you can get on the ground and play with your dog and still be the leader.

, This will get him used to some of the procedures your vet may do on him during his next appointment.


The key to success is to reward your dog’s good behavior with a tasty treat or a sign of praise. This way, your dog associates the slightly uncomfortable experience of being touched in certain areas with a highly pleasurable reward.

, Your dog may have an area or spot that is “no-go” where he doesn’t like to be touched. If, for example, your dog is skittish about his ears being touched, start by briefly touching his ear and give him an immediate reward (a treat) so he understands why he's being rewarded.


Don't rush and take as long as necessary for him to accept the fleeting touch. Once you've achieved this landmark, build up the time you spend touching his ear, and work up to lifting his ear flap.

, This way he is less likely to interpret the vet's examination as invasive, and more likely to interpret it as one long petting session.

, Regular obedience work like sit, stay and heel will help make it clear to your dog who the authority figure is in his life.


This training also gives your dog a stable influence to rely on during times of stress, such as a visit to the vet clinic. His anxiety will be relieved to some extent if he can look to you for guidance, especially if you are calm and your body language tells him there is nothing to worry about.
Obedience training also helps your dog to focus in the waiting room. If he is anxious, but well trained, distract him by giving him commands to do tricks. He'll be so busy trying to please you and show what he can do that he'll forget where he is and calm down.

Consider search and rescue training.,
Certify your dog as a therapy dog.,
Volunteer with your dog.",How to Show Your Pride As a Dog Owner3," Dogs can do amazing things like locating lost children, following a missing Alzheimer’s patient’s path from a nursing home, and assisting law enforcement officers at crime scenes. If your dog has a good nose, consider showing your pride as a dog owner by training them as a search and rescue dog.You can find out about opportunities for search and rescue training by contacting your local search and rescue or law enforcement organization., Dogs who are certified as therapy dogs can bring joy and healing to a wide variety of people struggling with a vast array of issues or situations. Therapy dogs can help children, the elderly, and those fighting mental or physical illness. Consider getting your dog certified as a therapy dog if you want to show your pride by helping others.Contact the American Kennel Club to find out how you can certify your pooch as a therapy dog.

, Whether it’s a charity run with your pet, or taking them to a local nursing home to visit residents, there are many opportunities to show your pride as a pet owner through volunteerism. Contact your local animal shelter or community volunteer board to seek out opportunities near you.Some ideas for volunteering with your dog include donating pet blood, taking in a foster dog who needs to socialize with other pets, or visiting a local hospital that welcomes dog interactions with patients.

Contact a dog shelter or a rescue group.,
Provide information about the dog to the shelter.,
Monitor the dog’s progress through the agency.",How to Save a Dog Whose Owner Is Relocating2," If you are not able to give the dog a home but you do not want the dog to end up homeless, you can contact your local dog shelter or rescue group. Call them directly and ask them if they would take in the dog and register the dog for adoption.You can find dog shelters and rescue groups in your area by searching online or by calling your local Humane Society.
Look for dog shelters that have a no-kill policy, as this will ensure the shelter will not put the dog down if a home cannot be found within a certain time limit.
Be aware that surrendering the dog to a pound means the dog’s chances of finding a new home are very limited. Most pounds are only legally required to hold a pet for 72 hours and then the pet may be put down.

, You will need to provide basic information about the dog to the shelter, such as the dog’s breed, age, gender, and given name. You may also need to tell the shelter about the dog’s training and any behavioral problems it may have. Speak to the dog’s current owner to get this information.


Keep in mind the shelter may ask you to keep the dog with you for a few days while they try to find a placement for it. Many shelters have a waitlist for rehoming dogs so you may need to wait a few days for a response.

, Once the dog is accepted at the shelter, they may be kept there until they are rehomed. You may call the shelter or rescue group and ask about the dog to determine if it is healthy and well cared for. This may also be a good way to keep tabs on where the dog is at in terms of being up for adoption or being fostered by a temporary owner.


You may also help the shelter with rehoming the dog by advertising the dog on social media and online. You may also consider fostering the dog until a permanent home can be found for the pet.

Try to do everything around the same time each day.

, If you live with a partner, roommate, or family member, your dog will feel less anxious about its new home in the apartment if someone is always there during the first few weeks.When one of you is out, the other can stay with the dog. This isn’t always possible due to work schedules and other commitments, but doing it when you can will be comforting to your dog.


It shouldn’t be necessary to continue having someone stay home indefinitely. Once your dog shows signs of feeling at ease in the apartment, try leaving it home alone. You can tell your dog is feeling comfortable when it holds its ears and tail in their natural, relaxed positions when you are getting ready to leave.
Skip this step if you live alone.

, Your dog might be nervous about being in a new home and feel anxious when you’re not there. Even the smallest dog can become too noisy and annoy the neighbors when barking for its owner. To help your pup get used to being without you in the new apartment, step out briefly.Check your mail, chat with a neighbor down the hall, or run a quick errand. As your dog gets used to you being away for short periods of time, it will also be less anxious when you’re gone longer.

, A space where your dog can get cozy, or take a break when needed, will help your dog feel safe and comfortable in its new home.Make the space comfortable by placing familiar items there, such as a favorite toy or blanket. These should be items your dog had in the old home before the move.

Hire someone to check on your dog during the day.,

It can be comforting just having the crate as a safe place for the dog to take refuge when you’re out.


For more details about crate training, read Crate Train Your Dog or Puppy.

, Even the smallest dogs need daily exercise. Since your pup no longer has its own yard to run and play in every day, you’ll need to schedule daily walks. A walk first thing in the morning and another one late afternoon will keep your dog healthy and happy.Walk your dog for at least 20-30 minutes each time.Getting your dog outdoors daily prevents your pet from being cooped up in the apartment for too long, which can lead to unwanted behaviors such as chewing on furniture.

, Your dog will probably need to go to the bathroom at least three times during the day. If you don’t plan to use indoor training pads, take your dog out to use the bathroom once each in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

, In addition to daily walks, your pooch will benefit from more extensive exercise at least one day each week.A walk in any park is great, but parks designated specifically for dogs are excellent places for allowing your pup to stretch its legs and run around freely.


Exercising your dog regularly will keep it happy in your new, smaller home, and your dog will look forward to weekly trips to the park.

, If you are away at work all day, having someone else stop by your apartment can be reassuring to your dog. Family members, friends, or neighbors are all people to ask.

Get your dog used to standing on a scale by weighing him at home.,
Practice picking up your dog at home and placing him on a table.,
Stick to your regular routine on the day of the vet appointment.,
If possible, take your dog for a long walk or run before going to the vet.",How to Prepare Your Dog for the Vet2," Most veterinary clinics weigh their patients as this helps monitor the pet's health and provide an accurate weight for drug dosages. But, the scales will tip slightly under your dog’s paws and could freak him out enough that he will refuse to go back onto the scale.


If your dog is small enough, get him used to the tipping sensation by putting him on a bathroom scale.
If he is a larger dog, make an impromptu wobble board, perhaps using a coffee table with one leg resting on a slim book. Once he is on the board, give him lots of praise or a treat to reward his bravery.
Do not force your dog to stay on if he is panicking. A few seconds is fine for the first attempt. On the next try, get him to stand on the scale or board a little longer for the promise of a treat.

, If you have a large dog, your vet will likely examine him on the floor, so you do not need to worry about this step. But medium sized dogs will be picked up by your vet and placed on an examination table and this may unsettle him.


Once he is on the table give him lots of praise or a treat. Your aim is to get him to associate the table with positive things. Initially, put him on the table and then lift him down after a few seconds so that he doesn't have time to develop negative associations.
With each repeated trip up onto the table he will increasing associate it with pleasant things (a treat or petting and attention) and come to look forward to it.
Once he gets used to the table at home, it will be less alarming at his vet appointment.

, Dogs are creatures of habit and cancelling a walk will alert him that something is up.

, Burning off excess physical energy will likely tire out your dog and make him less likely to have any spare energy for nervous anxiety at the vet.

Discuss adoption with the dog’s current owner.,
Bring the dog to the vet.,
Integrate the dog into your household.",How to Save a Dog Whose Owner Is Relocating3," If you are able to adopt the dog, you should arrange the adoption with the dog’s current owner.

If the dog’s owner is not available, you may be able to go forward with adopting the dog without the previous owner’s consent.


You may then decide to register the dog in your name. The previous owner may need to authorize you as the new owner for you to do this. You will need complete a registration form and pay licensing fee to have the dog registered as your property., Once you have the dog in your care, you should take the dog to the vet for a full check up. Have the vet do a physical exam on the dog as well as blood tests.

Bathe your dog.,
Refrain from microchipping your dog yourself.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Fill out the paperwork.,
Check the microchip's ID number.,
Have the nurse hold your dog still.,
Have the vet inject the microchip.,
Recheck the microchip.,
Keep your information up to date.",How to Microchip Your Dog1," Before you get your dog microchipped, she needs to be clean. This is so the injection site is nice and clean when the vet injects the microchip into your dog.;
, You should not inject your dog with a microchip at home. It is illegal in many states to implant your dog yourself and you can have legal action brought against you. Even if you are able to buy a microchip from a third part source, do not implant the chip yourself.

, Microchips should always be injected by a qualified medical professional. It is much safer for your dog because your vet knows exactly where the microchip should be placed, how much pressure should be used, and what to look for in the rare chance there is any reaction to the microchip.


You can hurt your dog if she isn't injected in the right way., When you are having your dog microchipped, you need to fill out the paperwork that comes with the microchip so the microchip is registered. The information that you list on these forms is how your dog will be returned to you if she is ever lost or recovered. Your vet will then send off the paperwork to the manufacturer's database for you.


There is a fee to register the paperwork, which is often included in your vet bill.
Make a copy of this paperwork if your vet doesn't offer you one. This will ensure that you have all the right information about your dog's microchip., Before your vet injects the microchip, she will place the microchip reader over the needle with the microchip in it to make sure it reads clearly and emits the right unique ID number.


The number should match that on your paperwork.
You should also keep this number for your records., Your vet can perform the microchip injection in the normal exam room. She will require the assistance of a nurse to help her with the injection. The nurse will gently hold your dog steady by placing one arm beneath your dog's body and gently place the crook of his arm under her neck.


He will then hold the dog close to his body so she can't move., Once the nurse has your dog secure, your vet can locate the place between your dog's shoulder blades where the chip will be implanted. You vet will gently pull up the skin in this area and she will implant the microchip, about the size of a grain of rice, directly under the skin with the applicator.The skin doesn't need an alcohol swab or other preparation as long as your dog is clean.

, Once the microchip is implanted in your dog, the vet will recheck the chip to make sure it is still transmitting now that it is in your dog's skin. Once the number reads the right unique ID, your dog is ready to go.


Your vet will also routinely check the chip once a year to make sure it is functioning properly., If you move, change your phone number, or if any other contact information changes, make sure you tell your vet or contact the manufacturer's database about your change in information.


They will update your information as soon as possible so your dog can be returned to the right place if she goes missing."

Avoid speaking in a high pitched voice, shaking, sweating, or giving your dog too much attention.,
Take deep breaths to calm yourself and try to act normal.,
Get him to do a trick or two.,
Ignore your dog’s nervous behavior and speak to him firmly.,
If the vet is running late, take your dog for a short walk in the area.",How to Prepare Your Dog for the Vet3," Your dog takes his cues from your body language. So if you are a bundle of nerves, he will believe there is something to worry about. Likewise, if he is anxious and you reassure him too much, you are inadvertently confirming to him that he is right to be fretful and there is real danger.

, Being calm will also keep your dog calm. Sending encouraging signals to your dog by not addressing his anxious behavior (so as not to enforce it) and perhaps chat to other people in the waiting area to show him you are not concerned.

, That way, he will be showing good behavior that needs rewarding. Not only will this divert his attention, it will likely keep the other patients smiling and he may receive praise from them, which will further ease his anxiety.


Use treats as positive reinforcement. If he approaches the receptionist or sits and wags his tail, reward his brave behavior.
Do not use treats to simply comfort him. If he is shaking, don't give him a treat as you are inadvertently rewarding his fearful behavior.

, This gives him the message that you are not worried, so there is no need for him to be anxious. Of course this may well require some acting on your part as after all, you probably are worried about your pet's health, but do your best and don't let your anxiety show.

, Check with the receptionist to confirm if the vet is busy with another patient and you may have to wait awhile in the waiting room with an anxious dog. A short walk will keep your dog distracted and pass the time a lot quicker for him.

Make sure your dog is comfortable with wearing a collar.,
Get your dog used to wearing a muzzle if he tends to get snappy when anxious.,
Let the vet clinic know if your dog does not get along well with other dogs.",How to Prepare Your Dog for the Vet4," For safety reasons, most clinics insist your dog is restrained on a collar (or harness) and a lead. If your dog is not used to wearing a collar, introduce the idea in stages.


First, show the collar to him and let him sniff it. Reward this positive interest with a pet or a treat.
Place the collar around his neck but without fastening it. Again, tell him how clever he is and pet him.
Practice these actions so that you familiarize your dog with the collar and then fasten it over time. This way, your dog believes the collar means attention and treats.

, Train him to get used to the muzzle in the same way you introduced the collar.


Feed him treats while he is wearing the muzzle, so it almost becomes a feeding port for treats.
There are many different types of muzzles available, so choose one with a gap at the nose end that is large enough to allow you to feed him a treat.

, Phone ahead and let the receptionist know about your dog’s issues. The clinic may have a side room you can wait in, or else book you in a time slot when there are no other dogs around.


If you let the vet know about your dog's preferences in advance, your anxiety levels will drop and your dog will pick up on your sense of calm in a positive way.

Learn why you should microchip.,
Understand how a microchip works.,
Know how long microchips last.,
Learn how much microchips cost.,
Be aware that it doesn't affect your dog's health.",How to Microchip Your Dog2," Microchips greatly increase your chances of having your dog returned to you if she is lost. Collars and other identifying tags can fall off, but microchips never leave your dog once they are implanted., A microchip is a device that emits radio waves at a certain frequency. There are typically three different frequencies that a chip may emit at, but there are universal readers that will read all three frequencies. When the frequency is read, the reader will display the unique ID number attached to your paperwork as well as the manufacturer of the chip. This will tell them which database to contact in order to find your information.


The chip itself does not contain your contact information. It just has your unique ID, which is used to access your paperwork., Microchips do not run on power. They simply reflect a signal back to the scanner. Once your dog has been implanted with a microchip, it will last for her whole life., Most vets charge between $25 to $50 for the implantation of a microchip. This will vary depending on your vet., Microchipping has a very minimal chance of any side effects. There is only a small pain felt when the microchip is injected, similar to that of any shot. Your dog may react to this a little bit, but it will only sting for a few moments.


If your dog is smaller, there may be a little more pain at the moment of injection because she is has less padding.
No surgery or anesthesia is required to implant the microchip. However, many owners opt to have the microchip implanted at the same time she is spayed (or neutered if male) so she gets both procedures handled at one time.There have been a few documented cases of extreme side effects, such as microchip migration that leads to abscesses or, in one case, death, but these are very rare."

OPTIONAL: Take her to a dog show!",How to Make a Small Dog a Diva," Many pets don't like being dressed up, and some are okay with it. Test out your pet when it comes to dressing them up, before you make it a part of their lives. Make sure the clothing is always their size. We don't want a medium sized dog choking on a small sized Shirt.;
, Make sure the carrier is in girly colors OR neon colors, like pink or neon green. The carrier should have a little leash attached to it on the inside, something to hook your diva's collar to.

, If you want a pro to do it, look for a dog groomer that should be perfect when it comes to how you want her to look. If it's a Chihuahua or a Yorkie, just a few brushes and a bow or two is all needed for your dog to look stylish.

, It's very confusing when your dog is named something but you keep giving her nicknames. For example, let's say your dog is named Lydia but you keep calling her cupcake, baby, princess, etc. Simply call her Lydia!

, A spoiled princess needs her room! Make sure you put some of her favorite fluffy toys in the bed so she'll feel protected. Remember, although your dog is a diva, she is also a DOG. Dogs need to feel welcome, protected, and loved.

, Nothing is better than a smart dog! Teach her how to sit, stay, and roll over. Then, once she is ready, train her to do something UNIQUE and helpful. Like closing the door when your hands are full of groceries, etc. She doesn't need to know everything in the world. But these are the RECOMMENDED tricks a dog should know to be called smart. So, three basic commands, one unique and helpful command.

, Your diva SHOULD be picky on what she eats. But that doesn't mean she gets gourmet food. You should feed her things like Beneful or Blue. It's okay to give her your leftovers every once in a while, but NOT all the time. If she begins to expect it every day, STOP FEEDING HER LEFTOVERS.

, The vet knows how to keep your dog healthy. A diva is not a diva if her health is like a stray dog's health! Make sure she is treated for worms if she has any, and give her all of her shots.

, Make sure your life is customized to let your dog go with you. For example, your local bank should be dog-friendly. The mall you go to should be dog-friendly. When you go on vacation, your hotel should be dog-friendly. Taking your dog everywhere makes her life full of fun. Being cooped up in the house all day is BORING.

, Nothing is better than winning a dog show! It only makes your pet even fancier if you win an award! Hang it up somewhere where your guests can see it, so that they are JEALOUS and think HIGHLY of your dog!

Notice if your dog becomes feverish and loses his appetite.,
Pay attention if the fever recurs and he exhibits head cold symptoms.,
Bring your dog to the vet if your dog remains unwell and starts to vomit or have diarrhea.,
Take your dog to the vet if he appears weak, cannot see or stand, and has seizures.,
Allow your vet to confirm your dog’s symptoms.,
Let her analyze tissue samples from your dog’s skin and gut.,
Be aware there is no specific diagnostic test for canine distemper.,
Receive treatment instructions from the vet.",How to Diagnose Canine Distemper," Once your dog has contact with the virus, it may incubate in his body for three to six days. Your dog may become feverish, lose his appetite, and have general head cold symptoms like a runny nose. He may also appear slightly off color or noticeable ill.Blood tests taken at this time would show a dip in his white cell count, as his body is using up white cells to fight off the infection.;
, The first stages of the virus can be subtle and may be missed or incorrectly labeled as a fever or a head cold.


Your dog’s fever may wane and he may appear normal for a few days. Then, the fever will return a second time and your dog may have very intense head cold symptoms, like thick, snotty discharge from his nose, yellow-green discharge from his eyes, and coughing and sneezing.

, At this point, your dog will appear very unwell and likely start to have gastrointestinal issues, like vomiting and diarrhea. These are all signs of canine distemper and means it is time to take your dog to the vet.


As well, once your dog becomes unwell, his immune system will be weak, making him more vulnerable to secondary infections. This is especially prevalent in young dogs, as many young dogs die from distemper due to complications like pneumonia.

, A certain strain of distemper can cause inflammation of your dog’s brain about two to three weeks into the infection. This can then lead to symptoms like stupor, weakness or dullness, an inability to see or stand and seizures.This strain can develop pretty fast, within two to three weeks, or several months to one year later in dogs with strong immune systems.
If the brain damage is not as severe due to this strain, your dog may still have a permanent “tick”, where they twitch or jitter uncontrollably from time to time.
Another late stage symptom is the development of “hard pads”, where the pads and the nose of your dog appear extended and excessive. This is due to hyperkeratosis, the excess production of keratin, which is the horny substance that makes up your dog’s pads and nose.

, Though there are laboratory tests that can be done to detect if your dog has the virus, your vet should also take into account your dog’s symptoms, your dog’s age, and his immune status. She may do a physical exam and ask you when your dog’s symptoms first appeared, as well as how they have progressed.Dogs who are not vaccinated or do not have their booster vaccinations are more susceptible to canine distemper. As well, puppies and young dogs are also more at risk. This is why dogs most at risk for canine distemper are shelter dogs with unknown vaccination histories or pet-shop puppies with an unknown breeding history or bred from an unwell mother.

, Your vet may take samples of your dog’s skin or gut and run tests on them, such as immunofluorescence, to get a definitive diagnosis of the virus.However, tissue sample testing is rarely done in practice, as having a definitive diagnosis does not usually change the treatment or the outcome. Taking a sample can also be invasive and require anesthesia on your already very ill dog.

, Though your vet may run blood tests to rule out other conditions like leukaemia or organ failure, these tests will not necessary confirm the canine distemper diagnosis. Because your dog’s body is trying to fight off the virus by the time he has it, the blood test may not be able to distinguish between antibodies produced due to stimulation by vaccination or those produced due to the virus.Your dog’s body may also be overwhelmed by the virus and be unable to produce antibodies. This means the test results could come back as a false negative, which is due to your dog being too sick to respond to the test.

, Though there is no medication currently available that can eliminate canine distemper, the vet can provide intravenous fluids to prevent your dog from getting dehydrated due to the infection. She may also provide antibiotics to prevent the development of secondary infections while your dog tries to build up his immunity to other diseases or infections.Keep in mind that though some dogs can survive canine distemper, the infection can be fatal for dogs. If your dog recovers from canine distemper, he may experience seizures or other central nervous system disorders that may only appear many years later. He may also have permanent brain and nerve damage, with symptoms that only appear in his later years.

Be prepared for frustration.",How to Make a Puppy Happy," One of the first and most important things that you can do for your dog? Keep the pet up to date on shots. Before you turn a dog loose in the grass, or take the dog to the dog park, you need to make sure that its had rabies, distemper, heart worm, and a variety of other shots necessary to keep your pet healthy.


Depending on the age of your puppy and where you got your pet, this may or may not be a concern. Still, it's always preferable to take your new animal to the vet as soon as possible to learn what you need to do to keep the puppy healthy.;
, Foam beds for puppies are commonly sold for puppies. They have sides wrapped around that give the pup's back something to curl up against. Cover the bed with an old blanket or towel, something that can easily be put in the washing machine but feels cosy. Place it near your own bed, so your dog will feel some kinship with you.


Some dogs don't want to sleep in dog beds, and that's fine. Don't force your pet to sleep somewhere they're uncomfortable. Provide a sleeping blanket if the dog wants it, but don't stress if the pup just wants to crash on the floor.
Avoid wicker baskets, they creak noisily at night and are not as comfortable as foam.

, Play is important for puppies, so it's good to provide a variety of different kinds of toys to play with. Balls, squeaky toys, and rubber rings are all good teething toys, so your pet can chew while teething. You can pull gently on these too, and have a tug of war.


Puppies chew a lot, in the wolf pack its natural, but in the home the pup needs to learn he can only chew his toys, not your house.

, The proper food is essential to your puppy's happiness and overall well being. All puppies are different so choosing the right food for your particular canine will most likely take some trial and error. Talk to your vet for a recommendation.


When you find a food that agrees with your pup, stick with it. Changing your puppy's food too regularly can make dogs sick. If a problem arises and their food must be changed for some reason, always mix the food they are currently eating with the new food for a few days before just quitting the old food cold turkey.

, Depending on the breed, puppies should be fed 2-3 times a day. They eat a lot, because they're growing, so it's important to make sure your new pet is getting enough calories to stay happy and healthy.


Puppies should eat food specifically made to feed to puppies, which is fortified with extra vitamins and nutrients necessary to aid in a puppy's development and growth.
Make sure you have a bowl of water that your dog can reach at all times, and keep it full of fresh clean water. If you have a small breed, you may need to place it in a low dish so he can drink it easily.

, It's important for puppies to get lots of run-around time when they're developing. Play is important to keep your dog happy and healthy. Take your dog for long walks after meals, 2-3 times a day if possible. Even if you don't go for long neighborhood walks, just spending time walking around outside is important.


While you're out, reward the dog with a treat each time ""business"" is done. This helps to train the dog to go outside when nature calls.
If the weather is reasonable, your dog could be put outside in an enclosure for a few minutes after every meal.

, Make sure there are no live wires for your pup to chew through, and make sure to put the dog in a kennel when you go out for any length of time. Try not to be longer than an hour, if at all possible.


You can make it cosy inside the dog's kennel, and make it a fun place to be. Let the dog play in it and leave the cage door open so the dog can find a toy or treat in it. Hopefully, your puppy will soon think of it as somewhere pleasant to go for a short amount of time.

, Remember it will be strange and scary for the puppy to be away from his mother and other puppies in his pack. Know that dogs are pack animals and feel comfortable to be with his pack. To suddenly be without them will leave him feeling lonely and homesick. Understand you are now the alpha in the dog's pack, so make the introduction to your house as good as you can, to make your pet as happy as possible.

, Dogs love to wrestle, nip, and love on their humans. If you want to make your puppy happy, its important to encourage safe and reasonable play. Get down on the floor and play with your pet. Pet them, rough house, and generally just have fun with your dog. Make play an important priority in your life, to keep your dog happy.


To get your puppy accustomed to be handled and have good manners, imprint training is important. Imprinting means that you physically handle the puppy and introduce him to certain objects, places and situations.

, Puppies love to run and explore so the more space the better. Dog parks are great because they not only have the space needed for the puppy, but it also helps to socialize the dog. This is also very important when it comes to the happiness of your animal.

, Puppies will go to the bathroom everywhere when you're first training them. If you want to keep the puppy healthy, start house training them as soon as possible to keep both of you clean and sane.


It's important to remember that Puppies are going to have accidents, just like a toddler being potty trained. Your job as the ""pack leader"" is to lead and guide.
Quick house breaking is essential to the happiness of your puppy because it keeps their confidence up and your stress level down. The more you get frustrated about pup's accidents, the more they tuck their tails in shame and that's no good for either of you.

, It's partially your responsibility to learn to read your dog, and learn when a trip outside is necessary. Dogs don't want to go to the bathroom inside. Pay close attention to your puppy's habits. When pup starts sniffing and moving around in an anxious manner, that is usually a tell tail sign that there's some business that needs doing.


If you see the animal starting to go inside, say, ""No"" firmly and physically take the dog outside. Each time the dog does business outside, it's important to reward the dog with praise and treats.
If you notice that the puppy has gone inside, it's too late to punish that behavior. Dogs aren't able to understand punishment for behaviors they did half an hour ago, or even two minutes ago. Never rub a dog's face in its own mess, or you'll just make the dog afraid of you.

, Training can be a difficult task, because you always have to remain calm and consistent. If your dog chews something that doesn't belong to him, say ""No,"" in a firm voice, and take the item away, then replace it with a toy. Avoid giving mixed messages. If your dog looks really cute and funny picking up a shoe and racing round with it, always be consistent and say ""No,"" remove the shoe, and give the dog a different toy.


Always praise good behavior instead of punishing bad behavior. This is a much more effective way of training dogs.
There's no need to strike or smack dogs to train them properly. Instead, use positive reinforcement when the dog does something right, instead of punishing the dog for doing something wrong.

, Your time as the pack leader is crucial to your puppy's happiness because he needs you to show him the ropes so-to-speak. Your puppy needs stimulation and attention that only you can provide as the human. Talk to your puppy so he can learn your voice, your demands, your tone. This is a great way to bond with your dog, and help the puppy learn your moods and your own personality. All this can make a huge difference in the happiness of the animal.

, Puppies can be frustrating. They'll make a mess. They'll poop in your shoe. They'll chew up that same shoe. Try to remember that the puppy doesn't know how to behave in your house. This is the first time your new pet will have a chance to learn how to behave. Try to be calm and consistent with your animal, to make sure that you train away those bad habits and introduce happy and healthy ones.


It may take a while to learn to go outside. Don't get a dog if you're not ready to clean up business five times a day, every day, for a couple of weeks.
Puppy pads are also a good choice for nighttime and hours that you are out of the house. Try not to make a habit of using newspaper and puppy pads as a long-term solution, however. It's important to train the dog as quickly as possible.

Look for lumps on the skin.,
Watch for unexplained weight loss.,
Notice any respiratory difficulties.,
Check for abnormalities.,
Check your dog’s skin once a week.",How to Diagnose Canine Cancer1," The most important thing you can do is to be alert for changes in your dog. This includes paying attention to lumps, like watching for the growth of a new lump on the skin, the enlargement of an existing lump, and a change from a lump not bothering the dog to becoming angry-looking or itchy., Another common symptom of canine cancer is weight loss. If your dog suddenly loses weight without a reason, like diet or increased activity, it could indicate cancer. Sudden decrease of appetite or lack of eating may also be a symptom.Weight loss is a common symptom for many canine diseases. You should take your dog immediately to the vet if he has lost weight so your vet can find out what is wrong.

, Respiratory difficulties, like problems breathing or coughing, may point to cancer. Cancer can metastasize in the lungs, which causes respiratory distress.Be aware respiratory problems may be caused by other conditions.

, Cancer symptoms also include changes in bowel habits, signs of pain, depression and lethargy, wounds that won’t heal, and abnormal odors. While these symptoms may not mean cancer, they need to be checked out by your vet just in case.Any sustained change, such as weight loss, lack of appetite, decreased energy, or increased thirst, are indications your dog is unwell. There are many possible reasons why, one of which is cancer. The important thing is to get the dog checked by a vet so that the cause can be localized and a diagnosis reached.

, It is a good idea to check your dog's skin once a week as part of your regular grooming. Make a note of any lumps and bumps. If you can, photograph the lumps and bumps, measure them, and make a note of the size.Any skin lump should be checked by your vet. Those that are worthy of urgent attention include red or inflamed lumps, itchy or painful lumps, those which seem deeply embedded and attached to the tissue beneath, darkly pigments lumps, or those which are growing, especially if they are growing quickly.

Look for the first signs of illness.,
Be concerned if your dog is vomiting and has diarrhea.,
Inspect your dog's stool for blood.,
Be especially alert for the signs of illness in puppies.,
Assume it is a different illness if your dog is up to date on vaccinations.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian at the first sign of parvovirus.,
Discuss with your vet whether a specific diagnosis is necessary.,
Follow your veterinarian's instructions for treatment.,
Get your dog vaccinated.,
Keep puppies and unvaccinated dogs isolated.,
Disinfect and dispose of contaminated items.,
Disinfect areas where dogs go to the bathroom.,
Be aware of the severity of the virus.",How to Diagnose Parvovirus in Dogs," These first signs are vague and non-specific, and include restlessness, fever, lack of energy, and loss of appetite. Sickness and diarrhea usually develop within 24- 48 hours of this.


The incubation period for parvo is 5 - 7 days, but can be as little as 2 days or as many as 20 days.;
, The sickness and diarrhea are severe. People who have experienced a dog with parvovirus remark that the diarrhea has a distinctive smell, not present with other diarrhea. The animals are unable to keep oral fluids down and rapidly become dehydrated due to the severe nature of the vomiting and diarrhea.


The dog will then become toxic and go into shock, meaning it may collapse and lose consciousness., This may be very obvious if your dog is having uncontrolled diarrhea, as is common with parvo. Any dog that starts to pass blood should see a vet without delay. This is especially true for unvaccinated dogs. Call your veterinary clinic immediately and make an appointment for that day.


However, keep the dog isolated because they could pose an infection risk to other dogs. When making the appointment explain to the receptionist the nature of your concern so that the clinic can isolate the dog appropriately.

, Dogs that are too young to have gotten the Parvo vaccine yet are clearly at risk for the disease. Parvo can be devastating to the developing systems of puppies and can kill them easily.


If they are nursed through the acute gastrointestinal phase (sickness and diarrhea) and survive, they may still have life-altering damage to the heart muscle., A dog older than 16 weeks that has received a full initial vaccine course and regular boosters as an adult, should be protected against parvovirus. Thus, it is unlikely (but not impossible) for this dog to get parvo.


However, an unvaccinated dog or a puppy under 16 weeks old is at high risk should they come into contact with parvo.This does not mean that you shouldn't take your dog to the vet right away! A dog that is vomiting and having bloody diarrhea should be seen by a veterinarian immediately.

, It is very, very important to start treatment for parvovirus as quickly as possible. Quick treatment can save your dog's life, while delayed treatment puts it in danger.


In many cases with puppies, parvo can not be caught early enough to save the puppy's life. This is one of the most devastating aspects of the disease, its mortality rate in puppies., The treatment given remains the same regardless of whether it is severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (another illness with symptoms of vomiting and bloody diarrhea) or parvovirus. Therefore, it is not usually essential to reach a specific diagnosis. However, where finances allow, there are tests which can confirm the nature of the problem.


It is most useful if the vet runs a full blood count, which gives an overview of the organ function, dehydration, white cell count, and anemia. Parvovirus attacks the bone marrow, and a low white cell count in the face of signs of infection, is a strong pointer towards parvovirus in dogs with the corresponding symptoms.Next, there are various lab tests that can be run on feces. Your vet can run a test in the clinic called an ELISA test.These work on a similar principle to a pregnancy test and change color in the presence of parvovirus proteins. The test takes around 15 minutes to run, but can occasionally produce a false positive or negative result.
Further testing can confirm the veracity of the ELISA test. This test needs to be sent to an outside lab and so there is a delay. The lab can either look for the virus itself under an electron microscope, or run a PCR test, which identifies small pieces of parvovirus DNA in the feces., Treatment involves aggressive intravenous fluid therapy to correct dehydration, drugs to control nausea, and antibiotics if the dogs has a secondary infection. With quick treatment, parvo does not have to be a death sentence. Without treatment, however, parvo has a 91% death rate.Some clinicians have had success using interferon therapy, but this involves high doses of a costly drug and so the cost can be prohibitive.

, Vaccination is highly effective in dogs with a good immune system. Get your dog vaccinated as soon as it is old enough. This is the best and most effective way of keeping your dog safe and stopping the spread of the disease.


Puppies cannot be vaccinated when they are very young. A puppy has maternally derived antibodies (MDA) present in the bloodstream. These interfere with the pup's body registering the vaccine, as the MDA can attack the vaccine.This is why the last vaccine needs to be given around 16 weeks of age, because by this time the MDA has gone from the pup's body.

, When a puppy is too young to be vaccinated you should keep it away from other dogs. While it is good to get a young dog socialized to many different animals and experiences, the risk of a life-threatening parvo virus should delay this socialization.


You should also keep an infected dog isolated. This will help to limit the spread of the infection. Also tell your neighbors that your dog has parvo so that they can take proper precautions to keep their dogs safe., If you have had a parvo breakout in your home, do not risk infecting future dogs in the home. Bleach kills the virus, so all items that can be thoroughly cleaned with bleach should be. Items that cannot be cleaned with bleach should be disposed of.


If you have had a dog with parvo you should not bring a puppy into your home for at least six months after the virus is treated. This is even after you disinfect your home with bleach and replace items that cannot be properly disinfected. The risk to a puppy is too high to risk exposing it to this deadly virus.

, Since parvo can live in the environment for long periods of time, it is a good idea to keep dog areas as tidy as possible to limit the risk of parvo being present. If you know a dog with parvo has gone to the bathroom in a specific area, that area should be disinfected. Use a solution of bleach and water to accomplish this, with a ratio of 1 part bleach to 15 parts water. Pour this on outside areas that may be infected with parvo.This is not to say that you can eliminate it for sure, but you can reduce the chances of it surviving in your yard or dog area. Even after you disinfect an area, you should not bring uninfected dogs into the area for six months.Parvovirus is extremely hardy and it is not deactivated by high temperatures. It can survive at up to 60C for 60 minutes, meaning it can even survive steam cleaning. It is also resistant to desiccation (drying out). The only thing that will kill it is bleach, so all laundering and cleaning needs to include bleach.

, Parvovirus does a lot of harm in the body because it requires dividing cells to grow. It tends to colonize the gut wall, because the cells there divide rapidly.This rapid attack of cells leads to a quickly debilitating illness.


This is also why the heart is at risk in puppies, because the cells of the heart are dividing rapidly in young dogs and so they are ripe for viral colonization.
Infected feces can pose a risk to unvaccinated dogs for weeks or months, or even years, to come.This combined with the severity of the virus' effects is why parvovirus outbreaks are so serious and devastating.

Be aware of the signs of infection.,
Be on the look out for problems with clotting and bleeding.,
Don't ignore jaundice in your dog.,
Pay attention to excessive thirst.,
Look for additional symptoms.,
Be especially cautious when symptoms occur in young dogs or in dogs with poor immune systems.,
Take your dog to the vet if it shows signs of ICH.,
Understand the disease.,
Tell your vet about the progression of the illness.,
Ask your vet if an exact diagnosis is necessary.,
Ask for a general screening blood test.,
Discuss whether further testing is a good idea.",How to Diagnose Canine Infectious Hepatitis," The first sign is a fever of 104F (40C) or over, which lasts for 1 - 6 days. The dog may also have sticky eyes, which is a very similar presentation to distemper.Dogs with ICH usually become very ill very quickly and are extremely lethargic and lacking in energy, off their food, develop sickness and diarrhea, and then a raft of other symptoms. This varies slightly from distemper, where the symptoms tend to come on less quickly.


The incubation period from being in contact with the virus to becoming sick is 4 - 9 days.The signs of ICH are quite general and there is an overlap between them and other diseases that cause fever or clotting problems. However, any dog showing suspicious signs should be checked out by a vet in order to be given supportive treatment when necessary.
Death is usually from any combination of dehydration, blood loss, and secondary infections, such as pneumonia.;
, ICH stops the liver from producing clotting factors so when the body uses up its reserves, the dog is prone to bleeding. This could be bleeding from the gums around the teeth, or hemorrhage from minor cuts or even after injections.


Some dogs show ""petechiae,"" which are small pinpoint areas of bleeding on the gums and look like red freckles against the pink (or white, if blood loss is severe) of the gums. Dogs with clotting problems can show a number of symptoms, including hematomas (blood blisters) on the skin that form as a result of minor bumps. They may bleed persistently from small scratches or cuts, or even along the gum line. If the dog bleeds internally, their gums are likely to be white or pale and the dog will be very weak.
In same cases there is bleeding within the brain and this causes seizures or poor co-ordination., Infectious canine hepatitis affects the liver and creates other symptoms related to liver damage. These include jaundice, which is a yellow tinge to the whites of the eye, skin, and gums.However, even when the liver is affected, not all cases develop jaundice. This means that a lack of yellow staining does not discount ICH as a possibility.

, ICH can also affect the kidneys. This means the patient is liable to be very thirsty and drink more than normal. This is also exaggerated because of fluid lost in diarrhea or sickness, which the dog needs to replace by drinking., For example, some dogs also develop ""corneal bluing"" This is where the surface of the eye takes on a blue haze. This usually resolves in dogs that have recovered from active CAV-1 infection but in some cases is permanent and leads to loss of vision in that eye.The virus is also likely to multiply in the tonsils. This means that infected dogs often have swollen glands in their throat and develop a runny nose and sticky eyes., Dogs under 12 months of age are at risk because their immune systems are not as strong at fighting off infection. Dogs with other infections are at higher risk because their immune system is already weakened. The average mortality rate in young dogs is around 10 - 30%., If you any of the signs of the disease are present, contact your vet immediately. Because this disease can be so dangerous, it is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to veterinary care.

, ICH is caused by a virus from the Adenovirus family, called CAV-1. This is closely related to, but different from, infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough). CAV-1 is a virus which can survive for weeks or months in the environment but is destroyed by steam-cleaning or household bleach.One of the reasons ICH is so widespread is that the virus is present in bodily excretions such as saliva, sneezes, urine or feces. Indeed, a recovered animal can excrete virus particles for up to six months after recovery, which results in considerable contamination especially when wild animals are infected., Some major clues as to a diagnosis of canine infectious hepatitis are the clinical signs and the speed with which the dog became ill. While the symptoms are not diagnostic in themselves, they will give your vet a strong suspicion of a couple of conditions, including ICH and distemper.

, Your veterinarian will examine the dog and make a list of its problems it is having to narrow down the possible causes. However, putting an exact label on the illness is not always an efficient use of financial resources. This is because most of the conditions, such as distemper or parvovirus, that have similar symptoms are also viral infections with no specific treatment or cure.In all cases it is supportive care (intravenous fluids, antibiotics where appropriate against secondary infections), pain relief, and anti-nausea drugs that ar most helpful. The vet does not need a specific diagnosis to know these therapies are the pet's best chance., The vet may want to run tests to rule out other conditions that do have specific treatments, such as lungworm infection or pneumonia. The vet will start with a general screening blood test looking at organ function and the red and white cells.


The vet then looks at the white cells to rule out problems such as leukemia and to see if the body is fighting an infection.
The numbers and sizes of red cells also tell the vet if hemorrhage is present and if the body is making new replacement cells or not., If the dog is anemic the vet may want to run tests checking that the dog doesn't have a disease (such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia) where the body attacks its own red blood cells. This is done by a slide agglutination test and examination of the size and shape of the red blood cells under the microscope.


Additional blood tests can be run that identify either the presence of the virus in the bloodstream, or the antibodies which the dog has produced against CAV-1. However, a positive test can be of limited use because it does not distinguish a successful vaccination from active infection."
"
Take your dog to the vet.,
Get your dog a physical exam.,
Run screening blood tests.,
Decide on further tests.,
Biopsy the lump.,
Know that diagnosing early stage cancer is problematic.",How to Diagnose Canine Cancer2," If you believe something may be wrong with your dog, take him to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam in order to draw up a short list of problems which could account for the symptoms.This list is used to decide on the most useful and appropriate tests that will help the clinician reach a diagnosis.

, The vet will try to localise which bodily system is involved. The vet will use a physical exam to look for areas of tenderness or pain, and areas which feel abnormal, especially if the main symptom is poor appetite and weight loss.

, If your vet suspects cancer, she will probably run screening blood tests. This is to check the numbers of red and white blood cells. This blood test also checks out organ function, which can highlight if the liver, kidneys, gut, or pancreas are healthy or not.Veterinarians in the US are now able to offer the VDI-TKcanine+ blood test. This new test looks for a blood biomarker that indicates abnormally rapid cell division. When cells reproduce in an abnormal way, they release a chemical called thymidine kinase, and it is this chemical which the blood test detects.As with any test, it is not foolproof. If the results point to cancer, it does not pinpoint which part of the body is affected. Further tests are still necessary in order to find out where and what type of cancer.

, Your vet may want to do further tests after seeing these results. Often imaging is the next step. The vet will choose which imagining test to use based on the equipment availability, operator expertise, and the client's financial budget.


Radiographs are a popular starting point since they can highlight soft tissue enlargements in the abdomen or chest and give excellent information about bones.
Ultrasounds are another commonly used tool. They give clues as to the size of organs, if abnormalities are present in the tissue structure, plus allow growths to be visualized., Biopsying the lump is a crucial tool for diagnosing cancer. The vet may use a needle to aspirate the lump.If the lump is large or in a hard-to-reach place, then a small sample may be harvested in order to get an answer as to what the tissue is. This then allows the surgeon to plan his surgery to obtain the best possible outcome for the patient.If the lump is small or in an accessible place like the skin, an excisional biopsy may be performed. This removes the whole of the lump, and then the whole lump is sent to find out exactly what it is.

, Diagnosing cancer, especially in the early stages, is problematic for a number of reasons. There is no one single test that guarantees to determine if your pet has cancer. Each type of cancer has its own type of test.In addition, the symptoms for cancer tend to be general rather than specific. Thus it's not possible to take one sign, for example a cough, and say conclusively that the dog has cancer.For example, if a dog has lung cancer, the symptoms will be those of shortness of breath and a cough. These signs are similar to the majority of other problems which affect the lungs, ranging from a mild respiratory infection to parasitic disease or heart failure.

Inspect for abnormal growth.,
Look for inflammation or irritated skin.,
Watch for discharge from the mammary gland.,
Make an appointment with your vet.,
Run appropriate diagnostics.,
Consult a specialist, if needed.,
Realize that being intact increases the chance of mammary gland disease.,
Know about the different types of mammary gland diseases.,
Understand that mammary gland disease is not always fatal.",How to Diagnose Mammary Disease in Intact Female Dogs," One of the surest signs of mammary gland disease is the growth of abnormal masses underneath the skin. Growths like these are almost always causes of concern and are indicative of some sort of mammary disease.


The majority of abnormal growths on or around the mammary gland are tumors.
Tumors may appear as one or may appear in clusters.
Tumors may be red or purple in color.
Non-tumor growths may be infection related.;
, One sign of mammary gland disease is inflammation around the stomach or chest surrounding the mammary tissue. Ultimately, inflamed or irritated skin is the most obvious indication of mammary problems.


Redness around the mammary tissue may be an indication of disease.
Sensitive skin around the mammary tissue is another common symptom of mammary disease.
Red lines or streaks emanating outward from mammary tissue., A discharge other than milk from the mammary glands is indicative of infection. Dogs who have recently given birth or are nursing puppies are at a higher risk of developing infections of the mammary tissue. If you identify discharge, remember that:


Discharge is associated with firm or swollen mammary glands.
Discharge will be pus-like and may erupt irregularly.
Since discharge is often associated with nursing puppies, and may lead to neglect of puppies or inability to breastfeed., Your vet will examine your dog physically and conduct basic diagnostics to get an idea of what is affecting your dog. The first appointment will give you a lot of information that will help you and your vet arrive at a proper diagnosis of mammary gland disease, if that is what is affecting your dog.


The vet will question you about symptoms you observed at home such as irritated skin, growths around the mammary tissue, or other problems.
They will conduct a complete physical examination of your dog, paying attention to the chest and stomach.
Your vet may complete blood work or a urinalysis to gather basic information about the health of the dog.

, Either the vet or the specialist will conduct diagnostics to get a better idea of the nature of the disease. Diagnostics may be invasive or non-invasive, but are necessary to properly diagnose mammary gland disease.


Your vet may suggest an X-ray or ultrasound.
They may decide to perform a biopsy.
If the dog is post pregnancy, the vet or specialist may collect breast milk for a culture to determine if there is a bacterial infection., Depending on the nature and severity of the mammary gland disease, you may need to consult a specialist. A specialist may have more education and experience dealing with mammary gland disease in intact female dogs. However, only do this after getting a thorough workup by your regular veterinarian. Although a workup by your veterinarian will include taking samples from suspicious lumps or removing the lumps surgically, checking draining lymph nodes, taking fine needle aspirate samples of cells to check for spread of cancer, and doing an xray of your dog’s chest.


If your vet feels that they have enough experience dealing with the problem, they may not refer you to a specialist.
If your dog has a tumor or some sort of cancer, you may need to see a surgeon who will remove it.
Most major metropolitan areas will have a specialist who have substantial experience treating mammary disease.
Your doctor may refer you to the vet school of a major university. These schools are great resources as vets there are on the cutting edge of their field., Use of the mammary glands in addition to the hormones released during pregnancy and repeated estrous cycles and the release of hormones involved, drastically increase the chance of mammary gland disease. Thus, veterinarians recommend spaying dogs who are not considered valuable breeding stock.


The younger a dog is spayed, the less likely the chance of mammary gland disease or tumors.

, There are a variety of diseases that impact the mammary gland. It is important to know some of the most common ones. They include:


Mammary gland tumors. About 50% of all tumors in female dogs are mammary tumors.
Galactostasis. This is the accumulation of milk in the mammary gland that creates inflammation. This may affect your dog after pregnancy.
Galactorrhea. This is like galactostasis, but is associated with pseudo pregnancy.
Infection of the mammary gland or mastitis. This often occurs during breast feeding as the dog’s mammary glands become infected., If treated promptly and correctly, your dog has a high chance of surviving mammary gland disease. If you do not catch mammary gland disease at the right time, your dog’s health may be in jeopardy.


Mammary tumors are perhaps the most serious type of mammary cancer. If caught early enough, these tumors can be removed and the dog can make a full recover.
Galactostasis can be treated with anti-inflammatory medicines and should not impact the lifespan of the dog.
Infections can be treated with antibiotics and most dogs will make a full recovery.
Problems associated with pseudo pregnancy will often fix themselves within a couple of weeks."

Learn when dogs start showing symptoms.,
Monitor for tremors.,
Watch for coordination problems.,
Look for seizures.",How to Diagnose Little White Shaker Syndrome in Maltese1," Dogs typically start to show signs of Shaker Syndrome from nine months to four years of age. Many cases occur in dogs that are less that two years old.Most dogs affected are medium-sized, roughly 30 pounds or less.;
, The first sign of Shaker Syndrome is muscular tremors. These tremors affect the legs and head. The shaking looks like a shiver and at first may be mistaken for the dog shaking with cold or because of anxiety.The tremors are repetitive, rhythmic, and sometimes look like they’re oscillating.The tremors usually stop when the dog is asleep or relaxed.Sometimes the dog may have rapid or erratic eye movement., Another sign of Shaker Syndrome is a lack of coordination. When the dog tries to walk, she may seem uncoordinated and unsteady on her paws. She may sway or fail to walk in a straight line.The dog may sometimes have a head tilt and hold her head to one side.
The limbs may show weakness, or the limbs may not land where they are intended to go., In extreme cases, the dog may have seizures. These severe tremors may incapacitate the dog.The signs of shaking may be made worse by exercise, excitement, or apprehension.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Rule out other possible conditions.,
Perform tests.",How to Diagnose Little White Shaker Syndrome in Maltese2," If you suspect your dog may have Shaker Syndrome, take her to the vet immediately. While there is no cure for the disease, your vet can prescribe treatment that will help alleviate the symptoms.You may want to videotape one of your dog’s tremor episodes if they come and go. This may help the vet in his diagnosis.Often the signs worsen over the first three days and then remain until treatment occurs. This is why it’s important to take your dog to the vet to be evaluated.

, Unfortunately, there is no specific blood test or method of imaging which can reach a definitive diagnosis of Shaker Syndrome, so the diagnosis is one of exclusion.That means the vet will attempt to rule out all other possible causes of disease which produce similar symptoms.The vet will take a thorough history to rule out any possibility of poisoning, which may cause similar signs.

, To rule out the other conditions, the vet will test for them. A strong suspicion of Shaker syndrome will result if all the tests come back normal or negative.


The vet may run blood tests to check electrolyte levels and make sure the dog does not have low blood sugar levels since this can produce similar symptoms.
They vet may also schedule an MRI scan of the brain to rule out a brain tumor. The vet will also make sure any seizures are not due to another cause.

Learn what Little White Shaker Syndrome is.,
Know which breeds are at risk.,
Understand how to treat the condition.",How to Diagnose Little White Shaker Syndrome in Maltese3," For a long time, researchers have been uncertain as to what causes Shaker Syndrome. The latest research suggests the condition is caused by the body's immune system attacking the cells that produce a neurotransmitter in the brain called tyrosine. Without enough tyrosine, the body cannot properly coordinate its movements, hence the symptoms of tremors, swaying, and poor co-ordination.An alternative name for the condition is idiopathic cerebellitis.Idiopathic means there is no identifiable cause, and cerebellitis refers to inflammation in the cerebellum, part of the brain to do with movement.
Many vets now prefer to call the condition generalized tremor syndrome., Though one of the popular names for the condition is Little White Shaker Syndrome, the disease doesn’t just affect small white dogs. The Maltese terrier and West Highland white terrier are two of the breeds most commonly affected, but despite the fact that both of these breeds are white, the problem does not have a direct link to coat color.


Other breeds affected include the beagle, poodle, Yorkshire terrier, miniature pinscher, and other small breeds., There is no confirmed treatment for Shaking Syndrome. High doses of corticosteroids can alleviate the symptoms, possibly because they suppress the immune system which stops it from attacking the tyrosine-producing cells.The dosage of steroids is tapered until it is discontinued.
If the dog has seizures then intravenous diazepam can decrease the severity of the episode.
Your dog may have to remain on the medicine for the rest of her life if symptoms continuously reappear.

Locate your dog's anal sacs.,
Watch for symptoms of anal sac problems.,
Watch for perianal pain.,
Consider whether your dog has anal sac cancer.,
Get your dog examined.,
Look for signs of impaction.,
Determine if your dog has an anal sac infection.,
Get your dog tested for anal sac cancer.,
Give your dog some relief.",How to Diagnose Canine Anal Sac Problems," Look for two sacs on either side of your dog's anus, at the ""twenty past eight"" position on a clock face. The sacs should each be the size of a small grape and sit just underneath the skin.


Your dog's anal sacs drain out onto his feces through small ducts. When your dog needs to toilet, the squeezing action forces a few drops of the smelly secretion out of the sacs and onto each bowel movement.;
, You'll probably notice that your dog is uncomfortable, especially when he needs to defecate. Common signs that your dog is impacted or has an infection include:


Irritation around the anus: Your dog may stop and suddenly look at his rear end, or sit down and start licking his bottom.
Pain during defecation: Your dog may yelp or try to stop while he defecates if he feels pain. The anal sacs become hot and tender during an infection.Change in behavior: With an infection, your dog might become grumpy if you try to look near his rear end or he might refuse to eat. Your dog is in pain and fears you will touch the tender area.
Stickiness around the anus: If the anal sac ruptures, you'll see foul-smelling blood-stained pus that might be yellow-green. Once this bursts, your dog will probably start feeling more comfortable since pressure is released, although your dog will still need antibiotics from the vet.

, If you notice your dog dragging his rear end along the ground (scooting), he may be trying to relieve irritation. This may mean that your dog has perianal irritation instead of anal sac problems.Dragging his bottom or scooting might also mean your dog is suffering from allergies, parasitic infection or migrating tapeworm egg packets.

, Your dog may be suffering from advanced untreated anal sac cancer if you notice hard swelling near the anus. This hard swelling can push against the side of the rectum, making it difficult for your dog to defecate. Your dog may strain, and spend a lot of time emptying his bowel. If your dog has anal sac cancer, he may lose weight (because of secondary tumors in the liver) or cough (because of secondary tumors in his lungs).Swelling and difficulty defecating can also be caused by constipation or prostrate problems. It's best to get your dog thoroughly examined by the veterinarian if you suspect cancer.

, If you think your dog has anal sac problems, the veterinarian will need to examine your dog's rectum. The vet will check for signs of pain or swelling by gently applying pressure. This will empty the sacs and the vet can check the secretion for symptoms like abnormal yellow-green or smelly discharge.


If your dog is experiencing the early stage of infection, it might be difficult to make a diagnosis. The vet may have to send a sample of the secretion away for bacterial testing., Once you've determined your dog has an anal sac problem, check for impaction which is the most common problem. Impaction happens when the anal sacs make more secretion than they drain away. This also increases the pressure in the anal sac.Check the dog's secretion for small pieces of a waxy substance. This waxy secretion can block the anal gland duct, causing pressure to build up. This stretches the anal sac which is uncomfortable for your dog.


Impaction can happen when your dog is secreting normally, but for some reason it's not secreted out onto the feces (which might happen when your dog has diarrhea)., You'll probably notice that your dog becomes sensitive about having his rear end touched or looked at. When you do look, you may notice foul discharge. If the infection gets worse or is left untreated, a painful abscess (collection of pus) will form in the sac. Pressure buildup may cause the abscess to burst through the skin. If this happens, you'll see blood-stained pus around your dog's bottom and raw skin where the skin has split or ruptured. Get veterinary care if this happens.


Infections are commonly caused by bacteria that travel through ducts connecting the rectum to the anal sacs.

, The early stages of cancer are often symptom free, but your vet might notice an unusual anal sac during a routine check up. A cancerous sac might be larger or harder than a healthy, softly swollen sac. If cancer is suspected, the vet will sedate or anesthetize your dog before taking a gloved finger to gently examine the inside of the rectum. This lets the vet compare the size and consistency of the sacs.


X-rays and ultrasounds are used to check the chest and abdomen for secondary spread of cancer.The vet will remove the suspicious anal sac and send it away for testing to confirm if your dog has cancer., While you're waiting for a veterinary appointment, you can comfort your dog by applying a warm salt water poultice to the area. Only do this if the skin has not broken. Since the area is sore, don't be surprised if your dog tries to bite or is distressed when you try to apply the poultice. If he is distressed, stop and wait for the appointment.


To stop your dog from licking this sensitive area, cover his bottom with a pair of boxer shorts or put a buster collar on him.

Medically correct dysplasia.",How to Diagnose Bone Diseases in Growing Dogs," Limping is one of the most recognizable signs that your dog is experiencing pain. You might notice that your dog is favoring one leg rather than distributing their weight evenly, or they may hold up a paw to avoid putting weight on it.Limping can either come about suddenly or develop over a period of time. The sooner you recognize that your dog is limping, the faster they can receive treatment.
You may notice that your dog's limbs seem swollen at the joints, or that their legs are bowing. This can indicate that there is a bone deformity or disease present.;
, Growing pains are typically associated with larger breeds since these puppies develop more bone mass in the same period of time as smaller breeds.You may notice that your dog is walking strangely or in a markedly different way than they normally do. Their back and pelvis might drop towards the ground or they may hop instead of taking steps.


Bone diseases will present themselves in different ways in a dog’s gait. The most important thing is to notice that your dog is walking differently, rather than trying to diagnose your dog at this stage., Lameness is a more serious symptom and should be addressed as soon as possible. Dogs that are lame will avoid putting any weight on one leg. They may also have pain, decreased range of motion, lose muscle mass, and demonstrate abnormal postures and gaits.Never exercise your dog if you realize they are lame. Their bodies need time to heal and exercise can aggravate the condition., If you notice that your dog is displaying symptoms of a possible bone disease, take them to the veterinarian. Share your concerns with the vet and let them know what kinds of symptoms your dog has displayed.


If your dog appears to be suffering from other bone issues like bowed legs, swollen joints, or discomfort when they move their legs or try to walk, your best course of action is to take them into your vet so they can complete a physical examination of your dog.

, This will help your vet determine which leg or legs are a source of pain and potential bone disease.


This can also help your veterinarian see how the dog is limping and walking.
Your vet will also want to move your dog’s joints. Your vet will be looking for symmetry between the left and right legs, using the corresponding joint on the opposite leg for comparison to spot swollen joints.

, In the consult room, your vet will stand back and take a look at your dog to get an overall impression of your dog’s muscle development. Dogs and puppies develop and strengthen different muscles as they grow so a physical exam will help your vet locate the problem.


Muscle wastage is usually the result of long term under use of a limb, so a poorly muscled leg indicates a problem that has been developing for weeks or even months.
Your vet will take into account your dog’s age, weight, medical history, and breed into account when they are examining and making a diagnosis.

, At the end of this physical exam, the vet should have a good idea of where the source of pain is for your dog. The majority of bone pain in growing dogs can be attributed to growing pains, not a disease. Your veterinarian will conduct this exam and offer their expert opinion. This diagnosis will either require further testing, or treatment.If your dog’s lameness has been ongoing for longer than two weeks, your vet will suggest imaging tests.
Bone diseases are typically either congenital or hereditary, nutritional, or caused by a traumatic injury. Some bone diseases are curable and manageable while others may be chronic., To take x-rays, your dog might have to be sedated or given a general anesthetic. This will help x-ray technicians put your dog’s limbs in the necessary position to get useful images. Usually two views are taken of each area of interest, for comparison.This test is excellent at detecting bone pathology, however, it does have limitations. Although an x-ray will tell your vet about your dog’s bones, it can't show any damage to cartilage or soft tissue. So if your dog’s problem lies within a joint or the joint lining, an x-ray will give your vet clues, rather than a diagnosis., A CT scan is a more sophisticated form of x-rays, where multiple beams are fired from many different directions to build up a 3D image of an area. CT scans give a very realistic picture of the bones and show very detailed joint linings images. This test also makes it possible to detect cracks in your dog’s cartilage and other problems that may not show up on an x-ray.

, Bone biopsies are not usually conducted on young dogs. The most common reason for conducting a bone biopsy is to differentiate cancer from an infection. This is very rarely necessary to test for in growing dogs., Panosteitis is the medical term for “growing pains.” It causes discomfort in the long bones (thin, shin, upper arm) of large breeds who grow rapidly. This is the most common type of bone injury that your growing dog might experience.


It is not entirely clear what causes Panosteitis but one cause may be an imbalance between the rate of growth of your dog’s bones and excess thickening of the bone. It tends to happen more frequently in larger dog breeds and in males.If your dog has Panosteitis, they many wince or show discomfort when you gently touch the affected bones. On an x-ray, the bone will have a “thumb print” appearance, and the shafts will look like someone has marked it with dirty thumb prints.
Panosteitis is curable. It usually resolves itself as the dog continues to grow. In the mean time, your vet might prescribe pain medication or anti-inflammatory drugs., As your pup grows, their legs get longer. This leg growth comes from areas called growth plates, which are on the ends of longer bones. These growth plates produce new bone cells that are added on to the existing bone, literally making the bone longer. MOD is a bone disease that produces severe lameness, pain, and swelling along the growth plates.We aren't sure what causes HOD.
The vet will diagnose your dog with HOD based on x-rays that show bony inflammation and abnormal bone growth near joints.
HOD can be treated with anti-inflammatory and pain medications. Your vet may also prescribe an antibiotic since many dogs with HOD have fevers and high white blood cell counts., Pups with rickets have obviously deformed legs that are markedly bowed, or splayed out. Rickets can appear in dogs as young as 4 weeks old, since their bones are not strong enough to support their weight at this age. On an x-ray, a dog with rickets will have bones that appear hazy and indistinct. All of the bones in the dog’s skeleton will be affected, not just their joints.Dogs develop rickets because they have Vitamin D deficiencies and can’t absorb the calcium they need to form strong and healthy bones. All breeds can contract rickets, since this is a nutritional issue and not a genetic condition.You can treat rickets in your pet by supplementing their diet with calcium and Vitamin D.

, This condition affects the joint lining of large dog breeds when they are typically between 6-9 months old. As their bones grow very quickly, even a slight mismatch in the rate of growth of cartilage can lead to cracks and small breaks in their bones. These cartilage cracks, flakes, and chips will cause the dog to limp, become lame, and experience a lot of pain.Experts are not sure why osteochondritis dissecans occurs in larger dog breeds, but there may be a genetic cause and some breeds such as Labradors, Retrievers, and Bernese Mountain dogs may be predisposed to this condition.A CT scan is the ideal test for this condition, as these cracks can be missed on an x-ray. A CT scan will give your vet a detailed image of the surface of the joint and show any bone damage.
Osteochondritis dissecans is first treated through corrective surgery. Your veterinarian will then prescribe medicines to help with pain and inflammation while your dog heals. There are some medicines that help to limit cartilage damage and degeneration that can make managing the disease easier., Dysplasia is the abnormal growth of joints as a result of an inherited genetic defect. The hips and elbows are two areas where dysplasia is more common. Dysplasia affects the joints and results in osteoarthritis and joint degeneration over time. Large breed dogs are more susceptible to dysplasia, and most breeders will genetically test for this condition before they breed their dogs.Elbow dysplasia is more difficult to spot because the signs will be difficult to see on an x-ray. Get a CT scan to look for signs of elbow dysplasia, which will appear as a tiny crack in a certain area on the inside of your dog's elbow. It is easier to diagnose hip dysplasia based on x-rays.
Your vet might recommend corrective surgery, anti-inflammatory medication, or osteoarthritis medication."

Weak limbs can make your dog appear to limp or walk differently. Your dog might put their weight on one side, stagger, topple, or walk as if drunk.For example, you might notice that your dog only likes to use the limbs on one side of their body or only likes to use their hind legs.;
, The most obvious signs of a balance problem are often swaying, tipping over, staggering and stumbling. At first, you might think that your dog is just a little clumsy. However, your dog may have a balance problem if they continue to struggle with simple walking or running in an open space.


Your dog might fall suddenly and have trouble getting back up if it has balance problems.

, In addition to the full-body signs of a balance problem, you should also look at your dog's head. Your dog's eyes might move rapidly from side to side, as though watching the ball at a tennis match. Your dog may also tilt their head or shake it if your dog is having trouble balancing.Any changes in your dog's eye movements can indicate a balance problem.

, Keep track of how much food your dog eats at meal times. If it seems like your dog isn't eating as much or has nausea in addition to showing some of the other signs described in this article, then they may have a balance problem. Your dog may also hack or struggle to eat.The balance problem can make your dog feel motion sick which is why they develop nausea.

, As soon as you notice any sign of a balance problem, get your dog examined by the vet. There are many conditions that can cause balance problems in dogs and the vet will need to make a diagnosis before your dog can start treatment. Give detailed information about the signs you've noticed. For example, you might say that your dog always wobbles after it stands up or maybe your dog has stopped eating meals. It may help to write down the signs so you can easily tell the vet your dog's symptoms.


Chances are your dog's condition will respond best when treated early. This is why it's important to get your dog examined quickly.

, Ataxia is a sensory dysfunction that causes balance problems in dogs. The vet will run tests to look for a lesion in your dog's brain, inner ear or spinal cord. These tests may include radiographs, x-rays, MRIs, and tomography scans. The vet may also want to test fluid from your dog's spinal cord and test the blood and urine.Ataxia is further diagnosed as vestibular, proprioceptive or cerebellar. Since there are different types, it's important to get an accurate diagnosis from the vet.

, To diagnose a middle or inner ear infection, the vet will examine deep inside your dog's ears and may take x-rays.Your dog will probably have to be anesthetized since this is a detailed examination that may be uncomfortable for your dog.

, To get this diagnosis, the vet will take a full medical history and watch your dog's movements. The vet will also test your dog's blood and urine. Your dog might need testing like radiographs, MRIs, or tomography scans to look for tumors. In order to diagnose vestibular disease, your dog must:Be an older dog
Experience sudden balance problems
Not have another condition causing the balance problems (like ear infection, trauma, thyroid problems, etc.)
Recover from the balance problems within a few weeks

, Your dog may develop balance problems if their ears have been poisoned by drugs or chemicals. Since there are no specific tests to determine if poisoning caused the balance problems, the vet will take a full medical history and test your dog's hearing to determine any hearing loss. Tell the vet if your dog has been exposed to any of these:Aspirin
Quinine
Loop diuretics (water pills)
Antibiotics
Anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer drugs)
Environmental chemicals (like lead, tin, manganese, mercury, carbon monoxide)
Any drop or cleaner has been put in the dog's ears

, Treatment will depend on the location of the lesions, how severe your dog's balance problems are, and how old the dog is.Some dogs still have balance problems even after the lesions have been treated. Your dog may need help recovering from the balance problems, so make your dog's environment safe so they can't injure themselves. Remove furniture with sharp corners, lay down soft pillows, and block off stairs.

, If your dog is diagnosed with a mild infection, the vet will probably prescribe oral and topical antibiotics. The vet may also give an antibiotic injection. If your dog is diagnosed with a severe ear infection, the vet may have to surgically remove fluid from the ear drum or remove part of the inner ear.If allergies or tumors caused the infection, the vet will create a treatment plan to manage the underlying cause.

, Most dogs with vestibular disease will recover on their own within a few weeks. Since vestibular disease isn't usually caused by anything, the vet will treat the balance problem itself. The vet might recommend giving your dog intravenous fluids or hospitalization, if your dog can't walk or eat on their own. The vet may also prescribe medications.The vet may recommend giving your dog a sedative that will help them relax as they recover. Your dog might also take motion sickness or anti-nausea drugs to help them cope with the balance problems.

, As soon as the vet determines that your dog's ear has been poisoned by something, your dog shouldn't be exposed to the substance anymore. For example, if a medication (like an antibiotic) caused the hearing loss and balance problems, the vet can prescribe a different medication. If the ototoxicity was caused by environmental poisoning (like lead), you'll need to remove all lead from your dog's environment.Note that there are relatively few antibiotics that are toxic to the ear. You and your vet will need to discuss why it is necessary to use that particular antibiotic, should this be the best treatment option.
Unfortunately, hearing loss caused by ototoxicity can't be reversed. The sooner you can identify the toxin causing the problems, the better.

Establish a routine.,
Be gentle and patient.,

Make bath time fun and cozy.,
Consider the haircut.,
Take the time to trim nails.,
Check the eyes, ears, teeth, and skin.",How to Groom a Puppy," You may still hear advice circulating that you shouldn’t groom — and especially bathe — your puppy before it is six months old, but modern professional advice is to start easing into the grooming/bathing process as soon as possible.


By starting the process early, your puppy can be ready for a full grooming session by sixteen weeks of age, about the time when its regimen of puppy shots will be complete.;
, A puppy that is terrified at the prospect of a bath or cowers at the sight of a brush or nail clippers is never going to be a dog that makes grooming easy or fun.


Provide treats and rewards early and often as you prepare your puppy for the grooming process. Reward as you begin a practice session, and during and after each step of the process — holding, handling feet, ears, etc., putting brush to fur, and so on.
Practice holding your puppy still — gently but firmly. Do not respond when it squirms, but immediately release and reward it when it stops resisting. Teach that relaxation is rewarded, resistance is not.
If your puppy learns the simple equation “grooming = treats” early on, it will be a more agreeable participant in the process for life.

, Don’t introduce your puppy to grooming by yanking out knots with a brush then dunking the little guy into a tub. Instead, introduce the elements of each step in the process slowly, gently, and with plenty of encouragement and rewarding.Let your puppy examine and sniff the brush before you use it. Start by gently applying the brush to fur for no more than two minutes, then give a reward. Repeat the process several times a day, slowly increasing the brushing sessions.
Handle and touch sensitive areas, like paws and ears, for several days before attempting to groom them. Allow your pup to become familiar with the sensation of contact in these areas.
Touch nails with the clippers before actually trying to cut them, and try the same with scissors on fur. After about five days of simple contact, you can slowly begin to do actual grooming tasks.

, Introducing consistency to the grooming process allows your puppy to immediately recognize and respond accordingly. Just as a dog that hates baths will immediately respond negatively to any sign that one is imminent, a puppy that has learned to like them will react with excitement.


Play with your puppy for several minutes before any grooming session. This not only introduces the routine, it also helps wear out your little basket full of energy before grooming.Establish a consistent location for grooming — a mat in the bathroom, a table in the kitchen, wherever it may be. A quiet, comfortable location will work best., This is essential advice for puppy care, in general, and is especially true when it comes to grooming. Expect some squirming, yelping, nipping, splashed water, scattered fur, and a few messes on the floor along the way.


If grooming proves to be too much of a challenge for you and your pup, there is no shame in utilizing a professional groomer. The price you pay will be well worth not damaging the developing relationship between you and your new dog.

, No single brush type, brushing technique, or brushing frequency is right for every dog. You can follow some specific advice by breed/fur type/size group, but expect to go through some trial and error.


Long-haired puppies may need to be brushed daily and may require more specific tools like a slicker or pin brush while short-hairs may only need a quick weekly brushing with a simple comb or glove-brush. See How to Groom a Dog for more information of brush selection and brushing technique.
Brush as much as needed, but always brush before giving a bath to remove knots and tangles.Start with major parts of the body — back, sides, etc. — and work your way to more delicate or hard-to-reach areas as you go. Don’t yank out knots — use quick, firm strokes, and place your other hand on the skin or fur to counter the tugging effect.
With puppies especially, remember to offer regular treats and constant praise during a brushing session.Consult How to Brush Mats out of Dog Hair if you have a problem with severe tangles or matting, or see a groomer or your vet.

, Some puppies like getting wet, others despise it. By choosing a quiet, warm location and employing care and patience, you’ll increase your odds of ending up with a clean, happy dog (and less water splashed everywhere).For most puppies, a sink or plastic basin is sufficient for a tub. Use only a few inches of water.
Wet the fur thoroughly and use a shampoo specifically formulated for your dog's hair/fur type. Follow the instructions for application and rinsing.
Do not, however, wet or use shampoo on the head or face. Even the gentlest shampoo can irritate a puppy's eyes, ears, and mouth. Lather up the rest of the body, including areas like armpits and the groin area, gently but thoroughly. Rinse until the water runs clear. Use a damp cloth without shampoo to clean the head and face, if needed.Keep your puppy warm until it is completely dry, which can take up to 45 minutes, even with a good towel-drying.
Advice varies widely on how often to bathe your dog — some say only a couple times per year,others say weekly,still others say simply whenever the dog is dirty. Modern shampoos have largely erased old fears of drying out the skin or hair, but feel free to consult your veterinarian or a groomer for advice on bathing frequency.
Never use human shampoo, as it is too harsh for canine skin. Always use a mild dog shampoo. If in doubt, use a doggy oatmeal shampoo, which has mild moisturizing properties.
See also How to Wash a Dog for more tips.

, For safety or just stylistic reasons, some people may feel better not attempting to cut their puppy’s hair. If so, employing a professional is a smart option.


Though more expensive, dog clippers are usually safer and easier to handle for a novice than scissors. See How to Groom a Dog for advice on tools and techniques.
Many puppies will respond well (and look fine) with a single-length “puppy cut"". Consult general instructions for haircuts according to your dog’s breed and/or fur type.
The best time for a haircut is after a bath, when the fur is about 75% dry. Be careful, obviously, but also remain calm and encouraging, and offer treats as you go., Along with a haircut, trimming your dog’s nails may be the most worrisome aspect of the grooming process, because of your fear of causing injury. Regular nail-trimming, however, is important in preventing infections (via broken nails), toe malformation (due to overly-long nails), or unwanted scratches.



How to Clip Dog Nails discusses nail clipper selection — either scissors-style or guillotine/cigar clipper style — and the use of styptic powder if you accidentally cut the ""quick"" within the nail and cause bleeding.
Start slowly with a puppy, perhaps only trimming one or two nails per session, with regular treats and encouragement.
Leaving nails a bit on the long side and having to trim more often is preferable to cutting them down to a nub and risking a pinch or cut, especially with a puppy. Clip off only a small amount at a time. Cutting into the quick and causing bleeding is not a pleasant experience for the puppy or you.
Again, rely on a professional to do the trimming if you can’t or won’t, because it is important to do for your dog’s health. If your dog has an excessive fear of nail-trimming (or other fears/issues in general), consider bringing in a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB), Board Certified Veterinary Behaviorist (Dip ACVB), or Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT).

, Remember, consistent grooming isn’t just about cleanliness. It can also help detect potential problems before they worsen.


During a grooming session, visually examine and feel the skin for signs of fleas, ticks, or other parasites, and for unusual or unexplained marks or bumps. Consult your vet if concerned by any findings.
It is normal for puppies to have discharge from the eyes. So long as there is not redness, puffiness, or a foul odor to the discharge, gently wipe it away with a damp cloth or cotton ball. Inspect the ears, but do not clean them out without your vet’s advice. Contact your vet if you find signs of redness, puffiness, or unusual discharge in either area.Regular dental care is important in preventing puppy periodontal disease. You can buy doggie toothbrushes and toothpaste, or you can wipe the teeth with gauze or a soft cloth wrapped around your finger. Clean the teeth at least two or three times per week. Employ chew toys and teeth-cleaning treats regularly as well."

Start grooming early.,
Brush your dog daily.,
Trim its hair.,
Clean around its eyes.,
Check for irregularities.",How to Groom a Morkie Dog1," Puppies as young as three weeks old can be introduced to grooming by way of gentle brushing. Starting this daily process early will allow your Morkie to be comfortable and cooperative in the future. Let your puppy sit or stand for brushing, and praise it for staying still. If it fusses or moves, gently but firmly say “no” to assert that it must obey you., Morkies have a coat that is long, soft, and fine, and requires daily brushing to avoid tangles. Brushing also removes dirt, dandruff, and dead hair, and distributes natural oils through your dog’s coat to make it shiny. Once a day, brush your dog very gently with a slicker brush or pin brush. Although Morkies are a non-shedding breed, your pet may lose a bit hair when groomed, so brush it on an easy to clean surface (e.g. the floor, a tabletop, a mat specifically reserved for grooming).Start by brushing in the opposite direction of hair growth, then brush it in the direction of hair growth.

, The hair growing around your Yorkie’s forehead can get into its eyes and cause tears, which can stain its hair. Use a small comb to gently pull this hair away from your Morkie’s face. With small grooming scissors, carefully trim the hair just enough to ensure that it doesn’t irritate your pet’s eyes.If your Morkie has any mats or tangles that brushing cannot remove, gently cut them out with the grooming scissors.

, To clean away tears, prevent the growth of bacteria, and make your dog more comfortable, clean its eyes daily. Wet a soft cloth with warm water and gently run it over your Morkie’s eyes to clean tears away. If tearing occurs during the day, repeat this process., While you are giving your Morkie its daily grooming, check its skin and hair for any possible issues. Such problems could include fleas, ticks, skin irritation, dry patches, and inflammation. Daily inspection can reveal these issues early enough to have them easily treated by a veterinarian."

This is so there isn't any mats when you start to trim the hair, which can cause pain to his skin or disruption in the fur line. Brush the hair on the legs and the beard as well. You should use a pin brush followed by a comb.


You should use a small soft slicker brush and a comb with 1/2 an inch bristles on your dog.
Make sure you brush under the arms, on the belly, and between his toes to ensue all the mats or knots are combed out.
If your has already dog has been trimmed or groomed before, he will not likely have a lot of mats. If he hasn't, this step is extremely necessary to ensure his cut looks as good as possible.;
, Once you make sure that the mats are out of your dog's fur, you need to bathe him. This will help his coat be as clean as possible when you cut his hair. Use a gentle shampoo to bathe him and lukewarm water to rinse out all the soap.


This also gives you time to brush his teeth., Once you are done bathing your dog, you need to dry his fur. This takes a combination of towel drying and blow drying. Towel dry him off as much as possible. Next, using medium heat, take a blow dryer and dry the rest of your dog's fur, combing it as you go.


Brush the leg hair up, starting at the top of the leg and working your way down. Also dry the back fur as well as that on the head. Don't blow the dryer in his face to avoid discomfort.
You can use a grooming table for this and all remaining processes if you want to avoid back strain. If you don't have a grooming table, you can use any tall, flat surface., Schnauzer's are groomed in a very specific way. To obtain the right look, you need a dog hair clipper. Grab a #8 or #10 blade and put it on the clippers. Starting at the base of your dog's skull, gently press the clippers down on the fur, moving the clippers along the length of the back to the tail area. Starting back at the top, do the same on the areas directly around the spine. On his sides, continue to trim with the grain of the fur until you reach his underbelly. To get around his tail, follow the grain of the fur around his rump and down to about an inch or so above the joint in his hind legs in the back, just above his elbow on the side, and just above his shoulder bone in the front.If it is wintertime and you want your dog to have a little more fur, you can use a #7F clipper blade to allow him to keep more of his fur.
You should periodically check the heat on the clipper blade with your wrist. You want to make sure it doesn't get too hot and burn your dog's skin. You should also clean out any fur that gets trapped in the blades as well.
For a better idea of what the pattern of fur clipping should be, you can download a guide from the American Miniature Schnauzer Club or other reputable groomer., There are areas on your Schnauzer that need to be groomed with scissors instead of clippers because they are so sensitive. The fur on and around the tip of the tail should be trimmed with scissors. Cut the length the same as the rest of the fur on his back so it matches. You should also cut the hair on his underbelly about the same length, but he careful not to cut his genital region.You can use clippers on the underbelly, but you have to be extra careful not to hurt his tender underbelly or genital region., The fur around the legs needs to be longer than his other hair. They need to be cut evenly and brushed so they stick out to the side. Make sure you brush them out so you can ensure that they are even all around.


The fur of the legs is all the fur from where you stopped using the clippers on his body to the bottom of his feet. It's also typically a different color., The face area is the most delicate. You have to be extremely careful so you don't hurt or aggravate his eyes or ears. Use the clippers to cut the fur from the base of his skull, where you left off on his back, up until just above his eyebrows. The fur around the neck should also be clipped up until his chin line.To cut the hair over his eyes, brush it straight down. Using scissors, point the scissors down towards his nose and cut the fur in a diagonal line over his eye. Do the same to the other eye.
To trim the beard, you need to brush it out and trim some off the bottom. His whole face should look long and rectangular., The fur on the outside your Schnauzer's ears will grow long, just like his other body fur. Brush the fur on the ears. Using scissors, cut the excessive fur growth that hangs free from the ear. Do not cut the fur that grows on his ears because it keeps his ears warm and looking nice.


Be very careful. The ears are sensitive and you can easily hurt them., One of the main differences between Schnauzers and other dogs is that they grow long fur on the inside of their ears. Because of this, you need to periodically pluck the hair from inside his ears. Use a pair of tweezers and grasp the fur. Gently pull the fur, making sure not to hurt him. You can leave a little bit of each piece of fur behind, so there is something to protect his ears but not enough to prevent air from getting inside to dry them out. Just pluck off the top portion of the fur where it has gotten too long.


You can also use scissors to do this, but be really careful. If cut, the ear can bleed profusely., Since fur grows so readily in his ear, your Schnauzer's ears are perfect for yeast and bacteria growth. To prevent this, you should also clean your dog's ears frequently along with trimming the hair. Use a cotton ball and pour dog ear wash on it. Gently rub the cotton ball on the visible portions of your dog's ear. Then, gently use a soft cloth to dry the ears so moisture doesn't build up in the canal.


You can buy dog ear wash at your local pet store.
Never use a q-tip to clean your dog's ears. It can damage his ear canal and lead to injury., Inspect your dog's paws. Ruffle out any excessively long fur along your dog's paws. Using scissors, you need to trim all of this hair along the nails. You also need to trim back the hair that comes out from between the pads of his paw.


Make sure you are careful not to cut too close to the skin. You don't want to accidentally cut his paw.
Repeat on every paw., Once you have trimmed the hair, you need to make sure the nails are cut to a comfortable length. You should use either guillotine dog nail clippers or a dog nail grinder. Gently cut or grind back the nail a little at a time. Once you see a dark area in the middle of the nails, you need to stop. Going below this will cut into the nail quick.


The quick of your dog's nail is the living portion of the nail that contain blood vessels and nerves. Cutting the nails too far will cause them to bleed and will hurt immensely. It may also cause infection if not taken care of properly.
Once you cut each of his nails, use a file to smooth out any jagged edges.
Make sure you use dog clippers. Human clippers are not nearly strong enough to cut dog nails., Once the nails are cut and filed, you should rub some vaseline or paw moisturizer to help hydrate his paws. This also gives his paws a break after the stressful process of having his nails clipped. Repeat this on every paw.


This is also a good way of leaving your dog with a good impression of the whole experience. This way, he will start to look forward to the activity and not stress too much about the clippers or grinder while you are working on his nails."

Put your dog on an anti-inflammatory medication.",How to Diagnose Canine Allergies," There are a range of possible symptoms that could result from an allergy. However, none of these signs are ""specific,"" which means none of them are enough in their own right to make a diagnosis. For example, for a dog with diarrhea this could be the result of a dietary allergy, an infection, parasites, garbage gut, lymphoma, or any one of a number of other causes. However, common symptoms of an allergy include:


Itchiness: This symptom becomes evident if your dog is scratching or chewing, pulling fur out, rubbing its face or bottom along the ground, or excessively licking itself.
Poor skin and coat: Your dog may have patchy hair loss, red inflamed skin, or spots and rashes.
Ear infections: Repeated ear infections can be a sign of allergies.
Redness: Inflamed skin and rashes can be a symptom of allergies.
Gastrointestinal signs: Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive flatulence, and weight loss can be signs that your dog is allergic to something it is ingesting.;
, Allergies typically develop in young dogs, although it is unusual to see signs in pups younger than six months because they haven't been exposed to an allergen enough times for the immune system to overreact. Typically, once a dog has developed symptoms of an allergic reaction, each time it encounters the allergen his symptoms get worse. This accounts for why dogs with seasonal allergies to pollens often seem to get worse from year to year.

, It is a common misunderstanding that a pet newly exposed to an allergen for the very first time will have an allergic reaction. In truth, an allergic reaction occurs after the dog has been repeatedly exposed to the allergen, which primes up the immune system for overreaction. Thus, for a dog allergic to food it's not the first time they eat the item that their allergies flare up, but it's after repeated exposure.
It is, however, true that allergic reactions get worse with time and repeated exposure.

, Allergens can trigger allergic reactions by entering the body in different ways. Perhaps the easiest allergy to understand is a contact allergy. This is where the dog lies on a substance to which they are sensitive, and the direct contact of the allergen against the skin triggers the reaction. Typically, the allergy is localized, meaning that the inflammation flares up in the spot where the skin contacted the allergen.


Food allergies are fairly self-explanatory in that there is a food which the dog eats and then reacts to. However, the dog's body can react in different ways. Some dogs develop inflammation and irritation of the gut lining, which causes gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting or diarrhea, or the allergy may show itself as inflamed skin and itchiness.
A common allergy is to air-borne allergens, such as tree, grass, or flower pollen. These contact the skin directly or are inhaled to set up an inflammatory reaction.Inhaled allergens, such as pollens or mold spores, often cause skin itchiness. Dietary allergens, such as beef or wheat, can also cause itchiness or upset stomachs., Many dogs are allergic to fleas and this is a relatively easy allergy to treat. Just make sure that you are giving your dog a flea medication on a regular basis, as once the fleas are gone, the allergy will be as well.Aside from allergies, it is important to always have your dog treated for fleas and ticks. It is especially important for dogs that spend a lot of time outdoors, in wooded areas.

, Diagnosing allergies is notoriously difficult. Although there are several tests available, each has advantages and disadvantages. Most clinicians take an overall approach, in which they eliminate possible causes, such as parasites, and interpret the test results in the light of the dog's history, symptoms, and response to treatment.The vet first performs a clinical examination looking at the skin, but also feeling the abdomen and listening to the chest. He or she then examines the coat in more detail looking for signs of parasitic infection, such as flea droppings or patchy hair loss, which could indicate mange.
The vet may wish to rule out parasites in the itchy dog, before proceeding to more extensive and expensive tests. This may be simply a case of using an effective insecticidal product in order to kill any parasites present.

, Once the preliminary testing is done, the vet has different options for a more specific diagnosis. These include blood tests, skin tests, skin biopsy, and dietary trials. These can give you a more specific diagnosis but there is no guarantee that they will actually figure out the root of the problem.

, The big advantage of blood tests is their convenience. The clinician draws a sample of blood and sends it to the lab for analysis. However, blood tests are costly and can give unreliable results.


The theory behind blood testing for allergies is that the body produces immunities called IgE when it encounters an allergen. Theoretically, the higher the level of IgE to an individual allergen, the more allergic the dog is. This sounds simple, but these tests are known to come up with false positive results. This means the results cannot always be relied upon to be 100% accurate., You may be familiar with intradermal tests, as they are commonly used on people. The test involves clipping an area of fur, dividing the skin into a grid, and then injecting a small bit of allergen into the skin. The skin then may produce a reaction in response, which is a raised blister like bump.The larger the reaction, the more allergic the dog to that particular allergen.


Intradermal skin tests are considered the gold standard for allergy tests, but even they can be problematic. Some dogs require sedation in order to have the test run, as the repeated pin pricks can be uncomfortable. However, some sedatives can inadvertently interfere with the allergic reaction and suppress the positive to make a false negative.
Also, intradermal skin tests are expensive because the samples of allergens don't keep for long and unless the clinician does a lot of testing, there is a lot of waste. This can mean referral to a skin specialist who does have the caseload to warrant keeping in house test kits.

, The role of skin biopsy in diagnosing allergic disease is limited. The sample under a microscope only suggests general inflammation that occurs with allergy, but cannot make a definitive diagnosis. Skin biopsies can, however, rule out other problems that mimic allergies, such a pemphigus or certain infections., These are reserved for suspected food allergies or to rule out food allergy. While lab tests do exist for food allergy, again the results are largely unreliable and it is best to run a dietary trial.A food trial consists of feeding the dog foods it has never previously encountered, and nothing else, for a period of 8 -12 weeks.


The theory is that this gives allergens time to clear from the system. If the dog's symptoms resolve in this time then it was likely an allergy that was responsible for them.
However, dietary trials take tremendous commitment on the part of the owner, since the dog must eat an extremely restricted diet. Even a single illicit treat fed during the trial period could undo all the good work.If your dog is a scavenger or you live with people who will feed the dog treats behind your back, then a dietary trial can be extremely challenging.

, All in all, allergies can be difficult to pinpoint. This is why broad-acting medications, such as anti-inflammatories, are a popular solution to allergy problems. If your veterinarian is sure your dog has an allergy, he or she may then prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce the itch and inflammation that is causing the dog (and owner) such distress.


The vast majority of allergy problems in dogs are diagnosed up to the point that the clinician is sure an allergy is responsible, however not to the point of labeling exactly what the dog reacts to.

Place your dog in the shower.,
Shampoo the dog.,
Rinse its coat.,
Dry your dog.",How to Groom a Morkie Dog2," Place a small towel or non-slip mat on the bottom of the shower. Gently place your dog on the mat and tell it to stay. Pet and praise it to keep it calm and happy., Use a removable shower head to gently wet your dog’s coat with warm water. Be sure to use a shampoo specially formulated for sensitive skin (available at most pet stores). Gently lather your dog’s hair to avoid matting it.If your shower does not have a removable shower head, consider washing your Morkie in the sink, or using a cup of water instead. A regular shower might overwhelm your small dog.

, Gently rinse out the shampoo from your Morkie’s hair. To prevent irritation of your dog’s sensitive skin, make sure to remove all soap residue from its body. Lift your dog to ensure that all shampoo is rinsed from its paws as well., Using a soft towel, dry your small dog with long, gentle wipes. To avoid knots and mats in its hair, wipe in the direction of hair growth. When hair is damp, blow dry your dog on a very low setting to dry its coat completely. While drying, gently comb your dog’s hair back into shape.

Prepare your Morkie for groomer visits.,
Choose the right groomer.,
Start grooming visits early.,
Begin slowly.",How to Groom a Morkie Dog3," In preparation for an actual visit, try to get your Morkie ready for what it will experience at the groomer’s. Once a day, handle its front and back paws and gently tap its nails with a metal spoon or clippers. Place it on a tall spot (e.g. a kitchen counter) and have it stand there for several moments to get used to being on an elevated surface., To choose the right groomer for your dog, ask friends for recommendations or look online for reviews of local grooming businesses in your area. Call and inquire about whether the groomer has the proper state-required certification (e.g. in some states, groomers must be licensed and certified in flea/tick applications). Ask other questions, such as:”Do you have much experience grooming Morkies?”
”How many years of experience do you have?”
”Did you complete training at a grooming school?”

, Bring your Morkie to see a groomer once a month, or at least every two months, to stay properly groomed. Groomers will give your Morkie a proper bath, trim its hair and nails, clean its ears, and brush its teeth if requested. Puppies should be brought to their first grooming session when they are 10-12 weeks old, or when they have received their second round of vaccines. , Ease your dog into visiting the groomer’s by opting for a limited treatment the first time. Have the groomer do a face trim, feet trim and sanitary cut instead of an entire body haircut. This will get your dog used to the sights, sounds, and overall atmosphere of the grooming salon without having the experience be too lengthy or intense."

If your dog went missing for a few days and then came back limping, then there is a good chance that he was injured.


If your dog has just been hit by a car or if he has other signs of a visible injury (bleeding, bone sticking out, etc.), then you need to take him to a veterinarian right away.;
, Your dog may be trying to stay off of the affected leg or he may be favoring one side over another. If you notice that your dog is limping, then this is a strong indicator that he may have a broken bone.


Your dog may also be avoiding walking at all if it hurts too much. If your dog is laying around more than is usual for him, then this can also indicate that something is wrong.
Keep in mind that dogs may limp due to a broken bone in the leg, hips, or even the ribs., If your dog has a broken bone then he may whimper, yelp, or make other sounds to indicate that he is in pain.You may also notice him voicing his pain when he does normal daily activities, such as going up a step, laying down, sitting, or going to the bathroom.

, Take notice if your dog starts acting in a strange way, such as by hiding or growling when someone approaches him. This change in behavior can be due to his pain and stress levels.


You may need to muzzle your dog to prevent him from biting you or someone else in self-defense. Dogs may bite their owners if they are stressed or in pain., Redness and swelling can also indicate a broken bone.If you notice that an area of your dog’s body is swollen or that the skin appears red and/or feels hot to the touch, then this may indicate that he has an infection. This could be due to a broken bone beneath your dog’s skin.

, If you suspect that your dog has a broken bone, then you will need to take him to see a veterinarian right away. Do not attempt to reset your dog’s broken bone by yourself and do not apply any antiseptics or other medicines to your dog’s broken bone.Try to keep your dog from moving around too much as you transport him to the veterinarian. You may want to place a blanket over him as well to keep him warm and help to prevent him from going into shock.

, Your veterinarian will ask you some questions about your dog’s symptoms and check your dog for physical signs of a broken bone. During the exam, your dog will most likely need to be muzzled to prevent him from trying to bite the veterinarian and veterinary technicians in self-defense., If your dog’s veterinarian suspects that your dog has a broken bone, then x-rays will be necessary. X-rays can help the veterinarian to see if there really is a break, what type of break it is, and where the break is located. Your dog will be sedated for x-rays to help keep him still and reduce his pain.


Fractures are classified as either complete or incomplete. A complete fracture is where the bone is separated in one or more places and an incomplete fracture is where the bone is bent and not fully separated., If your dog has broken a leg, then a cast will be necessary to immobilize the broken bone and ensure that your dog’s limb heals properly. If a fracture is above your dog’s knee or elbow, then pins and metal plates may also be necessary to ensure proper healing., Your veterinarian may prescribe some medications for your dog, such as painkillers and antibiotics. It is important to administer these medications for as long as your dog’s veterinarian says to do so. Do not stop your dog’s medication without asking your dog’s veterinarian first.

, You may need to prevent your dog from moving around after he has been treated for a broken bone. One way to do this is to use a crate. You can use a crate to encourage your dog to rest for up to six weeks.If you have never used a crate with your dog before, then you will need to make sure that you:


Get a crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down in.
Place some comfortable bedding in the crate, such as a couple of folded blankets or a dog bed.
Do not leave your dog in the crate for more than a few hours at a time. You will need to let him out to go to the bathroom and to eat and drink as well.
Never use a crate as punishment. Your dog should want to spend time in his crate, not fear it., Make sure that you ask your veterinarian about how much time your dog will need before he can return to his normal activities. Your dog’s healing time will depend on the severity and type of break as well as your dog’s age.For example, if you have a puppy, then he may fully recover in about one month. If you have an older dog, it can take much longer.

Remove any obstructions.,
Take them outdoors if weather permits.,
Enlist someone's help, if needed.,
Use a bristle brush.,
Brush their coats.,
Brush your dog daily during the spring and fall.,
Don't trim their coats.",How to Groom a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog1," When you’re getting ready to brush your dog, make sure they do not have their collar or any other accessories on.;
, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are a very large breed and can shed a lot during certain periods of the year. Plan to brush them outdoors, or in an indoor area that is easy to sweep, like a tile or hardwood floor.If you do brush them indoors, have a broom or vacuum ready to clean up the hair that will come out.

, They are an easy to groom breed but you may need someone else’s help to hold them still while you’re brushing them.


Since your dog won't have a collar on during brushing, another person can help keep them still. Also, many dogs enjoy being brushed, though it is a good idea for the person helping you to have a few treats handy to reward your Swissy for their good behavior during grooming.

, You can use a soft to medium bristle brush that has short and closely spaced bristles.They do shed a fair amount, even when they are not during the coat blowout periods, so you may need to stop and clean the hair from your brush as your brushing their coat.

, Their fur is very short so it is not prone to mats or tangles.They only need to be brushed once or twice a week. This will help keep shedding under control and removes dead hair. Make sure you brush in the direction that their fur grows. You can begin to brush their heads and move down the rest of their bodies until you reach their tails.


Be sure to brush their entire coat, but be gentle on sensitive areas like their faces and bellies.

, These dogs are bred for cold weather, so they have a dense outer coat and a thick undercoat to keep them warm. They do not shed much throughout the year, except for the twice-yearly times when the undercoat comes out. These periods are typically during the spring and fall. During these times, you will need to brush your dog daily to help the coat come out.You can use a shedding blade, undercoat rake, or rubber comb during these periods rather than your normal brush.During shedding season, try to brush them outside if the weather permits. They will shed a lot of hair so it will be easier to clean up and manage their hair when you are outdoors.

, The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog’s coat is very short, usually 1” to 2”, or about 2.5 cm to 5 cm, in length.They do not need their coat trimmed. They have a double coat that helps to insulate them during hot and cold weather, so do not ever shave your dog.

Choose a bathing location.,
Wash their entire coat.,
Dry off your dog.,
Bathe as needed.",How to Groom a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog2," Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are very large and can reach up to 140 pounds.Bathing them in a bathtub can be a challenge because they take up a lot of space. Weather permitting, you can bathe your Swissy outside with a hose, as long as the hose is hot water equipped.


You can also take them to a pet store that offers grooming. These stores may have bathing stations that you can pay to use. This way, you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your bathroom at home.
Be prepared for your dog to shed a fair amount of hair during a bath. This may clog a drain in a bathtub, so place a wire trap over the drain.

, Purchase a mild dog shampoo that is pH-balanced to use on their coat. After you wet their entire coat with warm water, work the shampoo into their fur. Massage the shampoo into their coats, but be extra gentle around their faces and ears. Rinse all of the shampoo out of their coat whenever you are finished.


Try not to get any water into their ears. Trapped water in the ear is a breeding ground for bacteria can lead to an ear infection.

, After you’ve finished their bath, you’ll need to dry them off. Use a towel to dry their entire coat. You can use a blow dryer on a low setting, to dry them off if you’d like. Drying their coat with a blow dryer will take more time than a towel will, but it can add shine to their coat. Make sure the blow dryer is on the low or no heat setting. Use a soft cloth to dry their ears and their face.

, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are naturally clean and only need to be bathed every month or so, unless they have rolled in mud or something smelly. Baths can also help to keep their shedding more manageable."

Brush their teeth.,
Inspect their teeth and mouth.,
Check their eyes.,
Check their ears.,
Clean their ears weekly.,
Trim their nails.",How to Groom a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog3," Use a toothpaste that is designed for dogs and a soft toothbrush to brush their teeth. You should brush your dog’s teeth two or three times a week to help prevent periodontal diseases, though daily brushing is the best.Make sure you are thorough and brush each tooth.


You should also schedule an annual dental cleaning visit with your veterinarian.

, While you’re brushing their teeth, take a look at their teeth, gums, and mouth. Look for any signs of disease or irritation, like browning teeth, bloody or red gums, irritation or ulcers.Most dogs will develop some dental or oral problems in their lifetime, but early detection can help to slow this process or prevent it altogether.


By incorporating brushing and inspections into your grooming routine, you’ll be able to identify problems early on and take your dog in for veterinary care., Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are predisposed to certain eye diseases and conditions, including cataracts, distichiasis, and entropion. Each of these conditions are treatable, and early detection is very important. As a part of your grooming routine, look at your dog’s eyes for any signs of irritation or infection, like redness, swelling, discharge, or abrasions. If you see any of these, talk to your veterinarian.Cataracts tend to happen during their senior years and will make their eyes look cloudy. Distichiasis is a condition where the dog grows extra eyelashes on the upper or lower eyelids. These extra lashes can cause irritation or corneal abrasions. Entropion occurs when the eyelid rolls inward, and usually happens before the dog is a year old.

, Every week, take a look at your dog’s ears. Look for any redness, irritation or wax buildup. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have long ear canals that can become blocked with wax buildup., Take a pH-balanced ear cleaner and pour the manufacturer recommended amount into their ear canal. Massage the base of the ear so the ear cleaner works into the ear canal for about 20 seconds. After massaging the ear, let your dog shake their head. Then take a soft cotton cloth and wipe the inside of the ear folds and the entrance of the ear canal., If your dog does not wear down their nails naturally, usually by exercising and walking on concrete or pavement, you’ll need to trim them every month.Clip the tip of each of their nails and be sure to avoid hitting the quick. The quick is the vein that runs through the nail and will bleed if it is cut while you trim their nails. Greater Swiss Mountain Dog’s nails grow fairly quickly and are strong so use a guillotine or scissor style nail cutter rather than a regular nail cutter.


Many Swissys have black nails, which make it more difficult to identify the quick. Only clip a very small part of the nail at a time to avoid hitting the quick. Keep some styptic powder and cotton balls handy just incase you hit the quick and need to stop the bleeding.

Part the coat into sections.,
Brush one section at a time with a slicker brush.,
Focus on areas that are easily matted.,
Brush their coat once a week.,
Deal with mats, if present.",How to Groom a Long Fleece Coated Labradoodle1," In order to have access to each part of their coat, you’ll need to put your Labradoodle in a secure area either on the floor or on a grooming table. If they are unable to stay still during the grooming process, enlist the help of another person to hold them still while you’re working. Fleece coats are much easier to take care of than a wool coat, especially when the fleece coat is wavy rather than curled.Remove their collar and any other accessories before you begin.;
, For brushing, you’ll want to work in sections starting at the head and moving down the body. Part the hair at the skin and work on one individual section at a time. It is better to work in small sections at first, especially if you are not accustomed to grooming at home. , Slicker brushes have fine wire bristles that will help to remove mats and tangles from your Labradoodle’s thick fleece coat. As you’re brushing, you want to make sure that you are brushing the hair all the way down to the skin. Many people only brush the surface of the coat and leave mats to form close to the skin.


If you are unable to brush out any small or large mats, you will need to shave the hair right to the skin. A professional groomer may be able to get the mat out without cutting the hair, so it can be worth going in for a consultation.

, While mats can occur anywhere on your dog’s coat, they tend to occur on the chest, neck, armpits, and behind and under the ears. Spend a little extra time brushing these sections with the slicker brush to ensure that no mats have formed., For general maintenance, you’ll need to brush their coats once a week to prevent matting and tangles.

If you see any redness, flakiness, scabbing or unusual skin texture you may need to consult your veterinarian.By brushing frequently, your dog will become accustomed to the process and you’ll be able to identify any skin problems early on.

, Mats occur when the hair close to the skin becomes extremely knotted and tangled. The best way to deal with mats, if they aren't too large or too tightly knotted, is to try to untangle them using your fingers. After you've broken apart some of the larger knots, use a comb to try to untangle the smaller knots. If you're able to, try to hold the fur closest to the skin so there is less pulling, which can be painful for your dog. Large mats may need to be cut out. In more extreme cases of matted fur, your dog's coat may need to be shaved.Regular brushing is the best way to prevent mats from forming.

Put your Labradoodle in a tub with a non-slip mat.,
Use a gentle shampoo and massage it into the fur.,
Rinse out the shampoo.,
Dry them off.",How to Groom a Long Fleece Coated Labradoodle3," Labradoodles have very little odor so they don’t need to be bathed any more than once a month, unless they’ve rolled in something smelly or muddy.

Your goal should be to brush them at least two to three times a week to help prevent periodontal diseases., For larger and medium sized Labradoodles, it’s easiest to use a pair of scissor nail clippers. These look more like scissors and can cut through thicker nails.

For brushes, bristle brushes can be used on all coat types. In general, the longer the coat the more widely spaced and longer the bristles should be. Wire-tipped brushes without rubber ends are also a good choice for dogs with long, coarse, or curly coats. If your dog has a lot of mats or tangles, slicker brushes are a useful tool to remove such problems. After you brush your dog down with a brush, use a comb designed for dogs to ensure that all tangles or mats are gone.Combs are used to get right down to skin and also tease out tangles.

, Brush your dogs back, legs, underbelly, chin, and neck with your slicker brush, targeting tangled or mated fur. Brush any featherings on the dog's legs, tail, thighs, neck, and back.


If you encounter any particularly difficult tangles or mats, put a dime-sized glob of detangler on the mat and working it out with a comb and your fingers.A lot of dead hairs will likely fall off during this process, leaving a pile of dog fur on the floor. Brush your dog on a surface that's easy to sweep or vacuum. If available, use a grooming table.

Dampen a cotton ball and use it to gently swap the dog's ear with ear cleaning solution. Never insert anything, like q-tips, into the dog's ear canal. Stick to the exterior lining.Earwax may rub off on the cotton ball. The wax is usually brown or black. If you notice crusty skin, redness, discharge, bad smells, or swelling this can be a sign of an infection and should be addressed by a veterinarian.Use tweezers to pull out unwanted hair, which can tangle and cause mats to form in the ear canal. However, discuss tweezing with your vet beforehand. Ear hair removal is not necessary for every dog breed., Dogs should be groomed every day, but bathed just once a month. Before beginning the bathing process, get the tub ready for your canine companion. Place a rubber bathmat on the bottom of the tub so your dog can keep his footing, and fill the tub with 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 13 cm) of lukewarm water. Make sure the water is comfortable to the touch as water that is too hot or too cold causes your dog undue distress., If possible, use a sink or bathtub with a spray attachment. This is easier to handle than a faucet or bucket, and more comfortable for your dog.


Spray your dog's back and legs with water until he is damp but not dripping wet.
Spray his underbelly, neck, and chin.
When wetting the head, avoid getting water in your dog's eyes or ears. You can place cotton balls in a dog's ear before a bath to prevent water contamination and cover the dog's eyes with your hand when spraying his head.This process may take awhile with a longhaired dog, so be patient. A good 5 to 10 minutes is necessary to get your dog completely wet.

, Working from head to tail, gently massage the shampoo into your dog's coat until it forms a thick lather.


When washing the head, be especially careful not to get soap in your dog's eyes. Tilt his head up so the soap flows away from his eyes. Lather his scalp and ears.
You can apply a line of shampoo along the dog's back and lather the product into his back, hips, shoulders, and legs.
Use your fingers to comb the shampoo in, as this can help remove unwanted dirt and debris from your dog's fur.Work the suds down and under the dog's tail, his underside, his legs, and paws.
Remember to clean under your dog's neck, in facial wrinkles, and in ear flaps., Use the spray attachment, faucet, or bucket to thoroughly rinse any soap residue from your dog.


When dealing with the head, make sure to tilt your dog's head back again to avoid getting soap in his eyes.

Using a small amount of conditioner in the palm of your hand, smooth the conditioner over the top of the neck to the end of the tail. Cover the outside of the ears, the legs, the chest, feathering and the rest of the body. Different conditioners have different requirements, so follow the instructions on the bottle to see how long to leave it in before rinsing. Some conditioners are leave-in, so you do not need to rinse them out.

, Dry your dog with a large towel until he is damp.


Allow your dog to shake. With longhaired breeds, this lifts and separates the fur and makes the drying process faster.
If needed, squeeze excess water from your dog's fur using your hands.
If you placed cotton balls in your dog's ears during the bathing process, remove them now.

Make these decisions before beginning the clipping process.


If your shortening your dog's fur for summer, you may feel the need to shave him completely. However, this is not recommended as his long coat actually helps regulate his temperature. It provided insulation, which cools your dog in the summer, and can also prevent sunburn and other skin damage. It's best to trim down your dog's hair, focusing especially on long hair on his legs and snipping any mats from his coat.Making your dog ""show-ready"" can be complicated, and difficult to achieve without professional training. If you're going at it on your own, and do not have a background in dog grooming and showing, it's best just to strive to make your dog look less shaggy and remove any troublesome mats or tangles.

, A variety of clippers and shears are available for dog-grooming, and the options can initially be overwhelming. However, some diligence, patience, and research are all you need to make the right decision for your dog.


Understand the difference between scissors and clippers. Clippers are operated electronically and can be outfitted with a selection of blades to fit your dog's needs. They are also easier to use for DIY grooming, as they're easier to handle and remove hair quicker and neater than scissors. Scissors, or grooming shears, are non-electronic and look much like a conventional pair of sewing or craft scissors. They are recommended for trimming around delicate areas, like your dog's eyes and muzzle.Choose a brand of clippers specifically designed for your dog's breed, or the closest approximation of your dog's breed. This should be listed on the label, and you can also ask an employee at your local pet store if you are unsure.Select your blade number depending on how long you want to leave your dog's coat. The lower the blade number, the longer the dog's hair will be. A #5 blade leaves a hair length of 1/4, while a #30 blade leaves a hair length of 1/100. The most commonly used blade is a #10, as this works well for body trimming of most breeds, but might not be the best choice for long-haired dogs if you wan to leave them some fur. A #5 or #7 blade might be a better choice.The speeds can be an important consideration when you’re picking out your clippers. For the most part, they come in two different varieties: single-speed and two-speed. The single speed clippers will be lighter and easier to use for extended periods, two-speeds will be more versatile and better for dogs with exceptionally thick hair.

, Using your scissors, as the feet are a sensitive area, remove any unwanted fur from your dog's feet and tail.


With long-haired breeds, hair around the feet and pads need trimming. The hair here can get long and cause the dog to lose traction and slip on certain surfaces like hardwood floors.Clip around the tail. Long feathers on the tail should be shortened, as these can become tangled with fecal matter and other debris., When you finish grooming your dog's body, still using your scissors over your clippers, move to the head and muzzle.


Be wary of any movements of your dog's ears, eyelashes, and muzzle. Place the clippers flat against the dog's head, with the blade spokes facing to the rear. Clip backwards, to push unwanted hair away from the dog's eyes.Trim the muzzle. Begin at the bridge of the nose and move downward towards the dog's eyes. Then, gently wrap your hand around your dog's muzzle and point it towards the ceiling. Trim down the throat to remove unwanted hairs from the muzzle., You can now begin the process of trimming down your dog's hair with your clippers, providing a smooth and even look for your pet.


Start at the back of the neck. Do not push the clippers too fast, as to avoid leaving lines, and go with the growth of the hair. This makes the hair look smooth and natural.
Hold your dog gently to prevent movement, as wiggling and resisting can cause uneven lines and hairs.
Groom one side of the body, starting from the back of the neck, moving to the whole side, and finishing on the back of the leg. Turn the dog around and repeat this process on the other side.
Groom the front legs and then move onto the belly. The belly requires extra clean shaving, as it's prone to trapping dirt and debris and is not at a high risk of sunburn. Go against the growth of the hair on the belly for a finer shave., Once your dog is clipped and bathed, you can make him show ready by brushing and fluffing his hair. Use a soft bristle brush and brush your dog from the bottom up, lifting the roots and giving him the full effect of his long hair. After brushing his hair in the wrong direction, start at the feet and brush to direct the hair back down. Continue brushing until your dog is fluffy and tangle free., Regular dental care for your dog can prevent the development of gum disease, a serious ailment for dogs. Like ear care, it should be incorporated into a grooming routine.


Put a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush. Place one hand over the top of your dog's muzzle and gently lift his lips. With your other hand, gently brush the outside of his gums and teeth.
Gently place one hand over the top of your dog's muzzle and open his mouth. Put the brush in the dog's mouth and brush the roof of his mouth and the inside of his gums and teeth., Many dogs are squeamish about having their feet touched or handled, so be sure to ease your dog into the process of nail-clipping to avoid injury during the process.


Associate nail-clipping with good things. If your dog learns tolerating nail-clippings leads to treats, walks, or new toys they're more likely to behave during the process. Whenever you trim your dogs nails, make sure you immediately follow up with some kind of reward.
Handle your dog's toes and feet regularly, picking up his paws and touching his nails. This gets him used to the sensation of having his feet touched. You can also try touching the dogs nails to the clippers and immediately following this up with a treat.

, Once your dog is used to having his feet handled, you can begin the nail trimming process. Use guillotine clippers, which provide a small hole that nails are inserted into. The blade is then pushed up to remove the nail.


Take your dog's toe and hold it firmly in your hand. Insert his nail into the clipper hole. Hold the trimmer perpendicular to the nail, as you'll be cutting from bottom to top.
Know where to trim. If your dog has clear nails, you can see a sliver of pink towards the base of the nail. This is the live quick and you should not clip into this area as this will cause pain and bleeding. Make sure you are at least 2 millimeters away when you make the cut.
If your dog has dark nails, cut away one small sliver of nail at a time starting with the tip. Look at the exposed edge each time and eventually a gray or pink oval will start to appear. Stop trimming when you see this oval."

They may need to be exercised so they can burn off their excess energy.
They may be wound up because they are very excited for grooming or some other reason.;
, A tired dog is much more easily groomed than a hyper dog. This is especially true with working breed dogs, since they naturally have higher levels of energy and need a significant amount of exercise to keep them relatively calm. An hour or two before you groom your dog, make sure they get plenty of exercise. Depending on your dog’s preferences, you could play a rigorous game of fetch, go for a run, or take them to the dog park.Let hyper dogs wear themselves out with exercise.

Keep your Chihuahua warm in cold or wet weather.,
Be sure your terrier has toys with which to entertain himself, especially when left alone.",How to Keep Your Dog Happy," Dogs are bred for a specific purpose, whether it be herding or hunting, and can misbehave when these natural instincts are suppressed. Create an obstacle course in which your dog follows a scent to his favorite treats.
Provide him with food puzzle toys, like Kongs, to stimulate his mind.
Leave him with plenty of chew toys. These will not only strengthen his jaw and teeth, but also keep him from chewing up your shoes instead.
Hire a dog walker or someone to play with your pet while you’re away.;
, Keeping him isolated or at home all day can be detrimental to his emotional well-being and create fear when he finally does come in contact with other people or dogs. But always remember to take your pup’s personality into account so you know what his limits for socializing are. Take your dog on a walk, to the dog park, or set up play dates with other humans and their dogs.
Have a friend, whom your dog knows and trusts, look after your pet once a week to get him used to other people.

Reward your pup with special treats when he has followed your directions.
During walks your dog should be next to or behind you.

, Never behave uneasy or anxious. Because you are the pack leader, these feelings are sure to rub off on your pet.


Nervous animals are more likely to be aggressive. , Believe it or not, your pup does have self-esteem, and there are things that you, as his owner, can do to keep it up. Praise your dog when he has mastered a new trick, along with other accomplishments.


Remember that your tone of voice is the key to communication with your pet; praise for him should sound different than a command, Especially if he is alone all day, a dog needs exercise just like people do. Take your dog on a walk around the block or play a fun, interactive game with him. Hide and seek will stimulate your pet’s mind and body.
If you have a high-energy breed, your dog could benefit from an agility class, which may be offered through your local shelter.
A puppy is especially precocious, so active games like tug-of-war and fetch will burn some energy and help to socialize him. For an older dog with stiff joints, water activities are a safe, low impact source of exercise.
If you have a small dog, consider finding a dog park that has specified areas where your pet can socialize with pup's his own size and temperament so you don't have to be skeptical of his safety.

, An animal is happiest when he can exercise, and to do so, he must eat healthful food. What you feed your pooch depends on his age, energy level and potential allergies. Organic, grain free kibble is always best if you are going to go the commercial route. However, some veterinarians also swear by feeding dogs “people food”. Dog-approved people foods include:


Raw, unsalted peanut butter
Baby carrots
Pumpkin
Green beans
Sliced apples
Oatmeal , The vet will provide an overall health screening, as well as any vaccinations your dog might need. It's best for puppies and older dogs to visit every six months, while once a year is adequate for adult dogs under the age of ten. This visit can also help you determine methods for keeping your dog’s ears and teeth clean, along with any other hygiene concerns.

, This includes making sure he has an ID tag on him, a fenced yard that will keep him safe from potential predators, and plenty of shade and water if he’s outside during warm weather.


Make sure your dog is securely fastened or confined during car trips and never let his head hang out of the window where he could be hit by airborne objects or thrown from the vehicle. Unless your dog is extremely well trained, leashing him when outside the yard is important, especially if you’re in a high traffic area.
Kids should always be supervised around a dog; young children should also never be allowed to hold a small dog as they can accidentally drop or injure him., This will bring down his stress levels and soothe any joint pain he may be experiencing.


A slow rub down that reaches the muscle, fat and bones can work wonders to calm a nervous dog.
Daily massages can prolong the length and quality of your canine’s life.
Rubbing your dog’s joints can prepare him for physical activity and help him to unwind directly after.Great Danes and Mastiffs are especially prone to arthritis, so aside from a daily massage, nutritional supplements can be considered to keep these breeds healthy and pain free. , Your Golden is especially prone to allergies and matting of his thick coat. Keeping his fur clean will help his skin from getting itchy and also better serve as insulation during the hot summer and cold winter. As a bonus, he won’t shed quite as much on your furniture.
Pay special attention to the feathering of his tail and legs which can get tangled easily, causing your Golden discomfort.

, While this breed is known for his loyalty and devotion, he needs a lot of quality time with you so he doesn’t get bored and destructive. The high-energy Pit Bull isn’t the type you can leave alone or put outside for the entire day.
This athletic breed enjoys swimming, running, playing fetch or frisbee, along with most other sports.
Because he is a social butterfly, a well-trained Pit Bull appreciates human interaction, including time with your friends, family and even strangers, so be sure to get him out of the house.

, This must be taken seriously since the Chihuahua, like some other small breeds, has trouble regulating his own body temperature, and doesn’t have a large amount of insulating fur. A Chihuahua is generally content to be cuddled up on his owners lap, both for affection and warmth.
Investing in a sweater for your Chihuahua will help keep him from shivering when he's outside.

, While a terrier is a fairly independent dog, he does require a fair amount of exercise. This dog doesn't require your supervision all day as long as you give him the means to play safely on his own. If your terrier is left with nothing to occupy himself, he may resort to digging or other destructive forms of entertainment.
He is especially fond of other canine companionship and playtime can be beneficial for socializing terrier breeds.

Brush their teeth.,
Trim their nails.,
Check their ears.,
Wipe their eyes.",How to Groom a Chinese Shar Pei3," Daily brushing is ideal, but brush their teeth at least two to three times a week to help prevent periodontal disease and tooth decay.Take a toothpaste that is specifically made for dogs and a soft toothbrush. Gently brush your dog’s teeth while you examine their mouth for any signs of disease, like tooth decay or sores.

, Unless you regularly walk your Shar-Pei on pavement, their nails will need to be trimmed every month. A good way to tell that your dog needs their nails trimmed is to listen for any clicking when they walk on a hard surface, like tile. Trim their nails using a guillotine or scissor style nail clipper and cut a small portion of the nail. You want to avoid the quick, which is a vein that runs through the nail delivering its blood supply.It can be more difficult to locate the quick on black nails, so be very careful and only cut small pieces of nail at a time. Have styptic powder and cotton balls handy in case you cut the quick so you can stop the blood flow.
Shar-Peis are also prone to toe infections that are caused when the short hairs on their paws become impacted. While you’re clipping their nails, keep an eye out for any signs of irritation., Shar-Pei ears typically have small ears that sit at the top of their head. Folded ears tend to be more prone to ear infections, but you should check your dog’s ears once a week as a part of your grooming routine. Look for any signs of redness or bad odor, which could indicate an infection.Each time you check their ears, wipe them with a cotton ball that has been dampened with a pH-balanced ear cleaner.


Do not stick anything into their ear canal, like a cotton swab. Only clean the outer portions of the ear.

, Shar-Peis have deep set eyes that often have folds of skin that hang over them. They are very prone to eye diseases and infections, since these flaps of skin can be breeding grounds for bacteria. Check your Shar-Pei’s eyes at least once a week for any blisters, sores, pus, and redness. Use a pH-balanced and gentle cleaning solution on a soft cloth to wipe their eyes.Consult your veterinarian about products that are safe to use around your dog’s eyes.

Make sure your dog has some shady or covered area where they can get out of the direct path of the elements.Large trees that provide shade can give your dog a good place to rest.

Provide your dog with a calming aid.,
Begin to introduce the triggers slowly.,
Give the dog treats when he looks at the trigger object.,
Place the trigger object next to your dog’s food bowl when you feed her.,
Use the trigger object briefly on your dog.,
Increase the amount of grooming over time.",How to Groom a Difficult Dog2," Does your dog get nervous every time you put him in the car?

Teaching your dog to enjoy being groomed is going to take weeks or months, so be prepared to be patient. Begin this process well before you plan to actually groom the dog.

, If the sight of the brush makes your dog anxious, take the brush out from the cabinet so she can see it. Make sure she sees it, then put it back in the cabinet. If the car makes her nervous, bring her to the car but don’t drive anywhere.If the sight of the groomer is what scares your dog, it may not be possible to practice this technique, since you’ll need to repeatedly expose your dog to the trigger for short periods.

, This will help create positive associations with grooming. You can also pet your dog and give him praise for acknowledging the trigger object.If your dog runs away or barks at the trigger object, don’t give treats. This sends the message that running away is a positive thing.

She will eventually be hungry and curious enough that she will eat.
Repeat this step for several days.

, Once your dog has gotten used to seeing the object near his food, try using it on your dog. Don’t attempt a complete grooming, though. For example, run the brush over your dog’s coat once. Turn the clippers on and bring them near your dog’s coat for a few seconds.If the car is what triggers your dog, you can take him for a short ride. You can drive to the groomer’s and give him a treat. Then simply turn around and go home.

, After you’ve used the trigger object for short moments, increase the duration. You can brush your dog for a minute or two. Try clipping part of her coat, or putting her completely in the bathtub.If your dog begins to get anxious at any step, simply reassure her and stop for the day.

Use a comfortable restraint.,
Work quickly, using good equipment.,
Don’t respond if the dog struggles.,
Reward the dog with treats when the grooming is done.",How to Groom a Difficult Dog3," You don’t want to seem overly sensitive, or the dog may assume there’s something to be afraid of; however, you also don’t want to seem angry or aggressive, or the dog will have negative associations with this process.Even if you get frustrated with your dog, work to keep your voice even and assertive. This lets your dog know that you are in charge.

, There are a variety of restraints available for dog grooming. The best ones place a comfortable loop around the dog’s neck holding it up while she stands on a grooming platform. These restraints are safe for dogs and are specifically designed to make grooming easier.Some dogs may require a muzzle to prevent biting or baring their teeth.
Handle your dog carefully while putting her in the restraint. Be firm but gentle. You don’t want him to associate the restraint with pain.
Make sure the restraint works with the location you've chosen. For example, if being in the shower causes the dog's restraint to be uncomfortable, you may need to use it elsewhere.

, Good grooming equipment makes things easier on you and on your dog. Have everything laid out before you begin. You don’t want to leave your dog restrained for a long time while you go off in search of a specific tool.Have water for washing him ready before you’ve restrained the dog.
Make sure the blades on your clippers are sharp.

, You can firmly speak to the dog and tell her that everything is okay; however, don’t coddle her or give treats at this point. It will confuse the dog — she will think this behavior is being rewarded and encouraged.Remember: You can be kind and gentle without giving up control. Dogs respond well when they see you as the “alpha.” It’s okay to show them they need to be able to tolerate some safe, temporary discomfort.

, You can do this while he is still in the restraint, if that’s physically possible. This may help increase positive associations with the restraint.Never reward a dog when he’s exhibiting unwanted behavior such as growling or resisting. This sends a confusing message and will not help him unlearn the behavior.

Make sure your dog is microchipped.,
Create an emergency kit.,
Purchase a dog carrier.,
Find dog-friendly shelters in your area.,
Place a rescue alert sticker on your home.",How to Include Your Dog in an Emergency Disaster Plan1," During a disaster you may get separated from your pet, so it is important that your dog wears an identification tag at all times.

Find a pet-friendly hotel or motel in the area or somewhere along the evacuation route where you could stay with your dog.

, A rescue alert sticker can be placed on the front window or door of your home and alerts emergency responders to the fact that you have pets in your house. This way if you are unable to evacuate your dog, it may be evacuated later by emergency workers. The sticker should include the types and number of pets in your home.You can purchase these stickers at pet supply stores or order one through the ASPCA website.

Considering your positive feelings about each of them, this is actually quite likely. However, there are a few important things that can help make sure an introduction goes well.As the dog meets your partner, provide them with a treat while saying your partner’s name in a calm, friendly voice.
Tell your partner to avoid direct eye contact with your dog. This may stress your dog out.;
, Especially if your dog tends to be a bit nervous around new people, talk to your partner about letting your dog take the initiative to interact physically. For instance, have the dog walk up to them, instead of allowing your partner to reach out towards your dog.More specifically, tell your partner not to assume they can pet your dog when your dog walks up to them to sniff.
Tell your partner to wait to pet your dog until to dog is visibly relaxed, with loose body language. Other signs that the dog seeks physical interaction include keeping a close proximity next to your partner, especially leaning or rubbing against them.

, Some shy dogs may be more likely to want to interact with your partner if your partner ignores them. For example, have your partner sit with you, but with their body angled slightly away from your dog. Further, direct them not to acknowledge or otherwise seek your dog’s attention.When you partner approaches you and your dog, tell them greet you warmly and calmly, but not acknowledge your dog. Have your partner acknowledge your dog and give them a treat only if your dog approaches your partner and sniffs them.

, Dogs can sometimes behave aggressively for a number of reasons. Most commonly, this aggression is associated with protectiveness, possessiveness, fearfulness, or defensiveness. Fortunately, many fearful tendencies can be curbed with training. In short, you need to show an aggressive dog that you are in control, and that they don’t need to intervene on your or their own behalf.If your dog behaves aggressively towards other people, consider waiting to introduce them to your partner until you are better able to control their behavior.
Note that dogs from rescue facilities are often more likely to have aggressive tendencies, perhaps especially towards men.
If you are unable to curb your dog’s aggressive tendencies through training, it’s important to seek professional help. Look for help an animal behaviorist that is certified and experienced.

, Once your dog is comfortable around your partner, have your partner begin to establish a stronger bond with your dog by engaging in the same training practices you use. Further, your partner can establish more clear social boundaries with your dog by helping you enforce the rules you have for your dog.Start simply, by having your partner give commands to do things your dog already knows how to do, like “sit”. When the dog obeys, have your partner provide a treat and pet the dog.
This can be especially helpful if your dog seems to like your partner a bit too much. For instance, if your dog always wants to jump and play with your partner, training can help convey that your dog also needs to listen to your partner when they tell them “down” and other commands.

, Adjustments to your dog’s environment, including the increased presence of your partner, may cause them to become stressed. This is true even if they are friendly with your partner. Make sure your dog is not feeling uneasy if your partner is spending more time at your home by monitoring your dog’s behavior closely.Specific signs of stress to watch out for include chewing, marking, and withdrawing from you or your partner.
If these signs develop, make a point of spending more time with your dog and showing them more affection.

, Aside from spending consistent time with your dog, it’s additionally important to help keep your dog’s schedule stable. Most simply, try to keep any routine you’ve established with the dog as closely as possible. For instance, if you walk and feed the dog at similar times every day, keep it up.If adjustments do need to be made, do so gradually.
For instance, if your dog is accustomed to spending three hours together hanging out every day, don’t all the sudden reduce this amount to one hour. Instead, make sure you’re still spending at least two hours together daily.

, One of the best ways to strengthen the bonds between the animals and humans in your life is by spending time altogether. Try to choose activities that all parties will enjoy. For instance, if both your partner and your dog enjoy being active, go to the park for a game of long-distance fetch.When you’re all together around the house, be sure to spend time cuddling all together. If you exclude your dog, they may be more likely to become jealous or resentful. Further, the more your partner and dog cuddle with each other, the better their own relationship will be.

, Don’t force a relationship with your partner upon your dog. Similarly, don’t insist that your partner falls in love with your dog too. This means being patient, as well as understanding that both your dog’s and your partner’s wishes may be different than what you had initially hoped. In short, if they are slow to be affectionate towards one another, don’t let this bother you. As long as neither is aggressive towards the other, don’t feel like you need to constantly intervene to improve their relationship. Instead, focus on maintaining a positive with each of them independently.
In fact, the stronger your relationships with each on individually, the more likely they’ll wind up falling for one another.

, Communicate both your training regimen and the rules you expect your dog to follow early on in your relationship with a new partner (or a new dog). Further, note specific concerns you have as well.Even before your partner may be able to help with training, they should be told how to prevent complicating the training process.
For instance, if you’re training your dog not to jump up on people, direct your partner to ignore the dog and turn away when they jump up.
Further, if you know your dog likes to bolt out the door when other people enter or exit your home, make sure your partner is aware of this.

, Be explicit about what you want. While the rules that you need your partner to help you enforce may be easier to talk about, it's also important to share your desires. If a positive relationship between your dog and your partner is important to you, be sure to mention it.


For instance, if your partner and your dog do not acknowledge each other and this bothers you, feel free to mention it. In this case, say something like, ""It would really mean a lot to me if you could be more warm towards Lana Dog Rey.""

, The best way to deal with any issues that arise between a partner and your dog is by talking to your partner about it. If you notice your partner becoming inpatient around your dog, or your dog occasionally growling towards your doctor, ask your partner about it. For instance, say something like, “How have you and Princess Elizabeth been getting along lately?”Listen closely to what your partner has to say. If they don’t bring up a specific reason that they may be frustrated, or admit to any tension with your dog, ask them something like, “Is there anything specific thing Elizabeth does that bothers you?”
Encourage your partner to share how they feel about your dog. Try something like, “I understand that being around a dog can be frustrating sometimes. The more I know about how you feel about it, the more I may be able to help.”

, There are some issues that may indicate the dog needs more effective training. The fact of the matter is that a poorly-behaved dog can definitely be frustrating to deal with, even if their behavior doesn’t bother your personally. Additionally, any prolonged aggression from your dog needs to be addressed before your dog snaps at your partner or another human.Never allow your partner to be abusive towards your dog. While a dog’s aggression may be addressed through calm exposure to new people and experiences, a human’s aggression towards animals should simply not be tolerated.
Talk to your vet about different ways you can train your dog, or about how to look for a certified, experienced dog trainer.

, Ideally, you and a serious romantic partner will support one another’s interests, including taking care of a pet. However, it’s not necessarily fair to assume that your partner will want to help take care of a dog. If, for instance, they simply don’t like dogs, you shouldn’t expect them to want to watch your dog for you or take it on walks.In short, as a dog owner, it’s ultimately your responsibility to ensure that the dog’s needs are met. This may require you to do most of the chores involved with owning a dog, even if you share a home with an otherwise supportive partner.

Eliminate any motivation for barking.,
Ignore barking whenever possible.,
Desensitize your dog.,
Teach the quiet command.,
Walk your dog frequently, but time it carefully.,
Keep the dog somewhere else when your landlord is over.,
Vacuum and clean to keep pet hairs hidden.,
Have a friend vouch for you if you get caught.,
Make sure you have the money to move fast.,
Watch out for your neighbors.,
Prepare to pay for damages upfront.,
Try to negotiate with your landlord instead.",How to Keep a Dog in an Apartment That Does Not Allow Dogs," If you want to keep your landlord from discovering your dog, you need to keep it quiet. Start by removing any motivation for barking. Try to observe when your dog barks and work on eliminating anything that encourages the behavior.For example, if your dog barks at pedestrians, keep your blinds closed. If your dog tends to bark when you play music, avoid playing music in your apartment.
Many dogs bark at the door if the doorbell rings or someone knocks. Try discouraging your guests from knocking or ringing the doorbell. Explain the situation to them so they understand why this is necessary.;
, It is probably not always possible to ignore barking, especially if you're trying to hide a dog from your landlord. If your dog is barking loudly when you're home, you will probably need to keep it quiet right away. However, dogs may see your attention as a reward. Whenever possible, ignore the barking as this can help discourage the behavior.If your dog starts barking, do not even look at the dog. Turn your back to it and ignore the behavior until the dog quiets down. As soon as your dog gets quiet, reward it immediately. You can give your dog a treat and praise.
Once your dog learns it is being rewarded for keeping quiet, lengthen the amount of time the dog needs to stay quiet before receiving a reward.
Again, this method is best used outside your apartment. Try to ignore your dog's barking when out on walks or visiting a friend.

, Dogs may bark if they get nervous or frightened easily. If your dog tends to bark in response to particular stimuli, work on de-sensitizing your dog to that stimuli.First, identify what makes your dog bark. For example, maybe your dog barks in response to UPS trucks. Many dogs perceive the UPS driver as an intruder.
Start exposing your dog to the stimuli at a distance. For example, take your dog to a post office where trucks are parked. Have your dog look at the trucks from across the street. Feed it treats so it associates the truck with happy moments.
Repeat this multiple times. Learn when you can expect the UPS truck to drive by your home. Feed your dog treats each time the UPS truck drives by, and stop as soon as the truck is gone.
With time, your dog should stop barking in response to a UPS truck. This may take time, however. You will have to give it a few weeks or months.

, ""Quiet"" can be taught as a command. You will first have to teach your dog to ""Speak."" You can do this by saying ""Speak"" and encouraging barking. Reward the barking when it occurs in response to a command. Once your dog knows ""Speak,"" it can learn ""Quiet.""Bring your dog somewhere away from your apartment to teach this command. Say ""Speak"" and allow your dog to bark.
When your dog starts barking, say ""Quiet."" When it stops barking, reward it. Repeat until your dog knows it should stop barking when it hears ""Quiet.""
You can use the quiet command when your dog gets noisy in your apartment. If a car goes by and your dog barks, say ""Quiet."" If your dog barks in response to the doorbell ringing, say ""quiet.""

, Dogs may make more noise and commotion if they're not getting enough exercise. Make sure to play with your dog and walk it regularly.With a smaller dog, you may be able to adequately exercise it through playing games in your home. Be careful, however, if you live on an upper floor, especially if you live without carpeting. You may want to lay a rug down to muffle the noise of your dog's paws.
Walk your dog frequently, but be careful where you walk your dog. You will have to take the dog out an exit where you're unlikely to run into neighbors or your landlord. For example, sneak your dog out back. You may want to only walk your dog late at night, and use something like a newspaper or a training pad for your dog to its business during the day.

, You should have a game plan in the event your landlord visits. Have a friend or family member to call who can take the dog for a day. You do not want the landlord to see your dog and figure out what is happening.Know when the landlord will show up. For example, the landlord may be coming over to check on a leak in your sink. Have a plan that day to hide the dog.
You may want to keep your dog in a separate room when you are not at your apartment. You can also keep your dog in your car, as long as you crack a window and check in on your dog frequently. If you have a roommate, one of you can walk the dog when the landlord visits.
You can also see if a friend can watch the dog for a day if your landlord is coming over. You can have a friend pick up the dog in the morning and bring it back at night.

, Your landlord may get suspicious if he or she notices signs of your dog in the apartment. Work on keeping any evidence hidden by regular vacuuming. You want to remove any traces of dog hair.Do not just focus on vacuuming the floor. You should also concentrate on vacuuming any furniture.
This is especially important if you have carpet. Carpet can make a dog's presence obvious.

, Despite your best efforts, you may end up getting caught with a dog. In this case, you will have to think of an excuse. A good excuse is to say the dog belongs to a friend, and you're only watching the dog for the day.The landlord may be a bit more vigilant after finding a dog in your apartment. You may have to be extra careful about hiding the dog if you get caught.

, You may get evicted if you get caught with a dog. If dogs are clearly against the rules in the lease, you have broken the lease by hiding your dog. Your landlord may require you to move fast.Moving is expensive. In addition to paying for things like moving trucks and gas, you will have to pay to transfer your utilities. You will also have to put down a deposit on a new apartment, and may have to pay first month's rent upfront.
Make sure you have a nest egg to front these expenses in the event you have to move fast. The potential financial fallout is one of the reasons it's risky to sneak a dog in an apartment.

, It's hard to judge your neighbors' attitude. Some of them may not mind you bending the rules, while others may be irritated. Some people may have specifically chosen that apartment complex because they dislike dogs.Be polite to your neighbors at all times. Keep your dog from jumping on them, barking, or generally disturbing anyone.
If you're respectful of your neighbors, they're more likely to like you. This will decrease the likelihood they'll report you to the landlord if they catch you with a dog.

, A pet deposit usually covers any damage caused by a pet. If your dog, say, chews up the carpet, the $300 you put down for the pet deposit will cover this. However, if you're sneaking your dog in, you won't have a pet despot as a buffer. In the event your dog damages the unit, you will have to pay any damages upfront., It's always best not to break the rules. You could get in a lot of trouble and end up spending a lot of money sneaking in a dog. You may be able to convince a landlord to make an exception to the no pets rule.You can explain to a potential landlord that you have a dog. If there are any reasons you cannot give the dog up, let him or her know. For example, maybe your dog has special needs and would not do well with another owner.
Offer to write up a contract. You could provide a legal document promising to take care of any damages done by your dog. You and your landlord could both agree on the terms of the document. If the landlord sees you're willing to take responsibility and pay potential damages, he or she may be more willing to allow you to have a dog.

Learn the different sleep stages.,
Observe your dog’s eye movements.,
Watch your dog’s body movements.,
Listen to your dog’s vocalizations.,
Do not wake up your dog when he is dreaming.,
Do not touch your dog when he is dreaming.,
Learn what a seizure looks like.",How to Know If Your Dog Is Dreaming," Just like people, dogs have different stages of sleep: short wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM).REM is considered to be the “sleep of body,” when the body is relaxed but the mind is very active.Dogs dream during REM.SWS is known as the “sleep of the mind,” when brain activities have decreased, but muscle tone is still present.It would be somewhat difficult to wake up your dog during the REM sleep stage,but he would probably wake up more easily during SWS.;
, Dogs tend to start dreaming about 20 minutes after they fall asleep.Rapid eye movement is one of the most obvious signs that your dog is dreaming. If you look closely enough, you may be able to see your dog’s eyes moving under his eyelids. This movement is due to your dog actually seeing his dream images as if they were happening in real life.Your dog’s eyes may be fully or partially closed when he is dreaming., Quite naturally, dogs dream about typical dog activities (e.g., running,digging a hole and fighting with an imaginary burglar).His body movements when he is dreaming will likely reflect what is happening in his dream. For example, if he is running and/or chasing after something in his dream, you’ll probably see all of his legs moving in a running motion.


Your dog’s movements will likely be gentle and intermittent when he is dreaming, even if he is ‘running.’Your dog may also have occasional muscle twitches during his dream. These twitches will look jerky and will not last long. He will quickly fall back into a more relaxed state.Even though your dog may move occasionally while he is dreaming, his overall body posture will suggest that he is relaxed and at peace., Your dog may begin to make various noises when he is dreaming. For example, he may bark, whine, or cry, depending on what he is dreaming about.Usually, these vocalizations will be brief and infrequent,and will not wake him from his dream.


Your dog may also breathe differently during a dream. For example, he may start to breathe rapidly or have brief periods when he holds his breath.Your dog’s breath may also become shallow., As much you appreciate having uninterrupted sleep, your dog would also appreciate if you did not wake him up. Similar to human dreams, your dog’s dreams function to process and reorganize what he did during the day.By allowing your dog to sleep and dream uninterrupted, his brain will be better able to process information.


A helpful saying to remember when your dog is dreaming is “Let sleeping dogs lie.”You may need to wake him up if he looks like he’s having a bad dream or nightmare (e.g., distressed-sounded vocalizations). If this is the case, gently call his name (without touching him) to wake him up. When he is awake, talk to him in a reassuring voice to help him calm down., Depending on what your dog is dreaming about, he may be in a relatively active state when he is sleeping. If you try to wake him by touching him, he may react defensively and try to scratch or bite you., At first glance, your dog’s movements and vocalizations during a dream may look troubling, and you may wonder if he is having a seizure. Recognizing what a seizure looks like will help you determine if your dog is having a seizure or is just having a very active dream. For example, if your dog is having a seizure, his body will become stiff and he may begin to tremble heavily or have violent muscle activity.During a seizure, your dog may start to pant excessively and might vomit, urinate, or defecate.If your dog is having a seizure, his eyes may be wide open but have a blank stare. He might also begin to have loud, involuntary vocalizations (moaning, howling, screaming). These vocalizations might be very unsettling to you, but are not signs of pain and distress.Unlike a dream, your dog will likely lose consciousness if he is having a seizure. Because of this, he would not respond to you if you called his name.If your dog has had a seizure, he would be very disoriented and confused after regaining consciousness. This is different from a dream, which your dog would wake up from and not feel disoriented.If your dog is having a seizure, stay calm and stay away from his head and mouth. Clear away any item, such as furniture, on which he could injure himself. Even though he may be unconscious, talk to him in a soothing voice until the seizure ends. When the seizure ends, cool him down with a fan and call your veterinarian.Seizures require immediate medical attention.

Enjoy the wedding ceremony and reception.",How to Host a Dog Wedding," In addition to the bride and groom (and their human handlers), you may want to include other dogs in the wedding. Ask the bride’s best furry friends to serve as the maid of honor and bridesmaids. Invite the groom’s favorite four-legged friends to stand by his side as the best man and groomsmen., Marriage ceremonies, even those of the canine variety, are conducted by an officiant. Since dog marriages are not legally binding, any one can officiate your pet’s wedding. You may hire a licensed celebrant to conduct the ceremony or ask a close friend to lead the bride and groom through their wedding “bows”.

, Weddings are meant to be celebrated and witnessed by friends and family members. Together with the parents of the bride or groom, compile a list of loved ones you want in attendance. Don’t forget to add a few canine guests to the list too!Remember, the size of the venue may limit the number of people and dogs you invite.

, The venue you select must accommodate the needs of your four-legged bride, groom, and guest. In addition to allowing dogs on the premises, it is imperative that the staff is comfortable working with animals.


If you are hosting a small, intimate affairs, consider holding the wedding festivities in a backyard, a park, or a garden.
If the guest list is lengthy, you may want to rent a larger venue, like a hotel ballroom.

, No wedding—not even a canine wedding—would be complete without tasty food, lively music, gorgeous flowers, and a photographer to capture all of the lovely memories. While some hosts choose to hire a caterer, DJ, florist, and photographer. Others prefer to find volunteers to provide these services or even perform these tasks themselves., The wedding ceremony may be as informal or traditional as you would like. Many traditional elements of weddings can be adapted for your canine friends. For instance, consider including the following elements:


Procession: Have the wedding party (and their human handlers) walk down the aisle to the alter.
Symbol of Unity: Have the bride and groom drink out of a shared cup.
Vows: The two love pups may exchange vows at the alter.

Officiant: ""Do you Victor take Viridian to be your beloved?""
Victor: ""Arf!""
Officiant: ""Do you Viridian take Victor to be your beloved?""
Viridian: ""Arf!""


Pronouncement of Marriage: After the pups exchange vows, the officiant can formally announce the happy couple.

Officiant: ""Victor and Viridian, I now pronounce you two pups in love! You may sniff your bride!"", Like the wedding ceremony, the reception may be as non-traditional or formal as you'd like. The only stipulation is that the reception should cater to dogs and human guests.


Food: Set of treats for the pups or serve them a formal meal. For your two-legged guests, consider passing around appetizers, setting up a buffet, or having a sit-down dinner.
Drinks: Put down water dishes for the pups. Set up drink stations for your friends and family.
Dessert: Order a canine cake and a separate dessert for your guests.
Entertainment: Put together a play area for the pouches and a dance floor for the people.
Traditional Elements: You may have the bride and groom cut the cake or share a first dance. The bride's handler could throw her bouquet to the eligible female pups, and the groom's owner could toss the bride garter to all the bachelors.

, Many pet stores and specialty dog boutiques carry wedding outfits for canine brides and grooms.They also have dresses for the bridesmaids and bowties for the groomsmen. Don’t forget to find fabulous outfits for the human handlers!Instead of purchasing the wedding outfits, you can always make your own or have the clothing custom made., When all of the wedding details are finalized, you can create the invitations. In addition to including all of the relevant details—date, time, attire, etc—you may also want to explain why you are hosting a dog wedding. Mail the invitations a few weeks before the nuptials so that guests have time to RSVP.Before you send out the formal invite, you could even send out a “Save the Date” card.

, On the day or morning prior to the wedding, you will be busy overseeing preparations for the wedding and reception. Surround yourself with a team of helpful volunteers or hard-working vendors to help get the job done. Last minute preparations may include:


Making floral arrangements
Setting up tables, chairs, etc.
Cooking and baking
Decorating the venue
Coordinating with vendors

, The morning of the ceremony, treat the canine bride and groom to a day at the groomers. Have the dogs bathed, their nails clipped, and their hair styled. After a morning at the spa, get the couple dressed in their wedding outfits and rush them off to the ceremony site.


You can invite members of the wedding party to join the happy couple at the groomers.

, After weeks or even months of planning, the big event has finally arrived. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the celebration. Remember, dog weddings, like human weddings, are unpredictable. You won’t be able to control your four-legged guests, so you might as well laugh at their antics."

Feed your dog a quality food.,
Exercise your dog.,
Prevent parasites.,
Pay attention to your dog's dental health.,
Keep a record.",How to Holistically Care for a Dog1," Nutrition is the foundation of a dog's health, so a quality dog food is important. The first thing you should look for in your dog's food is that it says ""complete and balanced"" on the label, which means it passed certain regulations to meet your dog's nutritional needs. Also, look for a food with meat, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Your dog is not a strict carnivore, and the other foods in your dog's kibble or wet food provide vitamins and minerals it needs.In addition, make sure you are buying food that's appropriate for your dog's size and age. Buy puppy food for puppies and adult food for adults. Similarly, buying ""large breed"" or ""small breed"" food when appropriate is important.
Check for high quality ingredients. ""Meat meal"" is actually not a poor quality ingredient, as long as it comes from a good source. You can always contact the food company if you're concerned about the source of your dog's food.
If you still don't know what to choose, ask for a recommendation from your vet.;
, Just like you, your dog needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy. Daily walks are one way to help your dog get exercise. However, you can also do things like throw a ball in the backyard for your dog to fetch. Older dogs might enjoy some gentle water exercise. Basically, anything that gets your dog (safely) moving will help your dog get the exercise it needs., Parasites, such as heartworms, tapeworms, fleas, mosquitoes, and ticks, can all lead to health problems for your dog. It's best to prevent these parasites if you can, rather than trying to treat them after your dog gets them.Consider getting prevention treatments from your vet, such as heartworm medication and flea pills.If you want to limit your dog's intake of these types of medications, you can medicate for certain things (like ticks) only when your dog is in an area where they're prevalent, such as when you go on vacation.
Some people use essential oils to help repel parasites, though you must be careful with essential oils. Lemon eucalyptus, for example, can be used in a collar specifically designed to hold essential oils, and it can help repel mosquitoes., You may not think about your dog's dental health as often as you should. However, your dog's teeth need care, too, and if neglected, they can affect the overall health of your dog. Fortunately, working on your dog's teeth is easier than it sounds.You can buy toothbrushes and toothpaste made specifically for your dog at the pet store. While brushing is the best option, various types of dog chews can also be effective. Daily bully sticks, raw bones, or dental chews are all good ways to reduce the bacteria on your dog's teeth.

, One way to keep track of your dog's health is to keep a journal. Make notes in it, such as when your dog seems to have allergies or reactions to certain foods or treatments. Doing so will help you see patterns with your dog, so that you can better treat it in the future.You should also note things like if your dog is drinking more water or has a change in appetite. Coat and behavioral changes are good to note, as well.
For example, over time you may notice that your dog has cracked ears or paws in the winter, due to the dryness in your house. A simple solution would be to use a humidifier and apply dog-friendly oil or lotion as needed.

"
Evacuate your dog.,
Evacuate early with a dog.,
Create a buddy system with neighbours and friends.",How to Include Your Dog in an Emergency Disaster Plan2," The general rule during an emergency is that if it is not safe for you, then it is not safe for your dog. Always evacuate your pet with you, if possible. Many people leave their dogs at home during an emergency evacuation because they believe their pet will be more comfortable or they think they will only be gone for one night. This is not a good idea. Dogs can get severely injured, lost, or worse if left alone during a disaster.In some instances you may not be allowed to return to an area that has been evacuated for days or even weeks after the evacuation.
Your dog will not be able to look after themselves.

, If you have a dog, or any other pet, you should always evacuate early. Typically, major weather disasters can be predicted. If they are calling for a major weather event or storm in your area, you should always evacuate with your dog before it is too late. If you try and wait out the storm, you run the risk of a mandatory evacuation or rescue.In some cases, during a forced evacuation or emergency rescue, emergency responders will not allow you to bring your dog.

, It is also important to consider the fact that you may not be at home when a disaster hits the area. As a result, you should prepare in advance to have a friend, neighbour, or relative evacuate your dog for you, if necessary. This individual should have a key to your house, be familiar with your dog, know where your dog’s emergency kit is kept, and have all of your contact information.You should also set a specified location where you can meet to pick up your pets.

"
"
Keep your dog inside.,
Create a safe room.,
Separate dogs and cats.",How to Include Your Dog in an Emergency Disaster Plan3," In some instances, you may have to stay at home during a disaster. For example, there may not be enough time to evacuate. During these instances, you should keep your dog inside at all times. Your dog may get anxious during severe weather and become disoriented. As a result, they can wander out of the yard and get lost.Once inside, you should keep your dog on a leash or in a carrier so that it is contained and with you at all times.

, Locate a safe room in your house where you can stay during a disaster. Choose an interior room with few windows. During a flood, choose a room that is on the top story of your house. Make sure the safe room is free of any hazards for your dog, such as chemicals or sharp objects. Store an emergency kit inside the room so that you have access to all of your dog’s supplies., Even if your dog and cat typically get along, an emergency can cause anxiety and your pets may begin to act irrationally. Place your cat in a crate and contain your dog on a leash so that they do not injure each other."
"
Keep your dog on a leash and maintain close contact.,
Check your yard and home for dangers.,
Monitor your dog’s behaviour.",How to Include Your Dog in an Emergency Disaster Plan4," Following a disaster or emergency, keep your dog on a leash when you take it outside. This should be done for at least the first few days. The outdoor environment may have changed because of the disaster, causing your dog to feel confused and disoriented. For example, trees may have fallen, new smells may have entered your yard, etc., During a disaster, your yard and home may be altered. Check to make sure that everything is safe before allowing your dog to freely roam around. For instance, wild animals may have taken up shelter in your home or yard during the disaster, and/or power lines may be down, causing hazards in the area., Your dog’s behaviour may change after an emergency. For instance, energetic and friendly dogs may become aggressive or defensive as a result of a traumatic experience. Monitor your dog’s behaviour and keep them in a secure and safe environment until they begin to act normally again."
"
Ask the vet about home treatments.,
Realize that natural cures may not always be the best option.,
Pick a vet who understands.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Look at herbal remedies.,
Add supplements if your dog is unhealthy.",How to Holistically Care for a Dog2," You may find many natural remedies on the internet for dogs. However, these treatments are not always safe. It's best to ask your vet's advice about a treatment before giving it to your dog. You don't want to make the situation worse.Keep in mind that what's safe for humans is not always safe for dogs. For example, dogs can't have onions, garlic, raisins, grapes, or chocolate.
Simple home remedies can help with a variety of ailments. For instance, you can use pediatric replenishing drinks to help your dog recover after they've been vomiting or had diarrhea. Other people use cooled chamomile tea, both for stomach problems and to spray on mild skin issues. However, you should always ask your vet first about such treatments., Home remedies can cure some ailments and are relatively safe for your dog. However, some ailments are best cured by conventional medicine, especially ailments that would usually require surgery.For instance, for something like a hematoma, which is a blood-filled blister, alternative medicine may not work, particularly if it's in a difficult place, such as the dog's ear.
Also, if your dog is in obvious distress, such as having non-stop vomiting or breathing problems, a vet needs to see it. Constant whimpering or whining is also an indication your dog may need to see a vet.
The same holds true for things like vaccinations. Even if you aren't a big fan of vaccinations, you may find it prudent to vaccinate your dog if a particular disease is going around in your area.

, While you may not want to choose a wholly ""natural"" vet, as they might not practice any conventional medicine, you should at least pick one who's sympathetic to your mindset. Find a vet who understands that you prefer home remedies, but who will be honest with you when a home or natural remedy won't work.You can also get advice from a holistic vet when you want a second opinion.

, Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils to treat certain conditions. At home with your dog, it's best to only use essential oils in either topical applications or diffusion/inhalation. You should not give essential oils orally to your dog.Dilute oils for your dog. You should only use three to six drops in an ounce of carrier oil or eighteen to twenty-four drops in eight ounces of shampoo. A carrier oil is just a basic oil that can ""hold"" and dilute the other oil, such as olive oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil, while a shampoo is just any pet shampoo you want to use. Hydrosols are similar to essential oils, but they are formed from a different part of the plant, so they aren't as strong. Therefore, they may be a good place to start with your dog instead of essential oils.
Remember that a dog's sense of smell is very strong, so you don't need nearly as much as you need for humans. Start small.
Often, the same application you use for humans will work for dogs. For instance, lavender can have a calming effect on dogs.Always be careful when using essential oils, particularly on your dog. You should NOT use any of the following essential oils: birch, wintergreen, anise, camphor, juniper, hyssop, white thyme, yarrow, clove, rue, pennyroyal, mustard, horseradish, tansy, and wormwood. This list is not extensive, so always check if the oil is safe for your dog.

, Just like some people use herbal remedies on themselves, you can use them on your dog to help with some ailments. They are appropriate for a wide variety of applications, but remember that some herbs that are safe for humans are toxic to dogs.Aloe vera gel, for instance, can be used on dogs to help with minor cuts or burns. However, it shouldn't be ingested by dogs, so they shouldn't lick the area.
You can also use herbs like calendula flowers on your dog. You can either apply the flowers directly to a cut, or make an antiseptic by boiling the flowers in water.

, If a dog is eating a nutritious diet and is healthy overall, it likely won't need any supplements. Nonetheless, if your dog has a particular condition, supplements can sometimes benefit a dog's health.Consult your vet before adding a supplement, particularly if your dog is on a special diet.
For instance, you may find that if your dog has joint problems, a supplement containing glucosamine and chondroitin may help. For skin problems, fish oil may be beneficial, and vitamins C and E may help reduce inflammation.

Consider acupuncture.,
Look at chiropractors.,
Check out massage.,
Find support.",How to Holistically Care for a Dog3," While not every city is going to have an acupuncturist for dogs, it is becoming more popular. Some dog owners have had good luck with acupuncture, as they notice it seems to help relieve pain in their dogs. It may also help to correct things like a stiff gait.Some vets may practice acupuncture, too.
Though you may not have an acupuncturist in your area that works on dogs, you can search online or in the phone book to find one. Try looking under ""alternative medicine"" or ""Chinese medicine."" Alternatively, look for a vet that also provides natural alternatives, as they will either be able to do the acupuncture themselves or point you in the right direction.

, Another area of holistic medicine seeping from the human world to the dog world is chiropractors. Like their human counterparts, dogs may benefit from having back and spine corrections performed by a chiropractor. Check to see if you have an animal chiropractor in your area that can treat your dog., Massage can be another option in place of or as a supplement to conventional treatment. It can help with mobility issues if your dog has swelling, for instance. It can also help reduce anxiety in overly anxious dogs. Think about the things you would get a massage for, and your dog may benefit in similar ways.Make sure to find someone trained in massage for dogs. You can find specialists online or in the phone book, although your vet may be able to perform massages as well. In a similar vein, you could try a physical therapist for dogs.

, If you can, finding people who think like you do can be beneficial. You may find there's a holistic dog group in your area, for instance, and then you can share tips and ideas. If you don't know of a group, start talking to people you meet at places like the dog park. You may find someone who shares your interest and who will provide the support you need."

, Train your dog to wait quietly when tied at a location away from you. Train your dog to understand plain English= common household words and phrases and to do tricks.

,, “Fix” your dog for the emotional and health benefits the surgery provides.

, House train your dog by visiting other homes and buildings. Train your dog to “go potty” on command and while being walked on a leash.

, Train your dog to accept grooming. Provide vaccinations and general medical care for your dog so it is healthy.

, Tags, a microchip and tattoos help to SAVE LIVES!

, Don’t feed your dog from the table. If you want to give your dog “people food”, save the food and place it in the dog’s crate when you are done eating.

, Don’t allow your pet to get on furniture and don’t allow your dog to sleep on a human’s bed.

, Train your dog to travel in the vehicle in its crate and also out of its crate.

Determine if your cat is fertile.,
Watch for mating behaviors.,
Understand the implications of a cat in heat.,
Check for enlarged nipples.,
Look for a characteristic ""burro"" shape.,
Notice any nesting behavior.,
Take your cat to the vet if you think she may be pregnant.,
Ask for an ultrasound.,
Ask the vet to take radiographs (X-rays).,
Avoid getting vaccinations, deworming, or giving medications to your cat if she's pregnant.,
Increase her caloric intake in the last few weeks of her pregnancy.,
Keep the queen inside during the last few weeks of pregnancy.",How to Tell if a Cat is Pregnant," If your cat is fertile and has recently been in heat, it’s possible that she may be pregnant.


Female domestic cats become sexually active as the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, typically between spring and fall.
A female cat may start her estrus cycle (go into heat) once the weather becomes warmer and she has reached about 80% of her adult weight. This means a cat may go into heat as early as four months of age in unusual cases.;
, When a cat goes into heat, she displays clear behavioral changes meant to attract a mate that will last about four to six days.A cat about to go into heat will initially display signs of restlessness, become more affectionate, begin making low calls, and have increased appetite.When a cat enters into heat, she will begin “calling”--meowing or mewling frequently and insistently--and may lose her appetite.
A cat in heat will become much more affectionate towards people, will roll around, and will prop her hind quarters up in the air while treading her back paws and holding her tail to the side., If your cat has gone into heat, the effects can extend much further than odd behavior--your cat could have gotten pregnant.


If you determine your cat has recently been in heat, pregnancy is a definite possibility.
After being in heat, a cat will enter into a “quiet phase” lasting about 8-10 days, during which her behavior will calm down. Following the quiet phase, however, your cat will go into heat again and continue to go into heat through the period between April and September.To prevent your cat from going into heat and/or inadvertently getting pregnant, have her spayed as soon as it’s safe to do so.

, About 15-18 days into the pregnancy, a queen's nipples will “pink up,” or become red and enlarged.


Her breasts may enlarge, and she may express a milky fluid.
Enlarged nipples are also signs of being in heat, so bear in mind that growing nipples are not exclusively indicative of pregnancy.

, From the side, pregnant cats frequently look somewhat swaybacked, with a slightly round and bulging abdomen.


Many female cats assume this burro shape later in pregnancy.
If your cat is merely overweight, she’ll be heavier all over, including her neck and legs, and not just in her abdomen.

, A few days before she’ll give birth, your cat will begin showing nesting behaviors as she prepares for the arrival of her litter.


Your cat may go to a quiet place like a closet and start arranging blankets, towels, or other fabric to create a place to give birth to her kittens.
If you notice nesting behavior and you hadn’t previously realized your cat was pregnant, take your cat to the vet as soon as possible for a prenatal checkup.

, The vet can confirm the pregnancy and advise you on caring for the cat. Ask your vet about caring for the queen and preparing for the birth.


Have the vet examine the queen’s stomach; after about 17-25 days, an experienced veterinarian can usually feel the embryos.
Leave feeling for embryos to the vet--your prodding could lead to a miscarriage., If the vet is unsure after feeling your cat for embryos, they can instead use an ultrasound to determine whether or not your cat is pregnant and, if so, with how many kittens.The vet will be able to detect fetal heartbeats by 20 days into the pregnancy with an ultrasound.

, At approximately 45 days of gestation, the skeletons of the kittens can be seen with an x-ray, which will confirm the pregnancy and the number of kittens in the litter.The vet will typically take two x-rays in order to get views of the abdomen and count kittens while also looking for potential problems.
These x-rays will not hurt the queen or the kittens.
An X-ray is better for counting fetuses than an ultrasound, though it still isn’t 100% accurate.

, Vaccines in particular may be dangerous to the queen or her kittens during gestation.


Consult your vet before giving the any medications, including dewormer, to the queen or, after she gives birth, to the kittens.

, You may notice your cat consuming more food and gaining weight as she gets closer to giving birth.Because the kittens are developing rapidly during the last third of pregnancy, you should feed your cat a growth (kitten) formula diet to provide sufficient calories.

, As your cat gets closer to giving labor, be careful to keep her inside so that she won’t find a place outside to give birth to the kittens.It’s best if you prepare a nest or whelping box for her inside the house. Place a box in a warm, dry, quiet place in the house and line it with newspaper or an old towel or blanket.
Set your cat’s food, water, and litter box near by and encourage her to sleep in the box in the days leading up to the birth."

Find your local animal shelter.,
Research what volunteer opportunities are available.,
Tell the shelter about any skills you have.,
Sign up for a job.,
Commit to going at your scheduled time.",How to Help Shelter Dogs1," There may be multiple shelters for you to volunteer at, or maybe you just have one local adoption group. Try to locate all of the shelters in your area so that you can choose the one that works best for you.



The Shelter Project can help you identify all of the animal shelters and rescues in your area. Simply type in your postcode and click the option to find a “Pet Adoption Group.”;
, Depending on the shelter’s size and needs, there may be a variety of different jobs they need you to fill. Volunteers are often asked to socialize and train dogs to make them attractive for adoption. Other jobs may require you to take on a customer service role to help potential adopters at the shelter.Some jobs you may be able to do include:


Walking dogs
Bathing dogs
Training dogs
Providing veterinary care
Grooming dogs
Helping families find the right dog
Working in administration

, Shelters often need assistance with fundraising, marketing, and caring for the dogs. Contact the shelter, and let them know if you have a particular skill that might help them with these specialized services.If you're a photographer, you may be able to take professional quality pictures of the dogs to post online. This will help the dogs be adopted more quickly.
If you have experience in marketing, you may be able to help the shelter advertise their dogs.
You should let the shelter know of any previous work you have with helping animals, including any veterinary training that you may have.

, Some shelters will ask you to fill out an online form to sign up; others may have you complete a physical application. This form may ask you to provide your age, experience with dogs, contact information, and availability.


The shelter’s website should state what their volunteer policies are. If they do not, try calling the shelter and asking them, “How can I volunteer to help the dogs?”
Many shelters may require you to be at least 16 years old to volunteer. Some may let you volunteer with a parent or guardian if you are younger.

, Animal shelters often rely on their volunteers to function at full capacity. It is important that you follow through on your promises when you volunteer. Most shelters will assign you a time when you should come to volunteer. Make sure you’re able to be there when they need you.


Some shelters may require you to commit to a length of time when you will volunteer. This period may be as long as year.
You can work with the shelter to find a shift that fits your schedule. Be prepared to volunteer for between two and four hours per shift."
"
Check that the shelter is reputable.,
Ask them what they need.,
Raise money for the shelter.,
Organize a supply drive.",How to Help Shelter Dogs2," It is always important to make sure that the shelter or rescue you are supporting is a legitimate non-profit charity. Sometimes puppy mills will disguise themselves as a rescue to sell puppies or dogs who do not live up to their standards. Others will pack in as many dogs as they can in filthy conditions to maximize profits from adoption fees.If a breed-specific rescue is only offering puppies, be aware that it might be a puppy mill. Legitimate rescues will normally offer dogs of many different ages.Visit the shelter. A filthy or overcrowded shelter is usually a sign that they are complying with local animal laws. If the dogs appear malnourished, they may not be using their funds for food.
Puppy stores are not shelters. They sell the dogs for profit, and they often buy their dogs from puppy mills. Avoid donating to these stores. If you are worried about the welfare of these dogs, contact animal control instead., Some pet shelters may have a wish-list of items that they need desperately. Others may be trying to raise money for a new building, new bedding, or special medical care.To identify the best donation for your shelter, call them. You can ask:


“Are there any special projects that the shelter needs money for?”
“Are you in need of food, bedding, or other supplies?”
“What is the proper way of donating money to your shelter?”
“What types of items do you not accept?”

, Shelters need money to buy food, medical care, and food for dogs. By raising money, you can help improve the quality of life for dogs in the shelter. It may also allow the shelter to care for more dogs without euthanizing them.


You can host a bake sale, garage sale, or other small scale sale to raise money at your own home, school, or office.
If you have a birthday or wedding coming up, you might consider asking guests to donate to your local shelter instead of buying you gifts.You can set up a crowd-funding page for your local shelter on a platform like Go Fund Me or Generosity.com to solicit donations.

, You can encourage people to donate dog food, toys, treats, and other dog items. This will save the shelter money. It may also give the dogs a special treat. Some things you can donate include:Food and water bowls
Leashes
Dog beds and blankets
Toys like tennis balls, chew ropes, or KONG toys
Both wet and dry dog food

Adopt dogs instead of buying them.,
Foster a dog.,
Spay or neuter your dogs.,
Tell your friends to adopt.,
Share notices of dogs needing homes.",How to Help Shelter Dogs3," One of the best ways to help shelter dogs is to adopt one yourself. By giving a dog a permanent, loving home, you not only reduce the burden on the shelter but you also free a spot for another homeless dog at the shelter., When you foster a dog, you care for the dog in your home while the shelter looks for a potential owner. This is a temporary situation. By letting the dog into your home, you open up a spot for another dog at the shelter.Make sure that you can handle giving the dog away when they are adopted.
You may have to housebreak the dog and train them. This will help the dog find a good home more quickly.

, The best way to prevent overcrowding at shelters is to prevent more dogs from entering the system. Spaying or neutering your dog will prevent them from having puppies of their own. It may also help current homeless dogs find a home.


If you do not have a dog, you can encourage others to spay or neuter their dogs. Point out the benefits of spaying and neutering. You might say, ""spayed female dogs live longer"" or ""neutered male dogs won't wander from home as often."", If you can’t adopt a dog yourself, you can encourage others to rescue a dog instead of buying one from a store or breeder. If a friend or family member is considering getting a dog, talk to them about the benefits of adoption.


You might say, “You should consider adopting from the local animal shelter. It’s a great way to save a life.”
You can bring up the benefits of adopting. For example, you might say, “It is much cheaper to adopt a dog” or “many dogs in animal shelters are already trained.”, Social media is a powerful tool to help shelter dogs find homes. Like the pages of your local shelters social media pages. They will often post notices of dogs who need homes. Share these on Facebook, Twitter, and other networking apps to spread the word. This will help the dog find a home more quickly."

Apply to be a volunteer.,
Make a monetary donation.,
Donate useful things.,
Raise money.,
Offer transport.",How to Help Dogs in Need1," Many shelters and rescue groups are in dire need of volunteers, and will provide training for you once they approve your application. To be sure that you meet the volunteering requirements of your local shelter or rescue organization before applying, call for information or visit their website to see if you fit the criteria. Volunteers can be in charge of many tasks, including walking dogs, teaching basic obedience, moving dogs in and out of their cages, cleaning, and meeting with potential adoptive owners.For instance, the Animal Humane Society, the leading animal welfare organization in the Upper Midwest, outlines on its website that it requires applicants to be at least 16 years old, willing to commit to a full year of volunteering (at least once every other week), and be able to lift up to 20 lbs.;
, Making a monetary donation to a dog shelter or rescue group, which run on donations for the most part, is the most straightforward and simple way to help dogs in need. As a general rule, most organizations accept donations by mail, in person, or online via credit card. Donations are usually tax deductible, and can be made on a monthly basis in many cases.For example, the Humane Society of the United States allows you to make a one-time donation, or set up a monthly donation of a certain amount on their website via credit card or PayPal. The Human Society also accepts donations made in memory of pets or persons., In addition to monetary donations, shelters and animal rescue groups can benefit greatly from the donation of different items to help care for their dogs. Such items could include food, blankets, dog beds, dog toys, treats, collars, leashes, grooming products, laundry detergent, and towels. Call your local shelter or rescue group beforehand to make sure that they will accept all of the items you have to donate, and ask when during business hours you should bring your donation.Some rescue groups, like the San Diego Humane Society, allow you to make donations of specific gifts on shelters’ Amazon.com wish lists. This can be done from your home and shipped directly to the shelter or center in question., If you are interested in raising money for the shelter or rescue group you are supporting, inquire about hosting a third party fundraising event. Whether you want to undertake the fundraiser on your own or collaborate with a local business, call or visit the organization’s website for more information (the Humane Society of Huron Valley in Ann Arbor, MI, for instance, has a fundraising questionnaire on their website to be completed online or printed and mailed). Some good ideas for community fundraising events may include:Bake sales
Car washes
Fundraising walks or races
Golf tournaments

, Shelter and rescue groups, especially small ones, require transport of dogs to veterinary appointments, adoption events, and adoptive homes. Beyond that, hundreds of dogs are transported around the country every week from high kill shelters to no kill organizations. Look online for groups and shelters in your area that require transport volunteers.


The Reach Out Rescue and Resources organization in Maryland, for example, has an application form for drivers on their website, and rely on these volunteers to help dogs who are travelling anywhere from a few hundred miles to as much as 1000 miles, broken down into legs of 50-75 miles."

Remove their collar.,
Supervise them until you can clean them.,
Go the vet if you think your cat has consumed the paint.",How to Remove Paint from a Cat's Fur1," If their collar also has paint on it, remove it, and wash it separately. You can use oil to remove oil-based stains or wash it with dish soap to remove water-based paint. Let it dry completely before putting it back on your cat. If the paint has soaked through the cat’s collar, particularly if it is an oil-based paint, you may want to simply throw the collar away.;
, You will need to make sure that your cat does not lick their fur until you have safely removed the paint. This means that someone must be watching the cat until you are able to clean them. If you notice the cat trying to lick themselves, stop them.Try putting an Elizabethan collar on your cat. This is a plastic cone that your cat can wear around their neck to prevent them from licking the paint. Do not remove the collar or let your cat outside until you have safely removed all of the paint.
If you do not have a collar readily available, you can wrap the cat in a towel instead., Most varieties of paint are toxic to cats, and cats may try to lick the paint off of themselves. Before you do anything, make sure that the cat has not ingested any paint. If you’re unsure, visit the vet just in case.Some symptoms of poisoning in cats includes:


Problems breathing
Diarrhea or vomiting
Drooling
Fever
Head shaking
Pawing at the mouth
Seizures
Bluish gums and tongue

Confirm your cat is pregnant.,
Pay close attention to nutrition.,
Ensure proper health.,
Know when the time is near.,
Prepare for birth.",How to Take Care of a Pregnant Cat1," Before you start caring for a pregnant cat, you'll want to make sure the cat is pregnant. Unlike humans, there is no simple blood or urine test that can confirm pregnancy. However, physical signs do emerge in the earliest stages of pregnancy that can clue you in that your cat may be carrying kittens. The full gestation period of a cat is around 60-70 days, so the process will move along quickly.By the third week the cat's nipples will become enlarged and pink. This is referred to as ""pinking up.""
By the fourth week, the cat will begin to gain weight, making the pregnancy visible.
By around the fourth week, your vet should be able to help confirm a pregnancy. An experienced vet can feel around the cat's stomach and feel the kittens. They could also do an ultrasound to detect heartbeats.
There will also be noticeable behavior changes, particularly in the final weeks. They may appear uncomfortable due to their growing abdomen and meow to seek more attention or affection. As their pregnancy moves along, they'll eat more and spend even more time than usual sleeping.;
, You'll need to make sure your cat is getting proper nutrition for her own health, but also the growing young inside of her. By the start of the sixth week, you should be offering at least 25% more food. Also, make sure the diet is high in protein and calcium are essential to both the kittens and the mother's ability to lactate.Introduce a diet designed for kittens to your pregnant cat. These diets are rich in protein and calcium that the cat will need during this time. You should continue to feed them kitten food during their entire pregnancy and after delivery.
You will not need any special vitamin or mineral mixes, as long as you are feeding them a high quality diet of kitten food. Buy a common and trusted brand to make sure it's up standards.
Always make sure fresh water is available. This is just as important as any food.

, Although a healthy cat will rarely have problems introduced by pregnancy, it's important to make sure your cat is healthy enough for the rigors or pregnancy and birthing. Have your cat checked for routine parasites and make sure common vaccinations are up to date. Other more acute problems to look for include:Watch with concern if your pregnant cat loses interest in food. This can be an indication of a bigger problem and also cut off necessary nutrients. In some cases a cat may lose interest in food right before giving birth, but it should not last long.
If your cat is acting distressed and licking her vulva area, this may an indication of a problem. This could mean there is an irritation or a problem the cat is sensing. You should have the cat examined by a vet.
Look out for any abnormal, bad-smelling vaginal discharge. This can happen during labor or during pregnancy, and in all cases should be followed up by a vet.
If you notice blood in your cat's urine, or they're squatting with no urine coming out, this can be a sign of uterine infection. This can be painful for your cat and affect the kittens if left untreated.

, If you have been tracking your cat's pregnancy since the beginning, you will have a rough approximation of when the due date is looming. However, if you aren't sure of the timeline, there are other means to recognize that labor may be near. Some of the signs include:Your cat is actively looking for secluded areas for nesting.
Your cat is less active and losing appetite.
A drop in body temperature.
Frequent licking of belly and genital area.

, It is essential that your cat is comfortable and safe for the birthing process. This includes bringing them indoors so they aren't exposed to harsh elements, but also creating a safe and cozy nesting spot where they can give birth and nurse their kittens. If your cat has a current favorite bed or blankets it lays on, move them to a quiet and safe area away from busy traffic of the house.Create a nesting area. This can simply be a large cardboard box that is lined with her own bed or sheets, The mom will likely begin to situate herself in a nesting area a day or less before she is ready to give birth. If she chooses her own nesting spot outside of the one you created for her, just accommodate the spot that she chooses by making sure it's safe rather than trying to move her.

Dry the kittens with a warm, dry towel.,
Place the kittens into a makeshift nest that is warm and dry.,
Leave the kittens’ umbilical cords intact.,
Keep the room temperature between 85-90°F (29-32°C).,
Consider seeking help from your veterinarian or local animal shelter.,
Get kitten-safe milk if the mother-cat is unavailable.,
Prep your kittens' environment and food.,
Position the kitten on her belly if you're feeding her yourself.,

Make sure the kittens get their mother’s colostrum, if possible.,
Help each kitten get her mother's milk, if necessary.,
Stick to a healthy feeding schedule.,
Use a syringe with kittens who won't feed.,
Stimulate the kitten to empty her bladder or bowels.,
Keep the kittens’ environment clean.",How to Take Care of Premature Newborn Kittens," A good mother-cat will lick the newborn to remove the birth membranes – this helps dry the kitten and stimulate her to breathe, which is important for premature kittens. If the mother is not able to perform this task, gently dry each kitten in turn in a soft, warm, dry towel. Rub her with small circular movements so as to mimic licking, and continue until her coat is dry.Keep all the kittens together because their mutual body heat will help protect against chilling.
A premature kitten has a large surface area to volume ratio and is therefore prone to rapid cooling. This is disastrous because a kitten cannot control her own body temperature and a cold kitten with quickly stop feeding, become moribund and die.;
, Your premature kittens are going to want to snuggle up to one another to keep warm. Get a box that is big enough for all of them and line it with towels and a heating pad or hot pack.Make sure the heating pad doesn't come into direct contact with the kittens or else their delicate skin may get burnt. Place it under a layer of towels so the kittens can still feel the warmth, but don't risk hurting themselves.

, There is no need to cut the umbilical cord on a kitten or to remove the remnants of placenta dangling from each kitten's umbilicus. Leave the umbilical cord and the placenta. They will dry out, shrivel up, and fall off within the first 7-10 days of life.


Cutting the placenta can lead to hemorrhage, hernias, or even introduce infection into the navel, which could prove fatal to the kitten.

, A premature kitten cannot move away from, or towards, heat. Therefore it is of vital importance that you provide the correct temperature. For the first three weeks of life the newborn should have a body temperature of 96-100°F (35-37°C). To achieve this temperature, keep the ambient room temperature between 85-90°F (29-32°C).


Lower the temperature to 80°F (27°C) in the second to third week of life. By this time the kittens will have more control over their body temperature.Rather than heating your entire house to this temperature, heat one room of your house and designate it as the kittens' room.
Provide additional warmth in the nest, too. This can take the form of a heating pad or a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel. Fill the hot water bottle with boiling water but make sure the kitten cannot have direct contact with the hot water bottle since she may be burnt by it.It is possible to overheat a kitten. If this happens, her ears will appear flushed red and she will feel hotter than normal to the touch. Hot kittens appear distressed and may vocalize it. If she is able to move, she will not stay still because she will want to move to a cooler spot.

, Bottle feeding kittens on your own is a demanding task. You will need to feed the kittens every 1-2 hours around the clock for the first week of their life. This is necessary to give the kittens the best chance of survival.Don’t be afraid to ask for help from your veterinarian or local animal shelter. They may be able to provide a surrogate mother cat or connect you with volunteers who have experience with bottle feeding newborn kittens. Some organizations may even be able to provide you with free supplies to help you care for the kittens.

, A young kitten can only digest milk from the mother-cat. If the mother cat has abandoned her kittens, you will need to feed the kittens a cat-milk replacement. Cow's milk is not suitable because it contains lactose which many cats cannot digest and it will give them diarrhea.In an emergency situation, goat's milk is unlikely to cause harm and will stop a newborn from getting dehydrated.Cat-milk replacement formula is available via the internet or from your local veterinarian. These formulas are an exact replica of the balance of fats, proteins and vitamins found in a queen's milk. They come in powdered form and are reconstituted with boiled water, in much the same way that human milk replacers are.
Always make each feed up fresh prior to use, since the high fat content encourages bacterial growth and quickly becomes contaminated.

, Make sure the kitten is warm – a chilled kitten will not be able to digest milk which will then curdle in her stomach and make her ill. Make up sufficient milk replacement for that feed and place it in a clean, sterilized feeding bottle. Special feeders for premature kittens are available, which have the advantage of being a convenient small size so they are easy to use with tiny kittens and don't waste milk.A premature kitten has a lot in common with a cold-blooded animal – if the room is chilly she cannot generate a high enough temperature for the enzymes of digestion to work.

, Place the kitten on her belly, in a similar way that she would suckle from the mother. It can help the kitten to find the teat if you first put a drop of milk on the tip and touch it to her lips. If the kitten still will not suckle, try stroking its head and back to encourage it to feed. When the kitten starts to make a sucking noise, try to offer the nipple again.Allow her to suckle until her belly is nicely rounded, but not bloated and tight. You can check this by feeling to see if her tummy is wider than her ribcage – if it is then her stomach is full and she has had sufficient feed for now. Many kittens will fall asleep on the teat when their tummy is full. If this happens, gently remove the teat from her mouth and place her back in the warm nest.

, Kittens need to be burped after a formula feeding, so you will have to do this yourself. To burp a kitten, place it over your shoulder on its stomach and gently pat it on the back. Keep patting until you feel or hear a burp.Make sure that you use a damp towel to clean off any formula that the kitten burps up.

, Shortly after giving birth, the mother-cat produces special milk called colostrum, which is high in antibodies. These are immune complexes that help to protect the kitten against diseases that the mother has encountered, similar to a vaccination. The colostrum strengthens the kittens and may even improve their chances of survival.Colostrum is also rich in the vitamins and minerals that kittens need for normal growth and development.

, A strong kitten will latch onto the nipple when placed against it, and start to suck. A weak kitten may need some help. To do this try expressing a drop of milk/colostrum from the nipple, and touch her mouth to the milk so as to get a taste and encourage her to latch on.The rear teats tend to produce the most milk. When expressing colostrum, chose a rear teat and gently place the fore-finger and thumb of your dominant hand just behind the nipple. With a gentle squeezing-pulling action travel the finger and thumb to towards the teat. Do this repeatedly and oftentimes the dam will release milk.
Make sure they feed often. A premature kitten is entirely dependent on her mother's milk for nutrition. She feeds little and often, with a newborn feeding as frequently as every 1-2 hours.

, Premature kittens have tiny stomachs which can only hold a small volume of milk at any one time, so they need to eat often to get the nutrition that they need. This means that each kitten will suckle for five to ten minutes every 1-2 hours – night and day! To be successful hand raising kittens there are no short cuts and each one must be fed every 1-2 hours for the first week of its life. Here is a sample feeding schedule:1-3 days old — feed 2.5ml of milk replacer every 1-2 hours
4-7 days — feed 2.5–5 milliliters (0.08–0.2  fl oz) every 2 hours
6-10 days — feed 5 – 7.5ml, every 2-3 hours
11-14 days — feed 10-12.5 ml every 3 hours
15-21 days — feed 10 ml every 3 hours
21 days to 6 weeks — feed 12.5-25 ml, every 6-8 hours in addition to a normal diet

You will know if a kitten is still hungry because she will cry, and hunt around for the teat as if unsettled.



, Some premature kittens have a weak suckling reflex and don't find it easy to suckle from a teat. If this, gently open her mouth by inserting a fingertip between her upper and lower lips. Using a syringe loaded with milk replacer, drip one drop of milk at a time onto her tongue. Allow it to trickle back and trigger her swallowing reflex.


Time and patience is crucial since this process cannot be rushed. Never do more than a few drops in at a time, since larger volumes may run down into her windpipe before she has a chance to swallow. This could cause the kitten to drown., Young kittens cannot empty their bladder or bowels on their own until their second or third week of life. Instead they hold onto their toilet until the mother licks their anus and genital area which stimulates them to defecate and urinate. You will need to stimulate this reflex using moistened cotton balls. Use the following process:Use a cotton wool ball moistened with warm water to gently wipe the kitten's bottom.
As you wipe the kitten’s bottom, the kitten should soil the cotton wool.
After the kitten has urinated or defecated, discard the cotton ball in the trash.
Use another moistened cotton ball if necessary.
Dry off the kitten’s bottom with a clean dry towel before putting the kitten back into its nest.
Repeat this process 3 or 4 times a day, washing your hands after each time. The kittens should defecate once per day and urinate each time you use this process. If they do not urinate every time, then they may not be getting enough water., Kittens may become sick if they are exposed to germs and this can be a major threat to their survival Always wash your hands with soap and water before handling the kittens. You may also want to keep a clean shirt handy to put on over your everyday clothes prior to picking the kittens up so as to reduce the risk of contamination from the outside world.Take care to sterilize all bottles and teats between uses to decrease the risk of infection, too. To do this, use a sterilizing product designed for human baby bottles, like Milton solution. Or, if you have access to a steam sterilizer, this can also work well.
Change the kittens’ bedding every day. Kittens may soil their bedding or throw up sometimes, so it is a good idea to change the kittens’ bedding every day.

Deworm the cat and kittens.",How to Take Care of Nursing Cats," Mother cats will typically lose weight while nursing their kittens. To prevent the cat from losing too much weight, you should begin feeding her more than normal in the final third of her pregnancy. Feeding her too much before the last third of a cat's pregnancy can lead to her become overweight and that can make giving birth more difficult.


A mother cat's body weight may have increased by 40 to 50% by the end of her pregnancy.;
, After your cat gives birth, you should continue to feed it more than she typically eats. She will need more calories, since she is now providing energy to her kittens by nursing them. The exact amount of food a nursing cat needs will vary in proportion to its litter size.Cats nursing more than two kittens typically need 2 to 2.5 times more calories than usual.
A 10-pound cat nursing 4 kittens needs approximately 603 calories per day. A 15-pound cat nursing 4 kittens needs approximately 851 calories per day.

, Giving your cat the opportunity to graze at will can be the easiest way of ensuring that she gets adequate nutrition. Leave her food dish full and freely available at all times. Wet food is best, since it may be higher in protein. However, if your cat is used to dry food, or if the wet food spoils too quickly, let her have free access to dry food as well., Not all cat foods are created equal. Look for a cat food that specifically provides nutritional support for lactating cats, or one formulated for cats at all stages of life. To ensure quality, you can also look for a cat food that has been certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)., A nursing cat will need lots of protein to keep herself healthy, and to provide nutrition to her kittens. Quality cat food will normally provide enough protein. However, if her kittens are especially noisy or mobile, it can be a sign that the mother is not getting enough protein.If in doubt, feed kitten-food to the mother cat while she is nursing. Kitten food is higher in calories, calcium, and protein.

, Most kittens will nurse for an average of 8 weeks. However, you or their mother can start introducing solid food at about 5 weeks. The kittens may mostly play with the food at first, but will eventually begin to eat more of it., If the kittens look or feel unusually thin, or are very vocal, it may be a sign that their mother is having trouble producing milk, or that they just aren’t getting enough. Commercial cat milk replacements are available, however, and can be fed to kittens using a bottle, dropper, or other method. Talk to your veterinarian if you are concerned about the kittens’ nutrition, and for milk replacement recommendations if necessary., A mother cat will need a place to set up a nest for its kittens, and will probably start looking for one while still pregnant. You can offer her a spare bedroom, an unused closet, or a carrier—even a box is fine. The most important thing is that the space is quiet, safe, and free from disruptions or dangers (other pets, traffic, etc.)., Lay towels or a blanket down in the cat’s nesting site. After the cat has its kittens, you will need to change the bedding regularly. You will likely need to change it daily at first, but in general, do it as often as necessary to keep the nest dry and clean.Lay several layers of towels down at a time. Remove a wet or dirty one to reveal a new, clean layer beneath it. This will make the process faster and easier.

, In the wild, mother cats may move their kittens around frequently as a way to protect them from predators. Don’t be alarmed if your cat wants to pick her kittens up and move them to a different location, as long as it is a safe one., At first, your cat will be very protective of her kittens. Gradually, however, you can start to touch, play with, and pick up the kittens. Handling the kittens will get them more used to humans, and help with transitioning them away from their mother., Kittens infested with fleas are at risk of flea anemia. However, flea treatments should be given only to the mother, and never to the kittens. Typical flea treatments are not intended for young kittens. If you want recommendations on how to deal with a flea problem, contact a veterinarian.Changing bedding frequently can help reduce potential flea problems.
If you do see fleas on the kittens, give them a bath in a solution of mild, non-antibacterial dishwashing liquid and warm water. Remove the fleas using a flea comb. Dry the kittens well after the bath.

, Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are diseases that can affect a variety of cats. One way that these diseases can be spread is by a mother transmitting them to her kittens via her milk. You can bring the kittens to a vet at about 1-2 weeks of age for an inspection, and for treatment if necessary. Testing the mother for FeLV and FIV beforehand can indicate how likely the kittens are to contract these diseases., Hookworms, roundworms, and tapeworms can be a problem for some cats and kittens. See your vet about the best methods and schedules for deworming yours, if necessary."

Foster a dog.,
Adopt a dog.,
Host an adoption event.",How to Help Dogs in Need2," An excellent way to find a dog a good home is to foster it in the meantime. Foster owners or families provide dogs with a temporary home, food, water, socialization, basic grooming, and exercise until it is ready for a forever home. Foster animals are typically sick, injured, or juvenile, so instructions provided by the shelter for its care must be followed precisely. Call the ASPCA, Humane Society, or a local shelter to inquire about their foster programs, or apply online to foster a pet.For example, the ASPCA in New York accepts serious fostering candidates over 21 years of age, provides training, and eventually finds homes for the animals being fostered., If you are ready to accept a new pet into your home, adopting a dog in need is the most personal way to help. Visit your local shelter to get to know adoptable dogs, or look online for listings of available dogs in your area. Visit http://www.aspca.org/adopt-pet/adoptable-dogs-your-local-shelter to search by state, and by sex and breed of dogs.


Other popular websites, such as petfinder.com, provide listings of adoptable pets from reputable adoption groups.

, To hold an adoption drive, approach one or more local shelters or rescue groups and see how many adoptable dogs you will be dealing with. Pick a date and time, find a venue, plan a budget, and purchase necessary supplies (e.g. folding tables and chairs, trash bags and trash cans, cleaning supplies). Ask local business owners for contributions to the event, ask the rescue organizations for flyers or advertising templates, and share the event with the public on social media.Recruit volunteers for the event through social media, word of mouth, flyers, and by contacting large organizations (e.g. church groups, volunteer organizations, schools).

Remove small spots.,
Prepare a bath.,
Rub dish soap into their fur.,
Rinse out the soap.,
Dry the cat with a towel.",How to Remove Paint from a Cat's Fur2," If the spot is small or limited to one area, you may be able to remove it without bathing the cat entirely. Wet the fur by pouring a small cup of water over the spot. You can also dampen it with a wet washcloth. Rub dish soap into the spot. Rinse out by pouring more water over the paint until it has been removed entirely. Towel dry the cat.


Hold the cat firmly with one hand to keep them still while you clean. If possible, have another person hold the cat while you wash them.If the cat tries to escape, gently pull them back.
If the cat tries to wriggle away or scratch you, you may need to restrain them with a towel. Wrap the towel around their feet and body. Try to leave the painted areas unwrapped so that you can wash off the paint., If your cat is covered with multiple paint stains or if the mess is extensive, you may need to prepare a full bath. Fill a bathtub or sink with a few inches of warm water. As you bring your cat to the bath, pet them and talk to them soothingly.


If you have a sink with a spray nozzle, you do not need to fill the sink, but rather, you can use the spray nozzle to wet and rinse them.Put some cotton in the cat’s ears before placing them in the bath to prevent water from going inside.
Placing a towel or rubber bath mat on the bottom of the basin can help prevent your cat from slipping.This will also give them something to grip onto if they are nervous during the bath.
If you’re worried about being scratched, you may want to trim their nails before you bathe them.

, Once the cat is in the bath, wet them by pouring or spraying water over their body. Do not try to wash their head or face. Take the dish soap or a cat shampoo, and massage it into the cat’s fur.The paint should start coming loose and running off at this point.


Do not use human shampoo, as this can irritate the cat’s skin.
Do not use any soap on the cat’s head or face. If there is paint on the cat’s head or face, try to gently remove it with a damp wash cloth., Take a cup or pitcher, and fill it with water from the bath. Starting with the neck behind your cat’s head and moving towards their tail, pour the water over their body. Try not to get the cat’s head wet. Do this a few times until all of the soap and the paint has been rinsed from their fur.


If you have a spray nozzle, you can simply run the water over the cat’s fur.
If paint still remains after you rinse, try reapplying the dish soap, and wash them a second time.

, Once the cat is clean, remove them from the bath, and wrap them in a towel immediately. Soak up as much as water as you can with the towel. If you want, you can set a hairdryer to its lowest heat and air settings. Gently blow the cat dry."

Trim off the paint.,
Rub cooking oil into the paint.,
Bathe your cat.",How to Remove Paint from a Cat's Fur3," If your cat only has a few, targeted spots on their fur, trimming is the easiest way to remove it. Let the paint harden first. Using a pair of nail scissors, gently cut the paint patches away. Try to remove as much of the paint from the cat’s fur as possible.If you manage to trim off all of the paint, you do not need to do anything else.
Be careful not to cut too close to the cat’s skin. If you are having difficulty trimming the fur or if your cat is wiggling, you may want to skip to using oils to remove the paint.

, If the paint is deep into the cat’s fur or if it covers a larger spot, you can use vegetable or mineral oils to get it out. Pour a little into your hand, and work it into the paint spots.Use a paper towel to pat out excess oil.It may take a few tries to get all of the paint out. Keep rubbing in oil and gently patting it away until all of the paint is removed.
Do not use turpentine or harsh paint removers. These can burn and irritate a cat's skin.

, The oil will loosen and help you remove most of the paint by hand. That said, you should bathe your cat after this process to make sure that all of the oil and paint is gone.Run a lukewarm bath, and wash the cat with a cat shampoo. Towel dry afterwards.

Observe and know about the delivery process.,
Keep an eye out for ways to help.,
Be prepared to call a vet for emergencies.",How to Take Care of a Pregnant Cat2," Giving birth is a very natural process for a cat and something that she is built to experience alone. Therefore, you won't need to directly intervene unless there are signs that the pregnancy is going awry. Learn the stages of birthing so you can better be equipped to know what is natural.The first stage of labor lasts about 36 hours, and will typically be shorter if the cat has previously had kittens. During this period your cat will visit her nesting spot regularly but also have intermittent contractions with signs of strain. Late in this stage, panting and scratching at the nesting area may increase.
The second stage will last anywhere from five to thirty minutes for each kitten. There will be stronger contractions and each kitten will be pushed out by active straining of the mom, usually head first. The mom will break the bag and chew the cord herself for each kitten and will require no additional assistance.
The third and final stage will find the mom passing a placenta membranes and mass for each kitten. The mother cat will eat the placentas so as to hide the evidence that she gave birth. The entire process should happen within four to six hours. If it lasts longer than this, you should call a vet for help.

, Although most deliveries happen without any problem, you'll want to know what to watch for and how to act in case of a worst case scenario.If a kitten is only partly out and the mother seems to be tired and given up on pushing, you can gently help the kitten ease out but you must be very gentle.
If the mother does not bite through the cord, you can help by tying off the cord using a clean sewing thread about 3 centimeters from the kitten's body.
If a mother cat does not clean a kitten you can do so by using a clean kitchen towel and gently wiping the kitten. Make sure to clear its mouth and nose of any liquid that might restrict breathing.

, There are complications that can happen during a pregnancy that should only be handled by a vet. If you notice any of these situations, you should immediately call a vet:If the cat is straining for longer than 30 minutes without producing anything. There could be an obstruction preventing a natural birth, putting the mother and kittens in danger.
If there is a period of an hour or more between the first kitten and subsequent births.
If the cat suddenly appears weak and unable to continue with labor.
The presence of excessive blood during birth without a kitten. Greenish afterbirth is common, but without a kitten can be a signal for a problem.
Keep an eye out for kittens who cannot be dislodged using gentle force. A Caesarean Section may be needed in these cases and a vet should be consulted.

"

Keep monitoring nutrition.,
Keep the mother cat and kitten warm.,
Look out for post-birth complications.",How to Take Care of a Pregnant Cat3," Your cat will now need to care for her kittens. Nursing kittens will require that your cat has access to more food, sometimes as much as double, and continue wth a high protein/calcium diet. Continue to feed your cat a high protein kitten food and always provide access to clean water., The mother should use her body heat to keep the kittens warm. However, you'll also want to make sure her environment makes this as easy as possible. Keep warm blankets near her and the room temperature high.


If the mother is being inattentive to the kittens, you can provide a heating pad on low to help keep the babies warm.
Make sure the kittens and mom remain in a calm place where she will not feel threatened. This can cause a danger to the kittens and the mom.

, Your cat still may have problems after the birthing process is done. If you notice vaginal bleeding, or a prolapsed uterus (a uterus pushed out through the vagina), you should consult your vet. Also look for:Look out for atypical behavior, such as ignoring the kittens. She may reject the kittens, or if she feels in enough danger, she may even kill the litter.
Keep an eye out for inflamed mammary glands. Infected glands will become enlarged, hot to the touch, and may even appear a different color.
Watch for changes in appetite. If your cat is not getting enough nutrients this can endanger both her and the kittens. If an extended period goes by and your cat is unwilling to eat, take her to a vet.

Accept certain cats simply meow more than others.",How to Understand the Cat's Meow," Cat's meows can be confusing as they may meow for a variety of different reasons. While a cat may meow to get your attention, it may also meow as a warning. You can pay attention to your cat's body language to help read the meowing.Pay attention to how your cat reacts to you when it is meowing. Does it arch its back and rub up against you? Does it reach its head up to meet your hand when you reach down to pet it? If so, your cat may be meowing because it wants your affection.
Conversely, meowing may be a sign of aggression or fear. If your cat cowers when meowing, and ducks away from your touch, it may be meowing because it's distressed.;
, Your cat may meow while engaging in other behaviors. These behaviors may indicate the cat wants something. It may be trying to get you to do something.For example, if your cat is meowing while running to the kitchen, it wants to be fed. If your cat is meowing by the door to your bedroom, it wants to go in the bedroom.
Cats often signal what they need in other ways while they meow. If you pay attention to what your cat is doing while it meows, you may be able to figure out why it is meowing.

, Cats may meow at specific points in the day. This can help you pinpoint the reason for the meowing. Meowing that occurs near dinner time, for example, probably means your cat wants food. Meowing that occurs when you first get home is probably a greeting.You should also pay attention to where your cat is when it meows. Cats dislike being alone for long periods. If your cat meows when it's alone in a room, it may be meowing out of loneliness., Meowing is often the expression of a benign emotion or need. However, meowing can be in response to stress. Think about any recent changes to your home. Consider whether these could be the cause of your cat's meowing.Cats may get stressed in response to a recent move, a new pet, a new baby, or any other big changes. If your household has undergone major changes recently, your cat may be meowing out of stress.
If you can adjust the cause of the stress, this may cut back on the meowing. For example, if your cat dislikes its new bed, switching back to an old bed can help. However, some changes, like a recent move, cannot be undone. In this case, give your cat extra love and attention as it adjusts to the changes.

, If your cat has not been fixed, meowing is often hormonal. Female cats will yowl in heat in attempt to find mates. Male cats will yowl if they smell a female in heat nearby. As such noise can be frustrating to live with, consider spaying or neutering your cat to cut back on unwanted meowing., If your cat is getting older, it may meow more. A cat may meow if it becomes confused due to deteriorating senses. It may be a good idea to have an elderly cat evaluated by a vet to make sure it does not have any major health problems causing excessive meowing., The duration of the meow may indicate what the cat is trying to express. Shorter meows tend to indicate your cat wants something, such as food or attention. Longer, drawn out meows, especially if they're throatier in nature, tend to indicate your cat is annoyed or stressed by something.A long and very drawn out moaning noise is almost always an indication of distress. If you hear your cat yowling, you should check in on it to make sure it's okay.
The frequency of meowing can also indicate what your cat is communicating. Many meows fired off in quick succession usually indicate your cat is trying to get your attention.

, You can tell a lot about a cat's meow by tuning into tone. You may hear purring or rumbling noises alongside a meow. This usually indicate a happy meow. Squeaky meows, or meows that sound like chirps, usually indicate your cat is happy to see you.In rare occasions, purring can actually indicate distress. Focus on your cat's body language when it purrs. If your cat seems tense, and is keeping its ears back, it may be purring out of distress.

, If a cat clicks its teeth when meowing, making a kind of chattering sound, this is usually an indication of predatory excitement. A cat may chatter when looking at a bird outside or stalking a small bug in your home. A chatter can also indicate distress. If your cat is chattering out the window, for example, it may be frustrated it cannot get at a bird or other prey., Cats often meow if they're injured or in pain. Long, shrill yowling meows may indicate something wrong. Very loud meows can also be an indication of stress or pain. Excessive yowling, with no identifiable cause, should be evaluated by a vet., Meowing should never be entirely ignored. You do not want to encourage excessive meowing, but you should always check to make sure your cat does not need anything if you hear it meowing. A cat may, for example, be trapped in a room or be unable to reach its litter boxes. You should make sure your cat is not in need when you hear it meowing., Never scold, hit, or punish a cat in any way for meowing. If you want your cat to not meow for breakfast in the morning, ignore the behavior instead of punishing it.Cats do not respond well to punishment. A cat is unlikely to realize why it is being punished and will only become stressed. If you punish your cat for meowing, it can create a stressful environment that can lead to other behavioral problems.

, Your cat may start meowing excessively suddenly. In this case, take it to a vet immediately. Unexplained meowing can often be a sign your cat is injured or sick. You should never ignore unusual meowing in a cat that's normally quiet., If you're dealing with a new cat, you may be confused by excessive meowing. If the meowing does not sound distressed or frightened, it is probably okay. Certain cats are simply more vocal than others. Your new cat may simply feel the need to communicate through meowing more frequently."

See if you can guess what it was like to be him.,
Comprehend what he goes through.,

Love your cat.",How to Understand a Cat," Is he a stray? Did you breed him yourself? Where did you get him? Find what your cat's life was like before you received him. You can ask the previous owner, the doctor, or the people who work at the Animal Shelter.;
, If he was a stray, try to imagine how lonely and terrifying it must have been. When doing this, you will be able to see his world through his own eyes.

, For example, if you accidentally step on his tail and he bites you, don't yell at him. You are the one, after all, who hurt him in the first place. Before you got him, he might have been stepped on and it could have really, really hurt him. In other words, understand what's he's going through, being your cat. Put yourself in him position.

, Don't scream at him hour after hour if he breaks something. Realize that he's just a cat. It's not his fault. Even if it was your favorite vase brought here all the way from Brazil, that's what you get for having a cat. You're the one keeping him in captivity, so know that it's not his problem: it's yours. There's nothing else to say.

, This is a pretty broad step, but it has to be added. Your cat is your cat. Treat him like it. You are 50 times bigger than he is, and he is forced to live with you, so treat him as your family. Treat him as a fine guest in your household, and let him know through your actions that you never, ever, ever, want him to leave.

Set consistent boundaries.,
Look for signs of play aggression.,

Use tools to discourage bad behavior.,
Call the experts.",How to Teach a Kitten to Play Nice," A kitten should be kept with its littermates and mother for at least 12 weeks. A kitten can learn how to play nice most effectively from its mother and its siblings, so you need to give it time to get this education. When playing with its siblings or nursing from its mother, the kitten learns how hard it can bite before the others respond negatively and stop the behavior.A kitten that it taken away from its mother and siblings too soon will not have the advantage of this important teaching and learning period.;
, A kitten needs to play and explore the boundaries of acceptable behavior. In particular, stalking and attacking are behaviors every kitten will likely want to explore because they are part of the cat's innate prey drive. However, you need to teach your kitten that these are things it can do with toys and not with people. In order to do this, you will need to provide toys that satisfy this drive.


A great toy that allows you to interact with your kitten and allows it to pounce, chew, and attack is a fishing pole type toy. These are typically sticks with a string attached to the end. At the end of the string is a toy that will grab the kittens attention. If you move the stick around, the toy will move and the kitten can try to attack it., If the kitten wants to wrestle around, you should not use your hands and arm to do that. Instead, get a small toy, such as a stuffed animal that is a similar size to the kitten, and rub that on the kitten's belly to promote wrestling with that toy.Allowing the kitten to wrestle with a toy instead of your hands will decrease the likelihood that the cat will clamp onto your hands and arms in the future when it is feeling feisty and wanting to wrestle.

, While it may be cute in the short term to allow your kitten to pounce on your feet or hands when you move them, this sets the stage for this behavior to continue long term. Remember, behavior that you are reinforcing in your kitten is likely to continue for the cat's whole life.Instead, give your cat lots of toys and allow it to pounce and chew on those instead of your body parts.
A small kitten's bite on your hands or feet won't hurt much, but at the kitten gets bigger its jaw will get stronger and those bites will get more painful.

, If the kitten begins to bite you or wrestle with you aggressively, you need to stop that behavior every time it happens. Having clear boundaries for nice play versus aggressive play is important when teaching the kitten the rules of behavior.Disengage whenever the kitten bites or plays too roughly. This sets limits and will eventually help stop the behavior.
Without these consistent boundaries, the kitten will have no way of knowing what it acceptable and not acceptable from day to day.

, Some kittens will get too riled up and move from innocent playing to aggression. If your kitten is doing this, then that behavior needs to be curbed before it becomes habit. In order to curb it, you need to be able to identify the signs of this type of aggression and disengage from play when they begins.Look for the kittens tail to be moving back and forth in a controlled manner, the ears to flatten down, and the pupils to begin dilating. If these things are happening, you need to disengage from play right away.
If your kitten continues to stalk and attack even after you disengage from play, leave the room until the kitten calms down.
In many cases you can also shock the kitten out of this state by making a loud noise, such as clapping your hands or dropping something on the ground.

, If you want to teach your kitten how to play nice you need to set boundaries with it. If the kitten is getting too excited during playtime and it goes to bite or scratch you, you need to let it know that this behavior is not okay. You can do this by ending playtime at that point and walking away.With repetition, the kitten will learn that the fun times end when it is too aggressive, and so they will avoid that behavior.

, A consistent verbal command is another way to let your kitten know that it has crossed a line behavior wise. This should not be an aggressive or mad sounding command but it should be done in an assertive in tone.However, you should never use physical punishment or lash out in anger at a kitten that is not playing nice. This is likely to make the kitten fearful, which can lead to larger behavior problems down the line.

, There are ways you can discourage bad behavior in addition to disengaging and saying ""no."" Try keeping a laser pointer or other toy in your pocket, for instance. You can use these to redirect any rough play away from you and to the toy. If your kitten is stalking and pouncing on you from under furniture, put a safety collar with a bell on it on the kitten. This will let you know what the kitten is doing and will allow you to stop the behavior before it escalates.

, Talk to a specialist if you’re tried all of the above and continue to have trouble with your kitten. Start with your vet. Even if they're not an expert in animal behavior, your vet can still point you to someone who is.

Ask your vet for about feline behaviorists in your area, for example. You might also try looking for resources at the local humane society.
Try to address behavior issues quickly, while the kitten is still young. This gives you the best shot at preventing a long-term problem.

Interact with the cat in a small room.,
Set up places for your cat to hide.,
Give the cat time to explore its surroundings.",How to Socialize a Fearful Cat1," Cats will naturally feel more comfortable in an enclosed space, without any loud sounds or distractions. Sit in a small room with your cat (perhaps a bedroom or a laundry room). The cat will likely hide at first, but if you sit quietly, it will eventually build up the confidence to approach you.You may also find the cat watching you intently. This is normal; fearful cats will make sure that their surroundings are calm and safe before they emerge.;
, Your cat may be anxious and afraid of its surroundings. To help it feel more confident and secure, make sure the cat has places to which it can retreat and observe the world around it. You can assist by giving your cat places to hide.These don’t need to be anything fancy, and require little work on your part. For example:


Set a cardboard box on its side so the cat can crawl in.
Pull a sofa or dresser out from the wall by about 6 inches so your cat can crawl behind it.
Purchase and set up a “cat tree” that the cat can perch on top of.

, You’ll need to be patient while socializing a fearful cat, since this is the only way it will overcome its shyness and build confidence. If you live in a house or an apartment, let your cat wander at its leisure. Be careful not to make unexpected loud noises or do anything to frighten the cat, as these occurrences will only reinforce its fear.At first, the cat may primarily hide and only emerge when you’re asleep. Over time, though, your cat will build up its confidence and will interact with you more frequently.

Learn what your cat's meows mean.,
Understand your cat's purring.,
Learn what your cat is trying to communicate when it hisses or growls.",How to Understand Your Cat's Behavior1," Everyone is familiar with the cat’s meow. This all-purpose “talk” can mean many things, but primarily it means “pay attention to me as I want something from you.” Your cat may want food, attention, petting or may even be signaling that it doesn't want to be touched. Cat owners soon learn to interpret the nuances of their cat’s meowing knowing precisely what’s on their cat’s mind.


After spending some time with your cat, you should be able to understand the difference between your cats meows depending on a variety of variables, such as the time of day or the location of your cat when it meows.;
, Purring is another familiar cat vocalization. While not all cats purr when they are happy, it is a good sign if you are actively petting your cat and it begins to purr. Just don't be discouraged if your cat never purrs, it might just not be in its vocabulary.


Contented cats purr, but cats in distress have also been known to purr. It is believed that purring in these situations, such as when a cat is ill, is a way for the cat to “call” for help.

, Hissing and growling is understood to mean that a cat is afraid and/or angry. NEVER pick up a hissing or growling cat, as it may display aggression and bite you. Leave hissing or growling cats alone if you can or approach them cautiously with a thick towel and leather gloves if you absolutely need to pick them up.

Wait for the cat to approach.,
Move to a comfortable area.,
Get down to the cat's level.,
Pet the cat.",How to Greet a Cat1," When you are near a cat that you are friendly with (e.g. your own, or a close friend's cat) wait for it to approach you. Even cats that are normally friendly have days when they do not wish to be disturbed. Wait for it to demonstrate signs of affection (e.g. rubbing up against your leg) before greeting it., To properly greet a friendly cat, move to an area where you can settle in to pet, play, or cuddle the cat. Move away from the doorway, which could provide an unplanned exit for an excited cat. A cat will develop positive associations with whatever happy greeting spot you choose., Sit or kneel on the ground to allow the cat to greet you on its own level. The cat may want to rub noses with you, which is a bonding exercise and a sign of affection. You cat may also be comfortable greeting you from a high spot (e.g. the top of the couch, a tall windowsill)., Once a cat is comfortable with you, feel free to pet it gently. Start with the back and neck, spots that most cats enjoy being pet. Avoid petting the cat's tail, which is a sensitive area and may evoke a negative reaction."

Lure your cat close to you with treats.,
Play with the cat.,
Sit near the cat when you feed it.,
Pet the cat while it’s eating.,
Do not stare at your cat.",How to Socialize a Fearful Cat2," Even the most shy or fearful of cats will still have an interest in food and treats. Sit calmly on the ground holding a treat in your hand, and extend your hand towards your cat. Be patient, and the cat should cautiously approach your hand. Let the cat sniff, nibble, and eat the treat. This will help socialize the cat by allowing it to have a positive interaction with you.Of course, cats are notoriously picky eaters, and yours may not enjoy every variety of treat. If the cat doesn’t seem to want the treat you’re offering, buy another flavor, and try again.

, As the cat begins to warm up to you and to become more comfortable in your presence, you can start to socialize it through play. Use a toy that allows the cat to keep its distance from you, such as a long ribbon or a “fishing pole” toy with a toy mouse or fish on the end. Wiggle the ribbon or toy on the floor to catch the cat’s interest. Once it catches on, flick the toy around the room for the cat to chase.Keep the pace of the play slow at first; if you become too agitated and loud, or move too quickly, you may startle the cat and cause it to run away.
Be patient, and allow the cat to play and interact with you at its own pace.

, Although the cat may have constant access to kibble, you can feed it a special treat, like wet canned food or tuna fish. A couple of times during the day, place a dish of wet food or tuna on the floor near your cat. Even if the cat is hiding, it will likely emerge to eat before long. Sit by the food while the cat is eating; this will help the animal become used to your presence.Socializing your fearful cat by feeding it wet food will help the cat form positive associations between you and the food. This will help to decrease its fear.
Make sure that the cat always has plenty of water. Although there may be points where you take away the cat’s food (e.g. once it’s finished eating), you should never take away water.

, If your cat has been hesitant to allow you to touch it, or seems skittish around you, you can initiate physical contact while it’s eating. The cat will be happy and relaxed while eating, and petting it then will let the cat form positive associations between your touch and the food. Slowly reach towards your cat and begin to lightly stroke its fur. Begin by petting the cat on its back, and use a light, slow touch.When you reach out to pet your shy cat, do not reach directly toward the cat’s face. This will startle the animal, and it may be perceived as a sign of aggression. Instead, reach from behind the cat.

, While you may be staring at your cat out of interest, or trying to pique its curiosity, it may be seen as a sign of hostility by your cat. Direct eye contact between cats is a sign of aggression, and may indicate that the aggressor is about to attack.If you find yourself having eye contact with your fearful cat, blink your eyes slowly. This is a sign of love or trust between felines. The gesture will communicate compassion, rather than aggression, to your cat.
You may also make eye contact with your cat when bringing it food, water, a treat, or toys. Your association with these pleasant objects will lead the cat to trust you and become less shy.

"

Positively reinforce the cat’s behavior.,
Avoid negative reinforcement.,
Socialize your cat with new people.,
Introduce the cat to other pets.",How to Socialize a Fearful Cat3," When your cat does something you want to encourage (e.g. going to the bathroom in a litter box, scratching on a scratching post), you can praise the cat verbally, pet it, or give the cat a treat. This will socialize the cat by encouraging it to continue the behavior, and will help it to feel more comfortable around you.Make sure that you praise the cat immediately after it performs the behavior you want to reinforce.


Your fearful cat will take cues from your attitude and body language, and will be more likely to repeat behaviors that you have praised or rewarded it for.

, Since your cat is already fearful or shy, giving it negative reinforcement in the form of punishments or verbal chastisements will only deepen its fear. Your cat may also come to associate you with negative consequences, and avoid you altogether.Never shout or yell at your cat, and never punish it.


Additionally, cats tend not to learn from negative reinforcement, so it has little value as a training technique.

, Once your cat is comfortable in your presence and no longer acts shy, you can begin to introduce new people—e.g. your friends and family—to the cat. Let the cat approach and smell the new person as soon as they’ve entered your apartment. Give the person one of the cat’s favorite toys or a dish of cat food, so that the cat can gradually begin to interact with the visitor.Make sure to arrange the socialization in a neutral, quiet environment. If the cat is uncomfortable at first, it will retreat to a hiding place, and later emerge to meet the stranger.
Follow similar steps if you would like to socialize your cat with a child. Let the child know that they will need to be quiet and move slowly around the cat, and discourage them from playing aggressively with the cat.

, If you would like to increase your cat’s socialization process to the point at which it can meet other animals (such as friends’ cats and dogs), you’ll need to do so gradually. Shut your cat in a room, and bring the other pet to the outside of the door. Let the animals exchange scents and smell one another under the door. If your cat doesn’t retreat, you can open the door and allow the animals to sniff one another face-to-face.It’s advisable that the new pet be held on a leash, in case it tries to run or attack your cat.


Always bring the other animal to your house or apartment; your cat will feel safer here, and will be less likely to hide from or attack the new animal.
Only introduce the cat to one new animal at a time. Introducing multiple new animals may scare the cat.

Learn to identify when your cat is angry or afraid by paying attention to its body language.,
Understand why a cat rubs up against humans.,
Understand why your cat kneads.",How to Understand Your Cat's Behavior2," A cat will not always growl or hiss at you when it is mad or scared. An angry cat will have dilated pupils and stare at whatever it's angry at. The fur on it’s body will usually also stand on end. The tail may also flick from side to side as it holds it in an upside down U.


In addition, an angry or scared cat may have its ears flattened back.
In contrast, a friendly cat will approach you with its tail up, erect ears, and rub against your legs. It may give a friendly meow or series of meows and may even be purring.

, Cats are affectionate and responsive creatures. To get your attention, cats will often sit close to you or brush up against your legs while meowing. This solicitation for attention is normal cat behavior. It places the cat’s scent on the recipient, helps them bond with you, and probably, although we can’t know for certain, has other significant meanings.When a cat rubs up on a human it’s an important bonding ritual. If your cat is rubbing up against you, don't shoo it away. Let it give you a little love and attention so that
This action, rubbing up against another animal to transfer scents and affection, is called allorubbing when done with another cat.

, This is one particular behavior that leaves some owners scratching their heads. Some cats will “paddle” or “knead” their humans. This behavior is a holdover from when the cat was a kitten. Kittens knead their mother’s mammary glands as they are nursing to get the milk flowing. It is thought to be comforting for a cat to do so on a beloved human being.Kneading can get aggressive if your cat engages its claws while doing it. Be sure to protect yourself if you know that your cat goes overboard when kneading. Try wearing a long sleeved shirt or other protective clothing or have your cat stop when they start injuring you.

Understand cat hierarchies.,
Learn how cats might react to a new cat entering the family.,
Understand the importance of cats relationships with each other.",How to Understand Your Cat's Behavior3," When cats live together they will naturally form some sort of a hierarchy. One cat may be dominant over another. The owner’s may not see this behavior and not understand why cats may have litterbox issues or other behavior issue at first. If watched closely, however, the dominant cat will display signs such as approaching the submissive cat with a stiff gait, erect ears, and elevating the base of the tail. The submissive cat, on the other hand, will look away, lower the ears, and frequently avoid the path of the dominant cat.Having a hierarchy is natural between cats. Just make sure that all of your cats are happy and healthy, no matter where they lay in the pecking order.

, Introducing a new kitten or adult cat to your current cat(s) can take some time. The resident cat or cats will probably see the newcomer as a threat, with much hissing, growling, and attempts at “running off” the intruder. This is normal behavior, but after carefully introductions and repeated exposures they should accept each other and may become good companions., Although cats are said to be solitary animals, they do form bonds with each other. When two cats become close and one is lost or dies, the remaining cat may be depressed for months. A depressed cat may meow constantly or stop eating. Lots of loving and comfort is needed in this case.

Understand that cats show unhappiness or displeasure is a wide variety of ways.,
Make sure the cat's litter box is not causing your cat to urinate elsewhere.,
Look for other reasons for urination misbehavior.,
Understand why a cat scratches objects in your house.",How to Understand Your Cat's Behavior4," Cats are emotional creatures. Cats can feel lonely, bored, frightened, or stressed. They show stress in a variety of ways, from vocalizing to forgetting their toilet habits. By taking the time to observe your cat you, will hopefully begin to see patterns to their behaviors and be able to more fully understand your cat companion.

, Not surprisingly, most cat owners know how important the litterbox is to keeping all family members, including the cat, happy. When a cat stops using the litterbox to urinate, it can become a major issue and may put the cat out of his or her home.


There are many reasons why a cat may fail to use the litter box. It may be as simple as the cat not liking its litter, either the texture or smell. Most cats prefer an unscented litter. An elderly cat may not be able to get into the box due to arthritis. The box may be overly dirty and need to be scooped and cleaned (with soap and water) more frequently. A sudden noise, a dog, or some other noise or animal may have scared the cat while using the litter box.
In a multiple cat household, a dominant cat may be keeping a submissive cat from using the box. In these cases, it is always wise to have one more litter box than number of cats. If you have two cats, you’ll need three boxes. The litter boxes should be in different spots to keep the dominant cat from guarding the boxes., Urinating in odd spots, like the owner’s bed, chair, or on plastic bags, may indicate your cat has a urinary tract infection or other serious diseases. This can also occur when the owner has been away for several days indicating distress at your absence. If your cat does suddenly start urinating outside the box, it is best to consult with your veterinarian to rule out any medical causes for this behavior., Cats actually scratch because they find it enjoyable and in order to manicure their claws.Because scratching is so important to cats, you can't really get them to stop doing it. The best way to get a cat to stop scratching your favorite chair or sofa is to redirect their attention.


Give your cat a scratching post and entice it to use the post by scenting it with catnip and toys. If your cat doesn't like the scratching post, it might not be the right texture. Try attaching a different texture fabric and see if your cat likes to scratch that better.

Kneel or sit at the cat's level.,
Extend your finger.,
Wait for the cat to approach.,
Respect the cat's limits.,
Try playing with toys as an icebreaker.,
Use a wand toy to draw it closer.,
Ignore the cat.,
Be cautious about petting.,
Offer the cat treats.",How to Greet a Cat2," When you enter a room with a cat, or if a cat enters a room you are in, do not approach it. Instead, kneel down or sit at the cat's level. This will ensure that the cat doesn't see you as threatening or aggressive., Once you are at the cat's level, extend your index finger out in front of you. Do this slowly and calmly, and do not get too close to that cat in doing so. The aim is to give the cat the feeling that it has control in the situation, and can decide whether or not to approach you., Hold your position and wait for the cat to approach you. It will likely sniff your finger first, a move that mimics cats' nose-to-nose greeting to each other. Allow the cat to sniff your finger and rub against it if it wishes to., If the cat does not respond to your gesture, or moves away after sniffing your finger, leave it alone. Respect the cat's space and do not attempt to approach it or extend your finger again. Pushing an unwilling cat into an interaction can result in undesirable reactions such as:Hissing
Intense staring
Running away from you
Swatting at you
Scratching

, If a cat is especially shy, try introducing yourself via play. Toss a toy for the cat to chase, making sure to throw it away from both you and the cat to create a neutral playing zone. This way, the cat will comfortable playing and might warm up to you during the game., A neutral way to encourage a cat to approach you is to dangle a wand toy near it. If the cat is interested, this will allow it to approach you with a goal and interest outside of you. Playing with the wand toy may relieve stress and apprehension and make the cat feel more at ease near you.If the cat demonstrates any signs of distress (e.g. hissing), put down the wand toy and give the cat some space.

, If a cat is apprehensive around you, do your best to ignore it while you are in its presence. Keep your distance and avoid any eye contact with it. Your presence, without the threat of a forced interaction, will likely become more familiar and less threatening with time., When a shy cat finally starts to warm up to you, be careful about how you pet it. Pet it on the neck, head, or side in a gentle manner. Do not offer any resistance if the cat moves away from you or re-positions itself.

, With its owner's permission, offer a shy cat treats to coax it into an introduction. This will give the cat an incentive for greeting you and create a positive association with you in its mind. Be calm and gentle during the interaction."

Prepare for the birth.,
Put a water bowl and if wanted a small kibble bowl next to the basket for the mother and when old enough, the kittens.,
Put the mother cat in the basket throughout pregnancy to try to ease her into instantly going there when she is about to give birth.,

The box/basket will need to be short enough for the mother cat and the kittens to enter and exit with ease. Blankets and/or old towel should be used to line the bottom of the basket for comfort.;
, Put the basket in a place where the cats won't be disturbed, like in a laundry room or closet with an open door.

, It's a little like litter training!

,, When the mother cat goes into labor, try to get her to go into her basket, if she refuses let her have her babies where she chooses and clean up the mess later.

, During the birth, no matter how much you want to, try to refrain from helping unless the kittens or mother are in distress. When she is done giving birth, she will clean the kittens off and start to feed them.


Make sure that all other pets stay out of her basket and away when she is giving birth. Keep pregnant cats indoor at all times to ensure the safety of her and the kittens.
If in the first day or so the mother cat does not feed the kittens, go to a vet and ask if kitten formula is needed. Remember, the mother cat should be able to completely control the birth on her own.

, The mother cat can do most of the caring for the first few weeks, until the kittens start to climb out of the basket and adventure. Clean the water bowls daily to make sure that it is fresh.

, While the mother cat is breastfeeding the kittens, she will need just a little bit extra food at mealtimes, as that extra food will be turned into milk for her babies.

, Put water and maybe food next to her basket. Make sure she is comfortable during the birth.

, After the mother cat is done breast feeding the kittens, it is recommended that you get her spayed, unless you are an official cat breeder.

Spend time with your cat.,
Don’t yell at your cat.,
Stimulate your cat.,
Play with your cat.",How to Get Your Cat to Purr2," Interact positively with your cat every day. For example, take some time to hold it. Some cats will purr if you scratch them around the neck. You can even sleep with your cat to give you more time together., Do not punish it because a stressed cat will not purr. Instead of punishing your cat, encourage it through positive reinforcement. For example, praise it consistently when it does things correctly., Try to provide an environment that lets it perform natural cat behaviors, like hunting, climbing, and hiding. Give your cat perches and opportunities to climb. And give it toys that look or act like prey so it can practice hunting. Cats also need to use their claws, so provide it with a scratching post.Hide treats or catnip for it to find.

, Get a laser light, some yarn, or feathers on a string and let your cat pounce on these. Keep the items moving so they simulate prey. Roll items to your cat and it will roll them back to you.

, Allow your cat to roam and play and do not cramp it. For example, do not hold your cat if it resists being held. Also encourage other people in your home to let it be if it doesn’t want to be held. Your cat will feel happier and more secure if it has some freedom.

, Place your cat’s food, rest areas, and litter box in different places in your home. Cats don’t enjoy eating or relaxing too close to the litter box. And provide your cat with several scratching posts, resting places, and perches throughout your home to enliven its environment.


Try scenting the air with lavender to make your home more calming and pleasant for your cat.

, Make gradual changes in your home or in your cat’s routine. For example, move the furniture in stages rather than rearranging it all at once.

Socialization with people between 2 and 7 weeks of age sets the stage for the rest of the cat’s life.Socialization includes holding the kitten and encouraging it to interact with people and animals. These interactions need to be pleasant for the cat to want to continue them in the future.Consider kitten socialization classes. Your veterinarian likely has some resources for you to consider.;
, If you have an older cat, don't despair. You can still work with it. Positive interactions go a long way at all ages to make friends with a cat.


Even a cat that has been feral (living wild, without people) for up to four years can be socialized.Socializing an older cat requires a great deal more time an patience. The steps described in this article still apply. But, you should be prepared for the cat to take a much longer time to accept you.

, A cat won’t want to socialize if it doesn’t feel comfortable and safe. Create a calm and non-threatening environment when introducing a new cat to your home.


Begin by putting it in a quiet room where it can get comfortable in the space. Your bedroom is a good choice. Spending time here will help your cat get used to your scent.Gradually allow the cat to explore more of the environment as it becomes more comfortable.
Give the cat comfortable and fun surfaces to lay on (and in). A cat tree can be great for a cat that needs a little security and a place to call their own.
The cat should have access to food, water, a litter box, and a scratching post., Don’t hover over or crowd the cat. By staying calm and keeping your distance, you’re showing the cat you aren’t a threat and it shouldn’t fear you.


This is especially important for older cats that are not used to spending time around people. Giving a cat like this too much attention will actually do more harm than good. You must let a cat like this come to you.
Sit and read or watch TV, ignoring the cat. Scatter treats or the cat’s food around the room and encourage the cat to hang out and hunt for food.The cat will follow the treats and slowly get closer to you. Stay still.

Don’t push it, or you will need to start over winning your cat’s trust.Remember that it may take awhile for your cat to know that you do not intend to harm it. It doesn't know you yet. Show it your love by being patient when it is new to your home.

, These diffusers contain a calming cat pheromone that can help an anxious cat feel comfortable and relaxed.


Pheromone diffusers are very simple to use. All you have to do is plug them into a wall outlet, like many commercial air-freshening products. Then, just check them periodically to ensure they haven't run out of liquid.
You can find these diffusers at most pet and online retailers.

, Cats are easily over-stimulated, and a cat will become anxious or defensive if you try to show it affection when it isn’t welcome. Make sure the cat associates you with wanted, gentle affection, not anxiety.


Gently pet the cat if it rubs against you. When your cat rubs itself on your body, that is a friendly gesture. Reinforce the connection it is making with you by taking the opportunity to pet.
Cats like to have their heads and necks scratched. They also like gentle pets on the back, right where the spine meets the tail.Full-back strokes can be overstimulating and cause a cat distress to the point it may claw or bite you.
Offering a treat after handling your cat helps it create a positive association with touch., Pet the cat as long as it seems to enjoy it, and then pick it up and deliver it to a nice sunny spot or to food. You are trying to create the idea that being picked up is a good thing.


Don't forcibly hold a cat that doesn't want you to.This could break the trust you have built up with them. This is especially crucial for older cats.
There are times when you will need to pick up your cat against its will, for instance when you need to put it in a carrier. Be sure to do this as gently as possible, making sure to calm the cat with a nice tone of voice, petting, and perhaps even treats.

, Fearful and anxious adult cats may need prescription medication to help the socialization process. Talk to your veterinarian if the suggestions above don't seem to work.There are veterinary behavior specialists that may be able to help in extreme cases. Ask your regular vet for a referral.

During this time, try not to force the cat to come out of its hiding spot.Avoid chasing or picking up your cat, especially during this initial timeframe.;
, While your new cat is adjusting to its new home, you’ll want to get it used to your presence. If it’s hiding, sit near its hiding spot and talk softly to it. This will help get it used to your scent and sounds.Try sitting with it in intervals of about 20 minutes a few times a day.

, If it comes out of hiding, hold your hand out with a fingertip extended. Let it approach you and smell you on its own. When it does, gently touch your fingertip to its nose to say hello.Cats greet each other by touching noses, and you can simulate this by using your fingertip.

, Your cat will be a bit stressed out during its acclimation period. When you speak to it, be sure to speak softly, and avoid making lots of noise around it. Try not to make direct eye contact, as your cat will interpret this as a confrontation.Reducing your new cat’s stress will help it become comfortable enough to come out of hiding.

Bump heads with your cat.",How to Get a Grumpy Cat to Like You," Even a grumpy cat will appreciate food that tastes good and is good for her. Choose a food that has high-quality ingredients and is free of by-products.A high quality cat food will have a statement on the bag stating that it meet your cat’s minimal nutritional requirements, and thus meets the requirements of the American Association of Feed Control Officials.Consider wet food instead of dry food. Dry cat food tends to be low in water, high in carbohydrates, and contain more plant-based than animal-based protein.Cats are carnivores, so their main protein source must be animal-based.
Make sure to give your cat access to plenty of fresh, clean water.If your cat has specific nutritional needs, speak with your veterinarian for recommendations on what type of diet is best for your cat.
Talk to your cat as you prepare her food and give her a few gentle strokes along her back when she eats.This affection and attention may help reduce her grumpiness.;
, What cat doesn’t love a scrumptious treat every now and then? Your grumpy cat would love snacks that contain lean protein, such as freeze-dried chicken or lamb. Do not feed her human food, though—human food can cause your cat to develop mild to severe digestive upset.Tuna is another tasty treat for cats. Too much tuna, though, can lead to condition called yellow fat disease. A tuna-heavy diet can also lead to a vitamin E deficiency.Raw meat can be a source of infectious disease for cats, so do not treat your cat with raw meat.Limit your cat's treats to 5% or less of her diet.Too many treats can cause your cat to become obese and experience obesity-related health problems (e.g., arthritis)., Your grumpy cat may like you more if you give her a warm, comfortable, and quiet place to sleep. Place soft blankets, and maybe even a few soft pillows, in her sleep area.Clean her bedding when it becomes soiled, but do not clean it too frequently—she will still want to smell her scent on it., Your cat may be grumpy because you haven’t cleaned her litter box in a while. A dirty litter box could make even the sweetest cat a little grumpy. Clean out the clumps of urine and feces on a daily basis.If a regular and frequent cleaning schedule is not practical for you, consider switching to a self-cleaning litterbox., Toys are an important aspect of your cat’s overall health, and can keep her physically and mentally active when you are not home. Your grumpy cat would appreciate a variety of toys that will challenge her and keep her busy. Toys as simple as a crumpled piece of newspaper or a pizza box with a big hole in the middle can keep your grumpy cat entertained.Other fun, inexpensive toys include a paper bag with the handles cut off, ping pong balls, and empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls.If you would like to purchase some toys at the pet store, pick toys that do not have any small parts (e.g., ribbons, plastic eyes) that your cat could remove and swallow. Swallowing these small parts could give your cat serious digestive problems.Switch the toys out on a regular basis so your cat does not become bored with them (or grumpier!).

, In addition to your cat's general grumpiness, she may do some other specific behaviors to tell you not to interact with her. For example, she may hiss at you, arch her back, fluff her tail, and flatten her ears. All of these behaviors are clear signs for you to steer clear of her.Your cat may also hold her tail in an upright and slightly curved position. This tail position lets you know your cat is feeling defense or aggressive, not playful.If your cat really wants to be left alone, she may spit at you!, It is important for your cat to see you as her friend, not just as the person who owns her and gives her food.Her grumpiness may start to fade as you spend more time with her, which you can do by playing interactive games with her. Play games that nurture her natural hunting instinct. For example, shine a laser light on the floor in different locations and watch your cat chase after it.Schedule at least one playtime with your cat per day. Her grumpiness may stem from you not spending a lot of time with her, so plan to dedicate at least 10 minutes of your day playing with her.

, If your grumpy cat is well into her adult years, try bringing out her inner kitten to get her to like you. For example, play a game of fetch with her. Toss a toy mouse across the room and let her fetch it. You could also turn on a faucet and watch your cat have a child-like fascination with the water.Be creative with how to nurture her inner kitten. If you have had her since she was a kitten, try to remember what made her happy as a kitten and do those things.

, Your grumpy cat may start to like you more if you are affectionate with her. Cats love a soft scratch behind the ears, so try this with your cat.Try petting your cat in different areas to see what she likes the most and least. When your ‘session of affection’ is over, give your cat a treat so she can make a positive association with your efforts to be affectionate with her.Be affectionate with your cat on her own terms. If you try to be too affectionate with her, she may become even grumpier.
Try doing a few slow blinks with your cat. Slow blinks are a sign that your cat is comfortable with you.Your grumpy cat may not want to give you a slow blink initially, but she may do so as you do more things to get her to like you.

, During your play sessions, watch your cat's body language to know she has had enough and wants to be alone. When she is overstimulated, her pupils will dilate, her ears will flatten back, and she may start twitching or waving her tail. Your cat may also start to growl or put her teeth on you.End your play session when your cat indicates she no longer wants to interact with you.

, However, if your efforts to get her to like you pay off, then she may start to show affection in her own way, such as by licking you or ‘making biscuits.’ If your grumpy cat starts licking your ears and hair, she is showing that she trusts you and sees you as a friend.If your cat’s licking becomes excessive or uncomfortable, discourage her from licking by moving away when she starts licking you or giving her a soft toy towards which she can be affectionate.‘Making biscuits’ is another way of describing kneading behavior in cats. Kneading is your cat's way of showing that she's comfortable., If your cat wants to snuggle close to you to enjoy a nice nap, she is letting you know that she trusts you. Cats, like people and other animals, are most vulnerable when they are sleeping. If your grumpy cat sees you as a safe and warm spot to sleep, give yourself a pat on the back!, If you have an indoor/outdoor cat, or a very curious indoor cat, she may bring you her catch (e.g., dead prey) to show off her hunting prowess. Although the sight of a dead bird in your cat’s mouth or on the porch does not seem very praiseworthy, give your cat praise anyway—she is showing you a sign of friendship and you do not want to reject that.If your cat has a habit of bringing dead animals to you, and you are not comfortable removing the animals, consider contacting a local animal removal service.

, Another way to get your grumpy cat to like you is to imitate her affectionate behaviors. One of these behaviors is head bumping. Your cat will do this to say hello to you, leave her scent on you, and see you as part of her clan. Bump her head right back to reinforce your being part of her clan.Do not be forceful with the bump—you could just move your head slightly forward as she bumps it.

Brush the cat’s coat.,
Trim your cat's nails and clean their ears.,
Clean your cat’s teeth.",How to Take Care of an Aegean Cat1," An Aegean cat has a semi-long haired coat. This means that they will shed, especially during the spring and summer. To help with this, brush the cat once a week to remove dead hair.Make sure to use a wire slicker brush to brush your cat.
If your cat doesn’t like being brushed at first, try to work them up to it. Start by brushing them right before they eat, that way they associate brushing with something positive.;
, You should perform basic grooming tasks for your cat regularly. This includes trimming their nails and cleaning their ears. You may want to take your cat to the vet to get their nails trimmed if you cannot do it yourself.


To clean their ears, use a liquid ear cleaner and a cotton ball.
To trim the nails, get your cat comfortable and use the right tool. Make sure you clip only the nail and not the quick. Put the cat on your lap with your dominant arm gently around your cat’s upper body to keep it in place. Pick up a paw with your other hand and gently press on the paw to get the claws to come out. Use your dominant hand to trim the nails.

, You should also keep your cat’s teeth clean. Try brushing your cat’s teeth with a safe cat toothpaste and soft-bristled toothbrush. Let the cat taste the toothpaste by putting a little on your finger. Do this for a few days, and then when your cat gets used to that, start rubbing your finger along their gums.


When they are used to that, put toothpaste on the toothbrush and carefully rub it along the cat's gums. Over the next few days, work the bristles on the toothbrush along the teeth in tiny circles. Keep adding teeth until the cat will let you clean the entire mouth.
Never use human toothpaste on a cat.
You should also take your cat to the vet for regular checkups, and make sure your vet gives your cat an oral exam and dental cleaning.

Speak to your cat.,
Play with your cat.,
Keep your cat, and it's litter box, clean.,
Keep your cat healthy.,
Recognize the signs of affection.",How to Get Your Cat to Know and Love You2," Once your cat is comfortable with your presence, you can start building a positive relationship. Food is a powerful motivator, and you want to be the person your cat associates with food. This will help your cat associate something positive to your presence.


Feed your cat two or three small meals a day, rather than leaving food out. That will reinforce the association between you and food. If you leave dry food out for your cat, you can still use small meals of wet food in this way.
Stay in the room while your cat eats, to help strengthen the association between you and the food. You can also pet the cat while it eats.
Feeding high-value treats will also reinforce that you are the provider of all things good and tasty. Use the treats to reinforce good behavior, such as if the cat rubs up against your leg or shows you affection., It will be easier for a cat to bond with you if it isn’t driven by the instinct to mate with other cats.Spaying and neutering is also important to limit cat populations. This is especially important if your cat will live partially outdoors.If your cat is not spayed or neutered, contact a veterinary clinic or your local humane society to set up an appointment.

, Talk to your cat often, using a calm and non-threatening tone.Your tone of voice, along with your body language, conveys a message. Make sure that message is kind and gentle.


Yelling at a cat (or any animal for that matter) will frighten it and cause it to distrust you. Even if your cat has misbehaved, try not to shout at it.

, Once the cat feels comfortable approaching you, dangle a toy or string to invite the cat to play. Your cat may not want to play with you all the time, so take the opportunity when it does to bond with your pet.


Many cats like catnip. Consider buying a toy that contains the herb to encourage play.Playing with your cat will be most successful when the cat invites you to interact with it. For example, it may rub up against you or climb on you. While you can sometimes entice a cat to play with a flashy toy or a dangling string, your cat may ignore you if it doesn't want to play.

, Cats need a clean coat and clean surroundings to be content. Clean out it's litter box regularly, so it does not have to use filthy litter. A dirty litter box will often make a cat anxious and unhappy, leading it to act out.While your cat will probably spend a lot of time grooming, you may want to groom it yourself to bond with it. Try brushing the animal with a brush made for cats. Some cats will not allow you to, but others will enjoy the sensation. This will have the added benefit of lessening the cat fur in your house, especially if your cat is a long-haired breed., A cat may become withdrawn or avoidant if it has unaddressed health issues. Make sure to take you cat in for regular veterinary check-ups. Contact the vet if you notice significant changes in your cat’s health or behavior.


Your cat will not know that you are looking out for its well-being by taking it for check-ups. But, keeping it healthy is actually the best way for you to express your affection.
The cat may not show you love while you are putting it in a cat carrier, but the healthy years you get to spend together should more than make up for that.

, Everybody knows that purring is a sign of a contented cat. You may not know that a slow blink from your cat is also a sign of contentment and acceptance.


Try slow blinking back to your cat. Some people call this a “cat kiss.” Your cat may recognize this as a sign that you are non-threatening, and that you are a friend."

Give yourself plenty of time to get your cat in a carrier.,
Offer treats and toys.,
Try spraying Feliway.",How to Encourage Your New Cat to Come Out of Hiding2," You’ll likely need a minimum of 20 or 30 minutes to get your cat out of hiding and comfortable enough to get into a carrier. If possible, work this into your schedule so you can avoid having to fight with it and force it into a carrier.Try keeping the carrier in its space at all times, and place its food inside the carrier so the cat will associate it with good things.

, If you need to make a vet appointment or otherwise get your cat out of hiding in a hurry, try coaxing it with pet treats or a piece of canned tuna. You can also use a chase toy, like a feather on a string, to help it forget about its fear or shyness.Continue to play with it for 10 to 15 minutes. If you need to get it in a carrier, try placing treats in the carrier, and avoid forcing it in the carrier unless absolutely necessary.

, Feliway contains synthetic pheromones that can help soothe your cat. Spray it around your cat’s hiding spot to encourage it to come out of hiding. It’ll relax your cat and make it want to investigate the scent.It’ll probably want to rub against you and be stroked. You should give it some loving attention after spraying Feliway instead of trying to rush it into the carrier.

Keep your cat in one room when you first bring it home.,
Make dangerous hiding spots inaccessible.,
Let your cat out of its room at night once it becomes acclimated.",How to Encourage Your New Cat to Come Out of Hiding3," Your cat will have a harder time acclimating if it’s free to explore your entire home. Instead, keep it in your bedroom or a small, quiet room for at least the first two weeks after bringing it home.The room should have a door that closes and should be free of foot traffic. Try to keep your cat away from other people or animals while it gets used to your home.

, Keeping your cat in one room will reduce the likelihood that it’ll get trapped in dangerous hiding spots, but you should still take the time to cat-proof its room. Make sure HVAC ducts are secure, choose a space that doesn’t have a fireplace, and make sure it can’t knock over any furniture or objects.Try to keep your drawers closed, keep it away from appliances like washers or dryers, and keep your closet door closed if you want to keep it off limits.

, Once your cat is comfortable with coming out to explore its room, you can start introducing it to the rest of your home. Since cats are nocturnal, start by leaving the door to its room open at night. If it’s back in its room in the morning, close the door to avoid overwhelming it.If you can’t find your cat after you’ve let it explore the house, put out a fresh can of cat food or treats and give it some time to come out of hiding. If it has a favorite toy that makes noise, give the toy a shake to get your cat’s attention.
Be sure to cat-proof before you let your cat explore the rest of your house. Close doors to limit the area that your cat can explore and potentially hide. Keep a secure screen (or, in a pinch, a piece of plywood) over any fireplaces, be sure your washer and dryer doors are closed, and check for loose HVAC ducts.

Feed your cat quality food.,
Take your cat for regular checkups.,
Desex your cat.",How to Take Care of an Aegean Cat2," Aegean cats are from the Greek isles, and they are natural fisherman, so much of their natural diet is fish. Make sure to feed them fish-flavored food often since they love it so much.Cats are supposed to eat a meat-based diet, and need certain amino acids from proteins in meat. Ask your vet to suggest a cat food for you. You may also want to read the label to check the ingredient list.


Meat should be in the top two or three ingredients. Avoid foods with less than 40% protein. Try to buy a food that is grain free.
You can look for cat food that is salmon, tuna, or other fish flavored.

, Aegean cats are generally healthy and don’t have any known genetic diseases. However, you should still take them to get regular veterinary checkups. Your cat should go to the vet at least once each year.


Get your cat vaccinated against common feline diseases to protect their health. They will need booster shots each year.

, If your cat isn’t spayed or neutered, consider getting it done. Cats can be neutered around five to six months, which is before a female cat can get pregnant. Spaying or neutering your cat can also reduce the occurrence of behaviors like spraying to mark territory or behaviors connected with being in heat.


Being spayed can also reduce your female cat’s risk of cancer.

Know the difference between a stray and feral cat.,
Pay special attention to a cat's behavior and appearance.,

Select a cat trap.,
Lure the cat into the trap.,
Get a veterinary check up.,
Create a cat room.,

Introduce your cat to the household.",How to Earn the Trust of a Stray Cat," When you find a cat outdoors, it's either stray or feral. Dealing with feral cats is very different than dealing with strays, and their trust is sometimes impossible to earn. Before you proceed with approaching the cat, figure out if it's stray or feral.


Feral cats are born in the wild or outdoors. They have never been pets or lived inside. Stray cats were once pets, but were then lost or abandoned by the owner.Feral cats act more wildly than strays, their behavior more akin to raccoons or squirrels. Strays are generally more friendly and approachable, and tend to hang out in residential areas and near homes.Stray cats develop feral tendencies if they've been living in the wild for long periods. It can take a long period of one-on-one interaction with a cat to determine if it's stray or feral.;
, A cat's behavior and physical qualities offer clues as to whether he was abandoned or born outdoors.


Disheveled pets are, surprisingly enough, more likely to be strays. Recently abandoned cats have trouble adapting to the wild, and will likely be dirtier and more malnourished than a feral cat.Even if a cat runs when you try to pet him, if he approaches you at all he's likely a stray. Feral cats rarely approach humans.A sure fire way to determine if a cat is stray or feral is caging the cat. When a stray is caged, he will chirp, rub, play, and raise his tail up in a friendly manner. While feral cats may engage in this behavior outside, especially in the presence of someone who feeds them, they will never indulge the behavior while caged., You might find the cat you thought was a stray is actually feral. Feral cats, especially past the age of 7 months, are nearly impossible to domesticate. The ASPCA recommends a policy of Trap, Neuter, Return (TNR) as a humane way to help curb the population of feral cat colonies.


TNR programs humanely trap feral cats, examine them for medical disorders, provide a series of vaccinations, spay or neuter the cats, and then return them to the wild. Homing feral cats can be a traumatic experience as these cats are essentially wild animals. TNR is generally considered a more ethical option.You can set up a TNR program in your area by contacting your local Animal Control, ASPCA, or Humane Society for information. Do not try to deal with feral cats yourself unless you have specific training and experience in regards to handling wild animals. Feral can carry a variety of diseases, including rabies, and behave aggressively when frightened. They should only be handled by animal control professionals., Feeding is the most effective way to get a stray to interact with you. The cat is likely hungry and will respond positively to being fed. This gives you a chance to get closer to the cat and get him used to your presence.


Select strong smelling food. The easier it is for the cat to detect food, the better. Cats have a strong sense of smell. Canned food is usually more pungent than dry, especially fish flavors like salmon and tuna. However, do not leave human food, such as canned tuna or fish, out for a cat. This can upset a cat's digestive system and you do not want the stray to associate the food you leave with any unpleasantness.
Leave the food outside in areas where you've seen the stray. Consistency is important. Leave the food in the same place every day and the cat will learn to come to this area when hungry.
After a few days, stay outside while the cat comes to eat. It may take a week or so for the cat to trust you enough to approach you. Be patient. Do not try to force interaction.Do not pet or interact with the cat physically during this time, unless the cat makes contact with you by rubbing against your legs or nuzzling you. Strays have often suffered abuse at the hands of past owners. It may take a stray a long time to warm up to a new person, and they can be easily startled. If you push contact preemptively, the cat might be wary about returning for food., While some strays may walk into someone's home on their own, most strays have trust issues. A humane cat trap is often the best option to get the cat inside your home safely.


Humane societies often provide safe traps to visitors trying to capture strays. Workers can also explain how to use the traps correctly. The best option is to visit your local shelter and ask them for advice on a cat trap.If there is not a shelter in your area, you can purchase cat traps online. Be careful, however, as you want a humane that won't cause the cat discomfort or harm. Check all traps with the ASPCA website to make sure they are humane and safe., A cat will not simply walk into a trap, even if you leave food inside for him. The process of getting the cat safely into the trap takes time.


When the cat seems comfortable with your presence, start bringing a large crate trap with you when you go to check on him. Ethical traps, that provide no physical harm to the cat, can be found on Amazon or at local pet stores.
Spend a week or two placing the cat's food closer and closer to the trap. Eventually, put the food just inside the crate but keep the door open while the cat eats. Your goal is to get the cat comfortable being inside the crate so when you latch the door shut the experience is less traumatic.Gradually move the food farther into the crate. When you reach the point where the cat is comfortable going all the way in the trap, latch it shut., If you want to earn a cat's trust, you need to live with a stray for an extended period. Before you can do this, however, you need to make sure your cat is free from any diseases that could harm you or other pets in your household.


Before the check up, keep the cat quarantined from other people and animals. Keep him in a closed off room. If possible, a larger crate or cage kept in a heated garage would be the ideal option as the cat may have fleas and ticks that you do not want released into your home.
Your vet can check your cat for a microchip. This is an identification chip placed underneath the cat's shoulder which can be used to find the owner.Your vet will also run a basic physical exam and perform all necessary vaccinations. The cat will also be checked for ailments common among strays, like fleas, heart worm, feline immunodeficiency disorder, and feline leukemia., Taking in a stray is drastically different than taking in a sheltered cat. Your new cat will likely be more timid and more insecure about space and territory. Create a designated cat room so the cat feels comfortable in your home and, in turn, comes to trust you.


Have supplies like food, water, bedding, toys, and a litter box in place. Anything you can think of to make your cat feel comfortable and secure is a necessity.This room should be in a quiet portion of the house and should not be used by humans until your cat has adjusted to his new home. Provide a chair or couch with a blanket hanging over it so your cat has a place to hide when he feels threatened.Spend time in the room every day so your cat gets used to your presence. Knock on the door before entering, and say something like ""Coming in"" in a soft voice., Stray cats need time to adjust to human interaction. Do not try to force anything too soon, and let your cat take the lead when it comes to interaction.


Avoid eye contact. Cats often stare at humans, but do not engage in a staring contest with a stray cat. Staring is a sign of aggression. To communicate to your cat that you do not intend to harm him, close your eyes for a few moments and then look away.Let the cat approach you. Wait for a cat to make physical contact with you before you attempt to pet him. Cats indicate friendliness by rubbing up against people and gentle nuzzling. Wait until you get such a gesture before trying to touch the cat.If your cat wants to hide, let him. He might want to stay under a couch or chair for a few days, only coming out to eat. Allow him to do so, and do not try to coax him out before he is ready.
When your cat opens up to physical contact, avoid touching his stomach. The stomach is a vulnerable area for a cat and touching it could be a major setback in earning his trust.

, After your cat has spent a few weeks in his safe room, and seems comfortable in your presence, allow him to explore the rest of the house.


Let your cat move independently. Allow him to explore the house on his own terms. Keep an eye on him, but do not get in his way too much while he is checking out his new territory.If you have other pets, allow them to hear and smell each other before physically interacting. Feed existing pets near the door of your cats safe room. Encourage friendly pawing and playing under the door.You can try replacing the door with a temporary screen door, allowing other animals to see the new cat while still providing a physical barrier. This might be helpful if your stray is particularly timid.Supervise any initial face-to-face interactions with other pets, watching for signs of aggression.Make sure your cat always has access to his safe room so he can go somewhere he feels secure if he wants a place to hide.

See if he is getting uncharacteristically upset.",How to Figure Out if Your Cat Is Angry," Usually, if a cat is angry, it will flatten its ears when you try to pet or interact with it. This means, ""Stay away! I'm not in the mood."" It can also hint annoyance or anger in cats, and is not very hard to distinguish from the normal habits of your feline. Flattened ears are occasionally accompanied by baring of the teeth or a hiss.


Some cats will flatten their ears only slightly but, nonetheless, the meanings are the same.
Flattened ears will normally look as if the cat is pressing their ears against their head. The same reaction can be obtained by gently tapping the ear-of course, however, you should never intentionally provoke your cat.;
, If they are scared or feel threatened, they may either arch their backs and fluff their fur to appear larger, or lower their backs and appear as if they are cowering in a corner. Body language is everything to animals, humans and cats alike, and most creatures use their positions to express emotion.

, If they are skittish, they might bare their teeth at you, or try to bite you. This one is probably the most obvious, because often a cat with bare its teeth at you, or snap at you. If a cat wants to be left alone, it will also occasionally run away from you.


They are trying to look more threatening when they do that. 'Maybe if you see my teeth, you'll run!' is what they are ""thinking"".

, Usually when a cat meows, it's because they want your attention.


A typical cat meow could mean anything, from just wanting to be cuddled to wanting food. Make sure they have clean food and water.

,,, Milk can be a nice treat for a cat, but do not give it milk all the time, because it is not good for them. After your cat has weaned, it will most likely become lactose intolerant. Try to give your cat a little bit of cow's milk to see if it causes diarrhea. If your cat is okay after that, then you may give them a bowl of milk every once in a while as a treat. While grown cats do not need milk, you can purchase lactose free cat milk from a supermarket or pet store to give them.

Interact with your kitten in brief sessions.,
Don’t stare at the kitten.,
Speak kindly to your cat.",How to Earn a Kitten's Trust1," If your kitten doesn’t trust you, you should not overwhelm it with interaction. Let your kitten do its own thing most of the time, and interact with it in several short 15-20 minutes sessions over the course of the day.These sessions might include play time with toys, talking to it, petting, feeding treats, or any other interaction.
By the end of the day, the kitten should have spent at least two hours in total interacting with you. This shared time will help you build a rapport with the kitten.;
, Your parents may have told you that it was impolite to stare. Kittens agree. In the wild, staring is what predators do to their prey, so staring at your kitten will trigger its fear instincts. Instead, blink your eyes often as you interact you’re your kitten. Turn your head from side to side as you speak to it., If you persistently startle your cat by yelling at it or around it, you will have a hard time earning its trust.

, Blinking is a way that cats naturally show affection to one another, similar to a hug or a kiss among humans. In order to comfort and bond with your kitten, slowly lower your eyelids, blink, and open your eyes again.This should settle your kitten if it’s nervous.


If your kitten returns the slow blink, it’s responding to your affection.
Do not hold direct eye contact with your kitten—especially shortly after adopting it—as this can be perceived as challenging or threatening behavior.

, Animals trust those who help them survive, and tend to be more trusting of those who feed them. While your cat is eating, reach down and pet its back and tail (avoid touching its face while it eats). This will help your kitten associate you with food, and with the pleasant sensation of eating and being petted.When you first bring a kitten home, it may take time to adjust to you and to the new environment. If this is the case, give the kitten space and do not stroke it as it eats., Kittens are a large responsibility, and can require a surprising amount of attention and maintenance. You’ll need to constantly keep an eye on your kitten while it’s underfoot, and make sure it’s not getting into mischief behind your back. Make sure your kitten has plenty of food and water at all times.


You may need to “kitten-proof” areas of your house. Kittens can be destructive. Hide any breakable items (valuable dishes, vases, etc.) and put up any blankets that you wouldn’t want claw-holes in.

Declutter your home.,
Keep items in consistent locations.,
Place necessary items in accessible spots.,
Make the litter box area more secure.",How to Take Care of Your Aging Cat1," Some older cats tend to experience a decrease in their eyesight or hearing as they age. This may mean that your formerly agile cat will bump into things if they are stacked up around your house. Removing clutter will help an elderly cat to navigate it more easily., Keeping items in your home in their usual spots will allow an older cat to find them easily. For example, try to maintain the cat's sleeping and eating areas in the same place. This is especially important for cats that are losing their sight. Having items in your house in a reliable location will help a blind cat move through its home without bumping into things.


If you move, keep its old blankets, sleeping baskets, and food bowls to restore a sense of normalcy in the new house.
You may also want to keep a light on during the night so that your cat can find its way around the house. If a cat's eyesight is fading, it will not be able to see in the dark as well as it once did., While a young, agile cat may be able to climb or jump to get its needs met, an older cat shouldn't have to. For example, the cat's litter box, food and water dishes, cat bed, and your bed (if the cat likes to sleep there) should be easily accessible to the cat.You can buy little steps for your cat to help it climb onto your bed or wherever it likes to sleep. However, in many cases you can just arrange your furniture to provide this extra step.

, Remember that older cats are more likely to ""miss"" when using the litter box. Put its litter box on a plastic sheet or simply put it in an area that is easy to clean. That way, if the elderly cat misses the box or tracks litter out of the box, the mess can be cleaned up easily.


If you have the room, try putting the litter box in a small plastic swimming pool with a hole cut in the front. This will allow your cat to get in to do its business while containing its mess in something that can be easily cleaned.

Lie down on your stomach.,
Offer food from your hand.,
Pet your kitten.,
Pick the kitten up.,
Play with your kitten.,
Introduce your cat to a wide variety of people.",How to Earn a Kitten's Trust2," When your cat is still new to your home, lie down near it or in front of it when your paths cross. Speak to your kitten in a quiet, comforting voice, saying things like, “Hi, kitty. It's just me. You can trust me.” Soon, your cat will become interested in you and come over to give you a sniff. Repeat this exercise three or four time daily for a week or so.The exact distance away from your cat you should lie down varies depending on much your cat distrusts you. The less trust your cat has in you, the further away you will need to lie down in order to entice it to come near.
It might take several exchanges before your cat actually gets interested in you enough to come over and see what you’re doing.
Do not reach your hand out to the cat during this stage.

, Keep some treats handy as you walk around the house during the day. When you encounter the kitten that does not trust you, squat down on one knee. In a gentle voice, say, “Here, kitty. Would you like a treat?” Place a cat treat in the center of one upturned palm and extend it to the kitten. Repeat three or four times a day.At first, keep your arm extended out as far as you can.
After a week or so, start to bring your arm in closer to your body. This will allow your cat to feel safer with you. This feeling of security will help you earn a kitten’s trust.
At this point, reduce the number of times each day you give your kitten a treat to just one or two.

, After your kitten is comfortable eating from your hand in close proximity to your body, introduce a new element to the interaction. While your cat is nibbling the treat in one hand, bring your other hand up and stroke the cat gently from the top of its head or neck toward its tail. Smooth, steady strokes along its back will reassure your kitten and help you earn its trust., If you pick a kitten up before it trusts you, it will become startled. Only pick the kitten up after it trusts you enough to eat from your hand and allow you to pet it.When you lift your kitten, do so from the kitten’s left side. Cup your right hand under the right side of its body and support its chest with your right hand. Bring the kitten up against your chest where it will feel safe.
Cross your left arm over your right to secure its body against yours.
Holding your cat in this way can also help you earn its trust.

, Playtime is not just a fun distraction for both you and your kitten, but also an important bonding experience. To earn a kitten’s trust, wave a string toy near it, or flash a laser pointer across the floor in front of it. Your kitten will have great fun and will learn to associate you with happiness and all the other good feelings that make trust possible., If kittens are not raised with a wide variety of experiences, they will remain anxious and afraid when confronted by novel situations as they age. To prevent your kitten from developing an untrustworthy attitude, introduce it to tall people, short people, men and women, old people and young people. This will help break your cat of any prejudices that might prevent it from trusting you or others.If you do not have many friends or live alone, one way that you can socialize your kitten properly and thereby earn its trust is to leave the radio or television on during the day. This will allow your kitten to become accustomed to the sound of human speech.

"
"
Provide your cat with a cage.,
Put the kitten in an enclosed space by itself.,
Introduce your kitten to new rooms slowly.",How to Earn a Kitten's Trust3," Your kitten will love the safety and security of its crate or cage. The cage provides your cat with a refuge from you and all the other people that it doesn’t quite trust. Don’t close the door to the cage. Just allow your kitten to hang out in there when it wants.Don’t attempt to remove your kitten or pester it to come out. This will not be conducive to trust-building.
The cage should have enough room for the kitten to stand up and turn around.
You might want to put a soft towel or cloth on the bottom of the cage to make it cozier for your kitten., If you live in a house with loud children and big, barking pets, your kitten might be scared – especially if it already doesn’t trust you. Place your kitten in a small room without other pets or people. If you’re not yet at the stage where you can pick your kitten up, entice your kitten into the room using kitty treats.This is an important step if you know you’ll be having company over. Keep your kitten in the enclosed space until you’ve told your guests that you want to introduce them to your kitten. Instruct your guests to get down on their hands and knees and speak in a kind manner to the kitten that doesn’t trust you.
Even if you don’t have company, kids, or other pets, it is important to keep kittens isolated when introducing them to a new space. This will keep them feeling happy and safe. And if they feel happy and safe, they will be more capable of extending their trust to you.

, Being in a big, new space can be disorienting and scary for kittens. Your kitten might struggle to trust you if it is suddenly set loose in a house that, from its perspective, is a giant maze. Keep your kitten confined and introduce it to new spaces of the house gradually. Showing your kitten one new room every two or three days should be a slow enough rate of exposure to prevent alarm."
"
Give your cat food and water.,
Provide a litter box.,
Obtain a variety of toys for your kitten.",How to Earn a Kitten's Trust4," When you give your kitten food and water, it will come to know you as a caretaker or surrogate mother. This can help you earn a kitten’s trust.Place the food and water in pet dishes. Don’t use regular plates and bowls or your kitten will come to believe that when you are eating, you’re taking its food.
The best pet dishes for kittens are made of ceramic or glass. Unlike flimsy tin or plastic dishes, they are unlikely to spill. Plastic dishes, moreover, can leach chemicals your kitten’s water.

, If your kitten does not have a place to do its business, it will be difficult for it to bond with you. To earn a cat’s trust, place a litterbox in a quiet, low-traffic area of the house.Don’t place the litter box near the furnace or washing machine. These loud areas will scare the kitten.
Don’t place the litterbox in the corner of a room or in a closet. These spaces will make the cat feel trapped and disinclined to use the litter box.

, If you regularly bring gifts to your cat, it will soon come to trust you as someone who is kind and good-hearted. Each cat has different playtime preferences, so provide many different balls, string toys, and other toys. When you’ve identified a toy that your kitten particularly likes, spend most of your playtime with that toy."
"
Adopt your kitten while it’s young.,
Decide on its name.,
Create a comfortable, safe space for the kitten.,
Watch your kitten’s body language.",How to Bond With Your Kitten2," Young cats develop quickly, and can readily create emotional bonds while they are between 2 and 12 weeks old.If you’re in communication with the cat breeder, cat foster home, or animal shelter, specify that you’d like a cat within this age range. Many shelters will not adopt cats as young as 2 weeks (the cats will still need their mothers), but you should be able to adopt your kitten well before it’s 12 weeks old.


Ideally, look for a kitten around 8 weeks old. The kitten will be independent enough to not need its mother anymore, and ready to bond and play with a new owner., Naming an animal will help you feel more personally connected to it. Names indicate possession, closeness, and connection, and can help give your new kitten a sense of personality. When considering names for your kitten, think of:


The name of a favorite pet from childhood.
The name of a popular character from a beloved book or film.

, During the first several days after you adopt your kitten, keep it in a single room in your house, so it does not become overwhelmed by its new environment.This room should contain the kitten’s bed, food, water, and litter box, as well as a few toys for the kitten to play with.


Try to create a place in the house where you and your kitten can relax. For example, you can lay some blankets and pillows down on the floor.
When kittens are born the mother usually sleeps next to her newborns. If you do the same the kitten will see you as a motherly figure and find trust in you.

, Kittens have unique personalities, and will respond to different stimuli in different manners. Some kittens may be shy, and will quickly become scared if you play too aggressively or start introducing the kitten to too many people or objects at once. If your kitten acts fearful or nervous, give it some space and stop interacting.Nervous behaviors include:


Moving away from you.
Twitching or tensing its muscles.
Acting hyper-alert and reacting to stimuli with fear.

"
"
Wait to introduce your kitten to other animals.,
Limit your kitten’s interactions with other people.,
Encourage positive social behavior.",How to Bond With Your Kitten3," Introducing a kitten to another cat or a dog when you first adopt it can be a traumatizing incident for the kitten, since it will already be nervous and in an unfamiliar environment.Let the kitten get used to your living space before you introduce other pets.


You can begin to introduce your kitten to other animals when it’s between 3 and 7 weeks, as long as the kitten is comfortable in its environment.When you bring the kitten and another pet into the same room, give them time to sniff each other. If one or both animals are skittish, try giving them each a bowl of food or a couple treats. This will calm the animals down, and help the older pet develop positive associations with the new kitten.

, Make sure that all human interactions with your kitten are positive, gentle, and kind, especially while your kitten is still very young. Especially before 12 weeks of age, kittens are very fragile. If the kitten is around children or other individuals who may treat it carelessly, it could be dropped and injured.It’s fine for your kitten to meet other people, but if you want your kitten to bond most closely with you, you should be the one to play with the kitten, feed it, and care for it the most.

, Kittens are naturally social animals, and will mimic the behavior that they see you and other humans modeling for them. Encourage friends and family to treat your kitten gently and play with it, to help it develop an emotional bond and find a healthy outlet for its natural predatory instincts. If you kitten is being overly aggressive in its play, walk away and only resume playing when the kitten has calmed down.Do not encourage your kitten to playfully bite or scratch you. Although the behavior may initially seem cute, once the kitten has grown into an adult cat, its bite can be quite painful."
"
Adjust your cat's diet.,
Feed your cat soft food.,
Leave a water bowl out at all times.,
Groom your cat gently.",How to Take Care of Your Aging Cat2," If your cat is in generally good health but is getting older, discuss changing to a food formulated especially for elderly cats with your vet. However, if your cat is getting too thin or overweight, the veterinarian may suggest gradual adjustments to your cat's diet.If your cat's weight has fluctuated, it could indicate disease or an improper diet. Have your cat looked at by a veterinarian to figure out the cause.

, As cats get older, their teeth can become weaker. When the older cat crunches down on its hard kibble, it might crack or lose its tooth. This could cause serious pain to your kitty, so transition your senior cat onto wet food.


Discuss all food changes with your veterinarian. They should be able to point you towards a diet that will fulfill your cat's dietary needs and that will be easy on your cat's teeth.
Wet food can also add water to your cat's system. This is good for older cats, as they can become dehydrated easily., Older cats need more water than younger cats and can become dehydrated easily. Be sure to change the water daily and clean out the bowl every time you change the water.If your cat spends time outside in the summer, put water outside for your cat. Use a narrow, deep bowl and put it in the shade. If you want to, you can also put some ice in it to keep it cool.

, Older cats may or may not groom themselves, so be sure to groom them daily. Watch out for matted fur and only brush or comb gently, as an older cat's skin tends to be more delicate. With some help from you, your cat's coat can continue to be healthy well into old age.It is especially important to groom the areas of an older cat's body that it can no longer reach. With limited mobility, an older cat may not be able to clean the rear end of its body like it used to.

"
"
Pay attention to changes in your cat.,
Be alert for common health problems.,
Keep up to date on vaccinations and medications.,
Have your elderly cat examined more often by a vet.,
Give regular dental care.",How to Take Care of Your Aging Cat3," Changes in behavior and personality can signal health problems or just normal changes. To differentiate between the two, take your cat to be seen by a vet if it changes its daily routine or the activities it enjoys.An older cat might not like the food it used to or it may not even want to eat at all. It might also lose a little weight. Any of these issues are reason enough to have your cat looked at by a vet.
If your cat suddenly bites or scratches you more often, take it to the vet. These behavior problems could signal a medical problem that is causing your cat pain and irritability.

, It is important to be aware of the potential problems that can occur to older cats and to keep an eye out for them. This includes such problems and diseases as:Cancer
Urination problems
Loss of appetite or weight

Liver disease
Bad odor
Vomiting

, As your cat gets older, it will be more likely to get ill and it can have a harder time recovering from illness. In order to avoid many possible illnesses, be diligent about keeping vaccinations and medications up to date.Older cats may be particularly susceptible to certain infections due to decreases in their immune systems and an inability to groom themselves as much as they once did.

, It you are used to taking your cat to visit the vet once a year, you should start taking the cat in twice a year. This is because elderly cats are more likely to develop health problems, and it is important that they are caught as soon as possible., Older cats are especially prone to plaque buildup on their teeth, and dental disease. The vet can clean their teeth but daily brushing with a toothpaste made for cats will be easier on the cat and will prevent the problems before they develop.Elderly cats with sore gums or dental disease may avoid eating and become malnourished. If your cat has lost weight or has stopped eating, it may be caused by dental problems.

"

Make your cat comfortable.,
Keep the cat warm.,
Entertain your cat.,
Give your cat lots of love.",How to Take Care of Your Aging Cat4," When your cat gets older, it will need more specific care centered around its comfort. An aging body can have aches and pains that require a soft surface to rest on. To keep it comfortable, give your cat soft blankets, pillows, or beds to sleep on.At minimum, get a comfortable couch or cat bed so the cat can lay on a soft surface.

, Elderly cats can be the most cuddly of all, really craving the warmth of a human body at night. They will also want to stay warm during the day, so they tend toward areas next to heat vents or in warm rays of sunshine. If you have an older cat, make sure that it has access to a warm spot of its own.


Make sure it stays warm when you're not home, either by cranking up the heat in your house or giving it a heated cat bed. Overall, you want to make sure that the cat can curl up in a warm and cozy spot to nap the day away.

, Even when a cat is older, it will still mental stimulation but its body may not be able to move as well as it used to. With this in mind, provide toys that are easy to play with and items that stimulate your cat's mind without making it move its body. This can be as simple as giving your cat access to a view outside, where it can be entertained by the goings on.


Try bringing a cardboard box into your home and putting it on its side. Your older can may enjoy investigating this new item and pushing it around.Another idea is to can get some fish, put them in a tank, and set them somewhere kitty will find them.

, Spend quality time with your cat every day. Pet your cat if it likes to be petted and rubbed, hold it in your lap, and play games with it that it loves. Giving it love and attention is key to making most older cats contented.However, don't disturb your cat when it's asleep or if it has given you signs that it is not interested in interacting with you right now.

Observe your cat when she tries to jump up onto a surface, such as a table, shelf or favorite high spot.,
Observe her actions when getting down from a high place.,
If you have stairs, notice whether your cat no longer tries to climb them.,
Watch your cat at play.,
Notice whether your cat is sleeping more.,

Take your cat to the vet.",How to Spot Signs of Arthritis in Your Cat," Does she jump as usual or do you notice her using props such as a chair, stool, pile of papers or such to help her get to the higher level, something which she hasn't used in the past? Cats with arthritis will try to alleviate the limitations caused by arthritis by finding props to help them still get up high.;
, Does she look hesitant, act stuck or try to use a staircase approach to get down from the height by jumping onto objects in descending order.

, Arthritic cats often try to avoid climbing stairs.

, A cat in good health will still be a little playful even into older age. An arthritic cat will play less often or perhaps not at all.

, Although this can be a sign of just getting older or even of a different illness, if coupled with the other signs, it might indicate arthritis.

, Sometimes there is muscle wastage which can show up as thinner, weaker legs.

, Explain your concerns and offer your observations of the cat's behavior.

Find a veterinarian.,
Make an appointment.,
Discuss what will be done during the exam.,
Ask about the cost of the exam.,
Ask about preparations you need to make.,
Review your cat's behavior and health since its last exam.,
Have your cat do gentle fasting.,
Collect a fecal sample.,
Limit your cat's urination.",How to Schedule Wellness Exams for a Senior Cat," If you have an elderly cat you should make sure that it gets a health exam twice a year. This can be done by any certified veterinarian. If you don't have a veterinarian for your cat already, you simply need to find a veterinarian in your area that is accepting new patients and schedule an appointment.


In order to find a veterinarian, ask for recommendations from friends and family or you can do an online search for veterinarians and reviews of their practices.;
, Call your veterinary office and make an appointment for your cat's exam. Depending on how busy your veterinary office is, you may need to call a week or two before the date and time you want to assure you get them.


You will need to make these appointments twice a year, so that your cat gets looked at by its veterinarian every six months.
If you have not been to this veterinary office before, they may need some basic information from you before the exam. Because of this, they may request that you come in a few minutes early for the appointment in order to fill out new patient paperwork.
In order to make sure that your cat continues to get wellness exams, you may be able to schedule your cat's next wellness exam when you take it in for its current wellness exam. However, not all veterinary offices like to schedule six months in advance.
Many veterinary offices will send you a reminder when your cat needs another health exam.

, Before bringing your cat in for an exam, it's a good idea to know what to expect. Because wellness exams for senior cats can be thorough, they may include:Discussing the cat's health history
A physical exam to check general health and to spot potential health problems
Blood tests to check for problems with the liver, thyroid, and other organs
Urinalysis to check kidney function
Fecal testing for parasites

, Before you bring your cat in for its exam, you should make sure to know how much the visit will cost you. Because these exams are relatively thorough, the cost of a wellness exam for a senior cat can be more than an annual exam for a young or middle-aged cat.The price quoted to you when you make your appointment may not include all treatments and tests that your cat receives. This means that the quoted price is just the base price and your bill may be higher at the end of the appointment.

, When calling in to make an appointment, you should ask the person you talk to about any preparations you need to make. This could include collecting fecal or urine samples or having the cat fast before the appointment, among other things.If you have never done something that the veterinary office asks you to do, such as collecting a fecal sample, feel free to ask the person on the phone for advice about how to do it.

, During the wellness exam the veterinarian will likely ask you about your cat's health and behavior, so be prepared to answer questions about your cat's diet, daily behavior, lifestyle, and litter box habits.You should also prepare by making a list of any concerns or questions you have about your cat's health., Your veterinarian may ask you to limit your cat's food intake before its veterinary appointment. This usually means that you will be asked to limit your cat's food for about six hours before the appointment.Fasting allows the veterinarian to get better results for certain blood tests because it reduces the fat that is prevalent in the blood after eating.
If you know you will need to have your cat fast, try scheduling your appointment for early in the morning, so that you can simply bring it in before its morning meal.

, Your veterinarian may request that you bring in a fecal sample when you bring your cat in for its appointment. The fecal sample will be analyzed in order to look for parasite eggs.Your cat's fecal sample can be collected in a collection bottle supplied by your veterinarian or in a clean plastic container, such as a ziplock bag. It can be collected straight from your cat's litter box.

, Before your cat's appointment you should try to limit your cat's urination so that it has a full bladder. This will allow the veterinary office to easily collect a sample. In order to limit your cat's urination, you may need to keep the cat contained in a bathroom for an hour or two without a litter box. Also, if your cat is an outside cat, you should keep it indoors for a few hours before the appointment.If limiting your cat's urination is not possible, then you may need to collect its urine yourself. This requires that you use special litter box crystals that are non-absorbing, so that the sample remains pure. Once the cat uses the litter box, collect the urine in a clean plastic or glass container.
If at all possible, schedule the appointment for the early morning so that you do not have to keep your cat contained for long.

Purchase an aquarium tank.,
Place the tank in a warm spot.,
Add sand to the aquarium.,
Fill the tank with water.,
Decorate the tank.,
Welcome your crabs home.,
Release your crabs into the tank.,
Feed your fiddlers.,
Change the water regularly.,
Leave molting crabs alone.,
Watch for illness.",How to Take Care of Fiddler Crabs," Fiddler crabs live near bodies of water, so you’ll want to set up something as close tot their natural habitat as possible. Get an aquarium of at least 10 gallons to accommodate your fiddler crabs.


Buy an aquarium tank commensurate with the number of fiddler crabs you’ll have. For example, if you have four or less animals, a 10 gallon tank will work. However, if the animals are larger or you have more than four, get at least a 20 gallon tank to avoid hostility between the crabs.
Get the biggest tank you can afford at a pet store or large retailer. You can also often find them second hand, though you should wash these before using them.
See if the tank has a tank screen for the top because fiddler crabs can climb and escape.;
, Crabs are more active when their environment is warm.However, direct sunlight can kill fiddler crabs, so you want to put the aquarium in a warm spot out of the direct sun.Find a spot that has a relatively consistent temperature of 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 25 Celsius). Use a thermometer on the aquarium if necessary.Make sure the aquarium isn’t exposed to radiators or heating devices or drafty areas of your home.

, Although there is differing consensus on how much sand to add to your aquarium, keep in mind that fiddler crabs are semi-terrestrial and like to burrow.Fill the aquarium with at least a few centimeters of sand so that your crabs feel comfortable.Try starting with 4-5 centimeters of sand in the aquarium.Add more if you have multiple crabs or want to give your crabs more space to burrow.
Use aquarium, play, or bio sand to fill the tank.
Pile most of the sand on one side of the tank until you get to the level you like.

, You’ll need to add a small amount of water to the tank to mimic the fiddler crabs natural brackish-water habitat. Either add a small bowl of water or pour water directly into the tank.Fill the tank with 1.5-2 liters of brackish water.Make brackish water by mixing 1.5-2 liters of dechlorinated water with 1 gram or ½ teaspoon marine salts.Remember that chlorine can cause stress and kill fiddler crabs.
Choose whether you want to fill the bottom of the tank with the water or if you prefer to put it in a small glass or plastic bowl that is flush with the surface of the sand.Be aware that you want to keep the water as clean as possible because you’ll add your crabs food to the water.Recognize that the water and sand mixture may appear brown and cloudy. This is normal and because it will settle throughout the day.

, You may want to place some decorations or plants in your tank.Fiddler crabs like to hide when they are scared or when they are molting, so placing a few decorations in the tank may make them more comfortable.


Add plastic plants or sticks because fiddler crabs will often destroy live plants.“Driftwood” types of sticks and rocks are good choices because they let your fiddler leave the water, which is vital to their health.
Consider adding a piece of PVC piping for them to climb and hide. Make sure to rinse the piping out well before placing it in the tank.

, Most people will either order fiddler crabs from a pet supplier or purchase them in a store. Before you set them loose in the aquarium or while you are setting it up, release your crabs into holding containers.Use plastic pails or large dishes filled with brackish water as holding containers.Avoid leaving your fiddler crabs in any shipping material. Release them into the holding containers and discard any shipping water.Keep male and female fiddler crabs in separate holding containers if they arrived separately.Cover the containers to keep your fiddlers from escaping., Once you’ve had a chance to remove the crabs from their shipping or arrival containers and set up your tank, it’s time to release them into their new home. Although you can initially release all of your fiddlers into the same tank, watch for aggressive behaviors that may indicate inability to live together.


Be aware that although fiddler crabs often travel and feed in groups, that they can be aggressive with one another. This rarely results in injury, but you may want to consider separating fiddlers if one doesn’t allow another to move throughout the aquarium., Most crabs feed by “grazing” the sand in their habitats throughout the day. Watch for how much your crabs eat and increase food as necessary, though be careful to not overfeed them because this can make the tank smell offensive and like ammonia as well as muddle the water.


Add the following to your tank every day as food for your fiddlers: one brine shrimp or 2 plankton, a few fish flakes, place these only in the water.
Change the food up every few days by adding 3 freeze dried blood worms, a few fish flakes, and a couple small pieces of seaweed.
Be aware that seaweed will promote algae growth in the tank, which your fiddlers will eat.
Recognize that it is not uncommon for fiddlers to eat rotting food.

, Fresh dechlorinated brackish water is key to maintaining a fiddler crab’s health.Add new water to the tank as you see it evaporating. If you notice an ammonia smell or murky water, change the water and sand in the aquarium.Remember to add water that is dechlorinated and brackish.Never use table salt to make brackish water.

, Crabs molt their exoskeletons in order to grow. Watch for molting and make sure to leave your fiddler alone during this time because she may be very fragile for several days.Be aware that fiddlers may be reclusive and not eat during molting.
Avoid removing the molting or molted skin. The crab will eat the skin for calcium.Remove any crabs bothering the molting crab to holding containers., Disease and illness are rare among fiddler crabs.However, not keeping their water clean or housing them in improper temperatures can lead to illness and death.Keep in mind that molting is healthy.Be aware that missing claws and legs are normal and will regenerate.Checking the water for foul smells can alert you to problems with the water. You may find that simply changing the water makes your crabs more active.

Be gentle.,
Continue to play with your cat.,
Give your cat treats.,
Provide predictability.",How to Make an Old Cat Happy1," An old cat is especially happy if you’re calm and gentle when dealing with it. Let your cat spend time on your lap and give it gentle pets but remember that some cats are happiest when they have their space. Leave your cat alone if it seems to prefer being by itself. Also, an old cat won’t be happy if you yell at it when it does something you don’t like. Gently pick it up and move it to a new place if you don’t like where it is., Even though your cat is old it will still be happy if you take the time to play with it. Make sure that you don’t overstress your cat’s physical ability, however. Avoid making your cat jump after toys. Find a toy your cat likes playing with where it lies on its back or side. This will help you cat continue to exercise, have fun and be happy., All cats love treats and old cats are no exception. Your cat will be very happy with treats as long as you’re not overfeeding it and making it overweight. Experiment with different brands and flavors to find treats that make your cat happiest.


Try giving treats with catnip.
Try treats with fish.
Avoid giving your cat people food.
Don’t give your cat any treats that contain raisins, grapes, onions, alcohol, salt, or tea., Old cats are happiest when you provide them with predictability. Try to be as predictable when feeding your cat or spending time with it. Sit in the same spots so your cat easily knows where to go. Avoid changing your routine as much as possible to make your old cat happy because it is sometimes hard for older cats to deal with change."

Remove potential obstacles.,
Provide cozy places for your cat to sleep.,
Keep your house warm.,
Put food on a raised platform.,
Install a nightlight.,
Avoid new pets.",How to Make an Old Cat Happy2," Your cat won’t be happy if it can’t move around very easily. Therefore, you should observe your cat as it moves through your home and eliminate any objects that seem to get in its way. Change your cat’s litter box if the sides are high and your cat begins going to the bathroom elsewhere.Nothing makes a cat happier than having access to a clean place to go to the bathroom. Purchase absorbent pee pads, if necessary.

, You can make your cat super happy if you provide it with a warm and soft sleeping place. Look to see if your cat has any favorite sleeping places and place a clean blanket there for it to sleep on. Since old cats don’t have as much mobility, you can also make your cat happy by providing it with a ramp, step, or ladder so they can access their preferred sleeping spot., Old cats will be happy if you keep your house warm. Identify where your cat likes to hang out and try to keep this space warm and free of drafts. Move your cat’s bed to a space that is easy for you to keep warm, if necessary. For example, you could place your cat’s bed next to a radiator and see if they’re happy there., Your old cat might have trouble bending down to eat from its food bowl and no cat will be happy if it can’t eat. It’s a good idea to place your cat’s food bowl on a raised platform to help it. Buy a specifically designed raised feeder or simply place the bowl on something that elevates it. The benefit of buying a raised feeder is that the bowl won’t slip or fall off the platform as your cat eats from it., Cats love to roam at night but older cats often have eyesight problems so providing your cat with a light will be very helpful for making it happy. Keep a light on overnight or install a nightlight in areas where your cat might need to get to. For example, keep a light on near the litter box or where you keep your cat’s food., Keep your old cat happy by making sure your home is as quiet and calm as possible. Don’t introduce a new pet into the environment. A new pet may make your cat nervous or feel neglected, especially since you’ll likely need to spend a lot of time helping your new pet get adjusted.This won’t make your cat very happy.

Help your cat with grooming.,
Provide an appropriate diet.,
Monitor your cat’s food and water intake.",How to Make an Old Cat Happy3," Old cats have difficulty grooming themselves and will be happy if you help them. Set aside time every day to groom your cat. Gently brush your cat if it seems to like it. This will help prevent matted fur and hairballs, which can cause health problems.Clean your cat’s eyes, nose, and anus if you notice your cat isn’t keeping these areas clean. Use individual cotton balls dipped in warm water., Your cat will be happiest if you make sure it has a healthy diet. Talk to your vet about choosing an appropriate diet. It is important that your cat receives enough calories and vitamins in its food. Try mixing wet food and dry food to ensure a balanced diet.Don’t force your cat to eat a specific diet if it doesn’t want it. Provide your cat with food that it likes and makes it happy.

, Make sure your cat always has access to clean water. Even though many cats are shy about drinking around humans, this will make your cat very happy. It’s important that your cat continue drinking water because older cats tend to have kidney problems. Increasing the amount of wet food you give your cat helps add extra moisture into your cat’s diet and keeps it from developing health problems that won’t make it happy."

This is usually related to problems with their habitat, or “crabitat,” but may be a result of other issues such as mites., Hermit crabs need access to water to keep their skin moist and healthy. Examining your crab for signs of dry skin can keep your crab from drying out and ensure it can breathe properly.Signs of dry skin in hermit crabs can include:


Lack of water in the tank or on a sponge
Matte appearance to the skin
Excessive burrowing to get at moist spots in the tank

, The environment in the tank is vital to a hermit crab’s health and promotes its movement, too. If your hermit crab isn’t moving around much, the water in its habitat or even toxic paint on its shell could be killing it.Lethargy can also be a sign of stress.Recognize that most hermit crabs like to play and will move around their habitats a lot if they are not molting or sick.
Make sure your hermit crab is moving regularly and not hanging out of its shell, which can be a signal that it is dying.
Remember that lack of movement can also signal molting., Foul odor coming from the tank can signal illnesses related to problems with the habitat. Check on your crabs every day, which can quickly signal you to any bad smells that might be coming from the animals or parts of the tank.


Be aware that there may be a broad range of odors that can signal problems. These include: stinky feet, fish or shrimp, mildew or must, rotting food.

, Mites are arguably the most common cause of health issues for hermit crabs and you should be especially vigilant in checking for these.Be aware that there are “good” and harmless mites that inhabit crab’s spaces and bodies but that there are also “bad” and harmful mites.Watch out for the following types of harmful mites:


Gill mites, which are light pink or red and bury into the gills of hermit crabs. These mites are often not visible until after a hermit crab’s death because a flap of skin protects the gills of live animals.
Crab mites, which glue themselves to soft parts of hermit crabs’ bodies including the eyes, mouth, or joints. Crab mites range in color from white to cream, grey, pink, or red., In addition to the physical symptoms of illness, hermit crabs may also exhibit unusual behaviors.Checking on your crabs daily will help you see each animals typical behavior—hermit crabs do have distinct personalities-- and can alert you to potential problems.Some behavioral problems to watch out for are:


Digging down into the habitat sand or coconut fiber to “de-stress”
Consuming large amounts of food or water
Soaking in the water dish
Being very lethargic.Hiding in its shell for long periods, especially if it usually enjoys attention.Molting in the open.Hanging out of its shell in a limp or lifeless manner., Sickness is rare among hermit and other types of crabs.However, there can be some confusion when trying to tell if your hermit crab is sick because many of the symptoms of illness parallel the signs of molting such as missing limbs and burrowing for days or months.Some additional signs that your hermit crab may be molting and not sick, especially if the crab exhibits several of these symptoms, are:


Digging
Drinking large amounts of water or soaking in the dish
Spilling water from the dish to dampen the sand or coconut fiber in the tank
Cloudy eyes
Ashy-looking skin, which is also called the exoskeleton
Lethargy., Crabs must molt their skin to grow and this process can take weeks or months.If you realize your hermit crab is molting, leave it alone because she may be very fragile and any type of contact can cause her undue stress.Be aware that healthy crabs will molt “in private” by burrowing or hiding in a dark spot of the tank.The crab may not eat during molting, either.
Leave the molting or molted skin on the crab. She will eat the skin for calcium once she’s done molting., In most cases, you should avoid touching your hermit crab in any way. This can cause them undue stress and may kill it, especially if the crab is molting.Stay away from blowing on or poking your crab, which can also stress your pet.Be aware that there is varying information on touching crabs, but that not handling them with care can result in bites., If you suspect one of your crabs is sick, especially with mites, you’ll need to separate it from its crab friends. Prepare a large bucket or other container in which to isolate and treat your hermit crab.


Make sure that the isolation tank is similar to your crab’s normal habitat. Add some dechlorinated water, sand or coconut fiber, toys, and food in the crabitat.
Observe your sick crab to make sure it is healing. Once it appears healthy again, move it back to the regular tank.
Avoid isolating molting crabs as this can kill them. Remember to leave them alone in their usual habitat.Move a crab that is hanging out of its shell limply to an isolation tank. This is a sign that the crab may be dying., Many illnesses that crabs develop are a result of problems with the water or its habitat. Changing the water regularly key to healing and maintaining your hermit crab’s health.Add new water to the tank as you see it evaporating.
Change the water if you notice an ammonia smell or murky water. Remember to use dechlorinated and brackish water.Never use table salt to make brackish water.
Place new sand and toys in the habitat. You can also clean toys with a mild soap and water and rinse it thoroughly.

, Although there are differing viewpoints on the treatment of bad mites on your hermit crab, there are a couple of different ways to kill them.You can either bathe your hermit crab or introduce a mite species that will eat the bad mites from your pet.bath with care if you choose to use this method. Use dechlorinated, tepid water and lower him into a container you’re using as a bath. Your crab may go into the water alone, too.Don’t leave your crab unattended and remove it from the water after about a minute.Drain any excess water from the shell and allow your crab to dry out in a box or on a paper towel.Put the crab back in its usual habitat once it is dry.Introduce the predatory mite Hypoaspis miles into a habitat infested with bad mites. The Hypoaspis miles will eat all of the other mites, larvae, and eggs without bothering your crabs. As the number of bad mites disappears, so will the number of Hypoaspis miles., Consider taking your hermit crab to the vet if no other treatments are working or you don’t feel comfortable. However, you should be aware that there is little a vet can do for a very sick or dying hermit crab and nature may need to simply take its course.Call your vet’s office to make sure they will see hermit crabs.
Consider your crab’s health. If it really is dying, moving it to go to the vet can cause it unnecessary stress."

Buy litter boxes with lower sides.",How to Perform a Comfort Check for Your Senior Cat," If your cat has been eating its food from dishes that are on an elevated area or are in a spot that takes some agility to get to, you may need to move them. Watch as your cat goes to its food dish and assess whether the cat is having a hard time getting to it. If it is, then the food dish needs to be moved.In many cases, cat food dishes are placed in high spots so that other animals in the house don't eat them. If this is the case for you, try to find a spot that your cat can easily get to but that your other animals can't access.
If your cat is losing weight or showing less interest in its food, it can help to put its food in a place where it can get easier access.;
, As your cat gets older it is very important that it has easy access to its food. If your senior cat has to fight off other cats or other animals to get its food, that may impact its ability to get enough food as it ages. If this is the case for your senior cat, feed it in a location where other cats are not around, such as in a closed room.


This will help assure that your senior cat has the time and ability to get as much food as it needs.

, Placing water dishes on kitchen counters or other high spots can make it difficult for your senior cat to get enough water. If your older cat is looking dehydrated or having a hard time getting to its water dish, then you may need to move the dish.Consider luring your cat to water even more. Invest in a water fountain for your cat, which recirculates water and creates a trickling noise and movement that lures most cats to it.If your senior cat has mobility issues, try placing multiple water dishes around your home. This will help the cat to get enough water.

, As your cat gets older it may need a more comfortable bed to allow it to sleep and rest comfortably. Watch your cat throughout the day and decide whether it is having a hard time getting comfortable. If it is, the cat may need a more comfortable bed.A cat that paces and cries at night may simply be uncomfortable when it is trying to sleep. Try giving it a new bed to sleep on and see if that makes the cat more comfortable.

, In addition to having a comfortable bed, your cat may need a warmer space as it gets older. If your senior cat is avoiding its bed and choosing to nap next to a heat vent or sunny spot, then you know it needs more warmth. Place your cat's bed in a warm and cozy space where it is not exposed to cold temperatures or drafts.If your home is normally relatively cool, consider getting your cat a heated bed. These are available at pet stores and online. They provide a gentle warming to keep your senior cat nice and warm.

, As your cat gets older it may need to spend more time in peace and quiet. Pay attention to where it spends its time and if that has been changing. If your cat is hiding away from the action of the house, give it a comfortable place to do that.Place the cat's bed or a soft cushion for it to nap on in a quiet corner of your home.
Remember that you need to keep the cat's bed in a location where it is easily accessible, even if it is placed in an out of the way spot.

, If your senior cat has a favorite spot that it is having a hard time getting to, consider giving it some help. Provide a ramp or smaller steps up to its favorite spot in the window or up onto a piece of furniture it loves to curl up on.


Giving your cat the ability to continue doing things that it loves will help keep it happy and healthy.

, Watch your cat go to its litter box and make sure it can get to it easily. If getting to the box requires agility or flexibility, then it may need to be moved to a different location.


For example, if the cat spends most of its time on one floor of your home but the litter box is on another floor, then the senior cat may have to expend too much energy climbing stairs to get to it.

, As your cat gets older, it may be harder for it to get to its litter box in time when it needs to go to the bathroom. If your cat is moving slower than it used to or having accidents in the house when it hasn't in the past, you may need to give it some assistance by putting litter boxes in several locations in your home.Remember, having the inconvenience of dealing with more than one litter box in your home is better than the inconvenience of your senior cat having accidents in your home.

, If you suspect that your cat is having mobility problems, you should watch it as it gets in and out of its litter box. If there are any signs of pain or discomfort when accessing its litter box, you should consider getting it one that is easier to get in and out of.The litter boxes that are easiest for senior cats to get in and out of have low sides or a lowered entrance area.

Look for signs of kidney disease.",How to Watch for Common Senior Cat Health Issues1," Almost all cats over age 12 develop arthritis. Your cat might have arthritis or degenerative joint disease if it doesn’t want to go up or down stairs, no longer jumps, has trouble grooming itself, or has difficulty climbing into its litterbox.Bring your cat to the vet for a physical examination if you observe signs of arthritis. Ask the vet if they recommend medication.;
, Try to watch your cat when it eats and look for signs of dental disease. Notice if it seems to have difficulty eating or doesn’t have much interest in its food. Check its teeth weekly for signs of decay.Since older cats are at a higher risk of developing dental diseases, you should brush its teeth daily with a cloth or cat toothbrush and toothpaste designed for cats. Don’t use human toothpaste to brush your cat’s teeth.

, Older cats are prone to developing cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and other eye conditions. Check its eyes every week or two for white or cloudy lenses, dilated pupils, or redness in the white area around the lenses. Observe your cat’s mobility and take note if it often bumps into objects.Take your cat to the vet as soon as possible if you see any irregularities in its eyes. If it seems to have trouble seeing, avoid moving furniture around to make it easier for it to navigate its environment.

, Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is a common disease in older cats that can lead to hypertension, kidney problems, and heart disease. Symptoms include weight loss despite having an excessive appetite, sudden increase in energy, diarrhea, vomiting, and increased urine volume.Schedule a vet exam if you suspect your cat has hyperthyroidism. Blood work will offer an accurate diagnosis and help you and your vet decide if medication is necessary.

, While common in older cats, signs of chronic renal failure, or kidney disease, vary widely. Symptoms could include increased urine volume, weight loss, lack of appetite, and vomiting.These symptoms could be related to kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or heart disease, which are all common issues in older cats. Bring your cat to the vet if you observe these symptoms. Only the vet can make an accurate diagnosis and determine the best treatment plan.

Purchase an aquarium tank of at least 5 gallons to accommodate your crabs.Find a tank that will fit with the number of purple Thais you have. If you have one to three crabs, a 5-gallon tank will work. If you have multiple purple Thais, consider a tank that is at least 10 gallons. Increase tank size by 5 gallons for every 5-6 crabs you have. This can help your purple Thais stay healthy as well as prevent overcrowding.Buy the biggest tank you can afford. A good rule of thumb is no more than one crab per square foot. If you are trying to save some money, consider getting your tank second hand. Make sure to wash any tanks before use.
Purchase a tank screen to keep your purple Thais from climbing out and escaping.;
, Purple Thais live in a naturally warm environment. They’ll thrive in water that is between 72–82 °F (22.2–27.8 °C), which you can promote by putting their tanks in a warm spot.Keep the aquarium out of the direct sunlight, which can kill purple Thais.Pick a places that has a consistent temperature of 72 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 Celsius). Put a thermometer on the tank to help you measure the temperature.Avoid exposing the tank to heating devices or areas of your home with a draft.

, Purple Thai devil crabs live on both the land and in water.Fill the aquarium with a thin layer of sand and some water as the base for the habitat. Purple Thais like fresh water that is naturally brackish. Place a small bowl of water in the tank or pour it in directly.Spread 4-5 centimeters of aquarium, play, or bio sand to the bottom of the tank. Use more sand if you have multiple purple Thais or want your crabs to have more burrowing space.You can also use coconut fiber substrate if you prefer.Pour 1.5-2 liters of brackish water into the aquarium. You can buy a commercial freshwater salt mixture at most pet stores.Mix brackish water by stirring together 1.5-2 liters of dechlorinated water and 1 gram (0.035 oz) or ½ teaspoon marine salts.It’s important to use dechlorinated water—chlorine can stress and kill your purple Thais.
Understand that it’s normal for the water and sand mixture to appear brown and cloudy. The color and cloudiness will go away in a few hours.

, After you’ve added sand and water, it’s time to make the tank feel like home to your purple Thais. These crabs like to climb and sit on things near the water.Add decorations such as rocks, sticks, and Java moss to keep your purple Thais happy and healthy.


Choose a variety of fresh or plastic plants, pieces of wood or sticks, and rocks that your crabs can sit on and climb. Even a small piece of PVC piping is a great feature for the habitat. Rinse out the piping before putting it in the tank. Cover it with some Java moss, through which purple Thai devil crabs love to graze and catch food., Once you’ve set up your tank, welcome your crabs into their new home. Release your purple Thais into the same tank, but watch for aggressive behaviors from other animals in the tank that may indicate inability to live together.Be aware that some fish such as cichlids may eat or harass your purple Thais. Your crabs may also harass or eat small fish, dwarf African frogs, and tank mates that reside or sleep at the bottom of the tank.
Recognize that the best tank mates for purple Thais may be other purple Thai devil crabs. Some other mates that may work with purple Thais are zebra danios, tetras, barbs, platies, and mollies., Purple Thai devil crabs eat by “grazing” throughout the day. They usually graze Java moss and the bottom of the tank for their food. Purple Thais are omnivores that eat everything from vegetables to other animals.Pay attention to how much your pet eats and give them more food as necessary. Avoid overfeeding purple Thais because this can make the tank smell, decrease water quality, and hurt your crabs.Vary your purple Thais’ diet. They eat both meat and plants. You can give your crabs meats such as fruit flies, tiny crickets, and blood worms.They will also eat brine shrimp.Give your crabs plants such as dried algae and fresh or dried vegetables that you cut into smaller pieces about the size of your individual crabs.Consider giving your purple Thais protein- or algae-based pellets in addition to any plants or meats.Remove any food after three days in the tank. It’s not uncommon for crabs to eat rotting food, either.

, Purple Thais thrive in clean, fresh, and dechlorinated brackish water.Check the water quality daily and change the tank water every 2-4 weeks.Remove 10-25% of the total water volume in the tank every 2-4 weeks. Then refill the tank with the same amount of fresh water that is dechlorinated and slightly brackish.Change the tank water more often if necessary. If you detect offensive odors or ammonia, it may mean the water quality is poor. Lethargic purple Thais or crabs with dull color may also indicate poor water quality. In any of these cases, change the water as soon as possible., Purple Thai devil crabs are generally robust and healthy. When you feed or check the tank, also pay attention to your crab’s appearance, which can indicate health and vitality. Healthy purple Thai devil crabs:


Scavenge their habitat actively
Appear healthy
Have bright, even coloring, It’s rare for purple Thai crabs to have diseases or illness.They can get sick and die from improper temperatures, dirty water, or diseases introduced by other species.Some potential signs of illness in a purple Thai devil crabs are:


Dry skinLethargy or lack of movementVisible mites on the body
Digging into habitat sand
Consuming large amounts of food or water
Soaking in the water

, Crabs shed, or molt, their skin as a part of the growing process. The signs of molting may seem like your crab is ill. There are some additional symptoms that can help you better identify if your crab is ill or molting. Look for several of the following signs, which is a good indicator that your crab is molting:Digging
Drinking large amounts of water or soaking in the dish
Spilling water from the dish to dampen the sand or coconut fiber in the tank
Cloudy eyes
Ashy-looking skin, which is also called the exoskeleton
Lethargy

, If your purple Thai devil crab is molting, leave it alone until it exhibits a healthy appearance and behavior. Molting crabs can be very fragile for several days during and after the shedding their skin.


Understand that your crabs may be reclusive and not eat during molting.
Avoid touching your crab or removing its skin. Leave the molted skin in the tank because crabs often eat it for calcium."

Consider if increased aggression is due to pain.,
Look for signs of cognitive dysfunction.,
Make your cat’s environment more accessible.",How to Watch for Common Senior Cat Health Issues2," Cats tend to hide health issues, but behavioral changes often accompany underlying medical issues. If your cat becomes uncharacteristically fearful, anxious, or aggressive, it might be experiencing pain or discomfort associated with a health problem.If your cat becomes fearful or aggressive, schedule a vet visit and observe its mobility, eating habits, urination, and bowel movements. Feel its body for lumps, sores, and other abnormalities, and report anything suspicious to the vet.  

, Disorientation, confusion, getting lost, decreased activity, anxiety, and increased meowing are all signs of cognitive dysfunction, or senility. While often related to senility, these symptoms can also point to pain or an underlying medical condition.Take your cat to the vet to rule out medical causes. If the vet determines your cat has developed cognitive dysfunction, ask them if they recommend medication. You should also take steps to make your cat’s surroundings more comfortable and easier to use.

, If your cat’s litter box has high sides, switch it out for a lower one to make it easier to use. If it shows signs of senility and has trouble finding its litter box, consider adding boxes in other locations (in addition to keeping any existing boxes where they are).Avoid changes in food, water, and litter box placement. Make sure your cat can access these items, as well as its bed and toys, without having to go up or down stairs.

Even if you don’t notice anything out of the ordinary, it’s best to bring your cat to the vet every six months.Since cats typically try to hide their health issues, regular vet exams will help you catch any issues as early as possible.

, Older cats are prone to dehydration, so it’s best to feed them wet food instead of dry. In addition, make sure your cat can easily access clean, cool water at all times.Ask the vet if blood work and physical examination show any dietary deficiencies, like low iron or fiber. Ask them if they recommend adding supplements or other dietary changes.

, Weekly physical examinations at home will help you spot symptoms of common health issues. You should check your cat’s eyes, teeth, ears, and skin for any abnormalities. You should also feel its body for signs of cancer, like lumps or bumps, particularly those that increase in size.Ask the vet, “Can you show me how to perform a home examination on my cat? Do you have any tips for examining my cat without upsetting it? Do you have a home examination checklist on hand?”

, During regular checkups and emergency visits, ask the vet about medications that can help your cat’s condition. Prescriptions are available for common conditions including senility, thyroid issues, kidney disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Your vet might also recommend calming pheromones, like Feliway, to help ease anxiety or senility.Be sure to discuss cost with the vet, and ask about lower cost options for any medications they recommend. If you have pet insurance, discuss your coverage options with the vet and your insurer.

Look for lice that are whitish-gray or dark brown in color.,
Know that they can survive 2 days away from your body.,
Treat the area with a specialized lotion or shampoo.,
Know that you need to get rid of crabs and their eggs.,
Understand the complications if left untreated.,
Watch out for infection.,
Treat other areas, like the eyebrows, with a prescription.",How to Recognize Crabs," This is the most common symptom of having crabs. It will usually start 5 days after you get exposed to the bug and be isolated within the genital and anal area.It tends to be worse during nighttime hours because this is the time when the lice become more active and feed more often.


Fight the urge to itch, as getting lice under your fingernails or on your hands will make the infection more likely to spread. Even if you're not entirely sure crabs may be the culprit, it's better to be safe than sorry.;
, This will appear once the crabs have bitten the surface of your skin. It indicates that blood has been withdrawn from your skin through biting. Several spots will be seen depending on how many crabs currently infest the pubis area.


The longer you've had crabs, the more visible these colored spots will become. If left untreated, the area will be covered in all the dark spots the lice have bit.

, Crabs do a lot of hair gripping through their claws that will prevent them from falling from the hair. If you look closely you will see eggs attached to the hair and lice crawling over the area.


Of course, it's not just your pubic hair that could be affected, though that's the most common site. If necessary, take a close look at your eyebrows and eyelashes, too, for similar manifestations.

, Nits are the eggs of the crabs. They look like white, tiny, oval-shaped eggs. They are usually found near the roots or the base of the hair.


These are just as important to get rid of as the crabs themselves. Once you've started treatment and adult lice aren't visible, nits are what you need to keep an eye on to make sure the infection doesn't return.

, Crab lice have similar characteristics to crabs – that is, they have stereotypical claws that are normally associated with ordinary aquatic crabs. However, they're not easily seen due to their size and location. But nevertheless, they still can be seen with ease under a magnifying glass. Can you see the claws?


The average louse is about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. They are very tiny and just barely visible to the human eye.
Your dermatologist might use a magnifying glass to diagnose you. It's a surefire way to know exactly what you're dealing with.

, Lice that haven’t fed on blood yet have this color – but when they have already fed on blood they will turn into a rust-colored or dark brown due to presence of blood in their body.


Crabs feed roughly every 45 minutes. You may notice a change in color in this interval if you monitor them stringently.

, In general, crabs live for about 30 days. If they are away from the body, they can survive for 2. That means that even if you're rid of lice (or the people in your household do not currently have lice), it doesn't mean you're home free.


They love warm areas. If the temperature drops (as in they get removed from the body), they will head for warmer ground. This means you may be able to find them in your sheets or in other dark, stuffy areas.

, As soon as you find out you have crabs, make a trip to your local pharmacy or grocery store for an over-the-counter lice killing lotion or shampoo. If you follow the directions on the label and are diligent, your crabs can easily be gone in no time. It may take a few applications, but it will work.


Along with treating your body, treat your home, too. Wash your sheets, towels, and linens to prevent any lice that may be surviving out in the open from creating a recurring issue. This goes double if you live with others, as crabs are contagious and do not require physical contact for transference.

, Crab lice may exist in two forms on your body:


Live lice form (which can be seen crawling on the infected area)
Egg form (otherwise known as “nits”)
Finding either form indicates the presence of an infestation which requires immediate treatment. Even just one egg can present a problem.

, In most cases, there aren’t any serious complications seen with crabs; however, in patients with weak immune systems or other chronic diseases complications may be seen. Because of this (aesthetics and stigma aside), it's important to start treatment as soon as possible.


In cases of infestation that have not been treated for a long period of time, discoloured skin may be seen at the sites where the lice have been constantly biting and feeding from your blood.

, If you already have wounds present near the genital area or you get injured and this is then superimposed with an infestation of crabs, this could lead to a more serious skin infection which could spread around the body through the blood. This type of infection is called a “secondary infection.”


Pubic lice in the eyelashes or eyebrows gives rise to irritation of the eyes leading to potential cases of conjunctivitis as well as secondary infections of the eye.

, Special treatment has to be taken for treating crab lice in the eyebrows and eyelashes. Your ophthalmologist will prescribe you with ophthalmic-grade petroleum jelly which must be used on the eyelid margins at least two to five times per day for a period of 7-10 days. This is usually enough to kill the lice effectively.


Additionally, with care, tweezers may be used to remove any visible lice that may be present within the eyelashes and eyebrows. Regular petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) must not be used in the eyes as it is an irritant.

Make a hammock.,
Make a mangrove tree.,
Add driftwood to the tank.",How to Make Toys for a Hermit Crab1," Place two suction cups at one end of the tank and place two suction cups with hooks on them at the other end of the crab's tank. Cut a piece cheesecloth or a fine fishnet into a rectangle. The rectangle should be a few inches less than the length and width of the tank. Cut two small holes at each end of the rectangle. The holes should line up with the suction cups. Place string through the holes and make loops. Hang the hammock by placing the loops over the hooks that are on the suction cups.You want the hammock to sag a little bit so place the suction cups 1/2 to 2 inches above where you want the hammock to be.
Make sure the holes you place in the cloth are in the right position. Hold the ends of the hammock up against the tank before you pierce the cloth.;
, Twist bio-vine into four small vines. The bottom three vines will serve as the tree legs and the other vine will be your tree trunk. Attach silk leaves to the vine by unwinding the vine and creating small openings to fit the leaves in. Place the leaves in the slits you have made. Once the leaves are in position, re-twist the vine to secure the leaves to the vine.Do not use glue to secure the leaves. Glue is toxic for your hermit crab. Twisting the vines around the leaves is enough to keep them secure.
Add as many or as few leaves as you like. The tree will look more realistic if there are more leaves.
Your crab will enjoy climbing on the tree and hiding under the leaves.
All of these items can be found at your local pet store.
Tie fishing line or cotton thread to the stems of your tree and then tie the tree to a piece of driftwood. Bury the driftwood and the bottom of the tree stem in the substrate to keep the tree upright and from floating., Your hermit crab will enjoy having some driftwood in its habitat. Only use dry driftwood in the tank. Look for pieces that have a lot of texture and enough space for your crab to climb and play.Remove the driftwood when you clean your crab's tank. Wash the driftwood with hot water and put it in the microwave to dry. Do not use soap or detergent to clean the driftwood. These chemicals can be harmful for your crab.
Dried choya wood, coral, and barnacles can also be placed in your crab's tank as well."

Make a playground for your crabs so they can play.,
You can also make a ""rock pile"" for your hermit to explore, but don't use the rocks as the substrate because you can break their legs that way, instead use a bed of sand or cocoa fiber.,
Take them out of their tank and set them down on a clean smooth surface so they can get used to their new playground, make sure you supervise them at first to make sure nothing is wrong and that all is well.,
Think of games for your hermit, such as hiding its favorite food and encouraging them to find it; this will encourage your hermits to explore more as they are natural scavengers..

Hermit crabs are active.,
Try holding your hermit crab in the palm of your hand and keep it flat.,
Don't force them to do anything, just let them take it in their own stride.,
If your hermit crab does pinch you, do not run him/her under water, it really bothers him/her, because of the chlorine, chloramines and metals.,
Hermit crabs do best in pairs.,
Some hermit crabs die because they get thrown around and played with too roughly or too much.,
Never try to force a hermit crab to come out of its shell.,
When a hermit crab is dead, it falls out of its shell and smells like fish.,
When making a playground you can get two square pieces of cardboard and put rubber bands across them and then glue the two pieces together.",How to Play With Your Hermit Crab," Be sure to watch your hermit crabs if you do this. They escape easily and you will most likely not be able to find them. Every time you take a small crab out and place it on the floor, it will disappear, as if by magic, the second you turn away.;
, You can add some other toys, such as small balls, building blocks, etc

, If they happen to be sick or hurt, place them back into their habitat and keep the habitat crab friendly so he or she can recover.

,, Let them walk around. Don't use a hamster ball. This is because their legs can get stuck in the holes and break off.

, Every time it almost goes over the edge of your hand, move your other hand to the side he/she is walking towards. It's a great way to exercise your hermit crab, and have fun too.

, If you force them to do a lot, they will want to go back into their cage or worse, become stressed out.

, Tap water can be fatal to your hermit crab, because of chlorine in the water. Just set him down on the floor or in his cage, and he will let go.

, If it's just them alone, they will get lonely.

, Do not treat them this way. They will hate you and never want to be handled by you.

, They would rather die than be forced out, and a lot of the time they do die when made to move.

, If a hermit crab falls out of its shell and doesn't smell, it is molting. The thing that fell out of the shell is just an exoskeleton. Some people suggest removing the non-molters and placing them somewhere special while the molter molts, but it is probably not necessary. Keep the tank extra humid, and leave the exoskeleton inside. The crab will eat the exoskeleton when it is done molting. For more information on molting, see Hermit Crabs for Dummies.

, This can be a climbing frame and a hut for your crab.

Use play sand to line the bottom.,
Add a cup of water to the sand.,
Place food and water dishes in the isolation tank.,
Do not move a crab that has already begun molting.,
Leave your crab alone.,
Make sure the crab has darkness.,
Protect a molting crab that doesn’t bury itself.,
Avoid cleaning your isolation tank unless it is empty.",How to Take Care of a Molting Hermit Crab," When molting, hermit crabs completely bury themselves in the sand. A hermit crab that is preparing to molt will likely start to dig a lot more than usual. If you notice your crab is digging or beginning to bury itself in the substrate in the bottom of the tank, gently remove him and get him into the isolation tank.Keep a close eye on your crabs. Observing their behavior on a regular basis is the only way to know if any of those behaviors are changing!;
, When preparing to molt, hermit crabs will store food and water. Since the crab essentially “hibernates” while molting, it’s important for them to store food and water to sustain itself as it molts down in the sand. You may notice, then, that your crab is spending more time in its water bowls, or consuming more food than usual. This is a good sign that your crab is about to molt.You just might notice a gel-like black bubble forming on the crab’s abdomen. This is where it is storing the food and water for its molting process. It’s hard to see very well, though, and its appearance is not always a surefire indicator that the crab is about to molt., A crab that is molting or preparing to molt might show less signs of activity. Sometimes, crab owners may mistake a molting crab for a dead crab. A dead crab, though, will have a rather distinct, fishy smell. A molting crab won’t have that smell. If the crab is moving more slowly or hardly at all, check for other signs of molting and move it to an isolation tank.Remember: sometimes a crab that has just molted may also give off a fishy odor, so the smell isn’t always the best way to determine death. A dead crab will also show indications of decay, like mold growing on its abdomen., A simple ten gallon aquarium from your local pet supply store will suffice. You want the tank to be big enough to give the crab sufficient room to bury itself. But, since the crab will be in the tank alone, you won’t need anything more than 10 gallons.Save this tank especially for molting crabs. If you have multiple crabs, use this tank for the crabs individually as they molt.
If you have multiple crabs molting at the same time, try to keep them separated from crabs that aren’t molting. They should be okay to molt together in the same isolation tank—just keep an eye on them and make sure one doesn’t complete its molting and end up trying to attack the other while its still molting.

, A hermit crab must be completely buried in order to go through the molting process. Your tank should have a minimum of 6 inches of sand. This will provide an adequate amount of depth and space for your molting crab to bury itself. Play sand is your best option, since it’s the right texture and consistency for the crab.

, Mix the sand and water well, and add more water as needed until the sand is thoroughly moistened. When getting the sand to the right consistency, you want it to be damp, but not dripping or muddy. It should be moist enough to pack down.Try digging out a small circular hole with your finger in the sand. If the sides of the hole stay put, you’re probably in good shape.

, When molting, hermit crabs will need food that is high in calcium. Some good options might be cuttlebones, sea biscuits, or sand dollars. In the water dish, the usual dechlorinated tap water is fine. You might consider putting a bit of saline water in with their normal water, though, as the crab will be craving a little more salt than usual after their molt., Sometimes, a hermit crab may bury itself in the sand of its normal tank to molt while you, its owner, are sleeping at night. Digging up a molting crab to put it in an isolation tank can cause undue stress to the crab, and could possibly injure or kill it. You have to be the best judge of whether or not your crab needs an isolation tank to molt. If you have multiple crabs and are concerned about the other crabs attacking the molting crab while it’s weak, you might go ahead and opt for the isolation tank.If your primary tank has an undertank heater, your crabs should not be allowed to molt in that tank. This could be harmful to them.Some hermit crabs may also try to molt on the surface, without burying itself. Sometimes, this is fine, and the crab does well. Keep a watchful eye on any crabs that attempt this.

, One of the best things you can do for your molting hermit crab is to leave it alone. Handling the crab, digging it up, or otherwise disturbing it as it goes through the molting process could actually cause substantial harm to the crab. It’s best to keep the molting environment as close as possible to the one they would have in nature, which means leaving them alone to molt.If you think for some reason that another crab might be disturbing or bothering the buried molting crab, you can carefully dig it up to check on its well-being., In order to go through the molting process, hermit crabs need darkness. This is why they bury themselves in the sand when they molt. If the crab stays on the surface and doesn’t bury itself, or if it doesn’t bury itself completely, cover the tank with a light cloth to provide some extra darkness.Darkness is what helps trigger the crab’s production of a molting hormone that they need to successfully go through the molting process. Without adequate darkness, they may have difficulty molting., If you do have a hermit crab that doesn’t bury itself and begins to molt, it’s important to protect the crab, and to help simulate proper molting conditions. Cut the top half off of a regular 2 liter soda bottle. Rinse the bottle clean. With the lid of the bottle pointing upwards, cover the crab with the bottle and press the bottom down into the sand a bit. You can then cover the bottle, or the whole tank, with a cloth for darkness. , Hermit crabs will actually eat most or all of the exoskeleton they shed when they molt, so cleaning up after them is a minimal process. To avoid unnecessarily disturbing a molting crab, don’t clean the isolation tank unless there are no crabs in it. To clean it after returning a molted crab to the primary tank, simply clean out any leftover exoskeleton pieces, and stir up the sand a bit. Add a little water if necessary to retain the necessary consistency. This kind of cleaning should be done every three months or so."

Buy a 5–10 gallon (18.9–37.9 L) fish tank.,
Put sand in the tank.,
Place decorations in the tank, like rocks and miniature logs.,
Get a food bowl and a water bowl.,
Hermit crab cages usually need a heater.,
Give your hermit crab a bath at least once a week.,
Play with it every once in a while.,
Replace the sand 2-3 times a year.",How to Take Care of a Land Hermit Crab," Allow a lot of room for them to roam around in.;
, You should put enough sand so that a hermit crab could fully cover itself with it.

, Hermit crabs love to hide,so make hiding places. Also do not block the corners of the tank because they love to bury themselves in the sand near the corners because they feel safe.

, Make sure that the bowls are big enough for them to get right in.


Replace their food every day. Hermit crabs like many foods, including rice, grapes, peanut butter, pasta, tortilla chips, apple slices, dead crickets, and pretty much everything. These creatures are not very picky. You can also feed them hermit crab food from the pet store. The pet store food doesn't need to be changed every day but make sure they have nice fresh feeling and looking food to eat.
Replace their water every 2 to 3 days with room temperature bottled spring water. You can also put a sponge in their water bowl, so that they will have something to get a drink out of and climb on.

, But not usually the kinds that you get from the pet store.

, Put it in a bowl of bottled spring water for 15-30 seconds. Then, put it back in it's tank. But this is not mandatory.

, Don't let it roam your desk or table. It is very easy for hermit crabs to fall off, or get hurt. Never let your crab be in direct sunlight because their limbs will start to fall off and they will die.

, Be sure that you need to take care of crabs like any other pet, especially when the cage has defecates in it.

Determine the size tank you’ll need.,
Add a lid.,
Choose the decor.,
Include an aquarium filter, heater, air stones, and thermometer.,
Get a UVB light.,
Set the tank in a well-lit area.,
Create a mounded surface in the tank.,
Add the remaining decor items.,
Fill the tank with room temperature brackish water.,
Perform daily maintenance checks.,
Test the water quality on a weekly basis.,
Change 10-25% of the water on a biweekly or monthly basis.By changing the water, you dilute the nitrates and ammonia in the water, as well as remove other toxins and pollutants that may build up in the tank.Scoop out the old tank water using a vessel like a large cup or small bucket, and add an equal volume of new tap water back into the tank.

,
Clean the filter.,
Check for holes in the tank lid.",How to Set Up a Tank for Your Red Clawed Crab," Most likely a tank between 5 and 20 gallons will be appropriate. The volume you choose will depend on the size and number of crabs. An overcrowded tank can lead to stress and disease in a crab. The recommendation is no more than one crab per square foot., The tank will need a secure lid, as crabs like to climb and can do so on almost any surface, including tubing. The lid will prevent the crab from escaping the tank., Red-clawed crabs like to climb, hide, and dig, so you need to provide them with items to interact with, such as:Slopes
Driftwood
Plants
Rocks
Caves
Pebbles
Sand

, These are tools you’ll need to keep your tank clean, warm, and oxygenated. Buy them along with the tank to make sure they are compatible. Some tanks might come with some of these tools attached., Red-clawed crabs are nocturnal but require 10-12 hours of daylight during summer and 8-10 hours during the winter months. The UVB light makes sure they get the exposure they need to stay healthy., Positioning near a window or other light source will help the crabs get the light they need to stay healthy., Though red-clawed crabs are aquatic, they do breathe air. These means they’ll need high areas above the water line that they can reach by walking or climbing. You can create this with the decor items, or add a ramp for this specific purpose., Put the pebbles/sand at the bottom of your tank. Layer on the the hideaways and plants. Remember, hiding spaces make the crab feel secure, so place them in accessible spots and make sure they’re large enough for your crab.

, Though red-clawed crabs are freshwater creatures, they thrive in lightly salted water. Mix 1 teaspoon of sea salt per litre of 72-82°F water, and add it to the tank. Make sure to leave some areas above the waterline which the crab can reach to breathe., To ensure that the tank is clean, warm, and oxygenated, you will need to conduct daily tests of:the filter to make sure it is not clogged
the thermometer to make sure that the water temperature is 72-82°F
the tubing to make sure there is no damage

, You will need to use a test kit to check the pH level of the water in the tank.For red-clawed crab, the pH level should be between 7.5 and 8.5.You can purchase test kits from a pet care store.

,, Your filter may be mechanical, chemical, or biological. It will need to be cleaned every 1-2 months, depending on the type of filter. The cleaning will likely involve rinsing of the sponge or pads and scrubbing of the casing and tubes. Specific instructions for cleaning your filter will be included in the owner’s manual. Follow these to guarantee the filter continues to function properly., With their climbing abilities, red-clawed crabs are quite capable of escaping through holes in the lid. Repair them if possible, or replace the lid if necessary."
"
Make sure the substrate is deep enough.,
Use sand.,
Use coconut fiber.",How to Make Toys for a Hermit Crab2," Hermit crabs love to dig, tunnel and bury themselves. Not only is playing in substrate fun for your crab, the substrate provides the right environment for your crab to molt (i.e. shed exoskeleton, grow). The depth of the substrate should be 3 to 4 times the size of your crab's shell and be able to retain moisture.If your crab is the size of a dime, penny, or quarter, you will need at least 6 inches of substrate.
If your crab is the size of a golf ball, use 6 to 8 inches of substrate.
If your crab is the size of a tennis ball, use 8 to 10 inches of substrate.
If your crab is larger than a baseball, use at least 12 inches of substrate.

, Any type of sand is fine for your crab as long as it is clean. Most sand that you buy will be pre-washed and/or pre-sanitized. Pour some of the sand into a small bowl before you put it in your crab's tank and check for insects.


If you notice any strange smells when you open the bag of sand, do not put the sand in the tank. The sand may be moldy.
Sand is very affordable and your crab will enjoy playing in it., Coconut fiber (i.e. Forest Bedding, Eco-Earth) comes as a hard brick when you purchase it, and it must be prepared before you place it in the tank. Place the brick in a large bowl and fill the bowl with water until you can break the brick apart with your hands. Add the coconut fiber to the tank while it is moist.Your hermit crab will probably eat some of the coconut fiber. This is perfectly fine as it contains minerals that they need.
You can also use pre-prepared salt water to fix your coconut fiber.
Coconut fiber attracts fungus gnats. If you notice tiny black bugs in the tank, you need to clean the tank and replace the substrate.
You can also combine sand and coconut fiber. Use a 5:1 ration of sand to coconut fiber."
"
Make a plastic cave.,
Make a clay hiding place.,
Have multiple hiding places.,
Test and treat your rocks.,
Care for hideout toys.",How to Make Toys for a Hermit Crab3," Use PVC pipe to make a cave for your crab. Cut the PVC pipe in half and bury it in the substrate to make cave.You can bury the pipe horizontally or vertically. You can also place the cut pipes side by side for a different look.


If the PVC is untreated, rinse it with clean water before you place it into the crab's tank.
Make sure the cave is big enough for your crab to move in and out of it.

, Purchase a new, untreated terracotta flower plot as a hiding place. Place the flower pot on its side and dig it into the substrate so that it is secure. You can also make your own pottery piece to put in the tank. Only use natural clay without additives when making your own pottery pieces.Do not paint, glaze, or glue any of the clay pieces. These chemicals are harmful to your crab.
Use sand paper to remove any rough edges from your pot and wash it with hot water to get rid of dust., Hermit crabs enjoy a variety of places to hide and play. Incorporate different materials and shapes into your crab's habitat. An even mix of open space and hiding space is ideal.Your crab may prefer some toys to others so you can adjust the habitat based on your crab's personality and preferences.


Fake plants, vines, and rocks can also be used for hiding places.
You could also attach rocks to a the outside of a clay pot or PVC pipe cave. If you use rocks, attach them using aquarium safe silicone only., If you collect rocks instead of purchasing them from the pet store, you need to make sure they are safe to place in the tank. Wash and scrub the rocks and pour vinegar on them. If the rocks bubble, they are not safe to use. Place the other rocks in a bucket of water with 1-2 cups of bleach. Allow the rocks to soak for 24 hours. After 24 hours, rinse the rocks and soak them in a bucket of clean water for 48 hours.During the 48 hour soak, change the clean water every 12 hours to make sure that the bleach is gone.
Boil the rocks for 6-8 hours in a large pot of fresh water, rinse them, and allow them to cool before you use them.
If you do not want to go through this process, you can purchase rocks from the pet store that have already been sanitized.

, Transfer your crab to a small plastic container with a little bit of sand and remove the toys. Wipe the toys using warm, dechlorinated water. Some toys (i.e. drift wood and rocks) can be boiled for a few minutes to kill bacteria. Other toys (i.e. plastic caves, plastic plants) should not be boiled, just wipe them down. Allow the toys to dry completely before you place them back in the tank.Never use tap water to clean the toys. Hermit crabs are sensitive to chlorine found in most tap water. Also avoid using and soaps or chemicals because they are harmful for your crab.
Toys should be cleaned every 2 weeks to prevent mold and bacteria from growing on them.

Find a busy spot, but not too busy.",How to Set up a Crabitat," Crabs can be adversely affected by rapid changes in temperature and humidity. Be sure that the crabitat is completely set up and stabilized prior to bringing your new pets home., For two medium-sized crabs, the aquarium should be at least 10 gallons. Two large crabs or several medium sized crabs will require a larger tank, maybe 30 or 40 gallons.Crabs can escape if the tank does not have a secure lid. Glass or plexiglass is preferable.There are two types of glass tanks, terrariums and aquariums. Buy an aquarium, because many terrariums are not strong enough to hold the amount of substrate necessary for a crab.

, Wipe down the tank with a towel and cleaner that is not dangerous for animals. Consider using a mixture of vinegar and water. Mix the two evenly and the dunk your towel in the solution. After you are done, wipe it down with a dry towel to pick up moisture., Many heaters are housed under the tank. Thus, it is better to attach these before you fill it up so you don’t have to lift a heavy tank. Specifications for how to attach the heater vary depending upon the heater., There needs to be enough substrate in the tank that the crab can dig and hide itself completely under the sand. The amount necessary varies somewhat depending upon the size of the crab. The best substrate is a mixture of coconut fiber and sand. Mix approximately 5 parts sand to one part coconut oil.


Prepare coconut fiber according to directions on the box. Then mix it carefully with sand until the coconut fiber is well distributed throughout the substrate. Crabs normally dig in sand and love it as substrate. However, coconut fiber is better at retaining humidity, which is important in an artificial crabitat.
For crabs the size of a quarter or smaller you should have at least six inches of substrate.
For crabs about the size of a golf ball, you should have about six to eight inches of substrate.
Crabs as large as a tennis ball require eight to ten inches of substrate.
Anything larger than a baseball will require at least 12 inches of substrate, possibly more., Attach these so that you can begin getting the tank to an appropriate humidity and temperature. Specifications for how to attach these instruments vary depending upon the model.Crabs need moist, humid air to breathe properly. To be sure that the air is sufficiently moist, get a hygrometer to test the air. Relative humidity levels should always be between 60 to 80 percent in the crabitat.Crabs prefer a temperature of approximately 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). Install the thermometer to be sure that the temperature remains around this temperature.

, The tank should have a relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent. Soaking sand is a dangerous way to accomplish. Get a hand mister and spray it in the tank until it the hygrometer reads an acceptable humidity level. Alternatively, consider purchasing a fogger or humidifier.Depending on the humidity in your area, you might find that keeping up the humidity with a hand mister can be very laborious. If that is the case, a fogger or humidifier might be better, but be sure to monitor it to make sure that it is not flooding the tank.
Using coconut fiber substrate and a glass lid for the tank will help it retain humidity.

, Try to keep the tank at about 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use an automatic heater. However, a lamp can also help raise the temperature of the tank. If you are using a lamp, try to position it so that it does not shine on the entire area and the crab get out of the heat if it chooses.Consider getting a heater that can automatically turn off once it registers that the tank has reached the desired temperature., When the temperature and the humidity are acceptable in the tank, put your crabs in the tank. Watch them explore their new home!

, The tank should have a dish for fresh and salt water. The dishes should be big enough that your crab can submerge itself completely in them, but not so big that it can’t get in and out of it. Fill the bowls with dechlorinated water.


The salt water bowl should be filled with a mixture of dechlorinated water and aquarium salt mix. You cannot mix table salt into the water., Crabs love to climb over objects, so you should fill the crabitat with plenty of good toys. Appropriate toys include wooden and plastic houses, jagged rocks, driftwood, and fake plants. Be sure that the tank is large enough to accommodate the toys without overcrowding your crabs., Crabs love to change shells, so there should be a few in the crabitat to play with. Only use shells that have been cleaned and sanitized.Crabs typically prefer shells that fit snugly, without only a little bit of extra room. Be sure to get a shell with an opening about 1/8 to ¼ an inch bigger than the crabs claw. Experiment with a few sizes to see what your crab prefers.
Some crabs prefer shells that have round openings, whereas other prefer a D-shaped opening. Purple Pinchers generally prefer round openings. Ecuadorians generally prefer D-shaped openings. Watch to see which your carb seems to prefer.
Never give a crab a painted shell. This can be hazardous to their health., You need to ensure that the tank is at a steady, acceptable temperature. If it is near a vent, it can be exposed to gusts of cold air that are dangerous for the crabs., Whether it is near a window or outside, keep the tank away from direct sunlight. Crabs don’t much care for sunlight and it can heat the tank up dangerously., It is best to keep your crabs somewhere you will see them often, so that you can check up on them. However, don’t put them someplace where you use sprays that are hazardous to them, like hair spray, cologne, and room deodorants. They should be loud and rowdy at night, so you might want to refrain from putting them in your bedroom.

Purchase a variety of fruits and veggies.,
Harvest some leaves and bark.,
Add some form of protein.,
Avoid pesticides.,
Mix everything together.",How to Make Hermit Crab Food1," Visit your local grocery store or farmers market and purchase some fresh fruits and vegetables. (Organic produce is best, if possible.) Pick up some lettuce, kiwifruit, banana, bell peppers, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, or any other fruits and veggies you like. Wash them thoroughly, and cut them up into very small pieces.Hermit crabs cannot eat citrus fruits (lemon, lime). It is toxic to them.
They also don't like herbs (peppermint, rosemary).
They tend to avoid ""Prunus fruits"" or ""stone fruits"" (cherries, apricots, plums).;
, If you have oak trees or red maple trees in your area, these trees provide a great source of nutrition for your hermit crab. Harvest a few oak leaves and some oak bark, or some red maple leaves. Be sure to wash your leaves and bark in dechlorinated water.Oak trees have leaves with a ""lobe and sinus"" pattern.
Maple leaves have three ""fingers"" (think of the Canadian flag).
Oak trees drop acorns, while maple trees drop ""helicopters.""

, In addition to fruit and veggies, it is crucial for hermit crabs to have some form of protein everyday. Your crab may enjoy cooked lean beef, chicken, salmon, or shrimp. Or you can add dried plankton, krill or any other dried sea creatures (available at most pet stores).Be sure the protein you provide has not been seasoned with spices or table salt.

, Your hermit crab can eat almost any kind of vegetables or fruit, but they are very sensitive to fertilizers and pesticides. Whenever possible, you should seek out organic produce and untreated leaves/bark. If this is not possible, all produce should be washed thoroughly in dechlorinated water., Combine a ¼ cup of chopped fruits and veggies with ¼ cup of protein. Add a few leaves or bark (if possible), and 1 tsp. of sea salt. Mix everything together. Serve 1/3 of this mix to your hermit crab each night and refrigerate the rest.Note that sea salt is different from conventional table salt. Sea salt contains natural, unrefined minerals that are healthy for your crab, whereas table salt does not.

Pay attention to your dog's behavior.,
Check the dog's scruff.,
Check the dog's gums.,
Check your dog's urine.,
See a veterinarian.,
Keep an eye on the water supply.,
Make sure the dog drinks regularly.,
Beware of diarrhea.,
Watch for vomiting.",How to Determine if a Dog Is Dehydrated," A dehydrated dog with the energy to do so will typically seek water to drink. If your dog is dehydrated, you may notice unusual behavior, such as restlessness or pacing, as if looking for water.Your dog may repeatedly lick its lips and/or have an anxious facial expression if it is unable to find enough water.Some dehydrated dogs will also lie with their nose resting against their water bowl.;
, The classic dehydration test that you've probably seen the vet do at the animal clinic is lifting the dog's scruff. What this test actually measures is the skin's elastic recoil, which decreases with dehydration.To do this test yourself, take the following steps:


Locate the dog's scruff. This is the loose skin over the dog's shoulders or at the back of its neck.
Elevate the scruff. Grasp the skin and gently raise it two to three inches above the dog's back in a vertical direction.
Release the scruff and observe. Fully hydrated skin springs back instantaneously. When dehydration is present, the skin is less elastic, which means it will not fall back as quickly.
If the skin takes more than two seconds to return to normal, the dog is dehydrated., Gums are a good indicator of early dehydration. Normal gums are moist and shiny, much like our own. Dehydrated animals often have dry or tacky feeling gums, because they produce less saliva.Be aware that anxious or frightened animals may also have dry gums. Make sure your dog is relaxed when you check the gums or you can be misled., If a dog does not take in enough water, its body will automatically take steps to preserve fluid. In this situation, it either will not urinate because its bladder is empty, or the urine it produces will be very concentrated. Concentrated urine is a deep yellow color.This occurs because the dog's kidneys are working hard to recycle water in the body and hold onto it.Take note if your dog seems be urinating less than usual or if its urine is an unusual color.

, If your dog seems healthy and there is a simple explanation for your dog's condition, such as an empty water bowl, give the dog water and watch for signs of improvement. If however, the dog is dehydrated and seems sick, or if providing water doesn't help, contact your veterinarian.Some dehydrated animals need to receive fluids through an IV in order to protect their organ functions while they rehydrate., There are many circumstances that can cause a dog to become dehydrated, but the most obvious and easy to control is your dog's access to water.


If the dog drinks all of its water, or its water bowl gets knocked over and it is left without a refill for a long period of time, this can result in dehydration. Make sure your dog has ample water, especially on hot days.Dehydration can occur quickly, sometimes within an hour or so depending on the temperature., Even if your dog has access to water, it will become dehydrated if it doesn't drink it often enough. Keep an eye on your dog to make sure it visits the water bowl frequently.


For example, an older dog that suffers from arthritis and is too sore to get up and drink when it is thirsty is at risk of becoming dehydrated.The problem is made worse if the dog has other health problems such as diabetes or renal disease, because its body will tend to produce a lot of urine. A dog with these problems will lose fluid at a faster rate than a healthy animal. This form of dehydration is chronic, which means it develops slowly over several days and is likely to reoccur.Likewise, if a dog is ill and stops eating and drinking due to a lack of appetite, it is at risk of dehydration.

, Watery feces contains a lot of fluid, which means more rapid loss of water, and thus an increased risk of dehydration.If the dog is drinking enough, the risk of dehydration is reduced. A dog without access to water or with no desire to drink, however, can become dehydrated very quickly if suffering from diarrhea., Vomiting can be a serious problem because the dog is unable to retain any water it drinks.Closely watch a dog that is vomiting, and contact the veterinarian if you suspect he is dehydrated or if the condition occurs often.

Visit your local health food store.,
Purchase a variety of foods.,
Look in your pantry.,
Mix everything together.",How to Make Hermit Crab Food2," If you’d like to make your hermit crab a snack (in addition to his daily meal), it is as easy as a quick trip to your local health food store. You will want a store with a bulk section (such as Whole Foods), this way, you can buy just a little bit of each item, and it will be inexpensive for you., You can make a hermit crab snack from a mix of unsalted nuts, whole grains, unsweetened dried fruits, and seeds. You may also want to include nutritional yeast for added B vitamins. You only need a little bit of each item (1/4 cup or less).Nuts: pistachios, walnuts, or almonds.
Grains: oats, wheat bran, wild rice, or amaranth.
Dried fruits: mango, goji berries, pineapple, coconut, or raisins.
Seeds: pumpkin, chia, or sesame.
Choosing unsalted and unsweetened varieties is very important because table salt and processed sugar can be harmful to your crab.

, If you do not have access to a health foods bulk section, or if you just want to make the most of what you already have, take a look in your pantry at home. Look for any of the food items above, or for other healthy options.Look for oats, granola, whole grain crackers, raisins, or nuts.
Once again, read labels to watch out for added table salt or sugar.

, Take all the dry foods you have purchased or found in your pantry, and mix them all together. If using granola or whole grain crackers, crumble them up or use crumbs from the bottom of the bag.Since these foods are not considered perishable, you can place some of this food in the “crabitat” and allow it stay for 3-4 days, or until your hermit crab finishes it.

Avoid processed foods.,
Make some hardboiled eggs.,
Pop some popcorn.,
Give your crab cuttlebone.,
Try adding spirulina powder.,
Make sure they have clean water.",How to Make Hermit Crab Food3," When selecting food for your hermit crab, understand that your crab can eat almost any whole, unprocessed food. Food with added table salt and added sugar (such as chips, cookies, or fast food) can have a negative impact on your crab. These foods can cause digestive distress or even illness in your crab. Do not give your crab processed food., Another favorite source or protein for hermit crabs is hardboiled eggs. This can be served as part of a meal, or as a snack. Be sure to let it cool off quite a bit before offering a hardboiled egg to your crab.Simply place eggs in a small pot and cover with water.
Bring to a boil and let simmer for 8 minutes.
Some crabs may also enjoy scrambled eggs.

, Popcorn is a wholesome food that can be given to your hermit crab as a treat. The healthiest popcorn is air-popped without oil, but any plain popcorn (without butter) can be an enjoyable snack for your hermit crab., A cuttlebone is the flattened oval internal skeleton of the cuttlefish. Dried cuttlebones can be purchased at pet stores to feed birds, hermit crabs, and other animals. Place a whole cuttlebone in your crab’s tank for him to nibble on, or crush one up and include it in his meal., Spirulina powder is a dense super-food powder made from blue-green algae. This powder can be added to your crab’s food to supplement him with amino acids, protein, iron, and vitamins B, C, D and E.Spirulina powder is available at any health food store.

, Provide clean, filtered water for your crab to drink. Additionally, make a saltwater bowl available to him about once a week. You will want to replace the water in the fresh water dish each day to make sure your crab stays healthy."

Talk to a doctor.,
Establish one allergy free zone.,
Wash your hands after touching a dog.,
Keep the dog away from areas where you sleep.,
Have windows open as much as possible.",How to Deal with Dog Allergies1," There are many treatments options regarding dog allergies. Also, unless you have been previously diagnosed, you should not assume allergies are related to your dog. Have an allergy test to see if actually have an allergy to dander.Say something like, ""I have an allergy and I think it's to the family pet. Could we do some tests to confirm and then talk over treatment options?""
There are also medical treatments, such as steroids, immunotherapy shots, and antihistamine sprays and pills.;
, If you have allergies and are living with a dog, you need at least one area of your home to retreat to when symptoms flare up. Being exposed to an allergen 24/7 can make symptoms worse.The allergy free zone should be an area where the dog is never allowed. It's best if it's the allergic person's bedroom, as you don't want allergies bothering you in your sleep.
Use high quality HEPA air filters in this room.
Clean the room frequently. Sweep, mop, or dust the floors and wash any kind of bedding, like pillowcases and sheets.

, Touching your skin, particularly sensitive areas, after petting a dog can easily trigger an allergic reaction. After you pet the dog, wash your hands immediately. This can help minimize your reaction.Wash your hands with soap and water, making sure to scrub them thoroughly for 20 seconds before rinsing.
Allergens are part of a dog's dander, so hand washing after touching a dog is important.

, You should never allow a dog in your bedroom if you have allergies. Sleeping in a room exposed to allergens can greatly worsen your symptoms. Have a standing rule that the dog is not allowed in the bedroom.Unfortunately, if you live in a studio apartment or loft, you probably cannot keep a dog if you're allergic.

, A well-ventilated home will help remove allergens. When possible, keep windows open. If you have a screen door in place, keep the door opened to the screen side to let air into the room."

Gather a batch of soft vegetables like squash, zucchini, or several pieces of leaves of lettuce, spinach, or celery leaves.,
Wash your veggies!,
Shred your vegetables.,
Soften your vegetables.,
Let the vegetables cool down.,
Feed your crabs!",How to Make Fiddler Crab Food1," If you can, get organic veggies to reduce the possibility of feeding your crabs pesticides. If you are unable get organic, regular is still acceptable.


Scraps of vegetables, if not contaminated with raw meat or other substances, are a great way to use otherwise trashed food. Just make sure they aren't rotting.;
, Use special vegetable wash, not regular soap, or make your own. Combine a cup of tap water, a tablespoon of lemon juice, and two tablespoons of white vinegar to use as a soak or spray-on type of wash.Soak for ten minutes, then rinse.


Washing is especially important for those using non-organic food.
Tougher types of vegetables can withstand scrubbing; but, some leaves are too soft for this.
If you get pre-washed, organic vegetables, you can skip this step, unless you want to wash it.
Non-organic vegetables with skin should be peeled and washed, as much of the pesticides are found on/in the surface.

, For big vegetables like zucchini, dice up the flesh into tiny pieces. Each shred or piece should be no bigger than your pinky nail.

, In a microwave safe container, microwave your vegetables in some purified drinking water for a minute. It is important not to use tap water so that chlorine or heavy metals aren't ingested by your crabs.


Use small pieces of vegetable so that you don't have to microwave them for a long time.

, You can drain the water off (be careful if it is hot), put the solids in a plastic bag, and stick it in the freezer for a maximum of fifteen minutes.

, Stick a few shreds into the water (you might have to stick them in the sand or in a bowl if the pieces float around) daily and replace daily. Freeze any extra for later, and thaw them by microwaving for thirty seconds.

Consider adding coconut fiber to your hermit crab's home.,
Take extra steps to ensure the correct habitat.,
Ensure that the water you are placing in the habitat, including the water in the sponge, is de-chlorinated.,
Finished.

",How to Maintain Humidity in a Pet Hermit Crab Habitat," One key step to ensure that your hermit crab's home maintains constant humidity is to ensure that their habitat is properly set up. Avoid using the plastic homes hermit crabs are often placed in at pet stores. Instead, strongly consider buying an aquarium. The smallest enclosure you should use for two small to medium sized hermit crabs is a 10 gallon aquarium.;
, Once you have the proper cage, you can choose to cover the aquarium with a wire covering or with glass. If you have humidity issues in your habitat, consider a glass covering. However, a wire covering should be okay.

, Hermit crabs enjoy burrowing, particularly when they are molting. Playground sand, which you can find at most home improvement stores, is cheap and is generally a good burrowing option for hermit crabs.


Consider baking this sand to ensure that bacteria and mold are killed before they enter the habitat (first rinse, and then bake for a half hour at 300°F). If you want only the best for your pet, consider pure calcium carbonate. Different sands retain different amounts of moisture. Play sand can retain moisture well but it can also mold, which is why it's important to clean your hermit crab's habitat monthly (check for mold, replace dirty substrate). A substrate that seems to handle mold well and retains moisture remarkably well is coconut fiber.

, This can be found at any pet store. Hermit crabs tend to love burrowing in this, particularly while molting. Be sure to follow the product instructions and properly moisten the coconut fiber using dechlorinated water (chlorinated water, what you will find in your normal tap water, is harmful to hermit crabs).


Many hermit crab caretakers like to have one section of sand (a beach scene) and one section of coconut fiber (a jungle scene). Ideally, this substrate should be at least twice the height of your largest hermit crab. However, take precautions with newly adopted hermit crabs. Their bedding should only be half an inch deep to help them adjust to their new environment. This is sometimes referred to as ""weather therapy"".

, At this point, the substrate alone, particularly if you've added coconut fiber and have a glass lid, will keep your habitat at a decent humidity. However, to reach the ideal 80% humidity there are a few additional things you can do. Hermit crab caretakers often like to bring a moist, natural sponge into the habitat to add humidity.

, To ensure that mold or fungi do not grow on the sponge, replace the sponge daily; you can sterilize a used sponge by boiling it in dechlorinated water for a minimum of 15 minutes. 


To help retain moisture, you may also use a handy gadget called an airstone, which you can insert into one of your hermit crab's water bowls to create bubbles and therefore push moisture into the air. You may also want to moisten moss and add it to the tank. 
Finally, use a spray bottle with dechlorinated water to spray the tank should it drop below 70% humidity. Depending on the room environment where the hermit crab's habitat is located, you may need to spray once or twice daily.

Look to teeth to determine a puppy's age.,
Note changes in teeth for an older dog.,
Look for signs of aging.,
Examine your dog's eyes.,
Use fur color to determine age.,
Take your dog's size and breed into account.",How to Determine Your Dog's Age1," If you have a puppy, it's fairly easy to determine its age by examining its teeth. Teeth start developing during a puppy's first year. The stage of teeth development is tied to a puppy's approximate age.At one month old, teeth will have just started pushing through the gums.
At five months, a puppy will have a full set of teeth near the front of the mouth.
By seven months, a puppy will have developed molars in the back of the mouth.
When a puppy reaches a year old, you should notice ridges or bumps on both the lower and upper top front teeth.;
, As a dog ages, their teeth change. Changes in teeth can help you assess a dog's approximate age.Ridges on the top four incisors change as a dog ages. Between three and four, your dog will still have some ridges but they will have worn away considerably. A small amount of ridges on the front four teeth indicate your dog is between three and four.
By seven, a dog's teeth are completely smooth.

, Older dogs tend to be less energetic than younger dogs. Senior dogs often have small benign lumps on the body. They will also be less interested in playing than younger dogs. They are generally less muscular than younger dogs., Cloudy eyes are a sign of cataracts. If your dog shows other signs of aging, such as smooth teeth and low energy, cataracts can help you confirm your dog is older than seven. However, some dogs develop cataracts young due to genetic reasons., Fur color often changes as a dog ages. However, fur color is not the best means of determining age. However, when taken into account with other factors like teeth, fur may help determine a dog's age. Most dogs have some graying fur past the age of five. Graying hair is typically found around the muzzle.Some dogs gray as early as two, depending on their environment and genetic makeup. Fur color can help confirm a dog is older when taken into consideration alongside other factors, like teeth and activity level. It should not be used as the sole means to determine a dog's age.

, Larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans. They may show signs of aging younger than smaller dogs. Great Danes, for example, typically live around seven years while Chihuahuas live around 13 years. A bigger dog may show signs of aging early. In general, you can assume a big dog showing significant signs of aging is around six or seven while a small dog can be assumed to be ages 10 or up."

Bathe your dog on a weekly basis.,
Teach the dog to stay off furniture and carpeting.,
Keep your dog outdoors as much as possible.,
Have your dog brushed frequently.",How to Deal with Dog Allergies2," Most dogs do not need to be bathed frequently. However, if you're living with allergies, frequent bathing is vital to your health and well-being. Bathing your dog once a week can help reduce dander.Talk to your vet before you commit to bathing your dog, however. You may need a special shampoo if you're bathing your dog so frequently.

, Furniture and carpeting are particularly prone to retaining dander. If you have allergies, your dog should not be allowed on your furniture. If possible, restrict the dog to areas of your home that have wood or tile floors. It's easier to remove dander from these surfaces.If you see your dog getting on the furniture, give a command like ""Get down."" You may have to coax your dog off the furniture at first before they understand the command.
Reward your dog when it gets off the furniture after being told to do so. Eventually, your dog will learn to stay off the furniture.

, If you live in a warmer area, it's possible your dog could live outdoors much of the day. A fenced-in yard and quality dog house are a good investment. A dog that comes inside rarely is less likely to contaminate your home with allergens.Make sure to invest in a quality dog house with good insulation so your dog can stay warm. You also want to keep a cozy bed for your dog in the dog house.You should make sure your dog has an ID tag. There is always a chance of an outdoor dog escaping.
Keep in mind, this method is best for people with severe allergies and not all dogs will take to being outside so much.

, If you have allergies, it's best not to brush your dog alone. This could trigger a flare up. However, frequent brushing can reduce dander. Have a household member brush your dog each day to temper allergies.If you have a longhaired dog, it can also be helpful to take it to the groomers frequently to keep its hair short.

Invest in air filters.,
Keep cages clean.,
Close air registers.,
Clean often.",How to Deal with Dog Allergies3," High quality HEPA filters should be installed in every room in your home. They help remove allergens from the air. This can really help cut down on allergic reactions.If you can't afford to have filters in all your rooms, stick to the rooms you use most frequently. In the other rooms, you can ventilate by leaving doors and windows opened.

, If your dog has a cage or crate you keep in your home, this should be cleaned out frequently. Remove bedding from the cage and wash it. You should also wipe down the inside of the cage., Registers from heating vents and air conditioning can suck up a lot of pet dander. You should close these registers and replace them with air filters.If you cannot close all the registers, close them in the main rooms and the rooms where your dog goes most often.

, Cleaning is vital when it comes to reducing the amount of pet dander in your home. Thoroughly cleaning your home on a weekly basis can help reduce allergies.Work on dusting and vacuuming frequently, as this can efficiently remove pet dander. You should also mop and sweep places like hardwood floors.
Invest in a high quality vacuum with HEPA filters to remove dander from your home most efficiently.

Make weekly full body examinations a routine. Run your hands over every inch of your dog to feel for any lumps or bumps.Your dog will probably love this attention and may think it’s a massage.
Different types of skin cancer look different. With one common type, Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma, a bleeding sore appears that will not heal with creams or antibiotics. These sores usually appear white and are located in areas where the hair is light colored or white.;
, If you find a lump or bump on your dog’s skin carefully check over the rest of the dog’s body for further lumps. Use a centimeter graded ruler to measure the widest part of the lump and write the measurement down along with color and any other signs associated with the lump. Check the lump daily to see if it goes away.

, If the lump you have been monitoring doesn’t go away within a few days or grows in size, see your veterinarian. In addition, if you notice any of these symptoms call your veterinarian right away:Rapid increase in size
Swelling of surrounding skin
Redness of lump or skin around it
Ulceration
Drainage of fluid
Lump is itchy when touched or dog itches it

, Most lumps you find on dogs are just fatty tumors, not cancer.Remember that there are things that look like skin cancer but in fact aren't or aren't malignant. This is why it is so important to stay calm and get a professional opinion before suspecting the worst.


In fact, some of the most common types of skin cancer in dogs, such as Squamous cell carcinoma, do require surgical removal but do not usually require chemotherapy or radiation afterword., While the three main skin cancers of dogs all have their own characteristics, none of them can be definitively diagnosed from merely looking at them. A proper diagnosis is based upon close examination of the cells in a lump. In order to do this, a veterinarian will insert a thin needle into the suspicious lump, draw back on the needle to fill the needle with cells, and then examine those cells under a microscope.Sometimes a larger piece of the tumor (biopsy) or the entire tumor will need to be examined in order to find a correct diagnosis.

, Surgical removal is the most recommended, and in many cases curative, treatment. It is best to have the surgery done quickly after diagnosis in order to have the best possible outcome., More aggressive tumors may need to be followed up with radiation or chemotherapy treatment. These follow up treatments are needed in order to cure the cancer or, in some cases, to slow the cancer's growth and to give the dog a measure of relief from the on-going cancer progression.


Each case is different and only your veterinarian can help you to decide the best course of action.

, Mast cell tumors are the most common skin tumors in dogs. Almost one quarter of all skin tumors are this type.On the skin, mast cell tumors generally appear as raised solid raspberry like bumps but their appearance can vary. They are generally single lesions but in some cases there can be multiple lumps. Some of them can have ulcerated (raw appearing) skin.


Many times mast cell tumors itch and the surrounding skin is reddened.
Mast cells are blood cells that are part of the immune system and are produced in response to allergens and inflammation.Why some mast cells develop into tumors is not understood but they are more likely in dogs from 8-10 years of age and in certain breeds (pugs, boxers, Boston terriers, and Rhodesian ridgebacks)., Melanomas are tumors that arise from the pigmented cells in the skin. In dogs they are most common on the skin, toenails, and mouth. While the skin melanomas are usually benign (do not spread) the ones on the toes and mouth are usually aggressive, hard to treat, and frequently spread to other parts of the body.Melanomas occur more frequently on the head and front legs of older dogs.Schnauzers and Doberman Pinchers have a high rate of this type of tumor.
They are typically raised dark colored lumps. The ones in the mouth can interfere with eating, cause the dog to drool or bleed from the mouth and cause bad breath. Toenail melanomas can cause the toe to swell, the toenail to fall off, and make the dog limp.
Occasionally melanomas are NOT dark colored and will be the same color as the skin surrounding them.

, This type of skin cancer is less common in dogs than mast cell and melanoma tumors.In humans, it’s related to sun exposure but that isn’t really true in dogs, as their fur coats offer sun protection.


Dogs with little hair or light colored dogs can get sun-induced skin cancer, but this isn’t very common. As like the other types of skin cancer it is more common in middle-aged to older dogs.Squamous cell carcinomas can look like raised lumps with ulcerated skin.

Start out with washed produce: You can use leaves or soft fleshed vegetables.

,
Put all of your vegetables in a blender.,
Freeze your vegetables.,
Use the cubes to feed as a time-released diet for your crabs.",How to Make Fiddler Crab Food2,", Add a cup of drinking water for about four cups of vegetables. Pulse on and off frequently to avoid making veggie soup. You should have visible shreds of vegetable floating in water.


If you are using thick vegetables, you might want to cut them into smaller pieces before blending.
If the ratio of water to vegetable shreds is high, take some liquid out and strain out the solids, then add the strained vegetables back into the blender.

, When you have blended up a nice, non-soupy mix, use ice cube trays to freeze small portions of this vegetable blend. Freeze for at least 12 hours.

, Splitting a cube in half for smaller tanks is good, so you don't waste food. Stick a cube in shallow sand daily; it will melt and the crabs will be able to sift through the sand to find the food.

If using, soak dried bloodworms, brine shrimp, or pellets in some tank water until softened.

, It's best to use a combination of at least two foods to provide variety and nutrition. Mix with drinking water until you get a slightly thick soup.

, Freeze for 12 hours. You might want to use smaller ice cube molds, because this method packs quite a lot of food into a cube.

, Using the same method as the vegetable cubes, putting cubes a bit under the sand and wait for them to melt. Crabs will be more attracted to this kind of food, as non-vegetable food sources give off more of a ""there's food here"" smell that crabs can track.

Add 15 years for the first year.,
Add nine years for the second year.,
Add five years for each subsequent year.,
Keep in mind older breeds age faster.",How to Determine Your Dog's Age2," While conventional wisdom says you should multiply a dog's age by 7 to determine human years, dogs are well over 7-years-old by their first year. Most breeds of dogs are about 15-years-old in human years by the time they are one years old., By the time they are two, you can add nine additional years to your dog's age. Regardless of breed and size, most dogs are approximately 24 by the time they're two., As a general rule of thumb, you can add about five years to a dog's age for every subsequent year. By three, most dogs will be 28 in human years. By four, most dogs will be 32 in human years, and so on., Bigger breeds tend to age faster than normal breeds. While no one understand the precise reason for this, big dogs tend to have shorter lifespans. By around six, big to medium size breeds will age faster than smaller breeds. There is no precise gauge for determining a dog's human years, but most big breeds will be a few years older than small breeds.A Great Dane, for example, may start aging 10 to 12 years in human years after six as opposed to a smaller breed.At 8, a large breed like a Great Dane may be a considerably older than a smaller breed at 8.

Have your vet examine your dog.,
Get a blood panel done.,
Talk about keeping your dog young.",How to Determine Your Dog's Age3," If you're unsure of your dog's age, have your vet conduct an examination. Your vet can check things like teeth, hair, and eyes to get a rough sense of your dog's age. A vet will be more qualified to determine age based on physical factors than you., If you're really unsure of your dog's age, a blood panel may provide some insight. A vet can take a blood panel to determine the functions of organs like the kidneys and liver. A dog's organs will function differently at different ages.However, while this can give you a rough sense of your dog's age, your vet may only be able to determine an approximate age range. The only way to know your dog's age for sure is to know their birthday.

, If your dog is older or middle aged, talk to your vet about ways to keep your dog healthy. The risk for age-related diseases rises as a dog gets older, so make sure you provide your dog the healthiest lifestyle possible as it ages.Your vet may want you to begin brushing your dog's teeth, as teeth decay with age. Your vet can provide you with a toothbrush and toothpaste for your dog.
Keep your dog active to control its weight. Daily walks are a great way to control your dog's age.

Finished.

",How to Make a Playground for Your Hermit Crab," It could be within your crab's regular habitat or within another tank. If you choose to have a separate tank to let your crab explore every now and then, be sure to choose an aquarium and NOT a terrarium. Terrariums are not suited for being filled with water or sand. Next, fill your tank with sea sand. Sea sand is available at most pet supply stores. Mix in hermit soil(also available at most pet supply stores) in with the sand to provide proper moisturizer and promote digging. Add a thermometer and hygrometer to the back of the tank. Even if the playground is not your crab's regular habitat, it needs to have proper heat and humidity conditions at all times.
, Tree branches, climbing tubes that are available from pet stores, rocks and shells will all do. Providing variety of these spread throughout the tank will make your hermit start to explore and climb!,

Create a ""hermie hut"" by turning a plastic or Styrofoam bowl upside down. Cut a half circle on one side of the bowl. Place this new hiding spot inside you crab's playground.
Purchase fake plants designed for aquariums from your local pet store. Spread them around the tank to create hiding places and to imitate a crab's natural habitat.

, To make salt water, use fresh, dechlorinated water mixed in with a salt water solution, NOT table salt. Placing small pebbles at the bottom of the water bowl will help to minimize slipping.

Always offer a separate bowl of fresh water for your crab.

Recognize when your dog is approaching a seizure.,
Stay calm when your dog experiences a seizure.,
Keep your dog out of the water.,
Monitor your dog’s weight.",How to Cope With Canine Epilepsy1," The period of time immediately before a canine seizure is known as the “aura.” Dogs often seem apprehensive, disoriented, or restless during the aura phase, and may exhibit nervous behaviors including whining. If your dog is showing signs of being in the aura phase, but still walking around, attempt to lead the dog to an open area where they will not be at risk of hurting themselves when the seizure begins.After the seizure has concluded, your dog will enter the appropriately named “post-seizure” phase. Although convulsions will have stopped at this point, the dog will be physically exhausted and may feel confused as well. Dogs can take hours to recover, so give your pet space while it reorients itself.;
, Don’t panic or try to stop your dog from moving. You should leave the dog alone during this time, as the dog cannot control its movements and may lash out and strike you. If there are pieces of furniture, chairs, etc. near your dog, move these so that the dog does not injure itself on them.Be especially cautious around your dog’s mouth while it’s experiencing a seizure. The dog will not be in control of its muscle function, and could easily bite you if you put your hands on its head or near its mouth.

, Although many dogs love to swim and splash around in lakes, rivers, or even a backyard pool, you should keep your epileptic dog out of deep water. If the dog were to have a seizure while in the water, it would be unable to swim to safety and would likely drown.If you live in an area where your dog could easily run to a large body of water, consider building a fence around a portion of your backyard to prevent your dog from reaching the water.
Alternately, purchase a canine life vest for your dog, and put it on the dog each time it’s in or near water., Most dogs who are on long-term antiepileptic medications gain weight as a side effect. While this may not present itself as an immediate problem, you will need to closely watch your dog’s weight; excessive or rapid weight gain can be harmful to your dog’s health.If you notice that your dog is gaining weight rapidly or is approaching an unhealthy or obese weight, talk to your veterinarian about putting the dog on a diet play.


You can use a typical bathroom scale to weigh your dog in your own home. Since dogs are energetic animals and it’s difficult to have a dog stand still on the scale, weigh your dog by holding the dog and standing on the scale, and then subtracting your own weight from the total.
If you don’t have a bathroom scale, or if you have a large dog that you can’t pick up, your veterinarian’s office will have an animal scale that you can weigh your dog on.

Notice if your dog is panting excessively, drooling, or has thick, sticky saliva.,
Check the elasticity of your dog's skin to see if he is dehydrated.,
Check your dog's gums to see if she is dehydrated.,
Watch your dog's movements.,
Check her temperature.,
Evaluate whether or not your dog needs medical attention.",How to Cool Off Your Dog1," These are all signs that your dog is overheated and, if you don't act, could lead to heatstroke. If you notice your dog displaying these symptoms, begin cooling her down right away. Even if you think she's just hot and not experiencing overheating yet, it's worth it to call your vet and get their opinion.More severe overheating can cause diarrhea, vomiting (sometimes bloody), seizures, coma, cardiac arrest and death.;
, Gently pull the skin on the back of your dog's neck. If your dog is hydrated, the skin should immediately go back to it's normal position. If the skin sticks up or stays wrinkled, your dog may be dehydrated.The longer it takes the skin to return to normal, the more severe the dehydration.Take your dog to the vet so he can get treated with IV fluid.

, Lift your dog's lip and press your finger against her gums until the turn white. When you remove your finger, a healthy dog's gums will turn pink again immediately. If the gums stay white or take a while to turn back to their normal color, your dog is likely suffering from dehydration.If you suspect your dog is dehydrated, give her access to water immediately (if she won't drink, try wetting her tongue or just take her straight to the vet). Untreated dehydration can lead to organ failure and death., If she displays signs of fatigue, weakness, dizziness, listlessness, she could be overheated and need medical attention. If she collapses or has a seizure, take her to vet immediately. Call ahead so they can be ready to treat her immediately.Fatigue is one of the earliest signs of overheating. Don't drag your dog along on a walk or ignore her if she starts laying down or keeps straying into the shade. Give her some water and take her somewhere cool., Dogs naturally have a higher temperature than humans, and if his temperature is any higher than 104°F (40°C), then he is overheated and you need to start cooling him down as soon as possible and call your veterinarian for an exam.Check his rectal temperature every five minutes to check his progress.
Once his body temperature has reached 103°F (39.4°C), stop all cooling measures. Dry him off and keep him covered so he doesn't lose more heat., Dehydration and overheating can be fatal to dogs. Watch your dog's behavior and check for signs of severe overheating or dehydration. If you're unsure, call your dog's veterinarian or an emergency pet hospital and describe your dog's symptoms. They may ask you to continue to monitor her health or to bring her in for treatment.

Calm the dog down.,
Muzzle the dog if necessary.,
Address any bleeding you see.,
Apply a tourniquet only if needed and under expert instruction.,
Clip away hair from around the wound with electric clippers.,
Flush out the wound with warm salt water.,
Disinfect the wound.Dilute Betadine (Povidine Iodine) or Nolvasan (Chlorhexidine) in warm water.,
Dry the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic cream or spray safe for humans.,
Check the wound daily.,
Don’t wait to see a vet for eye injuries.,
Take the dog to the vet for stitches if the wound is more than superficial.,
Seek veterinary help for all bite wounds.,
Have the vet drain or debride the wound if necessary.,
Ask the vet about systemic antibiotics.",How to Clean a Dog's Wound," Once you notice that your dog is injured, get control of him and calm him down if he's over-excited. Soothe your dog by petting him gently and speaking to him in a low, calm voice. Make sure to stay calm yourself, even if you're worried. Your dog can read your body language and knows your voice intonations very well. He'll pick up on your behavior and follow your lead.;
, You need to keep your own safety in mind when handling an injured animal. Even if your dog is normally sweet and loving, he may lash out to protect himself from further pain. If you're at all worried for your safety — if your dog starts growling or snapping at you, or if the dog has a previous history of biting when agitated — muzzle your dog.


If you don't have a muzzle, wrap a leash or light rope around your dog’s muzzle.If he raises a big fuss, stop and get your pet to the veterinarian as safely as possible.
Protect yourself by putting a blanket or towel over him before moving him to the veterinary hospital.

, While cleanliness is important, it's actually more vital to stop profuse bleeding as soon as possible. If blood seems to be pulsing out of the wound, the dog likely has an arterial injury that could be very dangerous; pulsing blood should be taken very seriously.


Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean, absorbent material like a towel, washcloth, shirt, gauze, or even a feminine hygiene pad.
Keep pressure on the wound for 3-5 minutes before checking to see if the bleeding has stopped. If you keep taking off the pressure, you disturb the blood clot trying to form, and delay the process.

, A tourniquet should be your last resort to control bleeding. Applying one incorrectly can lead to complications that might result in tissue death. Your pet might need amputation if you cut off circulation. If you don't have training in applying a tourniquet to a dog, call your vet for expert instruction to go along with this general guideline.


Place a clean towel or pad around the limb (but not around the neck, chest, or abdomen).
Use a belt or leash to hold it in place. It should be placed above the wound, toward the body.
Leave it on for no more than 5 to 10 minutes before releasing the pressure to avoid permanent injury to the limb.
Use enough pressure to slow down or stop the bleeding, but avoid crushing the muscle and soft tissue.
Applying the tourniquet should not be painful to your pet.

, Once you've gotten the bleeding under control, you can start the cleaning process. If your dog has long hair, you may need to trim it away, but do so only if you can do it safely. If you don’t have clippers, carefully use blunt scissors to shorten the hair, but don't try to get down to the skin with scissors, as this increases the chance of further injury. Clearing away the dog's fur will let you a good look at the wound, and will keep hair from trapping dirt or irritating the exposed flesh.

, Add 2 tsp of sea salt to 1 cup warm tap water, and stir until it dissolves. Fill a turkey baster or syringe (without the needle) with the mixture, then squirt it gently into the wound until it's clean. The tissue should be clear and glistening before you stop flushing the wound.If you don't have a baster or syringe, pour the water directly over the wound.
If the wound is on the paw, you can soak the foot in a bowl, baking dish or small bucket for three to five minutes. Have a towel handy to dry the paw.

, Use this solution as a final rinse or soak. You can also use these solutions instead of saline when you're first cleaning the wound.

, A sterile gauze is ideal, but any clean absorbent material will be fine. Don't rub or scrub at the wound. Instead, pat it gently to avoid causing more pain or injury.

, Be aware that a spray might scare your dog, and may even sting for a little bit. Don't use creams and ointments if you have another option, as they might attract dirt to the wound. Furthermore, your dog will likely try to lick it off, so use those products only if you can prevent the dog from bothering the area. You can either wrap the treated area with protective gauze or use an Elizabethan collar.


Be careful that you don't spray anything into the dog's eyes.
Don't use ointments with steroids like hydrocortisone or betamethasone that may interfere with the wound's healing process. Use only antibiotic ointments.
Do not use antifungal creams (ketoconazole, clotrimazole) unless instructed by your veterinarian.
If you have any questions, call your pharmacist or vet before applying the product.

, If you see any signs of infection, take your dog to the vet immediately. Signs that suggest infection include a bad smell or yellow, green, or gray discharge.

, Any cuts or wounds to the eye could potentially result in permanent damage to your pet’s sight. To increase the odds of a healthy recovery, take him to the vet immediately for evaluation and treatment.

, If the cut looks severe, like it won't heal on its own, you need to have a vet look at it. All wounds that penetrate through the skin to the muscle, tendon, or fat need professional evaluation. After assessing the wound, the vet might suggest giving the dog stitches to promote healing.

, Bites usually involve crushing damage to the dog's tissue. This can complicate recovery, so bite wounds need flushing and drains, which both need to be done under anesthesia by your vet. Animals' mouths are full of bacteria, so there's a risk of infection even if the bite doesn't seem severe., If the wound fills up with fluid instead of healing healthily, ask the vet if he or she recommends draining it. Debridement is the removal of damaged or infected tissue from around the wound. Both of these procedures will require the vet to put your dog under anesthesia.

, These medications can treat or prevent infection, which slows healing. Your veterinarian should assess the wound, determine if there are signs of infection, and discuss antibiotics with you if necessary.

Calm your dog after it experiences a seizure.,
Practice personal stress reduction.,
Communicate your stress to a personal network.",How to Cope With Canine Epilepsy2," Reassurance is important after a seizure; your dog is likely to be scared, confused, and disoriented, so soothe the pet by stroking it and speaking to it with a calm voice and a low tone. Keep your dog relatively static until it has regained its bearings and is acting normally. If the dog begins walking or running too soon after a seizure, it could fall and injure itself, run into the walls, or fall down a flight of stairs.Dogs will be unable to control their bowels or bladder during a seizure, so you may want to have towels or plastic bags on hand to clean up urine or feces.
If your dog overheated during the seizure, rub it down with a damp towel or bring a small fan to blow air gently over the dog.

, Living with and caring for an epileptic dog can be intensely draining and stressful for the owner. To reduce this stress and to help yourself mentally and psychologically cope with caring for your dog, first try taking a series of five deep breaths. Hold each breath for a few seconds and then fully exhale—the repetition of this breathing practice will decrease stress and help you calm down.It’s also important to be physically active to help reduce stress. Taking a long walk or practicing yoga—even for as little as 15–20 minutes—can help your mind decompress, and reduce stress and worry.

, Having a healthy network of close family and friends that you can talk with will allow you to cope with the stress that results from your dog’s epilepsy. Don’t hesitate to explain your canine-related worries and anxieties, and talk through whatever aspects of your dog’s condition cause you the most concern. Talking through problems will help you feel better, and friends may present solutions to problems that have concerned you.Additionally, use time spent with these family members and friends to get some time away from your epileptic dog; this will allow you to focus on other aspects of your life. Do fun activities with friends: see a comedy show, go to a movie, or take a hike.

Give your dog access to plenty of fresh, cool water.,
Remove your dog from the heat.,
Cool your dog down by draping cool, wet towels over her neck, under her forelimbs (in her armpits) and between her hind legs (around her groin).These towels should be cool, not cold.",How to Cool Off Your Dog2," Make sure the bowl is clean and hasn't been sitting out in the sun all day--bacteria can grow in their bowl if you don't wash it and provide fresh water. Don't try to force or pour water into your dog's mouth, even if he refuses to drink, as he will likely just suck it into his lungs and choke.If your dog won't drink, try wetting his tongue with water. You can use your hand or squeeze water from a cloth and onto his tongue.
Don't give your dog ice water or ice if you think he is overheated. This can actually cool him down too quickly and shock his system., Get him indoors as soon as possible. If you are outdoors and can pick your dog up, carry him back to your car or house. If there is a pond or stream nearby, allow him to stand in the water and cool down a little before heading back.At the very least, try to get your dog into a shady spot.


Try to get your dog someplace with air conditioning or fans that you can position to blow on him.Once he is removed from the heat, evaluate his symptoms and call your veterinarian. It may be necessary to bring him in for emergency treatment.

, Don't ice ice or icepacks--you need to bring her temperature down gradually. If you lower her temperature too quickly or it falls too low, it could be just as dangerous as overheating.If you don't have towels, you can cool her by pouring room temperature water on her body.Wet her ear flaps and her paw pads. Most of a dog's sweat glands are in her paws, and cooling these down may help lower her temperature.You can also try evaporative cooling by rubbing her footpads and groin with isopropyl alcohol.Evaporative cooling works using the same principles as sweating--as the alcohol evaporates, it removes the heat from your dog's body."

Keep your dog in a cool, safe environment.,
Don't overexercise your dog.,
Walk your dog during the coolest parts of the day.,
Get your dog some cool accessories.,
Give your dog's hair a trim, but do not shave her.,
Make sure your dog is drinking enough water and give him some frozen treats.",How to Cool Off Your Dog3," Your dog should be indoors (and in the A/C or in front of a fan) as much as possible during really hot days and not left outside in the heat.If he does spend a lot of time outside, make sure he has a shady area where he can cool down out of the sun and plenty of fresh water to drink.The car is never a safe environment for a dog on a warm day--even if it's not that hot, even if you are parked in the shade, even if you crack a window and are only gone fora little while. The temperature in a parked car can quickly soar to 140°F (60°C).Garages, beaches with no shelter, or hot, sunny rooms are also not suitable environments for your dog on a warm day.A shaded, wooded area with a pond or shallow, running water is an acceptable place to walk your dog when it's hot. Be sure he has plenty of water and you watch for signs of fatigue and overheating.Provide a water dip for your dog to stand in if he is outside. Fill a tub with some cool water and allow him to cool the pads of his feet by sitting, standing, or sometimes laying in the water.

, Especially if your dog is older or a breed with a short muzzle (like Pugs, bulldogs, Pekingese, and Boston terriers), too much activity on a hot day can cause your dog to overheat. Try not to take your dog on a long run or walk on hot days. If you do go out, notice if she's seeking out shady spots and lying down. This is her way of telling you ""it's too hot, let's get out of here.""Dogs sometimes don't know their limits, especially if they're field dogs that love to run, hunt, and play. They may push themselves until they collapse and their lives are in danger. It is your responsibility to watch her for signs of overheating or save the hunt for a cooler day.Dogs with short muzzles are not as efficient at cooling themselves because they can't pant as well as other dogs. Panting is the main way a dog can cool himself.Even normal activity can be too much for these breeds on a hot day.

, Morning and early afternoon or evening are the best times to walk your dog--taking him out at high-noon is asking for trouble. Aside from the hot rays of the sun and the warm air, the hot asphalt, concrete, or sand can burn the sensitive pads of your dog's feet and cause them to blister.If it's too hot for you to walk barefoot, it's definitely too hot for your dog too.


If you take your dog out before or after the sun goes down, you can fit in adequate exercise so he won't become bored or destructive during the day.Try to keep your dog on the grass or even alternate between the sidewalk and the grass so his food pads don't get too hot., A cooling vest or collar can help keep your dog from overheating on hot days. Some use cooling packs that are built into the side, others just need to be soaked in water to cause the heat to evaporate off your dog's core. Look for one that is reflective and lightweight.You may also want to get your dog a cooling mat or elevated bed so he has a comfortable place to rest when he gets too warm. These are usually very portable and rely on different cooling methods, from gel mats to evaporation cooling to water cooling to inserts, you have tons of options to fit your space and lifestyle., Though you may imagine your poor dog suffering in her fur coat in 100°F (38°C) temperatures, your dog's fur actually provides insulation and helps her regulate her temperature.Just as it keeps her warm in winter, it also keeps her cool in the summer.If your dog has long hair, it's okay to give her a little summer trim or summer cut.Make sure you keep her fur clean and brushed, as this allows for better air circulation.Your dog's coat also protects her from UV rays and keeps her from getting sunburned or skin cancer., Keeping your dog well hydrated is essential to keeping him safe from overheating. If he is dehydrated and his tongue is dry, his method of cooling himself (panting) will be rendered ineffective. If you are out with a field dog on a hot day, make sure he is drinking water at least once an hour, if not more often.If your dog is not overheated, it's okay to give him some ice or a frozen treat to munch on. Try making him ice cream or ice pops. Just remember that feeding an overheated (not just warm) dog ice or frozen food can be very dangerous and can cause him to go into shock.

Take your dog to a veterinarian or veterinary hospital.,
Help your vet diagnose the type of epilepsy your dog experiences.,
Work with your veterinarian on an antiepileptic prescription.,
Administer daily medication to your dog.",How to Cope With Canine Epilepsy3," If your dog has only recently begun experiencing seizures, you’ll need to bring it to a veterinary clinic or veterinary hospital as soon as possible. While seizures are not life threatening and generally only last from one to three minutes, epilepsy is a serious condition and should be dealt with promptly. The longer that epilepsy goes untreated, the higher the likelihood that the disease will cause brain damage to the dog.If you need to transport your dog while it is still experiencing an epileptic seizure, put the dog in a crate or kennel. Do not attempt to pick up or lift your dog while it’s seizing, as it could unintentionally injure both itself and you.

, Canine epilepsy can take a variety of forms and is diagnosed by observing the type of seizure that the dog experiences and noting the age at which seizures begin. Often, epilepsy will be caused by physical and medical issues, including head injuries, kidney or liver failure, strokes, brain tumors, congenital defects, or extremes in body temperature. The resultant epilepsy is known as “secondary epilepsy.” If your dog’s epilepsy has no discernible cause, it will be diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. Idiopathic epilepsy is also known as “primary,” “genetic,” “inherited,” or “true” epilepsy.As a rule, younger dogs are more at risk for primary and idiopathic epilepsy, while dogs who experience epilepsy when they’re 4 years old (or older) are more likely to be diagnosed with secondary epilepsy., Epilepsy is a genetic disorder and cannot be prevented, so medication is the primary method of fighting the disease. Veterinarians will commonly prescribe Phenobarbital to decrease seizures, and often pair this with Potassium bromide to control some of Phenobarbital’s less pleasant side effects, including liver damage. Your vet may also prescribe Primidone, which is similar to Phenobarbital in its uses and side effects.It can take a while to find the right antiepileptic drug (or combination of drugs) for your epileptic dog. Once your dog is on a medication, keep a written record of the dog’s seizures; note if they increase or decrease with each new medication and report back to your vet.
This process will help the vet prescribe an effective medication for your dog’s epilepsy.

, The medications that your veterinarian will prescribe for your epileptic dog need to be given daily, and comprise an important part of both the treatment for epilepsy and your practice of coping with the disease. Vets will commonly prescribe two or even three medicines; you should carefully follow the directions for daily drug administration and administer in the dosage that your vet has prescribed.Your dog will probably also need to regularly visit the vet’s office for follow-up bloodwork after each change in medication or dosage, or if the dog experiences a seizure while on medication.

A rake comb for detangling and combing out matted fur
Scissors for cutting out large matts;
, Bernese mountain dogs can shed a lot, especially when they live indoors.Regular brushing can help keep the shedding under control. Plan to brush your Bernese mountain dog every couple days.Bernese mountain dogs typically blow their coat twice a year when the weather changes. You may need to brush your dog more frequently during these times
Because your dog has so much fur, it will be easier to brush the coat layers in small sections.This will make brushing take longer, but will ensure a thorough brushing.

, Your dog’s coat may have some matts in it. These matts are knots of hair that got stuck in the undercoat.Use your rake comb to comb through the undercoat and topcoat.Consider using a detangling spray, which will loosen the matts.Purchase this spray at your local pet store.
If the matts are too big to comb through, cut them out with the scissors.
Don't yank and pull to get the matts out. This will hurt your dog make grooming a negative experience for it.
If your dog seems to be prone to matted fur, consider taking them to a groomer. They may recommend an all-over haircut to make the matting less likely.

, Use the slicker brush after combing your Bernese mountain dog’s coat. Brushing with the slicker brush will distribute healthy skin oils through your dog’s coat, making it look healthy and shiny. Brush in the direction of hair growth., Some areas of your dog’s coat will need extra attention and care. For example, spend extra time brushing the chest fur, since it’s long.Also, don’t skip over the fur on the tummy and inner thighs.Here are some other tips:Brush the hair behind the ears carefully, since it’s soft and can easily get matted.
Use a comb to groom the hair on the legs.
Brush the tail last.

, Your dog may not be too keen on having its face groomed. However, the face is also important to brush. Use your slicker brush to gently brush your dog’s face.Use extreme care around your dog’s eyes.

, The long hairs in different parts of a Bernese mountain dog’s body should be trimmed, but not too much. Focus on trimming the hair in these areas:Between the foot pads
Fur around the foot, to give the foot a nice shape
Long streams of hair on the ears

, Because a Bernese mountain dog’s coat sheds dirt so easily, this dog breed does not need baths very often.You’ll know your Bernese mountain dog needs a bath when it starts to smell.Too-frequent bathing can dry out your dog’s skin.
Always brush your dog before bathing. Brushing will help get rid of excess hair and allow you to remove matts that could become impossible to manage when the fur is wet., Bathing your Bernese mountain dog will take a lot of effort. Make sure you have the right supplies to make the bath worth the effort. Below are the supplies you’ll need:Dog-safe shampoo
Non-slip bath mats
Regular or moisture-absorbent towels
Hair catcher to cover the tub's drain

, Large breed dogs like Bernese mountain dogs can easily overheat.To keep your Bernese mountain dog from overheating during the bath, put a few inches of lukewarm water in the tub.Place the non-slip mat in the tub before running the water. This mat will give your dog some traction so it doesn’t slip during the bath.

, Moisture in the ear canal can cause ear infections in dogs. To prevent water from getting into your dog’s ears during the bath, put a few pieces of clean cotton balls in each ear.Put them down far enough so they won’t fall out easily if your dog shakes its head from side to side.


Protecting the eyes is important, too. Purchase sterile eye lubricant and apply it to your dog’s eyes.To keep the lubricant sterile, do not touch the tube’s tip with your fingers and do not touch the tip directly to the eye.

, After getting your Bernese mountain dog wet, use your fingers to gently massage the shampoo into your dog’s coat. Start at the back of the neck and work your way down to the tail.Then, shampoo your dog’s belly, chest, and legs.


Make sure you get the shampoo all the way down to the skin.
Talk to your dog in a gentle, yet playful voice as you bathe them.This will help make the bath a pleasant experience for both of you.
Your dog will not want water to get on its face.Dampen a clean wash cloth with water and gently rub your dog’s face. Be careful around their eyes.

, If you think shampooing your dog takes a long time, wait until it’s time to rinse! It may take 30 to 40 minutes to get all the shampoo out of your dog’s coat.Don’t rush through this step. Your dog’s skin will get irritated if you don’t rinse out all the shampoo.You’ll know all the shampoo is out when you no longer see suds as you run your fingers through the coat.

, Your dog will be soaking wet after its bath, so you’ll need a lot of towels to dry it off. Moisture-absorbent towels are ideal because they dry dogs off more effectively than regular bath towels.In addition to towels, you can dry off your dog with a dog-safe hair dryer.Ask a pet groomer or your vet for recommendations on high-quality doggie hair dryers.

, Good dental hygiene is essential to a dog’s overall health. Brush your dog’s teeth daily if possible, or at least two to three times a week.Pick up a dog-safe toothbrush and tube of toothpaste at your vet’s office.Follow a few tips to brush the teeth:To get your dog comfortable with teeth brushing, rub your finger all along its teeth. Then, touch the toothbrush (without toothpaste) to each tooth. Next, put some toothpaste on your finger and let your dog lick it off.
When your dog’s comfortable, gently brush the teeth. Go from the outside of the front teeth to the back teeth. You don’t have to clean the inside of the teeth if your dog doesn’t like it.
Praise your dog so they know teeth brushing is a positive experience.

, Keeping your dog’s nails nicely trimmed is another important grooming task. Trim the nails about once a month.To properly trim the nails:Choose between guillotine- and scissor-type trimmers. Although they’re both effective, guillotine trimmers may be easier for you to use.
Hold only one nail at a time. Position the trimmer so you cut the nail at an angle that matches the nail’s natural curve.
Trim to just above the quick, the pink vein running through the nail. The quick is easier to see in light-colored nails. If your dog has dark nails and you cannot see the quick, start by clipping the nail little by little. As you get closer the the quick, you will notice the white spot at the center of the nail begin to darken. This can be a good cue to stop clipping.
It is a good idea to have styptic powder on hand so that if you do clip the quick on accident, you can quickly stop the bleeding. Styptic powder should be available at your local pet store.
After trimming all the nails, file them with an emery board (available at your local pharmacy) to smooth out the rough edges.

, Keeping your Bernese mountain dog’s ears clean and healthy is also important. Your vet can recommend an ear cleaner for your dog. Dampen a cotton ball or cloth with the ear cleaner and gently wipe in your dog’s ears.Do not use a Q-tip to clean the ears.Check the ears at least once a week for signs of ear problems, like redness or bad odor.These signs could indicate an ear infection. If you see these signs, take your dog to your vet.

Position your dog to take its pulse.,
Place your fingertips on your dog’s inner thigh.,
Count the pulse for 15 seconds.,
Determine the strength of the pulse.",How to Check Your Dog's Circulation1," Taking the pulse is a way to measure the heart rate and check circulation. Usually, the pulse is measured using the arteries, the blood vessels carrying blood away from the heart. It is felt when the heart pushes blood through the arteries, causing them to expand.Taking the pulse will be easier when your dog is comfortable and still.


Position your dog so it’s either standing still or lying on its right side on the floor.;
, The inner thigh contains the femoral artery, one of the major arteries in a dog’s body. The femoral artery is one of the main places to feel the pulse.With your dog still and comfortable, place the tips of your index and middle fingers high up on your dog’s inner thigh.


Because your thumb has its own pulse, do not use it to take your dog’s pulse.
It may be easier to find the femoral artery if your dog is lying down. You may need to move your fingers around on the inner thigh until you feel the pulse.
Use gentle pressure with your fingertips. If you press down too hard, you may block blood flow and not feel the pulse.
If you cannot feel the artery, place your fingertips directly over your dog’s heart. With your dog on its right side, place your fingertips under its left arm, near the armpit., Heart rate is calculated as the number of heart beats per minute (bpm). You don’t have to count the pulse for a full minute, though. Instead, count the pulse for 15 seconds, then multiple that number by four.Use a watch to keep track of time.
Here’s an example of a heart rate calculation: If you count 20 beats in 15 seconds, then your dog’s heart rate is 80 bpm (20 x 4).
The normal heart rates for dogs are as follows: small dog (90–120 bpm), medium dog (70–110 bpm), large dog (60–90 bpm)., How your dog’s pulse feels under your fingertips can provide clues to the circulatory system’s health. For example, if you can barely detect the pulse, or if the pulse is bounding (extremely strong), your dog may have poor circulation. Very weak or very strong pulses can indicate heart disease or some type of heart defect.Your dog’s pulse should be easily detectable, but not so strong that your fingertips noticeably move up and down with each heartbeat.

"

Lift your dog’s lips.,
Look at the color of your dog’s gums.,
Check the capillary refill time (CRT).",How to Check Your Dog's Circulation2," The appearance of the gums is an important indication of circulation in dogs. To examine your dog’s gums, lift a section of your dog’s upper or lower lip.It may be easier to look at the upper gums.

, Healthy gums, which indicate good circulation, are bright pink. Gums that are dark red, gray, blue, or white indicate poor circulation. Be aware that some dogs have naturally dark gums. If your dog’s gums are naturally dark, gently pull down on one of your dog’s lower eyelids with your thumb and look at the color of the inner eyelid.The inner eyelid should be bright pink, just like healthy gums.
You can also look at your dog’s tongue. It should also be bright pink, unless your dog has a naturally dark tongue.
Chow Chows and Shar Peis have dark tongues and gums., Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that branch off from larger blood vessels. CRT is another way to check your dog’s circulation. It is the amount of time it takes for capillaries to refill with blood after putting light pressure on them. To measure your dog’s CRT, gently press your thumb or index finger on your dog’s gum for one or two seconds, then release.Your dog’s gums will briefly look pale, then return to their normal pink color when the capillaries refill with blood.
Normal CRT is less than one to two seconds.A CRT longer than two seconds can be due to dehydration, shock, or heart disease."

Identify what a burr looks like.,
Look for burrs on your dog's body.,
Be particularly vigilant about looking for burrs during the end of the growing season.,
Remove visible burrs.,
Comb the dog.,
Break tough burs into pieces.,
Cut out stubborn burrs.,
Keep your dog out of weedy or high grass areas.,
Be particularly vigilant about not letting your dog inhale burrs or awns.,
Protect your pet.",How to Get Burrs Out of Dog Hair," A bur is a seed that has a hook or teeth on it. These teeth or hooks are designed to latch onto a passing animal’s fur, as a means of dispersing the seeds elsewhere. Burrs come in all shapes and sizes but they all are seeds that attach themselves to animals.


Plant awns are similar to burrs except they are bristle-shaped seeds that are shaped like a fish hook. Both awns and burrs attach to animals and their removal is the same process. In the case of awns, however, the seeds can physically work their way into a dog's skin, causing pain, infection, and, in extreme cases, death.;
, Both burrs and awns can latch on anywhere in your dog’s body. If your dog runs into a weedy, grassy, or wooded area carefully check the following spots:Ear flaps
Nose
Eyes
Armpits
Under the tail
Between each toe and the toe pads

, This is most dangerous time for burrs and awns, as this is when plants dry out and are ready to shed their seed packets. During this time of year it is best to comb your dog out daily to eliminate any burrs.

, Use your fingers to remove any loose burrs or awns from the surface of your dog's coat. Be very gentle, remembering that the dog may not like you pulling at its fur.


Try to remove the burrs by detangling the fur around it with your fingers.
You may need to wear gloves to avoid getting pricked, particularly with the harder, spike-like burrs.

, Use a wide-toothed metal dog comb or hair pick.Work the comb under any visible burrs and gently pull them out. This works best on loosely adhering or single burrs or awns.


If the burr or awn in severely tangled, you can start at the edge of the tangle and work your way in.

, You can use a pliers to crush the burr head, to break it up into smaller pieces. This should make it easier to remove.Be careful with your fingers and your dog's skin when attempting this. You don't want to pinch either.

, Sometimes, especially in long-haired dogs with undercoats that are deeply tangled, the burrs will need to be shaved or cut off. This should be done very carefully, as the skin can be burned by hot clipper heads or cut by sharp scissors.A good way of doing this is to work a comb under the tangle and then clip or cut above the comb. This can help protect the skin from injury.
If you are hesitant to cut the burrs out of your dog's coat, take it to get done by a groomer. They should be skilled at this safely cutting your dog's fur.

, Keep your dog on a leash when going for walks, so it cannot run into burr or weed patches. This is particularly important after the end of the growing season, when seeds are ready to fall off the plant.

, Of particular danger are awns that enter the dog’s nose or mouth while it’s running through plants with awns. During the breathing process these can be inhaled or swallowed. The awns will latch onto respiratory or gastrointestinal tissue, just like the hair, causing serious injury or even death.There are mesh hoods that attach to collars to keep the awns and burrs away from the entire face.If you suspect an internal awn contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. You will want to have your dog examined by a professional. It’s almost impossible to find these using any regular tools (ultrasound or X-rays) so it’s hard to diagnose and treat. The only symptoms are lathery and general poor health., Pet stores and hunting stores also carry protective vests for dogs that will prevent burrs and awns from reaching the protected area. If you are not able to keep your dog out of areas with weeds and high grasses, such as if your dog is a hunting dog, you should invest in some protective gear for your dog.


Boots are also available, but many dogs object to these, especially if they are trying to run.

Brush out mats and debris.,
Trim your dog’s coat.,
Use scissors for detail trimming.,
Clip your dog’s nails.,
Consider using a professional groomer.",How to Give Your Dog a Make Over1," Use your dog’s favorite brush to comb out its coat. Make sure to clear out any plant matter or other trapped debris. If you come across a thick mat, use a finer-toothed mat pick to remove it.Try holding the matted fur from the base with your fingers as you comb it out at the edge. Holding the base of your dog’s hair as you comb mats out will help cut down on pulling, which might hurt your dog.
Make sure to brush your dog’s coat before giving it a bath. Water will worsen mats and tangles.;
, Home trimming is best for those with some experience maintaining a dog’s coat. Use good pair of dog clippers (not human clippers) if your dog is too shaggy, but avoid shaving it down completely. If you have grooming experience, you can also use a pair of scissors to trim the coat, as long as you’re confident you can trim evenly.If you’re not sure about your scissor skills, use clippers to trim the coat or just hire a professional.
If you’re trimming your dog’s coat at home and want more information about conforming to breed standards, try searching for a local breed club or directory online. Check your breed club for standards, best grooming techniques, and information about your dog’s coat type., Clippers shouldn’t be used on a dog’s face, feet, and other sensitive areas. Use blunt-edge scissors to clear away excess fur from your shaggy dog’s eyes. Look for fur protruding between its toes and, while the dog is standing upright, cut away the excess fur.Use scissors to trim down hair around its tail and where it goes to the bathroom to avoid fecal matter getting stuck in shaggy fur.

, Overgrown nails can interfere with a dog’s natural gait, affecting its joints and back. Use cupped dog nail clippers or a nail grinding tool to trim long nails. Avoid clipping too much off, or you’ll damage the quick, causing pain and bleeding.If your dog doesn’t like having its nails trimmed, try clipping just one or two nails per day so you don’t overwhelm it. Be sure to reward it after clipping a nail to develop positive associations., Easier home makeover techniques, like brushing, can be a great bonding experience for you and your dog. However, it might be best for a professional to handle things like a super shaggy coat or nail clipping, especially if you have limited grooming experience. A professional can also handle the less than glamorous tasks, like expressing anal glands or dealing with a skunked or muddy pooch.If your dog is purebred, ask its breeder or local breed club to recommend a good groomer who’s well-versed in breed standards. Otherwise, ask your dog’s vet or dog-owning family and friends for a referral.To find the best groomer, check its website or ask for testimonials or reviews from current customers. Ask them, “Would you mind if I see your facilities in person first?” Look for clean, well-maintained facilities.
Rates can vary based on your dog’s size, along with the groomer’s location and quality. Typically, expect to pay around 15 US dollars an hour, or about 40 US dollars for a mid-sized dog’s basic grooming needs.

Use shampoo marked for dogs.,
Protect your dog’s ears and eyes from getting wet.,
Lather and rinse your dog.,
Dry your dog.,
Avoid bathing your dog too frequently.",How to Give Your Dog a Make Over2," When you bathe your dog, choose only gentle shampoos that are labelled safe for dogs. Avoid human shampoos and those marked for cats or other pets. Look for shampoos that are beneficial for any coat issues your dog exhibits.For example, if your dog has a dry, brittle coat, choose a moisturizing shampoo. If your dog’s coat is dull, choose a shampoo for shiny coats. Ask your dog’s vet if you have any concerns about nutritional or health-related causes for a dry or dull coat.

, Prepare your dog’s ears and eyes before its bath using cotton balls and mineral oil. Dab two cotton balls with a drop of mineral oil and place one in each of its ears to prevent them from getting wet.In addition, put a drop of oil on your fingertips and massage around its eyes to protect them.

, Wet your dog, making sure the water is warm but not too hot to your own touch. Place a dime-sized amount of shampoo in your palm, rub your hands together, then lather it through your dog’s fur.Rinse the shampoo thoroughly, making sure no suds or residue remains. A detachable showerhead will come in handy when bathing your dog.

, Squeeze out as much water as possible from your long-haired dog’s coat. Thoroughly towel dry and, if necessary, use a brush so the towel can absorb water from its undercoat. You can also use blow dryer to speed up the process.Make sure the blow dryer is labelled for dogs. Use a setting that’s gently enough not to burn its skin, and hold it at least a foot away from your dog.
Drying off a short-haired breed is much easier, so a towel alone will do just fine.

, Dog should be bathed regularly, but bathing too frequently will remove oils that help keep its coat and skin in good health. The recommended frequency depends on your dog’s breed and the type of shampoo you use.Dogs with oilier coats and skin folds, like Basset Hounds, should be bathed as often as once a week to prevent bacterial infections.
If you use a gentle, moisturizing shampoo, you can bath your dog every week or two.
For most dogs, try bathing them at least once a month or whenever they become dirty.

"
"
Massage your dog.,
Consider using soothing scents sparingly.,
Put bows or a bandana on your dog.,
Dress up your dog.",How to Give Your Dog a Make Over3," Take ten minutes to pamper your dog with a gentle massage. Open your hands and use your flat palms to slowly rub all over its body.Apply gentle compressions with your palm around its rear and shoulders to remove muscle stiffness.
Use your fingertips to softly massage behind its ears and around its neck.

, Studies have shown that the essential oils of lavender and chamomile calm dogs, and that those of peppermint and rosemary help increase energy.However, if you choose to use aromatherapy for your pooch, keep in mind that dogs have senses of smell thousands or tens of thousands of times more powerful than that of humans.Avoid using pure, undiluted essential oils. Try filling a spray bottle with water, and use as little as a drop of oil for the spray bottle. Even if you can’t smell the fragrance, your dog most likely will.
Spray the air around your dog, but avoid spraying or applying aromatherapeutic oils directly on its skin or fur.

, Accessories can be a fun way to finish up your dog’s makeover. If your dog is a short-haired breed, you can use special bows with a gentle adhesive available at your local pet store.You can also try using bows with elastics that attach to your dog’s ears.
If your dog is too macho for bows, a simple bandana loosely tied around its neck adds lots of personality.
If you want your dog to get used to accessories, try using them as early as you can. A puppy will get used to accessories more easily than a fully grown dog. Try offering a treat when you put the accessory on your dog to create a positive association.

, You can get a cute outfit for your dog, especially one appropriate for a holiday or other festive occasion. Dressing your dog can also have practical purposes, like giving your short-haired dog a jacket or sweater to keep it warm.Try using outfits or sweaters that don’t restrict your dog’s movement at all. Go for size-appropriate dog clothes that are marked for your dog’s breed. Avoid those that cover any part of your dog’s legs, as these are more likely to bother your dog.

Towel dry your dog after a bath.,
Apply a high velocity dryer to your dog’s hair.,
Use a slicker brush or a pin brush.,

Use a hydrating spray on her coat before brushing.,
Brush up and out for a fluffy look.,
Apply a steel comb at the end of the brushing session.,
Use professional grooming tools.,
Use the #4 or #5 blade to even out your dog’s hair.,
Work from your dog’s head to her tail.,
Clip your dog’s rear legs.,
Use a slicker brush with the clippers on your second pass.",How to Fluff Your Bichon Frise," Once you have bathed your Bichon Frise, usually done at least once a month or twice a month if your dog’s coat tends to get dirty or matted, you should use a towel to dry your dog. Blot and press the towel against her coat, and avoid rubbing her coat with the towel as this can lead to tangles.Make sure you use the towel and squeeze out excess water on your dog’s paws and tail. Try to get off as much water as possible with the towel without rubbing her hair.;
, Do not use a human hair dryer at this point, as it is not powerful enough to dry your dog’s hair and can burn your dog’s skin. Look for a high velocity dryer at your local pet store or ask your groomer to recommend a brand. There is a smaller dryer available called a Super Duck that you can use if you do not want to invest in a high velocity dryer.Make sure that as you dry your dog’s hair, you hold the nozzle very close to her hair, against her skin. The dryer should not be on a very hot setting as you do not want to burn your dog’s hair or skin.Hold your dog’s nose down and dry your dog’s face and head, keeping the nozzle close to her skin and moving in and out with the dryer. Be careful of your dog’s eyes and mouth as you dry her face. Do not direct the airflow directly into your dog’s ear holes or her eyes.
Work your way back from your dog’s face, drying one area at a time. This will straighten your dog’s coat and create a “powder puff” look. Try to dry as much water from her hair so her coat is separated and dry to her skin. Don’t forget to dry the top and bottoms of her paws, as well.
If your dog’s hair starts to dry on its own before you can apply the high velocity dryer to it, use a small spray bottle of water to spritz the dried area before you dry it. This will ensure it dries fluffy, rather than flat.

, These brushes can be found at your local pet store and are great for brushing your Bichon Frise without damaging her hair. Look for a slicker brush with a rubber base and a head of soft wire. Avoid slicker brushes with hard wires as they can hurt your dog.Once your dog has been dried with a high velocity dryer, you can finish off her fluffy look by giving your dog a brush with the slicker brush and a hand dryer.
Put the hand dryer on a medium heat setting and always move it along your dog’s body as you dry her. Holding it in the same spot can cause that spot to get too hot for your dog’s comfort level and can lead to burned hair or skin.
Hold the slicker brush in your other hand and move it in quick, light strokes as you move the hand dryer along your dog’s hair. Make sure you brush your dog’s hair up and out as this will give her hair more body and fluff. It will also remove any curls in her hair, giving her an even, straight look.
Use the slicker brush over your dog’s body, moving from the bottom of her body, including her feet and paws, to her head and face. When you get to your dog’s face, hold the hand dryer further away from her face and move it around so the air does not blow directly on her eyes or nose. Use the slicker brush under her head, on her chin, and her ears, but do not use it on the hair around her eyes or nose.

, Move the comb up and out, starting at your dog’s head, to give her a final fluff. Owners who do a solid job on brushing and drying their dog’s hair will likely not have any trouble combing out their dog’s hair.The comb should go all the way through your dog’s hair, combing in and out so the hair is fluffy and full of body. You can alternate between the slicker brush and the comb to make sure your dog’s hair is fully combed out and fluffy.
If you come across any tangles or mats, use the comb to gently pick apart the mats, rather than pull at them. Lift the comb in and out of your dog’s hair to break up the mat with a gentle whipping action, working carefully in sections so you do not pull at your dog’s hair., Brushing your dog once a day will ensure her hair stays healthy and fluffy until her next bath. You should use a slicker brush as well as a steel comb to give your dog’s hair a good, thorough brush. Coat care is essential for Bichon Frise, as their coats require a lot of attention to stay clean and full.Brushing your dog’s hair daily will also remove the old hair and allow the new hair to grow properly. Grooming your dog after a bath will also be much easier if you maintain a daily brushing schedule.

, Brushing a dry coat will cause the coat to break and irritate your dog’s hair and skin. Use a hydrating spray, found at your local pet store, and give your dog’s coat a quick spray before you start brushing., Use the slicker brush first, moving up and out from your dog’s skin, to help maintain a fluffy look. Work in sections, moving from your dog’s bottom to her head. If any hair dries before you brush it, use the hydrating spray to wet it slightly again.


Hold your dog’s head by placing your thumb on her nose as you brush her head. Avoid brushing too hard around her ears, eyes, and mouth.

, Once you have given your dog a brush with the slicker brush, use a steel comb to give your dog’s hair extra fluff. Comb out and up with quick strokes, moving from your dog’s bottom to her face.


If you come across any tangles or mats, you can use a detangling spray on the area to help loosen up the hair. Always pick at the tangles, rather than pull.

, Many Bichon Frise owners bring their dog to a groomer every four to six weeks for a professional bathing and grooming session. If you are trying to reduce your care costs or are looking for a way to try trimming your Bichon’s hair for a fluffier look, you should always use professional grooming tools to get it done right. You can find many of these supplies online or at a professional pet grooming supply store. To groom your Bichon, you will need:A professional electric hair clipper that can fit several blade sizes made for animals.
Blades: You will need skip tooth blades, which are made for cutting and trimming your dog’s body. They should not be used on your dog’s face, ears, or genital area. Look for blades in #4, #5, and #7. The #7 blade will give the closest cut, but you should have several blades to give you some room to adjust the trim and cut of your dog’s hair. Keep in mind the higher the number on the blade, the closer the cut will be on your dog’s hair.
Blade wash: This is a special wash made for cleaning your blades after use. Keep your blades in good condition by vacuuming off any hair on the blades and washing them in blade wash after a grooming session.
Snap on combs: These combs snap over the blades to give your dog a nice fluffy look. They are inexpensive and come in several different sizes. Usually when you order your blades, there will be snap on combs available that come with the blades. For a fluffy, full look, use a snap on comb over the #40 or #30 blade.
Cool lube: You can find this product at your local pet store. Cool lube is great for cooling down hot blades on your clipper when you are grooming your dog.
Stainless steel scissors: Look for high quality scissors at your local pet store or at a hair dressing supply store. The scissors should feel solid and comfortable in your hand as you cut.
A grooming table: If you groom your dog at home after her monthly bath, you may already own a grooming table. You can find grooming tables at your local pet supply store or you can make your own grooming table. The table should be wide enough and long enough for your dog to fit on comfortably and have a grooming arm and a noose to help keep your dog in place as you groom her.

, Attach the #4 or #5 blade to the clippers. Then, attach the snap on comb to the blade. Do a first pass over your dog’s hair to clip any long hair off. This will give you an even surface of hair to work with when you trim your dog’s hair to fluff it up.Place on finger on the base of your dog’s skull and begin by clipping below your finger so you do not clip any head hair. Continue from the base of your dog’s skull and lay the blade flat against your dog’s coat. Do not point the teeth of the blade down, as they are very sharp and avoid pushing down hard on the clippers.

, Apply a light pressure as you move from the base of your dog’s skull to the base of her tail. Work in long, fluid motions and try not to clip a few inches and then stop. This will create ridges in your dog’s hair, as opposed to a nice even surface of hair. Move the clipper one long stroke at a time and start in another area next to the area you just completed. Overlap each area as you clip.Be careful when you get to your dog’s rib cage. Clip carefully in this area, as it can be very sensitive and take care when you get to the tuck up. The tuck up is where the front of your dog’s rear legs meets her body. There is thin skin in the tuck up area that can get caught in the blade teeth so work very carefully and apply very little pressure on the clippers in these areas.

, Picture your dog’s legs as having four sides and be very careful when clipping the back sides of your dog’s rear legs. You will need to clip each side of your dog’s legs, as well the tops of your dog’s feet. You can then move from the base of your dog’s ear to her shoulder and down the front of her leg on both sides.Make sure you also clip from your dog’s Adam’s apple to the end of her chest. You will need to lift your dog’s legs to get to any hard to reach areas. But do not use the clippers on her genital area.
Once you are finished doing a complete first pass with the clippers, spray the blade with Cool Lube to cool it off.

, Using the slicker brush will give your dog’s coat a smooth finish with a fluffy texture. Make sure you brush your dog’s hair against the lay of her coat as you clip again over her hair. Continue to clip, then brush her hair against the lay of the coat, clip, and then brush again until there is no more hair that can be clipped off. Your dog’s hair should continue to become more fluffy and full as you clip and brush her.Clipping your dog’s hair on the second pass will make her hair appear a little choppy. Fix this by using a steel comb to comb her hair up and out all over her body, except for her face. Use the scissors lightly over her coat to even out her hair. Stand back and look at your dog at this point. If you notice any uneven hair, scissor it off so there are no stray hairs and your dog has a nice, even fluffy look.

Give your dog a tummy rub.,
Massage the areas of your dog’s head.,
Squeeze your dog’s tail.,
Complete the massage.",How to Give Your Dog a Massage1," There are different reasons to massage your dog (e.g, calm his nerves, warm him up for physical activity, relieve joint stiffness), each of which involves a slightly different massage technique.On most days, though, a basic massage will suffice for your dog. To set up a routine, come up with a word or phrase (e.g, ‘rubdown,’ ‘It’s massage time!’) to let your dog know it’s massage time.Pick a time of day for the massage. It is best to wait until your dog has gone to the bathroom, and at least 15 minutes after he has eaten.;
, The massage area should be quiet and distraction free.Play some soothing music,such as nature sounds or soft classical music.


Set up an area for your dog. The surface on which he will lay should be flat (no pillows or cushions), firm, and soft.A layer or two of comfortable blankets on the floor would work well.
Prepare the massage area so you can sit comfortably to massage your dog., Have your dog lie down comfortably on his side. With your palm facing down,use broad, light strokes to touch your dog from the back of his head to the tip of his tail.This will probably feel like normal petting to him, and will help get him ready for the massage.


There is no set amount of time for you to do this. Move forward with the massage when your dog looks calm and settled.

, Starting at your dog’s shoulders and working back to the base of his tail,massage the muscles alongside his spine—do not place direct pressure on his spine.First, use your fingers to make small circles (clockwise, then counterclockwise) down his back.Next, use your thumbs to apply gentle, vertical pressure down his back.As you massage along the spine, gently lift up small sections of your dog’s skin and slowly knead it between your fingers.Throughout the massage, pay attention to your dog’s body language.If he is not enjoying the massage and wants you to stop, he will use such body language as tensing, holding his breath, growling, and flinching., The sacrum is at the very end of your dog’s spine between the hips.With your palms facing down, use light pressure and make slow circular movements with your fingers.Massaging this area improves the mobility of the hips and spine., Use the thumb and fingers of one hand to rub his leg muscles, starting from the top of each leg.When you get down to the paw, gently squeeze the muscles between his toes and individually move his toes up and down in a wiggling motion.Flex and rotate each paw to release any tendon pressure.You can also give each paw a gentle squeeze.Not all dogs like their paws being handled.Read your dog’s body language when you start massaging his paws.

, As much as your dog probably loves a tummy rub, it is important to remember that his tummy is a sensitive area.As with the other areas of your dog’s body, use light, circular movements to rub his tummy., With your hands on either side of his head, use a slow, backward and forward motion to massage his cheeks.If you have a small dog, it may be easier to use your fingers rather than your whole hand on his cheeks. To massage his ears, start at the base of the ear and rub the earflaps between your fingers until you reach the ear’s tip.You can also scratch behind his ears.Your dog will probably love how that feels!
Rub under his chin, over his nose, and between his eyes., Your dog’s tail deserves attention, too! Starting at the base of his tail, make several, gentle squeezing motions from the base to the tip.Be careful not to pull the tail as you squeeze— that could be uncomfortable for your dog.

, After giving individual focus to each body part, complete the massage the same way you started it—broad, gentle strokes from the base of your dog’s head to his tail.Stroke down his legs as well."

Reduce your dog’s anxiety.,
Warm up your dog for physical activity.,
Relieve joint stiffness and soreness.,
Help your dog feel better if he has cancer.",How to Give Your Dog a Massage2," If your dog becomes anxious during certain situations, like the sound of fireworks or thunder, you could try massaging him to calm his nerves.Starting with your palm lying flat against the top of his head or neck, make light and sweeping motions down to his tail.Continue these sweeping motions until you see your dog start to relax.
Finish the massage by lightly resting one hand at the base of his head and the other on his hips (near his sacrum). These locations represent the parts of the spinal cord that control rest and relaxation responses.It may help to talk to your dog in a quiet and soothing voice while you are massaging him.

, If you have an active dog, it is helpful to get him warmed up before intense exercise. Begin by petting him over his entire body for a few minutes.Next, with your palm still facing down, use the heel of your hand (near your wrist) to briskly rub his large muscles (thighs, hips, neck, shoulders).Do not apply excessive pressure with the heel of your hand. Your dog will likely let you know if you are using too much pressure.
After briskly rubbing those muscles, lift them as if you were kneading dough— gently grab the muscles and rub them between your thumb and fingers.
To warm up his leg muscles, gently squeeze the muscles at the bottom of each leg and work your way up.Finish the massage the way you started it—broad strokes across his entire body., Dogs, just like people, can become sore after vigorous physical activity. Giving your dog a massage after exercise can help him recover a little more quickly. If you notice a particular joint that seems to be sore (e.g., hip joint, shoulder joint), begin to pet in that general area to warm it up.In a rhythmic fashion, gently press down on the muscles around the joint, then release the pressure. This compression improves circulation through the muscles and takes some tension off the tendons around the affected joint.Make sure not press down directly on the affected joint.If you do by accident, your dog will let you know that you’ve touched a painful area.
Finish the massage by petting the affected area again., If your dog is suffering from cancer, you may be able to use massage to help him feel a little better. In human cancer patients, massage can help to reduce anxiety, relieve such symptoms as pain and nausea, and lower blood pressure.It is reasonable to think that dogs with cancer may benefit from massage as well.Talk with your veterinarian first before massaging your dog."

, Make sure her fur is clean and well brushed. Dyeing works better with lighter fur. Cleanliness will help the dye last longer and will look better.

, Use a food processor or a masher to break down foods into a paste, mush, or powder. If you are using a dry food, try adding a small amount of water (1 tbs) until a desired consistency is reached.For trickier colors to obtain (like blues and purples), try adding the mashed food mixture to baking soda to make a paste.

Dogs have a different pH skin balance than humans, so avoiding human hair dye is essential to ensuring your dog’s comfort and safety. Instead, seek out alternative dyes that can be found naturally. The less synthetic the dyes, the better they will be for your dog., Do not dye your dog’s fur if they have any healing wounds or present skin irritations. Dyeing your dog’s fur will more than likely cause further irritation, and can even cause more serious infections. Be sure to check your dog’s body for nicks or healing wounds while you groom them before you begin applying the dye.

, Using permanent dye on your dog’s fur can cause harm as they almost always contain chemicals that can be harmful to your dog’s health. Permanent dyes can not only cause damage to your dog’s fur and skin, but pose serious health risks as your dog will be grooming themselves.There are many alternatives to dyeing your dog’s fur, from impermanent dyes to semi-permanent dyes.

, Edible foods, that are safe for your dog to eat, will produce light hair dyes. These dyes can be made in a variety of ways, from juicing fresh vegetables to boiling and dehydrating. However, the sugar in many fruits can also cause your dog’s fur to become sticky, and can also cause mild skin irritations. Try to stick to vegetables or fruits with low sugar contents.Try using vegetables like carrots, beets, and spinach, or spices like turmeric.Although fruit dyes should try and be avoided, they do often produce the most vibrant color. Try to thin or dilute any dyes made from juice to avoid skin irritation.
Most dyes made from edible foods are impermanent and will begin to fade within a week.

, Natural food coloring can be purchased at almost any supermarket and is generally free of harmful chemicals. Some food dyes are made with artificial dyes that have been linked to negative health effects if congested on a daily basis for many years. However, these dyes should not pose any problems when used in dyeing dog fur.

, Wash your dog’s fur in a bath with shampoo. Work up a thick lather all over their body and rinse. Once they have been washed, dry them with a towel so that their fur is still slightly damp. Damp fur will hold dye more effectively than completely dry fur.Use shampoos specifically designed for dog fur, like

, Apply a sterile ophthalmic ointment to your dog's eyes, especially if you plan on dyeing the fur around their eyes or on their face. Ophthalmic ointments will help prevent any dye irritating their eyes and will reduce the chance of infection in case dye invariably does get in their eye.Although using ointment is a good idea regardless of where you are dyeing, it won’t be essential if you are dyeing minimal parts of their body, like the tail.
Each ointment will come with a set of directions for applying the ointment in your dog’s eye.

, If you are using a homemade dye, you will need to mix it with water and place it into a spray bottle. Use half the amount of water as you are using day. If you are using one cup of dye then you will need to use half a cup of water. Most store bought dyes will give you mixing and application instructions.

, Once your dog is clean and relatively dry, use a comb or brush to prepare their fur for the application of the hair dye. Simply brush the area you plan on dyeing with a comb to straighten their fur so that the dye can be applied as evenly as possible. The better and more thorough their hair is brushed the easier it will be to evenly apply the hair dye.

, If you are applying dye made from food coloring or foods you’ll need to mix the dye with water and apply it with a spray bottle. Hair chalk can be rubbed directly into your dog’s fur, whereas bottle dyes will need to be applied by hand with gloves. However you are applying the dye, be sure to do so evenly so that your dog’s fur isn’t patchy. Make sure to cover the entire area you are dying before going over it with a second coat.Most dyes that you purchase will come with instructions and best practices for applying dye to your dog’s fur.

, Let your dog’s fur dry so that the dye can set. You’ll need to let your dog’s fur dry for varying amounts of time depending on whether or not you used a dry or wet dye. Dry dyes, like chalk, will only need to be left for a few minutes before they set, whereas dyes that have been sprayed on will need to sit for around 15-20 minutes. You can use a hairdryer on a low setting to decrease your dog’s drying time.

Bathe your dog.,
Dry your dog with a towel or hair dryer.,
Give them a haircut if necessary.,
Cut their nails.,
Choose to go to a professional groomer.",How to Get a Dog Ready for a Special Occasion1," No matter what the occasion, you’ll want your dog to be clean and well-groomed. You can achieve this at home with just a few steps. First, brush out your dog’s coat, paying special attention to any places that are matted together. To brush out mats, hold your dog’s fur close to the skin and gently work out the mat with your brush starting at the end farthest from your dog’s body and working your way up. Cut out especially difficult mats with a pair of scissors.Choose a brush (or multiple brushes) based on your dog’s specific needs. For example, dogs with short, smooth coats, like Chihuahuas or boxers, need a rubber brush to remove dead skin and a bristle brush to get rid of dead hair. However, a Yorkshire terrier, which has a long, luxurious coat, needs a slicker brush to remove mats and a bristle brush to brush through their hair once the mats are gone.;
, Generally, dogs only need to be bathed once every few months, so plan accordingly when you know you have a special occasion coming up. When bathing your dog, begin by spraying their coat all over with luke warm water. Add a dollop of shampoo to your hand and, starting at your dog’s head or neck, work your way down their body, gently massaging the shampoo in as you go. Rinse your dog thoroughly, making sure you get all the shampoo out of their coat.Only use shampoos formulated specifically for dogs. Human shampoos can cause dogs to suffer from dry, flaky, irritated skin and can leave them at risk for developing bacteria and viruses.Remove your dog’s collar before bathing and spend extra time on their neck. It is especially important to keep the area around their collar clean.Take special care to keep shampoo from getting into your dog’s eyes and nose when you’re washing around their face. Placing a drop of mineral oil around each eye can help keep shampoo out. Also, place a cotton ball in each ear to keep water from getting in them., Allow your dog to drip dry for a few minutes after you finish rinsing them, then finish drying them with a towel. If you want them to dry faster, you can also use a hairdryer (on the cool setting) to finish drying their fur.


You can also purchase a special dog dryer, which usually ranges in price anywhere from $30 to $300 dollars., After bathing your dog is a good time to cut or trim their fur. You may just need to do some routine maintenance, like cutting the hair on their belly and around their backside so it doesn’t pick up as much dirt and debris, or you may want to give them a full haircut. This is a good time to do either.


It is easiest to cut your dog’s hair when it is about 75 percent dry.
You can use either clippers or sharp scissors to cut their hair, depending how much you want gone and how short you want to cut it., To do this, you’ll need a guillotine-style nail clipper. Cut the tip of each nail off at a slight angle right before the point where the nail starts to curve under. Be extra careful to avoid cutting the quick, or the pink vein that runs into your dog’s nails. The quick can be hard to see under your dog’s nails, especially if they are black, so spend some time trying to figure out where it is before you begin trimming.


While you are cutting your dog’s nails, also check for dirt and debris between their toes. In addition, check the pads of their feet for any cuts or foreign objects.
If you do accidentally cut the quick, it will begin to bleed. Use styptic powder to help stop the bleeding., You can also opt to take your pet to a professional dog groomer. While it will be more expensive than grooming your dog at home, they are already prepared with the right tools to make your dog look its best. They are also familiar with the different needs of various breeds.


Your local pet superstore often offers dog grooming services. In addition, a quick Internet search should give you some more local options.

Allow the dog to air dry the rest of the way in location that is comfortable and not too hot or too cold.",How to Dry a Dog1," This is the easiest and most enjoyable way for the dog to dry. After getting wet, the natural reaction of many dogs is to shake from side to side with great vigor to release the water. In less than 4 seconds of shaking, dogs can shake up to 70% of the water from their fur., It is best to do this outdoors or in a room that you don't mind gets wet. Be prepared for the dog to shake water all over you, as well. Wear clothes you do not mind getting wet.

, Outdoors in the sunshine may be most enjoyable for the dog.


If you allow the dog to dry outdoors, make sure you provide water and shade for the dog.
Dogs prefer natural odors to man made ones, like those found in shampoo, so a recently bathed dog will likely wish to roll in the dirt or mud.Prevent your dog from getting him/herself dirty and smelly by keeping the dog in a place without mud, dirt, or other smelly/rotting materials until the dog is completely dry. A deck or patio outdoors would work well, or a comfortable indoor room.
If you bring the dog indoors to dry, the dog may roll around on the carpet. That is a natural reaction, so either allow your dog to enjoy that, or put the dog in a room without carpet if you do not wish the dog to roll on the carpet."

Check with the ASPCA for a program in your area.Most veterinarians recommend spaying or neutering at 6-9 months of age. However, the latest research suggests that the procedure can be done safely as early as 6-8 weeks.Spaying and neutering helps reduce the number of unwanted pets and reduces the burden on shelters (and others) who house and find homes for unwanted pets.
Spaying and neutering has been shown to reduce unwanted behaviors such as humping, roaming, aggression and urine marking.The health of the puppy will also be improved by spaying or neutering. The procedures have been shown to reduce certain kinds of cancers (breast, testicular) as well as uterine infections and perianal tumors.;
, Teach him to only eliminate waste outdoors.


Puppies can hold waste only the number of hours as his age in months. For example, a two month old puppy will need to go out every two hours.Start housebreaking when the puppy is between 12 and 16 weeks old. At this point he should have enough control over his bladder to train successfully.To begin, take the puppy out every hour and after feedings or naps. Get him used to the idea of going outside.
Be consistent with feeding times and times that you take him outside. Consistency and a schedule will help him learn to only go outside.Use praise whenever he eliminates outside. Let him know he has done a good thing.
Watch for signs your puppy needs to go out such as pacing, whining or scratching the door. As soon as you see a sign, take the puppy out.
Until your puppy has mastered going to the bathroom outside, confine him to a crate or room whenever he is left alone.
If the puppy has an accident and you catch him in the act, clap once sharply enough to startle but not scare him. Take him outside immediately.If he has an accident but you don’t find it until later, do not punish him. He cannot connect a current punishment with a past accident.Be sure to clean up any accidents immediately with an enzyme cleaner designed for pet accidents. You do not want the puppy to be attracted to one spot for elimination purposes.Do not use an ammonia-based cleaner as urine contains ammonia.

, Vaccinations will keep your puppy healthy.Your veterinarian can help guide you about the vaccinations needed and when to vaccinate.
6 to 7 weeks of age: Administer first combination vaccine (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza, Corona virus).
9 weeks of age: Second combination vaccine.
12 weeks of age: Third combination injection. You may opt for a lyme vaccine inoculation at this time. The lyme vaccine is repeated two weeks later, then once a year.
16 weeks of age: Final combination vaccine.
12 to 16 weeks of age: Rabies vaccine. Check with your veterinarian and local laws as the timing of this vaccine varies.

, You shouldn't just randomly give the puppy away. You don't know if that random new owner will really care for the innocent puppy. Some options are:


Family
Friends
Neighbors
Coworkers
Shelters
Humane societies
Rescue organizations
Law enforcement
Service organizations

, Include photos, a description and other pertinent information.


Take good color photos of the puppy. Make sure the puppy's face is visible. Showing the puppy playing is good. Photos of the puppy getting into mischief (chewing on shoes, spilling their food bowl) may turn off potential owners.
Write up a great description of the puppy. Describe how fun it is, what it's favorite activities are. Be upbeat and creative.
Make sure to mention that it has been spayed or neutered, vaccinated and housebroken.

, There are many options for advertising and you should use as many as possible.


Find an adopter by putting up fliers and posters in veterinary offices, dog daycare and boarding facilities, dog parks, and pet grooming salons.
Advertise in a local paper.
Use social media. Advertise on your FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media platform.

, Family, friends, coworkers and neighbors are a great place to start when looking for a home for a pet.


Email your contacts with photos of the puppy and a description.
Be sure to tell them that the puppy has been spayed or neutered.
Provide proof of vaccinations or any other veterinary service.
Offer to give the new owner the puppy's toys, food bowls, bed and any other items you have purchased for it.
Offer to take back the puppy if they change their mind.
Before handing over the puppy – even to someone you know well – observe them interacting with the puppy. Do both seem relaxed and happy? Does the puppy like the new potential owner? The puppy and owner should be a good match for each other.

, There are many people who want to adopt a puppy but you may need to look beyond your circle of friends or family.


Take extra care when picking a stranger to adopt your puppy.
Always let the person know you will take back the puppy if they change their mind or if things don't work out.
Make sure to exchange contact information so that they can find you if there are any issues or questions after the adoption.
Charge a fee. A small fee will deter some people who may have malicious intents. The person can make the check payable to a local shelter if you wish.Introduce the puppy and potential new owner. Watch their interaction. Do they seem relaxed? Is the puppy fearful? If you see or feel like anything isn't quite right, trust your instinct and find another person to adopt the puppy.

, Asking questions can help ensure that your puppy will be placed with someone who can care for him properly. Some questions to ask include:Why do you want a puppy?
Have you cared for a puppy or dog before?
Who will care for the puppy while you are at work?
Do you have any children?
Do you rent or own and does your landlord allow pets? You may want to ask for a letter from the landlord confirming that pets are allowed.
Do you have other pets and if so, what kind? Will they get along with the new puppy? You may want to have a home visit to see the interaction for yourself.
Can you provide references attesting to your ability to care for a puppy?

, Shelters exist all over the country to take in unwanted pets.Research different shelters in your area before handing over your puppy. Not all shelters are the same.
Some have no-kill policies and but many euthanize animals after a certain period of time because they cannot house the large volume of animals that are left with them.
Visit the shelters and choose one that is well-managed, clean and where the animals look happy and well cared for.

, Humane societies, unlike shelters, do not necessarily take all animals brought to them.Some humane societies only take in as many animals as they can handle, so they do not euthanize.
Others are “open-door” and take any pet, which means they may euthanize an animal after only a few days or weeks.
Check the policy of the humane society before dropping off your puppy.
As with shelters, only leave your puppy with a well-run and maintained humane society.

, Many non-profit organizations, and some individuals, rescue pets.Pets generally receive more one-on-one attention in these environments than in large city shelters, for example.
Living conditions may be better – dogs may be able to play outdoors and not live in cages the majority of the time.
Space can be limited, however, so your local rescue may not have room for your puppy.
Rescue facilities vary widely in terms of care. Research carefully before leaving your puppy.

, Many law enforcement agencies use dogs.


Only a few dogs are suitable for police work but your dog may be one of them.
German Shepherds are most sought-after for police work.
Be aware that there is a lengthy evaluation process before a dog will be adopted by law enforcement.
Contact your local law enforcement agency to find out if they are taking puppies for training.

, Service dogs are in high demand to help disabled people, and those with other medical conditions, live more independent lives.Not only will your puppy find a home, someone in need will get the dog they’ve been waiting for.
Some organizations train dogs for specific populations, such as disabled veterans.
Service dogs must pass a screening for health and temperament.
There are a variety of service dog programs available, including ones that provide service dogs globally."

Identify herding behavior.,
Be aware that Aussies are sensitive.,
Be prepared for the Australian Shepherd’s energy level.,
Include your Australian Shepherd in your family.",How to Find and Care for a Australian Shepherd5," Australian Shepherds are herding dogs, which means they will herd just about anything - small children, other pets, inanimate objects, and you. They may nuzzle you, bark at you, or nip at your lower half as you walk. This is not aggressive behavior but a herding instinct.Due to this, your Aussie may nip people’s calves, heels, or buttocks. Sometimes, this may be hard enough to bruise. Australian Shepherds are almost never aggressive dogs, so this is generally due to the herding instinct. This can happen with Australian Shepherds who come from a strong herding line.
If your dog demonstrates this herding instinct, make sure to keep them busy and give them plenty of exercise. Have them chase balls and frisbees. You may also be able to enroll them in a herding class.

, Australian Shepherds are sensitive to the stimuli around them. They are very attuned to light, sound, chaos, and even human emotions. They are very intelligent and perceptive, which means they will pick up on when you are angry and upset. Try not to overstimulate your Aussie so as not to make it scared or aggressive out of fear.If you have children, teach them to treat the Aussie with respect. Some Australian Shepherds have been considered aggressive because children were allowed to yell, shout, and scream at or around the dog and allowed to hit them.
Aussies are by nature not aggressive, so if your Australian Shepherd seems aggressive, they are more than likely scared due to the environment.

, Because the breed is a work dog, they need something to do. They are intelligent and love to be busy. This requires work and forethought on your part. Without the proper activity level, the Aussie can be destructive.Australian Shepherds may destroy your house, chew things, or bark a lot if they are bored.
He needs daily training and exercise. These dogs do well with competitive sports and agility training.
The Australian Shepherd may chase cars, people, or animals if they are bored and do not get enough activity.

, Australian Shepherds are fiercely loyal. They have a drive to be around their family nearly all the time and stay close by their side. This dog does best when socialized with the family. Don’t get an Australian Shepherd if you are not home a lot or want to put them in the yard for long periods of time.They will protect their family if need be.

Perfect the “sit” command.,
Teach your dog to stay.,
Introduce your dog to cameras.",How to Get Your Dog to Pose for Santa Pictures1," Teaching your dog to sit is a useful command that you can use every day. It is particularly helpful when you are trying to capture a photo of your dog.Whether you are training your dog to sit for a photo on the beach or prepping your dog to pose with Santa during the holidays, be sure that your dog has this trick down.


To train your dog to sit, get down on your dog’s level and hold a treat near its nose. Slowly move your hand up and ask your dog to sit. Your dog’s head will follow the movement of the treat, and his rear will move toward the ground. When your dog fully seated on the floor, praise it and reward it with the treat.Practice this command every day.;
, When posing your dog for a photo, it is also helpful for your dog to understand the stay command. This command will ensure that your dog will remain in the same spot as you try to capture the moment on film.


To teach your dog this useful trick, begin by asking your dog to sit. Place your palm in front of its nose and say “stay.” Slowly back away from your dog, and turn to stand right in front of it. Repeat the word “stay” as you slowly back away. When you want your dog to come to you, use another command word such as “here” or “okay.” Reward your dog with praise and a treat when it comes on command., If you have a camera of your own, carry it with you from time to time when you are playing with your dog or taking it on a walk. Take a photograph of your surroundings and of your dog every now and then. This will help your dog become accustomed to seeing this device, and it will help it get used to the sounds that it makes.Give your dog a treat each time you bring a camera with you. This will help teach your dog to associate a camera with a positive experience.
If you don't have a camera, ask a friend who has a camera to join you."

Decide on a recall cue.,
Give your dog positive associations with the cue.,
Practice “come” in a controlled environment.,
Practice the “come” command with distractions.,
Repeat their recall exercises often.,
Avoid negative training.",How to Get Your Dog's Attention1," The first step to getting your dog’s attention is to get them to come when you call. It’s basic and vital training for a dog’s safety and your sanity. The most common recall command is “come” paired with your dog’s name before or after.Because it’s likely that your dog hears their name frequently in many different contexts, their name alone is usually not an effective recall cue.
You could also consider using a sound, like a whistle, as a recall cue. This might be a good idea if you plan on recalling your dog from long distances since the sound will generally carry further than your voice.
You might also want to add a hand signal, such as putting a hand, finger, or fist in the air, to the cue since there may some instances in which your dog will be able to see you better than they can hear you.;
, Once you’ve decided on the command, be sure that it’s freighted with positive associations. Repeat the word several times, giving your dog a high-value treat with each repetition. At this stage, you are not actually asking your dog to do anything in return for the treats; you’re simply building a strong connection between the cue and rewards.Do this several times over the course of a week to build up your dog’s positive associations with the command.
High-value treats are special. They shouldn’t be ordinary kibble or training treats. They should be bigger dog treats or foods that your dog really loves, like chicken, lunch meat, or cheese. The treat could also be a special toy that’s used only for training.
Vary the treats to keep things exciting for your dog.

, Now that your dog associates your recall cue with high rewards, they should be ready to pay attention to the command and go towards you to see what treat you have for them. Start by working with another person in a controlled setting, like a hallway or a fenced-in yard. Have the other person kneel facing you and holding your dog.Once you give the recall cue, the other person should release your dog to let them go to you. Reward your dog with a high-value treat and affectionate praise as soon as they arrive.
Start with a very short distance and gradually increase the distance over the course of each session. If they fail to come, go back down a step and try again.
If you’re having difficulty getting your dog’s attention, try holding a toy they really love while you say the recall cue.
Repeat this exercise several times over the course of a couple weeks until it’s ingrained in your dog that the recall cue means “come.”
Another way to reinforce the cue by yourself is to give the command every time that your dog is coming to you of their own accord. Say the cue while they’re on their way, and reward them with a treat and/or praise when they arrive.

, Once your dog has mastered recall in a controlled environment with no distractions, it’s time to put them to the test in trickier circumstances. If they come to you in spite of outside temptations, you can be sure that you’ll be able to get their attention in the future.For instance, start by practicing outside with your dog on a long lead. Once they have that down, get a friend to try and distract them with play or toys while you recall them. From there, you might graduate to recalling them when they’re in a crowded dog park.

, Dogs respond best to training that is offered in many short sessions over a long period of time. Devote a few minutes once or twice a day to recall training, and your dog will develop strong recall.Make sure to go at your dog’s pace. Some dogs will pick up a “come” command within a week. More often, it will take a month or more for your pooch to get their recall down.
As they get more proficient at recall, remember to keep increasing the challenge of the exercises by making the distances and/or distractions greater. If they slip up, go back to the previous stage before you try moving on again.

, In order to encourage a strong recall, you have to be sure that you’re not inadvertently reinforcing bad habits. The main things to avoid are punishing your dog for not paying attention or rewarding them for not paying attention immediately.Never scold or discipline your dog if they don’t come to you right away. Doing so will make them less likely to want to return the next time.
Avoid repeating the “come” command or recall cue more than once. You want to teach your dog to come immediately. If you reward them for coming after you’ve given the command ten times, you’re telling them that it’s okay not to pay attention the first nine times.

Avoid costumes that contain hazards.,
Consider your dog’s comfort.,
Pick an appropriate outfit.,
Observe their behavior.",How to Get a Dog Ready for a Special Occasion2," You may want to dress your dog up for this special occasion. Dressing up your dog can be fine, but be sure you are thoughtful of what you are making them wear. Your dog’s safety should be the number one priority, not how cute they look in their birthday suit.


For example, make sure there aren’t any small buttons they might choke on or a scarf that could become wrapped too tightly around their neck.Because of the dog’s heritage, an outfit that fits tightly around their midsection may make them feel like they are being dominated. This feeling can cause them to freeze up, standing still in one place until the garment is removed, or they may try to remove it themselves by shaking, pawing at it, or rolling in something foul smelling., You should also make sure that your dog is going to be comfortable in any kind of costume you pick out for them. Ensure their outfit fits well, is not going to make them too hot, is made of comfortable material, and won’t impede their ability to go to the bathroom. Your dog should be able to do anything they would normally do—run, jump, sit, lay down, roll over—while they are wearing an outfit., If you’ve decided to go ahead and dress your dog up, the next step is picking an outfit that is appropriate for the occasion (keeping in mind the safety and comfort issues mentioned above). Your local pet supermarket will have some options for dressing dogs up, like birthday outfits and Halloween costumes. You can also find more specialized outfits for just about any occasion online, like a bow tie or special harnesses for a wedding. You must also pick a garment that fits your dog appropriately. There are three basic measurements you’ll need to do this:


Topline (length of your dog’s back): Measure from the highest part of the back (between the shoulders) to the base of the tail, or where the tail meets the body
Girth (chest): Measure all the way around the biggest part of your dog’s ribcage, keeping your tape measure behind the front legs
Neck: Measure all the way around the neck, where your dog’s collar naturally rests, Be sure to pay attention to your dog’s behavior while they are dressed up. If you notice they are acting strange or irritated, take the outfit off. It could be the outfit is rubbing them the wrong way, is too hot, or is just plain annoying. Ultimately, you know your dog’s temperament best, so use your best judgment.


Dogs that are dressed up often receive more attention than those that aren’t. While this is usually a good thing for dogs, if your dog likes to be left alone or is not great with new people, it might not be a good idea to dress them up."

Use a chamois leather.,
Rub the dog's coat with the chamois.,
Wring out the chamois.,
Be gentle.",How to Dry a Dog2," A chamois leather is a cloth traditionally made from the hide of a chamois, which is a European antelope. Today, chamois leather may also be made from the hides of goats or sheep, or it may be made from synthetic, non-animal material.A chamois leather is ideal for drying off a dog quickly and easily because it is absorbent and soft.


You can purchase a chamois online directly from manufacturers or sites such as ebay or Amazon, or you can purchase one at automotive supply stores. Many people use chamois leathers to dry their cars.
The natural oils in natural chamois leather will help make your dog's coat shiny., For a dog with long fur, gently press the excess water from the dog's coat before rubbing. You can rub vigorously and quickly, but do not rub too hard.

, Wring the water out of the chamois leather periodically before continuing to press the water out of the dog's coat. Chamois leather, once wrung out, will feel almost dry and will be able to absorb water again., As you rub, be especially gentle around the dog's chest, neck, ears, and paws.

"
Towel dry the dog.,
Have several towels handy.,
Rub the dog's coat.,
Replace the towel.,
Dry all parts of the dog.,
Be gentle.",How to Dry a Dog3," Towel drying is a little more work than using a chamois leather because the towel will become heavy and soggy when it soaks up the water. Nevertheless, this method works, and you likely already own towels.

, Replace each towel as it becomes wet. The larger the dog, the larger the towels you will need.

, Place a soft, absorbent bath towel over the dog's back and gently rub the dog's coat to absorb the water. You can rub quickly and vigorously, but do not rub too hard., As the towel becomes too wet to absorb any more water from the dog's coat, replace it with a new, dry towel.

, After drying the dog's back, move to its stomach, then its chest, and finally its paws., As you rub, be especially gentle around the dog's chest, neck, ears, and paws.

Blow air on the dog's coat.,
Keep the dryer moving.,
Praise your dog.,
Know your dog's limits.",How to Dry a Dog4," This method works best for dogs with very long or thick coats, such as Siberian Huskies, whose double coats take a very long time to dry using the other methods. However, a blow dryer should only be used on a dog who is not afraid of the dryer., Before using it on the dog, just turn on the dryer while the dog is in the room, and then gradually work your way up to blowing it on the dog once the dog seems comfortable with the noise. This may take several days to weeks before your dog is comfortable., Use the dryer on the lowest heat setting and on the lowest blowing speed.Never hold the hairdryer directly against or very close to the skin. Always keep the nozzle at least 10 inches away.

, Move the dryer quickly back and forth over the dog's coat, avoiding the face and feet. Do not hold the dryer on one spot for more than a few seconds so that you do not burn the dog's skin., You may also wish to give the dog treats to make getting dried into a positive experience., If your dog is fearful, stop using the dryer and use one of the other methods instead. You want the dog to associate being dried with positive experiences."

Consider other options if your dog is anxious.,
Keep your dog on a leash.,
Bring along your dog’s favorite toy.,
Give your dog a treat.",How to Get Your Dog to Pose for Santa Pictures2," Before taking your dog to the mall, the animal shelter, or pet store to meet Santa, call ahead and ask an employee what you should expect. Ask them if they expect a large crowd that day, how long it typically takes, and when is the best time to arrive. If your dog does not do well around other dogs or gets bored easily, you may want to plan your visit during a time when it is not expected to be busy., Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise before going to visit Santa. Your dog may be more relaxed and willing to pose for a photograph if it is able to expel some energy beforehand.Take your dog on a long walk or a jog, or play tug-of-war and fetch with its favorite toy.

, Bring a friend or family member with you when you take your dog to pose with Santa Claus. Make sure it is someone that your dog knows and is comfortable with. They will be able to help you entertain your dog while waiting in line, and they can offer assistance if your dog begins to misbehave or needs a distraction.Ask a friend who is a pet owner if they would like come and bring their dog along, particularly if your dog and their dog are friendly with one another. Waiting in line with a friend and your dog’s friend can help set your dog at ease in this new environment., If your dog does not do well in new places, is scared by people in costumes, or is nervous around new people, consider capturing a holiday photo with your dog at home. Ask a friend or a family member who your dog is familiar with to dress up as Santa and snap a few photos at home., For your dog’s safety and security, make sure that it remains on a leash for the duration of the photo shoot. There will be many new smells, sounds, and sights for your dog to react to when you take it to get a holiday photo. Be sure that your dog is secure and will not take off at the sight of another animal or run away in fear if it hears a loud, unfamiliar sound.


Many people bring a variety of pets to take holiday photos, so it is important to keep your dog on a leash for the safety of those around you. Your dog may get along with other dogs, but it may bolt if it sees a cat in the vicinity. Keep your dog under control and by your side at all times.

, Your dog may feel more comfortable and at ease if it has its favorite toy in tow. Bring along your dog’s favorite chew toy, plush toy, or ball.Having a toy on hand can help you keep your dog entertained while in a long line.


Be aware of other pets in line. Try to prevent skirmishes and make sure another dog is not grabbing your dog’s toy.

, Take some of your dog’s favorite treats and give your pet one or two when you get your place in line to see Santa. Your dog may be more likely to be on its best behavior if it knows that you are giving out his favorite treat.Periodically give your dog a treat during the wait if it remains calm.

Introduce yourself to Santa.,
Let your dog sniff the new area.,
Make noise to get your dog to look toward you.",How to Get Your Dog to Pose for Santa Pictures3," Before you place your dog in Santa’s lap or ask it to sit by his side, walk up to Santa and introduce yourself. Use a friendly, upbeat voice to demonstrate to your dog that Santa is not a threat. Your dog will see that you and Santa get along, which will help put your dog at ease. Your dog will be happy knowing that its owner is safe.Approach Santa and introduce yourself and your dog. “Hi there, my name is Sarah and this is my dog, Molly. How are you today?” Engage in a quick, friendly conversation so that your dog will know that you are not in a dangerous or scary situation.

, Before the camera rolls, ask the photographer if you can lead your dog around Santa’s chair so that your dog can become acquainted with the area and with Santa. Ask Santa to let your dog sniff his hand or his boots. In a new situation, your dog may want to check out the area and learn about this new environment.This will help make your dog feel safe, which is particularly important if your dog will be posing in Santa’s lap.

Decide on a focus cue.,
Reward your dog for making eye contact.,
Add your focus cue to the exercise.,
Make your dog hold focus for longer.,
Test them with distractions.",How to Get Your Dog's Attention2," The most common is “look” paired with your dog’s name. You can use any word that you like, but keep it short and snappy. You could also use a noise like clicking your tongue or smacking your lips as a cue. It doesn’t need to be loud since this command should be given only when you’re in close proximity to your dog.You may want to pair this cue with a hand signal, like pointing at your eyes, so that you can visually reinforce the cue and easily release your dog from the stare by putting your hand down.

, Pick a treat or special toy reserved only for training that your dog really loves. Have your dog sit in front of you, show them the reward in your hand, and gradually move it up towards your eyes.The minute your dog shifts their focus from the reward to your eyes, give them a reward and vocal praise (like, “good girl!”). If you’re using treats, give them a treat. If you’re using a toy, let them have the toy.
If your dog is failing to make eye contact with you, try this exercise using two treats instead. Put one treat in each of your hands, and hold your hands up on either side of your eyes with the treats exposed. That way, your dog will have trouble focusing on just one, making it more likely for them to divert their gaze to your eyes as they shift their attention back and forth.
Remember, at this point, you are using your action with the treat(s) rather than the focus command itself to gain your dog’s attention. This allows you to imbue eye contact with positive connections before you associate it with a specific vocal and/or visual cue.
Practice this several times in short daily sessions before moving on to the next step.

, Now that your dog knows that eye contact with you is a good thing, it’s time to associate it with a specific command. Repeat the same exercise as above, but give the focus cue just before you reach eye-level with your dog’s reward.After you’ve used the cue in several short training sessions, try giving the command without using the treat to guide their gaze. Simply have them sit in front of you, give them the cue, and reward and praise them when they make eye contact.

, Once your dog associates your cue with making eye contact with you, it’s time to increase the challenge by making them hold their stare for longer. Gradually increase the amount of time that they have to make eye contact with you over the course of each training session before they get their reward., The easiest way to do this is to go on a walk with your dog on a leash. Whenever there’s something that would usually draw their attention, such as a squirrel, fellow dog, or skateboarder, give them the focus cue and reward their attention."

Be patient and consistent.,
Keep training interesting.,
Give your dog sufficient exercise.,
Address your dog’s drives.,
Build your dog’s confidence.",How to Get Your Dog's Attention3," Teaching your dog to focus on you and practice impulse control is a long process that can take months. Patient repetition is the best guarantee of success. Always use the same commands and offer positive responses to get the best results., While consistency is best when it comes to your commands and responses, your dog will get bored with the same routines. Vary the types of rewards and circumstances in which you practice to hold their attention and keep them learning., Dogs are often hyper and misbehave when they have pent-up energy. It’s hard to keep your pooch’s attention when they’re bursting with energy, so be sure to give them daily walks and play sessions.The necessary amount will vary according to your dog’s age, breed, and fitness. However, most dogs need a minimum of 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise per day.

, Often times, the things that distract your dog are due to their instinctual drives to chase, play, and hunt. Training your dog to have strong focus and recall is the best way to control these drives. However, it also helps if you can channel these drives into controlled activities. That way, your dog can act on their impulses in a safe way while still focusing on you.For instance, if your dog loves to chase, play fetch with them or teach them to catch a frisbee. If your dog loves to hunt or chew, play tug or get a toy that has a furry ball on the end of a long rope for them to pounce on (at a safe distance from you).

, If your dog is frequently distracted by things that frighten them, sometimes the key to gaining their attention is to boost their confidence. Training and socialization are both great ways to make your dog more self-assured.Training includes the recall and focus exercises described above. Attending a basic obedience class with your pooch can also go a long way towards boosting their confidence.

Socialization involves introducing your dog to a variety of new environments over time. Comfort them if they have an anxious reaction to a new place, and reward them when they’re at ease with a new place.
Socialization also involve introducing your dog to new people and animals. If your dog is wary of strangers, start by letting them watch others at a distance while you reward them and speak reassuringly to them.

Practice training daily.,
Break bad habits before the big day.,
Get professional help.",How to Get a Dog Ready for a Special Occasion3," Special occasions often include unfamiliar people and surroundings. This can be both exciting and stressful for your dog. Even the best-behaved dogs may be thrown off under these conditions. The best way to make sure your dog minds their manners during a special occasion is to train them well from day one and practice this training daily.


Don’t assume that just because your dog knows how to “stay” in your living room at home that they will follow this command in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony. As soon as you get to the location of the event, practice basic commands like “stay,” “sit,” and “be quiet” with your dog., If your dog has a few bad habits, like jumping up to greet people or begging for food, do everything you can to break bad habits before the day of the event. If you’re short on time, determine which bad habits might be the most problematic depending on the occasion and work on those first., Putting your dog through an obedience course is always a good idea, but especially so if you plan to have them participate in various special occasions, like holiday parties, weddings, or dog shows. Going to a professional dog trainer can help give your dog the skills they need to perform at their best and will give you the tools to help them do so.

Dress up toy dogs.,
Dress up lean, short-haired dogs.,
Suit up older dogs.,
Let the natural coats of hearty breeds protect them.,
Pay attention to your dog’s signals.",How to Dress a Dog for Snow1," Very small dogs, like Chihuahuas or Pomeranians, are less able to regulate their body temperatures. Consequently, it’s a good idea to dress them up in a sweater or jacket when they go outside in below-freezing temperatures., If your dog has a thin coat and/or low body fat, they have less natural protection from the cold. Short-haired breeds, like Boxers, Greyhounds, or Dobermans, should have extra protection, like sweaters or coats, when they’re facing below-freezing temperatures to help them retain their body heat.This also applies to dogs, such as Poodles, that are highly groomed in a manner that keeps their fur very short.

, If you have a senior dog with a compromised immune system, it’s a good idea to give them the extra protection of a sweater or jacket when facing cold weather., Some types of dogs are specifically bred to withstand winter conditions. These large, hearty breeds, like Newfoundlands, Saint Bernards, and Siberian Huskies, come with thick, double coats of fur. They typically don’t require additional gear to help them with cold weather.Dressing up dogs with dense fur in outerwear can even be detrimental, leading to overheating.

, Regardless of your dog’s size, fur, breed, or condition, be sure to take cues from their behavior to see if you should be dressing them for the cold. If they show signs of being chilled, it’s always a good idea to bundle them up before you take them any further.If you notice that they’re shivering for an extended period of time, getting sluggish, coming to a complete stop, and/or trying to keep one or more paws off the ground when they walk, it’s likely that your dog is being negatively affected by the cold.

Get a leash and collar.,
Get an appropriate food and water dish.,
Get bedding and an appropriate sleep are for the dog.,
Get an appropriate puppy food.,
Consider getting a kennel for the dog.,
Buy toys.,
Get the dog immunized as soon as possible.,
Get the dog registered and get an ID tag.,
Give the dog a proper training regimen.,
Make sure the dog has a good home and owner.",How to Get the Right Stuff for Your New Puppy," Not all puppies wear collars when they're with their breeders, so it's important to get your puppy used to wearing a collar. Leash training should be done in a fun environment, as early as possible to get your pet comfortable going on walks.


Don't pull your puppy about! Instead, put it on the leash and follow it. Encourage it to go your direction if needed, but don't drag it along. Working at the puppy's pace will help it adjust to the leash much faster. Once it has, then you can move on to lead-manners.;
, Whether you want to be fancy about it is down to you, but make sure your puppy can reach the bowl effortlessly. Additionally, don't leave food in the bowl so the puppy can help itself when it wants to. Set feeding times, and ensure your puppy gets regular meals throughout the day. As it gets older, you can decrease the amount of meals it gets to as low as once a day.

, To help your puppy settle into its new home, ask the breeder for some bedding from its original bed where it slept with its litter mates. These scents will help your pet to relax more in its new home.


A clock with a clear ticking sound mimics the mother's heartbeat, which can also be very comforting to a young puppy. Don't be lured by the puppy's cries, all puppies do this but they all quickly settle after a couple of days, provided their owners ignore the cries.

, With so many brands out, which one is the best? It is recommended that your puppy continues to eat what the breeder fed them when they weaned off their mothers milk, so ensure you ask the breeder what they have been feeding their puppies, and then buy in that food. Alternatively, you can gradually wean them onto a different brand that you'd prefer.


Ultimately, if you want to actually provide benefits to your animals health, raw meat diets are becoming increasingly popular. Dogs are descendent of wolves. Being carnivores, they require meat in their diets to lead a nutritionally balanced life. Prey Model Raw diets are the most popular as it provides an equal amount of Bone, Muscle and Organ meat that your dog will need.

, X-Pens, kennels, or crates are sometimes appropriate for dogs, especially if you must leave the dog alone in your space for any length of time, before housebreaking. It is a great idea to have one of these set up all the time in your house and encourage a pet to seek quiet time in this area. It builds confidence as the pet always knows there is a safe place to go to escape noise, unwanted social interaction with strangers and other animals.


Kennels can range anywhere between $30-$300 depending on the size, model, and the material. Talk to an employee at a pet store in your area to find an appropriate size for your dog.

, Your puppy will go through many stages in life and some of that will involve chewing. Make sure that you have an appropriate toy substitute or else you might start losing your shoes. Enrichment is really important to our animals mental health as they do not have the ability to go out and seek entertainment on their own. Having toys and pleasant experiences in the home while owners are away or occupied will reduce anxiety, destructive behaviors and promote general wellness.

, Never take your puppy outside beyond your garden until it has had all its shots. This is vital as the boosters give the puppy immunization against lethal diseases such as Canine Distemper, Parvo and (in some countries) Rabies.


Take your puppy to a vet for its shots, and follow the vet instructions. You will likely be asked to return in 2+ weeks for follow up shots before your puppy can venture with you beyond your own yard.

, Make sure your ID tag has not only your dog's name but your contact information and secondary contact information. It's recommended that you use your veterinary clinic as a secondary contact, since they are easier to contact than a friend or relative that may be at work.


If you live somewhere that requires your animal to have a license makes sure to purchase one from your local City Hall. To find out if your pet needs a license call your local SPCA/Humane Society or Animal Control Unit. The fines for not having one far out weight the price of getting one in the first place.

, Animals respond best to positive reinforcement, so avoid using any harsh training methods such as lead-yanking if your puppy pulls, or ""burying his nose in it"" if your puppy does business inside. Puppy Classes are a great way to get the best of both worlds (socialising and training), but if the budget is beyond what you can manage, home training is great too.


Check out positive reinforcement training methods such as Clicker or the older toy/food reward training. Do not be encouraged to train your dog for ""protection,"" this is not necessary, and in most cases your dog will use its ""protection training"" in the wrong situation and could end up being put down for aggression.
Consider investing in a training course for your dog. Be prepared to spend some money to either attend a group training or hire a personal k9 trainer. This is important to the development of your puppy as it helps eliminate poor social skills, anxiety and aggression early on. Group prices are always a good value because generally they are slightly cheaper but you also have the social aspect of other dogs being present!

, A puppy might already know how to put food in its own mouth, and may not need to wear a diaper, but it's still a baby. Puppies are highly dependent on its caretaker (you) for essentials like socialising, food and training. Puppies are also mischievous and get up to no good if they're not closely monitored. If you don't have the time to look after a puppy round-the-clock, then you aren't ready for a puppy.


Many young dogs end up in shelters as their owners either didn't have the time to care for a puppy and see to its needs daily, or decided their badly behaved, under-stimulated working dog was too much for their comfy sofa-life.
When you're sure you're ready for a puppy, and you're firm on your decision of the breed that's appropriate for you, then start getting the necessary stuff to make the dog happy and healthy.

Blot the urine on your carpet with paper towels.,
Use an enzymatic cleaner.,
Mix up a vinegar solution.,
Scrub the vinegar solution into the soiled area.,
Dry the area thoroughly.,
Disinfect hard surfaces.,
Check clothing for urine.,
Sprinkle baking soda over the area.,
Mix a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and mild dish detergent together.,
Use a scrub brush to rub the solution into to the baking soda.,
Blot the area and allow the mixture to dry.

,
Vacuum the soiled area.,
Re-train your cat.,
Replace the cat's litter box more often.,
Consider getting your cat neutered or spayed.,
Have your cat checked by the veterinarian.",How to Remove Cat Urine Smell," Try to remove as much of the urine as possible. This will ultimately make your job easier. Use clean paper towels and apply pressure. Repeat with new paper towels until you are unable to soak up any more urine.Skip this step if the urine has already dried.
You can also use old throw away towels instead of paper ones. The thickness of regular towels allows for better absorption, soaking up more cat urine. If available, use a white towel. Once there's no longer a yellow-tint to the liquid being absorbed, you'll know all the urine has been absorbed.;
, Enzymatic cleaners, like Nature's Miracle, contain special biological enzymes that break down the proteins in urine, reducing or even completely eliminating the smell.Note that some enzymatic cleaners may not work if other chemicals were used beforehand to try to treat the stain. It is generally a good idea to try the enzymatic cleaner first, and saturate the area well. Follow the manufacturer’s directions closely and allow to dry for several days. You may not have to do anything else.

, If an enzyme cleaner didn't completely remove the smell, use a vinegar solution. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl or spray bottle. Saturate or spray the soiled area. Saturate a little bit beyond the soiled area so you can be sure to remove all urine.


If you have a black light or UV light at your disposal, you can see the urine glow in the dark and find the exact location of the urine spot.

, Use a bristle brush and thoroughly rub the vinegar/water mixture until the area is completely soaked. The vinegar will neutralize the ammonia smell in your cat's urine., Again, use paper towels or a clean rag to blot up as much vinegar solution as possible. Let the area air dry completely after you've blotted it.

, Wash the soiled area with a household cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia smells like urine to dogs and cats. Wipe the area clean with water. In a spray bottle, mix 10 parts water to 1 part bleach. Put on rubber gloves and spray the soiled area. Let the bleach sit for 30 seconds, then clean the soiled area with a damp cloth.


Be careful with the bleach as it may damage and change the color of some materials.

, If any clothing has urine, add 1 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar to the laundry detergent in your regular wash. If you still smell urine, add some enzymatic cleaner to your wash.Dry cleaning may be necessary. If you can't get the smell or stain out of an item, you may just have to throw it out.

, Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a natural cleaner as well as an odor-absorber and deodorant.

, Mix 1/2 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with one teaspoon (5 ml) of dish detergent and spread it over the baking soda.You may want to spot test this cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area at first to confirm that there is no discoloration.

, Wear rubber gloves if possible, and wait for the telltale foaming action of the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to kick in.

,, Vacuuming the soiled area removes both the urine particles and the deodorizer you applied. Extracting wet vacs work the best for this since they saturate the carpet and then vacuum the water back into the vacuum's tank.In a pinch, you can use your regular vacuum; it just won't be as effective as the wet vac.


For best results with a wet vac, use cool water in the vacuum tank and always follow the manufacturer's instructions.
Avoid using steam cleaners, since the high heat will actually set the stain., Never yell or punish your cat for urinating in the wrong area. Instead, quickly move her to the litter box. Consistently take her to the litter box and give positive feedback when she uses it. This will reinforce a positive association with urinating and her litter box.

, Cats like clean litter boxes, just as humans like clean bathrooms. If you're neglecting your cat's needs when it comes to offering a clean litter box, he may find it harder to resist urinating on your sofa or carpet.


Keep your cat's litter box in a quiet location that is not near its feeding area. This will increase the chance that the box will be used properly.

, Cats that are spayed will not purposely urinate in order to mark their territory, solving the problem for you in the first place. Plus, you won't end up with a litter of kittens to potty train!

, While accidents do happen, particularly with young or even elderly animals, there may be a medical issue at the heart of the problem if you notice your pet urinating inappropriately. Contact your veterinarian to discuss possible medical reasons that your cat is urinating outside of the litter box. Ignoring a medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney disease or diabetes, could be life threatening for your pet.

Get your dog neutered or spayed before you give him away.",How to Get Rid of Your Dog1," Before you go any further, find out whether someone you know and trust might be interested in taking your dog. This would be the most ideal situation, because they already know your dog, and you would be able to visit your dog in the future.

, If your family and friends cannot take your dog, try reaching out to their acquaintances through word of mouth. Ask your vet, friends and family to speak to anyone who is a responsible pet owner and wants a dog.If all else fails, you can advertise your dog in a local paper.

, Look at the property and interact with the family. See if the environment is well suited for your dog. Take into consideration small children and other animals. If your dog does not do well with those things, then consider finding a different home. Ask to see a identification from a potential new owner. There are some people who deal in “bunching” animals. This means that they pick up animals to sell to institutions that do animal testing. If you ask for valid identification and they are reluctant, this may be a sign that this is not a legitimate owner looking for a dog.


Write down the ID number of the new owner. If you are going to give this person your dog, keep their ID number for your records.

, Write down the requirements of adoption. Sign the contract, and have the new owner sign the contract. These conditions can include proper nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care. The contract can include a part that states that the new owner must contact you if he or she decides to give the dog away in the future. , This will prevent any irresponsible breeding that could happen in the new home. Talk to the new owner before you do this procedure to keep them informed about what is happening with the dog.

Decide between a sweater and jacket.,
Pick garments made from sturdy, convenient material.,
Get the sizing right.,
Make sure their gear fits well.,
Avoid designs with potentially dangerous accessories.,
Get lights and/or reflective gear.,
Reserve additional accessories for extreme conditions.",How to Dress a Dog for Snow2," If you’re simply trying to protect your dog from cold temperatures or taking them out for short outdoor sessions of less than a half hour, a sweater is probably sufficient. If you’re taking your dog out into snowy conditions, wind, precipitation, or extreme cold (like below-zero F or below -15 degrees C), then it’s better to dress them in a waterproof coat since they offer more substantial protection.If it’s at all wet or snowy outside, it’s best to go for a waterproof jacket. Wet sweaters can make your dog colder instead of keeping them warm.

, If your primary objective is trying to protect your dog from the cold rather than making a fashion statement, you should go for outdoor apparel that’s constructed from durable and breathable fabrics, like nylon, a wool blend, or fleece. Make sure that the gear is also machine washable for easy cleaning.If you’re going for a coat, select one that has a waterproof or water-resistant exterior so that it can withstand the elements.

, Each product and brand will have different sizing guidelines. Whether you’re shopping online or at a pet store, be sure to check the specific sizing charts associated with a particular product before purchasing it.Prepare yourself to find the right size for your dog by taking some key measurements. Use a tape measure to take the circumferences of your dog’s neck, chest (around their biggest rib), and waist. You should also measure the distances between the base of their neck and their waist, and between the base of their neck and the base of their tail.
Some garments may have sizing charts that are determined by your dog’s weight.

, Sweaters and coats should fit snugly but comfortably. If they’re too big, they’ll drag and compromise the warmth of the garment. If they’re too small, they’ll constrict your dog’s blood flow, irritate their skin, and/or restrict their movement.Dog apparel should be easy to take on and off. Once it’s on, you should allow your dog to move around in it to see if their range of motion or natural gait is at all affected.
You should also check that you can fit two fingers (one finger for small dogs) under the neckline or any other constrictive openings to be sure that they won’t chafe your dog’s skin.

, Many dogs are not in love with wearing clothing, and may try to remove it. If your dog is wary of clothing or prone to chewing, avoid getting garments that have decorations or accessories, like pom-poms or ribbons, that could easily be clawed or chewed off. You don’t want your pooch eating their apparel!, The dark sets in early during the winter months. Ensure that you and your dog can be seen by wearing lights and/or dressing them up in reflective or bright clothing.Consider attaching clip-on lights to your dog’s collar or getting a light-up collar so that you don’t lose your pet and so that they’re obviously visible to other people, pets, and motorists.
You could also go for a coat that has reflective strips or material as part of the design.

, You may want to put your dog in a hat and scarf because it’s adorable, but these accessories are not necessary winter gear for canines in most conditions. If you are preparing your dog for prolonged exposure to temperatures that are well below freezing, gale-force winds, or an active snowstorm, then adding a hat to their jacket would be a good idea.Keep in mind that the wisest thing to do in extreme winter conditions is to keep yourself and your dog inside.
If you do need to venture out, the most practical hats for dogs will be bands that tuck under their chins and wrap over their ears.
Neck warmers designed for humans also make good hats for dogs.

Get booties for your dog.,
Make sure to get the right size.,
Check that they have the right fit.,
Help your dog adjust to booties.",How to Dress a Dog for Snow3," If you live in a cold climate with lengthy winters or your dog’s feet are especially sensitive to salt or cold, it’s a good idea to get your pooch cloth or rubber booties to protect their paws.Besides keeping your dog’s feet warm, booties can also help shield your pet from ice, snow, salt, and grit. Being exposed to these winter hazards can injure your dog’s feet or leave their paws painfully dry and/or cracked.
Pick a material that’s sturdy enough to offer protection and withstand harsh conditions while being flexible enough to comfortably adjust to the shape of your pet’s feet.
They should also have waterproof or water-resistant exterior to keep your dog’s paws dry.
Consider getting boots with traction or grips on the bottom to help your pooch navigate through snow and ice.
Since these are specialty items, pet stores will not always stock them, and ordering them online may be easier.

, Before you buy a set of booties, check the brands’ specific sizing chart to get the right fit. There are no standardized shoe sizes for canines, and booties come in a wide array of designs. Thus, it’s critical to refer to the particular sizing and measurement guidelines used by the brand of booties you are ordering.Getting the right size will require you to take measurements of your pet using either a scale or a tape measure. Some dog shoe companies use sizing charts that go by weight. Others will ask you to measure the the distance between a dog’s heel and toenail.

, Your dog’s booties should slip on and off easily and have an adjustable strap to keep them snugly in place around your dog’s ankles. They should fit securely around the ankle but leave plenty of room for your dog’s paws to breathe since they regulate heat through the pads of their feet.Be sure that your dog’s booties are tight enough to stay on without being uncomfortable. Check to see that the ankle straps aren’t rubbing or chaffing your dog’s skin or fur.
Also check that the booties aren’t affecting your dog’s natural gait. While they may walk differently in their shoes at first, be wary if your dog does not adjust back to their normal stride over time. This can indicate that the shoes are cramping their feet or placing pressure on their claws.

, Wearing shoes does not feel natural to canines, so it may take them a while to get the hang of it. Make the period of adjustment as short and pleasant as possible by rewarding them with a treat after you put on each bootie.Giving your pooch treats along with their booties will help them develop positive associations with wearing shoes. Taking them out for a walk immediately after you put them on will also boost their positive associations with booties.
It’s also a good idea to keep your dog under control on a leash initially until they’ve adapted to walking in booties. If you notice that the booties are slipping off, stop and adjust the velcro straps until they fit tightly enough to stay on.

However, there are exercises you can do with your dog to manage their behavior that are easy on you. Think about working with your dog on his behavior before you get rid of him. Exercise your dog more. You can exercise your dog’s brain by buying food puzzle toys, playing hide and seek, or doing obedience training with your dog. Also, teach your dog how to play fetch or Frisbee to wear him out without having to go on long walks. Buy appropriate chew toys for your dogs. This can help keep your dog from tearing apart your shoes and furniture.
Do basic obedience training with your dog. For example, teach your dog to sit when visitors come over or you are out and about. Reward your dog with treats, games and praise when he obeys you, and take those rewards away if the dog does not obey you. Do both rewards and take-aways immediately after the behaviors. These basic obedience tactics can help you train your dog. , Many owners feel like they have to get rid of their dogs when they are moving, because it can be difficult to find a new place that will allow pets. However, there are several agencies that specialize in finding you a home that will accept your pet. Go online and search for housing agencies that specialize in that very thing. Make your own dog “resume” for your potential landlord. Give information about your pet including references or letters of recommendation from trainers, veterinarians etc. who can confirm that your pet is well trained. Include your dog’s picture, description of his personality, and likes and dislikes to let your landlord have a chance to see what your dog is like.
Leave your dog with a friend or family member for a few months while you find new housing. It may take a little more time to find a place that will allow dogs; however, if you put your dog with someone you trust, looking will pay off.
Keep your dog at a kennel or the veterinarian while you are looking for housing. This option is more expensive and should be used as a last effort. However, doing this may save you the costs of getting a new dog if in a couple of years you want a dog again.

If you do a combination of cleaning, using medication, and creating an animal free zone might mean you can keep your dog. Wash your dog on a regular basis. Use a shampoo specifically for dogs and wash your dog on a weekly basis.
Go to your doctor and tell him or her about your allergies. They can give you shots or pills that can help you with your allergies.
Keep the dog out of a designated space in the house. This should probably be the bedroom of the person with the allergy. Use a HEPA air filter to clean the air, and do not allow the animal into that room at any time.
Use HEPA air cleaners throughout the house and clean regularly. Wash any couch covers or pet beds and other fabric materials that will catch hair and dander.

Confine each cat.,
Rotate the cats into seclusion, one at a time.,
Reintroduce the cats slowly.",How to Know Which Cat Has Litter Box Problems in a Multi‐Cat Home1," If you have the space in your home, consider confining each cat to its own part of the house to see what happens with each individual litter box. By monitoring how each cat uses their own litter box, you may be able to tell who has the problem.Make sure each cat has all of the necessary supplies – food, clean drinking water, a clean litter box, and several toys.
Remember to spend time with each cat every day. Don’t just lock them up in a room and leave them there alone.;
, If you don’t have the space, consider isolating one cat at a time to determine who the culprit is. Place one cat in a secluded room with all of the necessities (food, water, litter box, toys) and leave it there for a couple days. During this time, you can monitor how the cat in seclusion and the ones who are free to roam interact when they use the litter box.Even if you do have the space to seclude each cat on its own, rotating the cats out one at a time might still be the better option (especially if you have more than two cats). This way, you can see how the cats interact in multiple-cat situations, not just what they do when they are on their own.

, Remember that multiple cats may have trouble living in a single household. When you isolate one cat, you should reintroduce it to the others slowly. Bring the isolated cat into the home with the rest of the cats in a carrier and let them all smell each other.After a few minutes, you can try letting the cat out of the carrier to interact with the others. But make sure you monitor the process.

Look for flea dirt.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Mop your floors.,
Wash soft furnishings.,
Spray your carpets and upholstery with a flea spray.,
Flea bomb your house.",How to Deal with Persistent Feline Flea Problems1," Flea dirt resembles small specks of ground black pepper. Look for these specks along your carpet and floor, especially in the areas where your cat rests. If you see the black specks, rub them with a damp, white cloth. If tiny red specks appear on the white cloth, then this is a sure sign that you have a flea problem.You can also identify a flea problem by putting on a pair of white socks. Walk around your home shuffling your feet to create warmth. If you see black or brown specks on your socks after doing this, then you can be sure that you have a flea problem.;
, Vacuum the areas where your cat spends most of its time like its bed or the couch. Also, thoroughly vacuum carpets, rugs, couches, and upholstered furniture in your house. Make sure to vacuum underneath your furniture since fleas thrive in dark environments.Vacuum your house every three days to remove organic material that fleas feed on such as dirt and flea feces.
Remove and throw away the vacuum bag each time you finish vacuuming.

, Since fleas can live in your baseboards, make sure to mop wooden and tile floors regularly. Mop them every 10 to 15 days to keep the flea infestation at bay.You can use a household cleaner or detergent of your choice to mop your floors.

, Wash removable upholstery, including curtains, per the instructions on the instruction manual. Also wash infested clothing and bedding on a hot cycle in your washing machine. Use the dryer to dry your clothing and bedding.The heat from the dryer will kill any remaining fleas and/or flea larvae.

Spray your carpet, rugs, curtains, upholstery, and areas where your cat sleeps like its bed.After using the spray, take yourself and your pets outside to let the room air out for 30 minutes to an hour before returning.
You can also purchase boric acid-based powders to control flea problems. Sprinkle the powder in between the floorboards and on your carpet and rugs. These powders are not harmful to your pets and/or children.

, You can either hire a professional to flea bomb your house, or you can do it yourself. Before you flea bomb your house, remove your cat’s food and water bowls, as well as household plants. You and your pets will also need to leave your house while the flea bomb works.You can purchase flea bombs from your local hardware store or pet store, or online. Make sure to follow the instructions on the canister. You may need to buy more than one flea bomb.
It may be up to eight hours before it is safe to go back home, so plan a fun day with your cat before flea bombing your house; for example, you could take your cat to the groomer to have it bathed while your house is getting flea bombed.

The shelter can also use the dog’s licensing information to find you and reunite you with Fido. , If you’ve just gotten a puppy, you have to get him or her licensed before they turn 3 months old. If you’ve gotten a new dog, you have to license him or her within 30 days. If you’ve just moved to Pennsylvania or moved to a new county, you have 30 days to get your dog licensed.The law is a little different in Philadelphia. There, you can wait until your puppy is 4 months old.

, Unless you buy the lifetime license, you must re-register your dog every year before January 1. (The penalty for not doing so is up to $300 plus court costs!) It’s not a difficult process, but it’s easy to forget to do it, so make sure you have a way to remind yourself every year.


If you use Google Calendar or some other online scheduling system, consider setting yourself a recurring reminder for early December. Then set a second one for mid-December in case you missed the first reminder.

, If you’ve adopted a dog from someone else, there is no way to transfer the original owner’s license. You will need to order a new license and provide your own information. , This department houses the Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement, which is responsible for everything from dog licenses to overseeing the welfare of dogs and puppies in breeding facilities and kennels.

Some counties provide you with the option to download a copy of the application to mail to your County Treasurer office.

, If you get an annual license, you will have to renew it every year before January 1. Annual licenses may be a cheaper option if your dog is older or if you are planning on selling or giving away your dog soon. Otherwise, a lifetime license will probably be both more convenient and more cost effective in the long run.

Check whether dogs and cats are kept apart.,
Ensure kennels require all pets to be vaccinated.,
Visit the kennel yourself.,
Ask for a background check.",How to Find a Dog Sitter or Boarding Kennel2," Boarding kennels often also feature a cattery, a sort of boarding kennel for cats. However, ensure that the boarding kennel and cattery are kept separate. Cats housed too close to dogs can upset them or even – in cases where the cages are far too close together – take a swipe at your doggie., The last thing you want is your dog to contract some sort of illness while at the kennel. To protect your dog against illnesses, don’t board it at a kennel which allows unvaccinated pets.One of the important things you should ask about specifically is kennel cough, a contagious respiratory disease common – as its name suggest – among pets who are boarded at kennels or who spend time exposed to large numbers of other dogs.

, Before deciding to leave your dog in the care of the kennel, you should visit it in person and verify that it is clean, orderly, comfortable, and well-ventilated. If the place is too hot or too cold, stinks of urine or feces, loud and chaotic, or seems to be run by staff who seem harried and have no real idea of what’s going on, you should look elsewhere for a boarding kennel.Ensure that dogs are not kept on concrete floors. Dogs kept in ground-level cages should have resting boards or bedding beneath them. If you see dogs in cages with nothing to protect them from the cold concrete, look elsewhere for a kennel.
Ask what sort of veterinary services are offered at the kennel.
Inquire about the opportunities for exercise and play.

, Professional dog sitters usually offer a criminal background check. If they don’t, ask them to provide you with one. Non-professional dog sitters might not have a background check. In this case, you could either ask them to procure one, or ensure that you’re familiar well-acquainted with the dog sitter and their background. Acceptable background checks will include:Social Security number traces
a current date (within the last year)
county-level court record search
the name of the investigator

Look for a dog sitter with licensing.,
Ensure your kennel has appropriate qualifications.,
Ensure your pet gets fed regularly.,
Always use a contract.,
Avoid long goodbyes.,
Get a bonded pet sitter.",How to Find a Dog Sitter or Boarding Kennel3," Dog sitters have a set of professional standards set by dog sitting organizations. These standards ensure pet sitters are capable of watching and caring for the animals they are responsible for. A highly-qualified dog sitter will ensure your dog is well-cared for while you’re away.Pet sitter organizations might offer annual conferences or ongoing professional development for members.
For dog sitters, Pet Sitters International and the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters offer ongoing professional development and certification courses.It is rare for pet sitters to have certification or membership, but if they do, all the better.

, Some states require that boarding kennels receive inspections. In states where inspections occur, the boarding kennels are required to meet a high level of care. Contact your state’s animal welfare department for more information.If your state doesn’t require an inspection, you should contact local business agencies to see what sort of reputation the kennel has. Business agencies like the Department of Consumer Protection and the Better Business Bureau will have a list of grievances filed against the kennel.
Find a kennel with few or no complaints against it.

, If contracting with a kennel, ask when feeding time is for the dogs. When contracting with a dog sitter, let your dog sitter know when your dog eats so that it can be fed at its regular mealtime. In either case, let the dog sitter or kennel know how much and how often to feed your dog. If your dog has special mealtime requirements – for instance, perhaps your dog needs to take medication along with its meal, or needs to eat a high-fiber dog food – let the dog sitter or kennel know., Leaving your dog with either a kennel or a dog sitter is a big deal. You’ll need to ensure your pet is cared for adequately, and the best way to do that is to have a contract with whoever is caring for your dog whilst you’re away. Kennels will usually have a care contract ready for you. Professional dog sitters, likewise, should provide you with a contract. When dealing with a nonprofessional dog sitter, however, you might need to draft a dogsitting contract yourself.Ensure any contract has stipulations for when your dog will go out, when it will eat, how much it will eat, when and how often it will be walked, and what steps should be taken if anything should happen to it.

, If your pet senses you’re upset, or that something’s wrong, your pet could become anxious and worried, too. Keep your goodbyes quick and simple when dropping your dog off at the kennel or leaving your dog with the pet sitter. For instance, give your dog a simple pat on the head and say “Good dog” before heading out., If your dog sitter is bonded, it means that your dog sitter is covered by a kind of insurance to guarantee that if anything goes wrong, the will be able to cover the costs you have to incur. For instance, if your dog is accidentally injured while in the custody of the dog sitter, you and/or the dog sitter might need to take your dog to the vet. In this case, a bonded dog sitter will be able to cover the costs of those visits."

Notice if your cat uses the litter box as soon as you clean it.,
Watch for aggression.,
Take your cat to the vet if you notice a drastic behavioral change.,
Listen to your cat talk.,
Use a non-toxic stain.",How to Know Which Cat Has Litter Box Problems in a Multi‐Cat Home2," Cats often eliminate outside of the litter box if it isn’t clean enough for them. If you have a cat that always seems to use the litter box right after you clean it, this could be a sign that this cat is the culprit.

If this is the case, start cleaning the litter boxes more regularly to help alleviate the problem.

, If a cat is unhappy about its litter box situation, it may act out aggressively toward other cats in the home. If one of your cats seems to be acting out towards your other cats or is being irritable in general, you might be concerned that this is the cat with the litter box problem.Monitor how your cats interact with each other and look for signs of aggression.
Also keep an eye on which cat is being victimized most often. A victimized cat may fear going to the litterbox because it may be ambushed by the aggressive cat while using it., As you’re paying closer attention to your cats, see if one is acting a lot different than normal. Take the cat that’s acting differently to be examined by a veterinarian. There are certain medical problems like a urinary tract infection, kidney disease, or irritable bowel syndrome that may be causing your cat to avoid using the litter box.

If your vet recommends it, allow them to run necessary blood and urine tests on your cat.
Follow any medication instructions that your vet gives you., If your cat seems to pace in front of the litter box and meow at you, this could be a sign that it is displeased with the litter box situation.Eventually, the cat will begin to eliminate in inappropriate areas. But it may try to communicate with you about the problem first.

, Contact your veterinarian and ask about a non-toxic stain to help with this issue. You give it to your cats orally and it will show up in their urine when they eliminate in an inappropriate spot. This dye is usually called fluorescein, though there are other varieties.Make sure you only give the stain to one cat at a time, otherwise you won’t be able to tell who has the problem.

Spay or neuter all cats in the home.,
Clean the litter boxes daily.,
Add more litter boxes.,
Provide your cats with litter options.,
Get different sizes of litter boxes.",How to Know Which Cat Has Litter Box Problems in a Multi‐Cat Home3," Your cat may be urinating outside of the box to mark their territory. When you spay or neuter your cats, you will remove the source of the hormones that drive your cat to perform this behavior., Much of the time, cats choose to eliminate outside of the litter box because it doesn’t meet their standard of cleanliness. Try cleaning the litter boxes more frequently than you normally do to see if this helps resolve the problem.If you scoop the litter boxes once every two days, start cleaning them daily. If you already clean them once every day, start scooping them out twice per day.

, One possible problem with improper elimination, especially if you have multiple cats, is not having enough litter boxes. Try adding an additional litter box in another part of your home for your cats to use. This extra space may help resolve the problem.Typically, the rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat, plus one extra. This means that if you have three cats, you should have four litter boxes.
Make sure the litter boxes are not right next to each other, or your cats will see them as one large litter box. Ideally the litter boxes should be in different rooms.

, It’s possible that your cats don’t like the kind of litter that you have selected, so try switching it up. If you have multiple litter boxes, use a different kind of litter in each one to see which type your cats prefer.Try using clumping litters, fine grain litters, and larger crystal litters.

, Some cats have clear preferences about what kinds of litter boxes they use. Your litter box may be too big for the cat, or too small. Perhaps it has a hood that the cat doesn’t like. Maybe your cat feels uncomfortable with a fully enclosed litter box. Provide your cats with a variety of litter box types to prevent future problems.You should try to have one enclosed litter box, one open air litter box, a larger box, and a smaller box. This kind of variety will give your cat the ability to choose its preference.
If your cat is older, they may not be able to comfortably step inside a litter box that has high sides. Provide one that has shorter walls so they do not need to step so high to get in.

Only give your cat flea treatments that have been recommended by your vet.To maximize the effectiveness of spot on flea treatments, bring your cat to a professional groomer to have it bathed with a flea shampoo before applying the treatment.
If the infestation is severe, then try a fast-acting flea medication that contains Nitenpyram. These can be used in conjunction with your cat’s flea medication., Since fleas can burrow down into the foam of your cat’s bed, make sure to wash the whole bed, not just the cover. Wash its bed on a hot cycle and use the dryer to dry it. Wash your pet’s bedding once every 10 to 15 days.Make sure to wash any plush toys your cat has.
Use a cat-friendly detergent to wash its bedding and plush toys.

Expect to separate the kittens from their mother when they are around 12 weeks old.,
Be sure the kitten has learned to use the litter pan before removing her from her mother.,
Introduce the new owner’s scent to the kitten.,
Introduce the kitten’s smell to a cat already living in the new home.",How to Separate Kittens from a Mother Cat for Adoption1," While most kittens are weaned by 8-10 weeks, most experts recommend leaving kittens with their littermates until 12-13 weeks, so they can be properly socialized.Socialization is the process whereby kittens explore their surroundings and accept what they find as normal. A well socialized kitten is bold, confident and friendly. Separating a kitten from its mother too early, on the other hand, may lead to poor learning skills and aggressive behavior.A kitten will start learning at about 3 weeks of age and continues to soak up experiences until 12-14 weeks when her ability to adapt to the unfamiliar tails off.
The implication of this is that a kitten will benefit greatly from learning from its mother until 12 weeks of age. However, if re-homing is delayed too long after that, the kitten is much more likely to be fearful and hide from the new owner.;
, Kittens learn to use the litter pan at different rates, but most will have learned by 12 weeks. Be sure the kitten has learned this crucial skill from her mother before she is adopted out., Kittens learn a lot about their environment by scent. They recognize their mother, littermates and nest by smell. Using this knowledge can ease a kitten’s transition from her mother to a new home. Do this by:


Having the new owner provide an old T-shirt that smells like the person. Because kittens are so smell-oriented, placing a piece of the new owner’s clothing in the kitten’s bed or favorite space will get her used to the person’s scent (this is called a ‘scent introduction’). When the kitten moves to the home, she will already be familiar with one of the scents so she will feel safer.

, Likewise, if the home already has a cat, give him a piece of bedding with the kitten’s smell on it. Doing this will give the established cat a scent ‘hand shake’ prior to setting eyes on the new kitten. This will start to diffuse potential tension between the two animals.

Know which cleaners are most toxic.,
Realize that even if you close your cat in another room during the cleaning process, most of the floor cleaners and dust removers can't be rinsed out.,
Remove the toxic cleaning products altogether.,
*Mix all these ingredients in a wash basin.,
Get professional assistance from a cleaner with eco-certified methods.",How to Clean Your Home with Cat Safe Detergents," For both pets and people, the household cleaners such as bleach, toilet bowl cleaners, washing powder and softeners contain the greatest hazard potential if ingested or inaccurately handled. Be most careful with any such products. Since these products are always factory packed, keep them well closed in their original packages and keep them well out of reach of your cats. Use the products with great care, clearing up any spills immediately and keeping cats away from you when cleaning, even if this means closing them out for a bit.;
, A small part of the toxic elements stick to the floor's and furniture's surface. Your pet can lick these substances off its paws after walking on the floors or cleaned surfaces. Your cat could also breathe in the product's fumes (and you could too). While these trace amounts may not kill your feline, they can easily cause allergic reactions in sensitive cats, and may result in gastrointestinal ulcers and other dangerous conditions for everyone in the household. Accumulated exposure can also be a source of more serious illnesses over time.

, Instead of cleaning with chemical-based detergents, try some homemade, totally natural alternatives. They're easy to do and should prove even cheaper to prepare your own cleaning product. If you don't know how, try the following recipe:


Gather two liters of warm water, a glass of fresh squeezed lemon juice, ¼ cup of white vinegar, and three soup spoons of baking soda.

, Use it to clean the floor, for example, with no need to rinse it. It's non-toxic and safe not only for pets, but also for you and your family. This natural cleaner could be used for all purposes – windows, floors, furniture's surfaces, etc. It's totally safe and effective for every day use and can also reduce the environmental pollution.

, If you need deeper cleaning – for example, to remove grime, dirt and stains, search for professional cleaning services. Book a team of cleaners. They will have the proper equipment and detergents. Be sure to mention that you need a special cleaning service without toxic products. This could be one step closer to a healthier lifestyle – no matter if it comes to you, or your four-pawed family members.

The tail may be straight, slightly curved or slightly bumpy.Every cat has a slightly different tail, but they are all quite short.;
, One of the reasons this cat looks like a bobcat is that it has very long hind legs. The hind legs are a bit longer than the front legs, which gives them a very alert and dynamic stance., The eyes are wild looking and have an almond shape, which is quite distinctive. The brow and the eyes give the cat a hunting gaze and make it look very smart., If you look at the face of the cat, you will notice a fairly broad head, wedged inward, with soft whisker pads and a medium muzzle. You will also see a fairly well sculpted chin., If the cat is standing still, you will be able to see that it has a fairly rectangular stance. If you look at the chest, it will look pretty full compared to other cats.

Separate the kitten from her mother.,
Teach the kitten to lap milk using kitten milk replacer in a shallow bowl.,
Introduce solid food.",How to Separate Kittens from a Mother Cat for Adoption2," Kittens need to be weaned off mother’s milk and onto solid foods before adoption both for their health and to avoid bad habits like “wool sucking,” where cat’s chew and suck on things like fabric.The mother cat will wean her kittens on her own, usually by 8-10 weeks. If you are adopting a kitten before then, you will need to accelerate the weaning process:, At 4 weeks, you can start putting the kitten by herself for a few hours at a time. Put her in a space with her own litter box, food, and water bowl.

, Put your finger just below the surface of a bowl of milk. The kitten will attempt to suckle your finger, but will then find it (instinctively) easier to lap at your finger, rather than suck.Do not give the kitten cow’s milk, as this may upset their digestive system.

, Once the kitten can lap up milk, it is time to introduce moist solid foods. You’ll want to start with a gruel-like consistency and slowly remove moisture until by 8-10 weeks, the kitten is eating dry food.To make the gruel, mix dry or canned kitten food with milk replacer until it is the consistency of oatmeal.
Each day, gradually decrease the amount of milk replace until by week 6, the food is only lightly moistened.
Sometime between weeks 8 and 10, the kitten should be eating dry food.

Do not separate the kittens from the mother all at once.,
Remove anything marked with the kittens’ scent.,
Know that the queen cat will recover quickly from the separation.",How to Separate Kittens from a Mother Cat for Adoption3," It is best for the queen cat’s milk supply to dry up gradually. If you take all her kittens away at once, her mammary glands may become painfully engorged., The lingering scent of her kittens can remind the mother cat that she needs to check on them, and she may appear to wander around the house looking for them. Once the kittens have gone to their new homes, it is best to remove anything marked with their scent and give the mother clean bedding. As their scent gradually fades from the environment so will her instinct to search and she will settle into her normal routine again.

, Nature programs the mother to make her kittens independent in order to survive, and as part of this process, she starts to distance herself from kittens in order to make them stand on their own paws. Re-homing the kittens just expedites that process.


So long as her kittens are old enough when they leave (preferably 12-13 weeks) and their smells are removed, the queen cat will usually only show signs of anxiety for a day or two before returning to her normal routines."

Consider using a plug-in pheromone diffuser to ease the kitten’s anxiety.",How to Separate Kittens from a Mother Cat for Adoption4," Arrange ahead of time to take a towel or blanket your new kitten slept on from her old home. Having a familiar scent will make the adjustment much easier. Use this blanket or towel in the carrier on the way home and leave it there for your cat to sleep on., The carrier will keep your kitten safe and help her feel more secure. Place a towel in the carrier for warmth and to absorb urine in case of an accident.Don’t use another pet’s carrier, as the smell of another animal can be stressful to the kitten.

, Provide your kitten with her own small room or space. It should be quiet and out of the way. The space should have a bed, water, kitten food, a litter box, scratching post, and safe toys.Whether you use a cardboard box or a bed purchased from a pet store, consider lining it with an old sweatshirt so your kitten can grow accustomed to your scent.
Be sure the room or space has places to hide. If there is no furniture to hide behind, put cardboard boxes in the room with holes cut into them for your cat to enter.

, Place her carrier in the room, open the door, and let her come out when she’s ready. Leave the carrier in the room as another hiding place., You will likely want to hold and pet your kitten continuously. Don’t. Your kitten needs time to adjust to her new environment, including the people in it.

Do not allow children under 5 to interact with the kitten. It is unsafe for the cat.

, When your kitten is eating, drinking, and using the litter box regularly, that is a sign that she is comfortable in her room and you can start introducing her to the rest of your home one room at a time.Place her open carrier in a room and let her explore on her own. After exploring, bring your kitten back to her den for at least a few hours before exploring the next room.If your kitten climbs on something – a bookshelf, bed, etc. – that you don’t want her on, gently pick her up and place her on the floor. If you do this from day one, you should have less trouble establishing off-limits places for your cat.

, Giving the kitten the food she is used to will provide a source of comfort and avoid an upset stomach caused by the bacteria in her gut having to adjust to a new food.Plan ahead and ask the person you are buying the kitten from what kind of food they have been feeding it, so you can have that food ready when your kitten arrives at your home.

, Cats produce facial pheromones (chemical signals) that they rub on things they know are safe—like their bed, a chair, or even your leg. There are plug-in diffusers that spray a synthetic version of these pheromones, which let cats know they are in safe environment. They last about 30 days – plenty of time to comfort your kitten until she has adjusted to her new environment.The most commonly used kind of pheromone diffuser is Feliway. It can come as a spray or as a device that you plug in to the wall that will emit the pheromones automatically.

Introduce the new kitten to a cat already living in the house gradually.,
Set up the kitten’s den in an area your current cat does not use frequently.,
Provide a scent introduction first.,
Feed the cats on either side of the new kitten’s door.,
Have the cats trade places once the kitten has adjusted to his new den.,
Let the cats meet one another once the kitten is comfortable in his new home.,
Try feeding the cats together if they are not getting along.,
Separate the kitten from the other cat if the kitten has a little too much energy.",How to Separate Kittens from a Mother Cat for Adoption5," If the kitten has been socialized properly and placed in the new house between the ages of 12 and 13 weeks, she should settle into the new home easily. However, if there is another cat already living in the house, you should introduce the two felines slowly.

, This gives the older cat a chance to realize there is another feline in his territory in a non-challenging way, as she’s not competing for his food or prime sleeping spots (a.k.a. his resources)., Your cats will sniff at each other under the door to the new kitten’s room. You can also swap bedding between the two animals so they can get used to one another’s smell. It also helps to stroke one cat, and then the other to mingle their scents.Be sure to give extra attention to your resident cat to ease his anxiety. If you ignore him and focus all your attention on the kitten, this will create problems., This will lead each cats to associate the other cat’s scent with something good: food., While the new kitten is being introduced to other part of the house, put your old cat in the kitten’s room. This will let the cats explore one another’s scents in new spaces., Place a barrier between the cats or keep the kitten in a carrier so that she can’t pounce or jump on the older cat, who will regard this as an affront. Let them get used to each other by sniffing and touching noses through the grill of the carrier. Hopefully the older cat will reach a stage of indifference and merely wander off—this is a sign that he has accepted the kitten.


If either cat shows signs of serious hostility - prolonged hissing, trying to scratch or bite the other cat - give them a few more days to get used to one another’s presence before putting them in the same room again.

, At first, put their bowls on opposite sides of the room. Gradually move them closer together. The idea here is to have your cats associate one another’s presence with the positive experience of eating., Once the older cat has accepted the kitten, you can let the kitten wander around the house. However, it is important to keep an eye on the kitten, especially when the older cat is around.If the kitten starts to play and becomes overly boisterous with the adult cat, pop her into a different room so the original cat is given precedence in his territory.

Observe their athleticism.,
Notice their intelligence.,
See if they want to play.,
See if they stalk their toys.,
Notice the affectionate and accommodating qualities.,
Find out if they were chosen for particular personality traits.",How to Identify an American Bobtail Cat2," The American bobtail cat is quite strong and well built. They make use of this strength with a great deal of athleticism and dexterity. They may climb trees, jump, or chase toys or rodents., The American bobtail cat is very intelligent and quite active. It will look for activities to engage its intelligence. If it is an outdoors cat, it may hunt birds and other wildlife. If it is an indoor cat, it may hunt mice or look for other objects to hunt.They love to problem solve and will often escape small rooms., American bobtail cats will often initiate games with their owners. You may be sitting on the couch enjoying a television show, and they will come to you with a toy for you to throw. If there is nobody around, they may occupy themselves with interactive cat games such as cat towers or scratch pads.Their playfulness is great for families with children.

, As a result of their intelligence and love of hunting, the American bobtail cat will often carry around toys as if they were freshly caught mice or other rodents. If it is an outdoor cat, it could be a real rodent such as a mouse or a squirrel that the cat has hunted and killed in the backyard., American bobtail cats love their families and show a great deal of affection. They are also relatively accommodating to other animals in the house, including dogs. Given their affectionate, confident and accommodating qualities, this breed is very good for therapeutic purposes., This breed can serve particular roles for an individual or family because of its personality traits. For instance, it is very sensitive to individuals with anxiety and stress disorders. As a result, they are recommended for people therapeutic purposes. They are often also used by long haul truck drivers, since they are good travelers. If you are not sure of the breed, you could ask whether the cat was chosen for its travelling or therapeutic traits."

Vacuum every day.,
Use pumice stone on the carpet.,
Try using a plastic sandal like a Croc on the carpet.,
Use dry mops on bare floors.,
Use wet rubber gloves on furniture.,
Use a cloth and furniture spray on wooden furniture.",How to Clean Up Cat Hair1," Hair accumulates very quickly, and so do the dust and allergy-triggering particles that come with it. Even a home with a single, short-haired cat might need to be vacuumed at least once a day, and a home with more pets will likely need more thorough vacuuming to keep excess hair at bay.


When vacuuming your carpet, go over areas twice in different directions to loosen stubborn hairs.
Robotic room-cleaners can be a good choice for regular vacuuming when you don't have time to go over a carpet every single day. Consider a robot for the rooms your cat frequents.;
, Scrape a pumice stone gently along the surface of the carpet. Any hair on the surface will gather right up. Peel the hair off the stone and throw the hair away.


Commercial products like FURminator work well, too, but a pumice stone is cheaper and does the job.

, Put a Croc on your hand or foot. Sweep it across the carpet, then rub the bottom of the shoe, and the hair will easily come off in your hand.


Try spraying water onto the bottom of the croc, and go back over the area a second time. This should gather the last of the hair.

, On hardwood, laminate, or vinyl, use an electrostatic or microfiber dry mop to clean up hair. These tend to work better than vacuums on bare flooring. They're sold at home-goods stores.


Sweeping helps to keep cat hair under control, but it can also be hard to corral the hair this way. Dry mops tend to trap the hair and dust better than anything else.

, Another way to remove pet hair from fabric or upholstered furniture is to use a damp rubber glove. The yellow kind used for washing dishes are perfect for this purpose. Get the glove slightly wet, then run the gloves over the surface of the fabric. Rinse the hair off and repeat the process as needed. If you don't have gloves, a sponge can work in a pinch.

, A clean, soft cloth can be used on wooden furniture, along with some polish or anti-static spray, to help remove cat hair. The spray will eliminate the static charge in the fur, making it less likely that the fur will re-attach itself to the same surface.

Use a vinegar cleaner.,
Try an enzymatic cleaner.,
Apply an all natural air freshener.,
Get your home professionally cleaned.",How to Eliminate Cat Odors Around the House1," There may be a strong urine smell in your home due to your cat’s litter box or due to your cat marking spots in your house. Tackle the urine odor by using a cleaner made of white vinegar. Put one part water and one part white vinegar in a spray bottle. Then, spray the cleaner on spots in your home that smell of urine. Let the vinegar evaporate, taking the urine smell with it.For large areas that smell of urine in your home, you can apply a clean cloth soaked in the vinegar cleaner.
For carpeted areas, you can use a carpet cleaner filled with the vinegar cleaner to remove urine odor.;
, An enzymatic cleaner contains enzymes that break down pet smells, such as urine odor. Removing these enzymes will also discourage your cat from marking these spots again. Look for enzymatic cleaners at your local pet store or online. Follow the instructions on the label to apply it to spots with pet odors in your home.Do not use an enzymatic cleaner with other cleaning products. The ingredients in other cleaning products can weaken the potency of the enzymatic cleaner.

, Another way you can remove cat odors is to use an all natural air freshener made with baking soda. Combine 1 teaspoon baking soda with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1 cup dried herbs like rosemary or lavender. Sprinkle the cleaner on your carpet or on furniture that has a smell. Let it sit for at least an hour and then vacuum it up.Keep the air freshener on hand so you can sprinkle it on smelly spots in your home as needed. It is a great finishing touch after you have wiped up any cat urine or feces in your home as it will get rid of any lingering smells.

Use a lint roller on your clothes.,
Groom your cat more regularly.,
Pay attention to the season.,
Try gently vacuuming your cat.,
Never punish a cat for shedding.",How to Clean Up Cat Hair2," Keep one of them beside the door so you can remove the hair quickly before you leave for work, school or social occasions.


Don't have a lint roller? Use tape! Any sticky tape (transparent, masking, duct, etc.) will pull hair off your clothes. You could even make your own lint roller with a dowel, an empty thread-spool and some sticky tape.
Throw your clothes in the dryer for about ten minutes and add a dryer sheet, or a dryer ball. This technique can help loosen the hair from the clothes. Using fabric softener when you do laundry also helps keep hair from sticking to clothes.

, Brushing your cat more often will help trap that hair before it has a chance to go skittering across the floor. Use a fine-tooth cat brush and regularly groom your kitty.


Cats groom themselves, of course, but many animals enjoy the feeling of being brushed and being held. If your cat doesn't like it at first, hold the animal firmly to your chest with your hand under its belly and pet it. Talk to the cat in a soothing voice.

, When late spring rolls around, it's important to start grooming your cats. They'll shed at the beginning of summer and at a variety of other times during the year, depending on the breed. Some cats shed constantly and will need to be brushed year round.

, While it might seem strange, it can be done safely. Try stretching a stocking or thin sock over the vacuum hose and then vacuuming your cat's back very gently if it's relatively comfortable around the vacuum. Because most pets go scattering when the vacuum comes out, this is usually difficult to pull off. The object here is to catch loose hairs before they attach themselves to you and your surroundings.

, If you find fur on the couch or on your favorite clothes, it might be tempting to push your cat's face into the mess and attempt to ""punish"" them, but this is the last thing you should do. Instead of learning that it's wrong to rub on or lay on a particular surface, your cat will only learn to fear your presence and may actually shed more as the result of stress. The point is: ""punishment"" is likely to be lost on a cat. It may serve only to drive a wedge between it and you. You may just have to accept the fact that cats and loose hair go together. "

You should change the litter in the litter box once a month to keep it fresh. Do a full wash of the litter box once a year so it stays clean and odor-free.

, Scented litter will only mask the smell and make it hard for you to determine when the litter needs to be cleaned. Some cats can also be turned off by scented litter and decide not to use the litter box at all, leading to stinky spots in your house. Go for unscented litter that is light in color so you can see when there is feces in the box that needs to be removed.To minimize odor in the box, you can sprinkle baking soda at the bottom and then put the litter on top. This can help to keep the litter smelling fresh.

, Place the litter boxes in different areas of your home and clean each box regularly. Try to have at least one litter box per cat in your household so each cat has the space and privacy they need to go to the bathroom. Having multiple litter boxes will also ensure all the cats are not using one litter box. This can lead to a stinky litter box situation in your home.

, Use a vacuum made to clean pet hair and dander. Vacuum any areas where your cat plays or lounges, such as around cat trees or scratching posts.

Provide plenty of food and a safe place so that she can look after her kittens. The mother will also teach the kittens to toilet and socialize. Since they won't be eating solid foods, she'll nurse them in the early weeks. In rare cases, the mother cat can't or won't care for her kittens (because of mastitis, a retained placenta, feeling overwhelmed, or she simply neglects them).Get the mother medical attention to treat physical problems and care for the kittens if she's not looking after them.


While you won't need to feed the newborn kittens, you should keep their space clean. Frequently check the kittens space to see if you need to change any bedding. They can begin using the litter box around 4 weeks old.;
, If you're caring for newborn kittens that have no mother cat around, first make sure that she is truly gone. Before picking up the kittens, keep a large distance and wait several hours for the mother to come back. If she doesn't or the kittens are in danger, carefully wrap them in towels and place them in carriers with good air circulation. Once the kittens are warm, bottle feed them kitten milk replacement formula every 3 hours.You should also do this for any kittens that a mother cat is neglecting, even if she's still around.
You'll also need to help the kittens use the toilet. Use a damp washcloth or piece of gauze and wipe it across their genitals until clean. Dry off the kittens.

, A caring mother cat reduces kitten's stress. If the mother isn't around or is neglecting them, you'll need to nurture the newborns. This is critical during the first few weeks of life, so if you can, try to give the kittens to someone who has a cat that is currently nursing. If you must socialize the kittens, start slowly and earn their trust. Gradually begin holding the kittens, introduce them to other people, and play with them as they get older.


If you're worried about starting out, let the kittens become familiar with you while you feed them. This way, they'll associate the feelings of comfort and trust with you., The kittens will get antibodies from their mother's milk, but they will need vaccines after a few weeks. It's a good idea to vaccinate kittens before you give them away. Not only will it improve your chances of finding a home for them, but you'll also ensure they're getting important medical care. Follow this early schedule for newborn kittens:8 weeks old: FVRCP Vaccine (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis Calicivirus and Panleukopenia), start heartworm, flea, and tick preventatives
12 weeks old: FVRCP booster, feline leukemia virus (FELV) vaccine
16 weeks old: FVRCP booster, FELV booster, rabies vaccine

, You should go ahead and spay or neuter the kittens before you re-home them. This ensures it gets done and may increase the chances that someone wants to adopt them. If you're giving the kittens to friends or family, you could discuss this with them to see if they'd like to cover the cost.


Be sure to wait until the kittens are weaned or at least 2 months old before spaying or neutering.Many states have low-costs spay/neuter clinics. Check with the vet or use an online database to find one near you., The kittens will benefit from staying with their mother for as long as possible. Their mother will nurse them, teach them to eliminate, and help them learn valuable socializing skills.Laws about how early you can sell kittens vary, so check your state's laws.In general, try to wait until the kittens are weaned, about 6 to 8 weeks.
Even if you're hand-raising the kittens (no mother is around), you should still wait 6 to 8 weeks before giving them away. This way, you ensure they're getting proper medical treatment and socialization.

, Potential adopters will want to the kittens' history. If you have several kittens, you may want to give a photograph of each of them along with a short personality description. Keep track of important information in a file that you can give the adopter. Include this information:


Birth date
Medical history, including vaccinations and preventatives
Surgeries, including spaying or neutering
List skills, including whether the kittens are housetrained

, Ask your friends and family if they're interested in adopting the kittens. It may be easier to place the kittens if you find people you already trust. If no one's showing interest, begin asking coworkers or neighbors. You can also ask the veterinarian to recommend people who are looking to adopt kittens.


Try to ask around in person before advertising. While social media makes it easy to advertise kittens, it may be harder to find a reliable, trustworthy person to take them., If someone who's not a friend or family wants to adopt your kittens, interview the person. Ask to meet in a public place and consider asking for references. The goal of the interview is to determine whether the person can be trusted with the kittens, whether the person can provide for them, and if the person will keep them for the long term. Consider asking these questions:How much are you willing to spend on your pets?
Do you have a veterinarian?
Do you have any other pets? If so, how long have you had them?
Do you have children?
If you rent, are you allowed to have pets?
When they're older, will the cats have access to the outdoors? If so, do you have a fenced yard?

, While you may think it would be easier to simply give the kittens away for free, it's better to ask anywhere from $20 to $60 for them. This prevents untrustworthy people from just taking free kittens and abusing them or selling them to labs. The fee can also weed out people who aren't serious about adopting.You can either use the fee to pay for early veterinary care (shots, spay, or neuter). Or, you can waive the fee once you've found honest and reliable adopters.

, If all else fails and you can't find someone reliable to adopt the kittens, find an organization to take the kittens. A local animal shelter, humane society, or rescue organization may be able to take the kittens. Note that some may charge a small fee or may not be accepting kittens.Before you drop the cats off to an animal shelter, research whether it is a no-kill shelter. Some shelters may euthanize animals if they don't have enough space.

Treat underlying conditions according to your vet's instructions.,
Watch for signs of complications.",How to Help Your Cat Who Had a Miscarriage2," Cats usually do not respond emotionally to miscarriages the way people would.

In these cases, it's a good idea to isolate the cat in a calming environment.Place your cat in a quiet room free of outside noise and distraction. Have everything she needs, such as food, water, and a litter box, in the room. You should also provide a warm bed.

Be proactive about parasites.",How to Help Your Cat Who Had a Miscarriage3," Unless you want to breed your cat, it's a good idea to have her spayed. You do not want to deal with another miscarriage in the future and caring for kittens can be costly. Spaying your cat will prevent pregnancy altogether., Seeing a vet regularly during your cat's pregnancy can decrease the risk of miscarriage. If your cat is not spayed and is around un-neutered males, she is at risk of becoming pregnant. Watch for signs of pregnancy so you can get your cat evaluated early.Cats usually do not gain weight until the end of pregnancy, so you should look for other signs. The main way to tell your cat is pregnant is to look at her nipples. Early on in pregnancy, a cat's nipples will become noticeably darker and enlarged.
A cat will also gain weight throughout pregnancy, so changes in your cat's size can indicate pregnancy.

, Cats need adequate food during pregnancy. A healthy diet can translate to a healthy pregnancy. You will need to add extra protein to your cat's meals throughout her pregnancy.Talk to your vet about safe sources of extra protein for your cat. Your vet may recommend a particular brand of cat food.
Towards the end of your cat's pregnancy, your vet may want to switch her to kitten chow to provide her the nutrients to support breastfeeding.
You should always have food out for your cat while she's pregnant. Even if you usually schedule meal times, allow your cat to eat freely while pregnant.

, Have your cat's stools checked regularly at a vet's office. This is especially important if your cat goes outside or has had fleas in the past. Parasites can cause a miscarriage, so keeping your cat parasite free can help prevent miscarriage."

These hairball control diets can be effective in some cats, but they are not guaranteed to solve every cat’s hairball problem. You can purchase hairball care foods at your grocery, vet, or pet store., Some veterinarians and cat owners think a grain-free diet is the solution for cats who frequently vomit hairballs. Try a hairball formula that is free from all grains including wheat, rice, and corn., Vegetable fiber can help your cat digest the contents of its stomach more efficiently. Most commercial cat foods only have a fiber content of one to two percent. Opt for a hairball formula that contains between five and eight percent fiber., A hairball formula that contains beet pulp and cellulose might help eliminate your cat's hairball problem. When combined, these two ingredients can effectively eliminate hair from your cat's digestive tract., It is important that your cat stays hydrated while you are changing its diet. This is especially important if you are feeding your cat a high-fiber food. Your cat’s body will need more fluid than normal as the digestive tract processes the additional fiber.

Her instinct will kick in and she won't need you to be part of labor and delivery. Instead, you'll need to watch and ensure that nothing goes wrong medically. Here are things to look for:The kitten is not freed from the birth sac: The kittens usually emerge in individual birth sacs that the mother then licks away. If she doesn't clean it away or rejects the kitten, you may need to take a soft towel and gently rub off the sac. If in doubt, give the mother a little time to tend to the kitten before doing this or she may reject the kitten.

The mother is pushing hard for more than 20 minutes: This is a sign she is having difficulty birthing. Have a quick peek to see if a kitten is half out. If so, hold the kitten with a soft, clean towel and gently pull backwards and downwards. If the kitten doesn't come out easily then call the vet. Likewise, if you see nothing, call the vet.
The kitten doesn't suckle after one hour: Most kittens suckle within an hour or two of being born. If this doesn't happen, gently place the kitten by the mother's teats which helps the kitten get the scent of milk. If after half an hour the kitten still isn't suckling, gently open the kitten's mouth and latch him onto a nipple to suckle. If after that the kitten doesn't feed, then you might need to hand raise the kitten.;
, Since the mother cat will be primarily caring for the kittens during the first four weeks of their lives, ensure she has everything she needs. The mother will most likely choose a nesting spot where you can make her comfortable. Put a box with some clean, dry bedding in the room and keep the temperature roughly the same temperature you would feel comfortable in wearing jeans and a T-shirt. You should also make sure the mother and kittens have private time away from a steady stream of visitors, which could make her feel threatened.Room temperature is important. Too hot and the mother will become distressed, but too cold and the kittens risk hypothermia. Newborn kittens cannot regulate their body temperatures and depend on the mother to stay warm.

, The mother will double her food intake after labor, so give plenty of high quality food and continue supplementing her with vitamins and minerals.Kitten food is ideal as it is higher calorie than regular food and has added vitamins and minerals. Avoid giving her milk to drink, since it could give her diarrhea. Place food and water close to her nesting place so she won't have to leave her kittens. You should also put a litter box within sight of the nest so can relieve herself and stay close to the kittens.Kittens are born deaf and blind. Their most developed sense is smell which they use to find their mother's milk.

, While there are many ways to wean a kitten (changing them from mother's milk to solid food), the easiest way is to let the kittens follow the mother's lead. They'll generally do this from the age of four weeks on. You can help by setting out kitten food for the mother. The kittens may only appear curious at first, but as they burn more energy, they'll begin eating the food. The kittens may find it easier to start eating soft food, such as canned kitten food.The mother will encourage weaning by cutting back on nursing sessions. This will motivate the kittens to begin eating solid foods.

, As they get older, the kittens will begin to move, explore, play, and stray from the nest. Now is a good time to set out a large, low-sided litter tray. Show the kittens where it is to prevent future toileting accidents. It may help to have the mother poop in the tray (or set some of her poop in the tray). This will signal to the kittens that the tray is the toileting place.Never use clumping cat litter. If the kitten investigates the litter and swallows some, the litter can clump within the gut causing a blockage.

, Keep the kittens safe by removing hazards like deep water bottles, strings, ribbons, or small toys. Doing so can keep your cat from drowning or choking. You should also take care where you put hot drinks in case curious kittens knock into them and get scalded. Plates with human food should also be removed from the kittens since they could eat food that irritates their stomachs.Supervise any other pets (especially dogs) around the kittens and seal off places where kittens could crawl inside and become stuck.
Also be careful when entering a room where the kittens are living. Kittens love to dash around in an unpredictable way and it is easy to tread on a kitten or fall over one.

, If you've decided not to keep the kittens, you can begin finding new homes for them as soon as they're eight weeks old. While some suggest you should wait until 12 weeks, kittens don't socialize as much by this point, making it harder for them to adapt to their new homes. This is why it's best to start looking for homes between eight and 12 weeks old.


This timeframe lets the kittens spend plenty of time with their mother and allows them to accept their new homes., Look closely at their skin and fur for small black spots. You can also brush the fur and shake the brush onto a white, wet paper towel. You might see red spots (dried blood) and flea dirt (flea droppings). If the kittens or mother have fleas, ask your veterinarian to recommend a flea product designed for use in kittens. Take care to treat the mother, wait for medication to dry, and return her to the kittens.


If your vet finds the kittens have roundworms passed on from mother's milk, the kittens might need to be treated with a liquid medication (fenbendazole) that is given by syringe.You can give this to kittens that are at least three weeks old. Repeat treatment every two to three weeks.

, You can get the kittens vaccinated once they are at least nine weeks old. Consult with the veterinarian to determine which vaccinations the kittens need. Your vet will probably recommend to vaccinate against feline distemper, which your cat will likely be exposed to. On the other hand, the vet may not recommend vaccinating against feline leukaemia if your kittens will remain indoors. This is because feline leukaemia is spread by close contact with other cats.Even if the kitten is going to be an indoor cat, vaccination is still advisable, although your veterinarian can advise you as to which components are essential and which are optional.

, When the kittens are three or four weeks old or no longer constantly nursing, invite friends over to handle and play with the kittens. Make sure this is a controlled introduction, so the kittens aren't overwhelmed or frightened (which could be traumatizing). Keep in mind that it's important to expose your kittens to a variety of people, sounds, smells, and environments before they turn 12 weeks old. Around this time, it becomes harder for them to accept new situations and experiences.


If you socialize the kittens at an early age, they'll be accepting, confident, well-adjusted, and outgoing, characteristics they'll keep as they grow into adult cats."

Observe its medium size.,
Look for a rectangular build.,
Feel its silky coat.,
Notice the variety of coat colors and patterns.",How to Identify an American Curl Cat1," An American curl cat is a medium-size cat. A male cat typically weighs between 8 to 12 lbs (3.6 to 5.4 kg), while a female may weigh 8 lbs (3.6 kg) or less. This breed has a life expectancy of 9 to 13 years., An American curl cat has a lean, rectangular body and a muscular build. This breed has a long body for its size, but its medium-sized bones give it a sturdy figure., This breed comes in both medium and short-haired varieties and has a smooth, silky coat that lies flat.This breed does not have an undercoat, which means it sheds very little. This breed requires very little grooming and needs only to be combed once a week.Notice this breed’s long tail.Breeds with longer hair will have a plumed, fluffy tail., Because this breed has a diverse genetic background, you will notice that they can come in a multitude of colors and patterns. The American Cat Fancier’s Association recognizes all of their coat varieties.Some of this breed's many coat colors include white, blue, black, lilac, golden, red, brown, and tortoiseshell.American curl cats can also have a myriad of coat patterns. Some of these include solid, bicolor, calico, tabby, shaded, ticking, smoke, and points."

Calm her loud meowing.,
Deal with scent marking.,
Be prepared for clingy behavior.,
Give her extra attention.,
Don’t change her feeding routine.,
Decrease the stress on your other cats.",How to Deal With a Female Cat in Heat1," When a cat’s in heat, she advertises the fact to increase her chances of finding a boyfriend and having kittens. One way she does this is by vocalizing incredibly loudly and constantly. To an inexperienced owner, it may seem like she’s in pain, but this is perfectly normal behavior. You can either choose to deal with the extra noise, or try to calm her down.


Try plugging in a Feliway diffuser before your cat comes into heat. This synthetic feline pheromone surrounds her with safe, familiar scents.Pheromones are chemical messengers — a similar idea to the pheromones a female gives off to advertise she is in heat. But the ones in Feliway might have a calming, soothing effect on her.
It doesn't work immediately, but the pheromones build up the cat's sense of well-being over a couple of weeks. As such, it's best to plug the diffuser in early and leave it running constantly in the background, so she gets the benefit by the time she comes into heat.;
, Not all female cats do this, but some mark their territory with urine. Urine has potent scent markers that she uses to attract mates. Again, there’s nothing you can do to stop this behavior without getting her spayed, so you just have to make do. A few things you can do to make life a little easier include:


Making sure she has a clean litter box at all times. Hopefully her house training will lead her to use the box instead of marking in the house.
De-odorizing immediately if she does mark. This will discourage her from returning to that spot to mark it again.
Use an ""enzymatic"" cleaner to completely remove the urine odor.The enzymes in these products break cat urine down better than any other cleaner. Allow the product to air dry for best results.
A home-made alternative is to dilute some biological washing powder in water. Use this to clean the area, then rinse it with water. Clean again with a solution of bicarbonate of soda. Finish by rinsing one last time.

Always test cleaning products on a small, hidden patch of fabric before treating a marked patch for odor.



, Your cat goes on a massive hormonal roller-coaster which changes her behavior when she’s in heat. One difference is that her body language and social behavior might change quite a bit.


She might seek out company far more than usual.
She may demand that you rub her lower back. When you do, she might flirtatiously holds her tail to one side to better expose her genital area.
She may 'commando crawl' across the floor by flattening her front half against the floor, then crawling with her rear end pushed up in the air.
She is also likely to squirm and roll around enthusiastically. When combined with the loud crying, it might look like she’s in pain. Don’t worry — she’s just flirting.
There’s nothing to be done about this behavior. It’s perfectly normal, and as long as no males are able to reach her, she’ll be fine.

, Tire her out with regular play sessions. This may lessen her energy and help her to settle down and sleep instead of writhing around and yowling. Some female cats enjoy an extra fuss or even a massage when they are in heat. But don't be surprised if she starts acting flirty with you and presents her backside!

, Many female cats don't eat properly when they are in heat. This can cause them to lose weight and body condition, which worries their loving owners. But don't try to feed make up for her lack of appetite with higher calorie cat food. This will only supply her with even more energy to cry and call.


Instead, leave large amounts of her regular cat food available for free-feeding. She can snack whenever she feels like it.

, If you own more than one cat, think of how stressful it is for the others to have a calling female in their midst for one week out of every three. This can be unsettling for them. The Feliway diffuser you use to calm the behavior of the cat in heat will also make your other cats feel better.


Again, Feliway takes a couple of weeks to build up in your cats' systems, so plug in the diffuser before your female goes into heat.

"
"
Recognize that your cat is in heat.,
Isolate her from male cats.,
Give your cat something warm to sit on.,
Use catnip only if it calms your cat down.,
Test whether herbal remedies are effective.,
Use Feliway in your home.,
Keep her litter box clean.,
Play with your cat.",How to Calm a Cat in Heat1," Make sure that the behavior your cat is expressing actually means that she’s in heat and not sick. An unspayed cat in heat will vocalize a lot, be restless, rub against people and objects, and roll around on the floor. If you stroke her lower back, she'll respond by raising her pelvis and shifting her tail to one side.The normal breeding season for cats is between spring and late summer. She will likely go into heat during this time of year.
Decide if your cat's in heat or sick. If she's acting restless, but not rubbing herself against everything and lifting her tail to the side, she may be in pain. Take her to the vet to find out what's going on.;
, When she's in heat, your cat will grow even more excitable in the presence of males. Do not allow her outside at all, and close all windows and lock all doors, including pet flaps. To keep her calm (and prevent her from getting pregnant), you need to keep her away from all male cats. Isolation will also keep her safe — she may try to escape your home if she senses a male outside.If you have a male cat in the same house, find a friend or hire a cat sitter to take him in for a couple weeks. If the two cats stay in the same area, they'll both act wild, and almost certainly end up mating.
If male cats are visible through a window, cover the window with curtains or a piece of cardboard.

, Although success is not guaranteed, some people find that giving the cat a heat pack or a warm, wet towel to sit on keeps her still and calm.A microwavable heat pack may be the easiest option, since you can quickly reheat it once the cat starts acting up again. An electric heat pad/blanket is also a good choice.

, Cats respond very differently to catnip. Some relax and quiet down when given catnip, but other become energetic and aggressive.If you don't know how your cat responds to catnip, avoid this method. It may make the situation even worse.


Note that this is only a temporary fix, but it might buy you an hour or two of peace.

, There are many herbal remedies on the market intended to calm cats. Some cat owners report success, but there is no single remedy that works on every cat. Furthermore, your cat may not respond to any of these products. Buy a collection of small samples and try several different remedies. Once you've found a product that works for your cat, buy it in larger amounts.


Follow the instructions on the labels. They may tell you to add the remedy to the cat's water, rub a few drops into the cat's fur, or use as an air freshener.
Do not use products intended for humans, which likely use higher dosages.

, Feliway is a synthetic cat pheromone that has a soothing, calming effect on cats.It takes a couple weeks of exposure to begin calming cats down, though, so it's not an immediate fix. If you know your cat is unspayed, you might consider plugging in the Feliway diffuser at the beginning of breeding season (spring). That way, whenever she goes into heat, the Feliway will already be built up in her system.

, Cats often scent mark with urine to attract males when they are in heat. By keeping her litter box clean at all times, you might encourage her to use it instead of scent marking your home. If she scent marks anyway, clean and de-odorize the area immediately. Leaving the smell of urine behind will only drive her to keep doing it.


Don't use cleaning products with bleach. The ammonia in them is also found naturally in urine, and the smell will encourage her to mark that spot again.

, Playing with your cat can distract her temporarily, but she'll often go straight back to howling after you're done. Petting, scratching, or brushing her lower back can be more effective, if your cat is already calm enough to let you do so."

Notice its unique ears.,
Look for walnut-shaped eyes.,
Observe its eye color.,
Pay attention to its rounded or wedge-shaped head.",How to Identify an American Curl Cat2," The hallmark feature of the American curl cat is its curled ears. This breed has arched, curved ears that are made of firm cartilage. The arch can range from 90° to 180°.The ears have been compared to the ears of a lynx, which is a medium-size wild cat with pointed ears.These unique ears give the cat a happy, playful expression.Kittens are born with straight ears, but they begin to arch after three to five days., Another identifier of this breed is the shape of its eyes. Its large eyes are walnut or wedge-shaped, which gives them a bright, friendly, and curious expression., This breed also has a wide variety of eye colors due to its large genetic background. Some of the colors include amber, blue, copper, green, gold, hazel, orange, or yellow., This breed has a rounded or wedge-shaped head, a well-formed muzzle, and a strong chin. In terms of proportion, its head is longer than it is wide and is well-portioned to its body size."
"
Notice its people-oriented personality.,
Pay attention to its playfulness.,
Watch its friendly interactions with other animals.,
Listen for cooing sounds.",How to Identify an American Curl Cat3," American curl cats are affectionate and attentive to their owners and others around them. They have been described as dog-like in personality, and they like interacting with children.An American curl cat is curious and will likely want to follow you throughout the house.This cat is likely to greet you affectionately at the door when you come home., These cats retain their kitten-like personalities as they grow older. They have been referred to as the “Peter Pan” of cats for their sustained playfulness and energy throughout their life.Both males and females are equally active and spirited., The American curl cat is adaptable and will usually get along well with other cats, dogs, and other pets in your home.When brought into a new home, this breed will respect the other animals and their territories, giving them time to adjust to its presence., The American curl cat is not a very vocal cat. Instead, this cat will let you know when it needs something by making a quivering, trill-like cooing sound."
"
Keep her indoors.,
Isolate her from your male cats.,
Lock your doors and windows.,
Consider neutering her.",How to Deal With a Female Cat in Heat2," If your cat is normally allowed to wander outdoors, you have to put a stop to it as soon as you realize she’s in heat. While she’s indoors, you can control whether or not male cats have access to her. While she’s outdoors, every male in the neighborhood is going to be drawn by her yowling and scent marking. She is very likely to get pregnant.

, If you own an un-neutered male cat, he will likely be drawn to her like a magnet when she’s in heat. You must keep all males away from her until her heat has passed.


Keep either the male(s) or female isolated in a separate room.
Spruce the room up so the isolated cat doesn’t grow anxious. Put a litter box in there, along with a comfortable bed, food, and plenty of toys to keep them occupied.

, Even if you keep her inside, the neighborhood males will still be able to hear her yowling and smell her scent marking. You may notice a suspicious increase in tomcats lurking around your home.


Leaving doors or windows open, even with mosquito mesh acting as a barrier, can be dangerous. A determined male will claw through the mesh to reach your female, and she can get pregnant without even leaving the house.
Block off any cat flaps in your doors.

, Rescue centers are over-flowing with unwanted kittens and cats. It's morally questionable to let your cat get pregnant for no good reason. Neutering female cats can be done at any stage in their hormonal cycle. If cost is an issue, many cat rescue or welfare societies offer vouchers towards the cost of surgery. Your local veterinary clinic will be able to point you in the right direction to make inquiries.

"
"
Spay the cat.,
Consider waiting until after the heat is over before spaying.,
Use hormonal therapy as a last resort.",How to Calm a Cat in Heat2," Spaying a cat removes her ovaries and prevents the heat cycle from occurring. It prevents her from getting pregnant, and reduces the risk of certain cancers and other diseases.If you can't afford the surgery, look for low-cost spay services. Many clinics offer this service at a reduced price because it reduces the population of stray cats.
Look up your area in the databases listed on the USDA website.There is a small chance of leftover ovarian tissue sending the cat into heat even after the surgery. If this occurs, consult a veterinarian.

, A vet can perform the spaying procedure at any point in your cat's hormonal cycle — even when she's in heat. However, there's a risk of increased blood loss at that time. The procedure is possible, but consult an experienced veterinarian for advice., The hormones prostaglandin and estrogen can be used to stop a cat’s heat cycle; however, this treatment has serious side effects including uterine infection and tumors.Because of the risks, take this step only when spaying is not an option. Always consult in detail with a vet, who will need to prescribe the hormones and explain how to use them properly.Even if the cat can't be spayed for medical reasons, the risks may not be worth the calm behavior.

Determine when to wean your kitten.,
Purchase the necessary nourishment.,
Buy a shallow food and water dish.,
Do not abruptly remove your kitten from its mother if you can.,
Present your kitten with replacement milk.,
Acclimate the kitten to bowl feeding.,
Introduce solid food.,
Transition to solid food around eight to 10 weeks.",How to Wean Kittens," The weaning process begins when kittens are around four weeks old. For most kittens, this process is usually completed when they reach eight to ten weeks old. Once a kitten has opened its eyes, is able to focus, and can walk steadily, you can begin the process.At around 10 - 14 days, a kitten's eyes and ears start to open. Between 2 -3 weeks they start to stand and take wobbly steps, building up their muscles, and learning to walk. During this time, they still get all their nutrition from mother's milk. Once a mother sees that their kitten is mobile, they'll begin the weaning process themselves in the wild.;
, When you first start weaning your kitten off of its mother’s milk, you’ll want to buy milk replacer. It is designed to replicate the nutritional value and to a degree the taste of its mother’s milk. You'll also want to be sure to purchase high-quality cat food, which will be introduced to the kitten gradually. A good rule of thumb is to see if a meat is listed first on its ingredients. This will mean that the food has a higher percentage of protein, which growing cats need to be healthy.Do not give your kitten cow’s milk. This is not a suitable replacement because your kitten’s stomach cannot process it. The kitten will end up with diarrhea., Ceramic or plastic bowls work equally well. Make sure that your kitten can easily reach the bottom of the bowl. Your kitten will take to its milk replacer and other foods much easier if it can lap its food up easily., Kittens, like children, learn through observation. Your kitten will observe its mother eating, using the litter box, and playing. It will then replicate much of this behavior. If you have both the mother and her kitten, try to keep them together as long as possible - or at least until the 10 weeks mark. They will naturally separate over time.


It is ok to separate them for a few hours a day at around four weeks. Make sure that they have their own litter box and food/water bowls. Eventually, your kitten will become more independent and will willingly chose to be away from its mother.Do not worry if your kitten has been orphaned. Your kitten has strong instincts when it comes to self-preservation. It will figure out a way to feed itself, even if its mother is not present. Most people that raise orphaned kittens choose to wean them onto solid food early, at around four weeks or so. At this point the kitten’s stomach has developed to the point that it can process solid food. It just needs to be taught to eat solid food., At first, your kitten will need about four to five meals a day. Give them around 1/3 cup of replacement milk and kitten chow for each meal.They'll be fine to go through the night without a meal, but if you hear them making noise, it is ok to leave them some extra food before you go to bed.If you have a newborn that's been removed from its mother, you'll need to replicate the suckling nature of its normal feeding time with an eye dropper. Fill the eye dropper with the replacement milk you’ve purchased. Hold the kitten securely and then slowly add a few drops of milk into the kitten's mouth at a time. Alternatively, some people dip their finger in the milk and let the kitten lick it off this way., This may be a difficult process for your kitten. If it is used to suckling milk from its mother, it will find the bowl a strange substitute. Simply show the kitten where the milk is. Dip your finger in the bowl and present it to the kitten. It will eventually recognize the scent and will explore it further.


Refrain from pushing the head of the kitten into the bowl. Doing so could cause him to inhale the milk, which could lead to lung issues.If the kitten is initially reluctant, return to dropper feeding or to his mother. However, begin every feeding by offering the bowl first to encourage the kitten to drink from the bowl.

, Once the kitten is accustomed to lapping from the bowl, offer a gruel mixture. To make a gruel, mix a ground high quality kitten food with the milk replacer. The initial consistency should be similar to oatmeal. Many people use a blender to mix their cat food with the milk replacer.You can introduce your kitten to this gruel and other moist foods around five to six weeks., Eventually stop providing gruel and, instead, offer well moistened kitten food. When you switch to the kitten food, make sure you provide a separate bowl of water for the animal.


To complete the transition, moisten the kitten food less and less until it is accepted by the kitten in its original consistency. A bowl of water should always be available next to the food dish.Make sure that your kitten has the opportunity to eat around four times a day until it is six months old. At this point, it is ok to transition them down to two meals a day.Talk to your vet about feeding methods. Some vets promote the ""ad lib"" or ""free feeding method"" over the scheduled feeding routine. Proponents of ad lib feeding argue that it accommodates persnickety eaters - or those cats who won't eat at scheduled times. In general, if this seems to make your kitten/cat happier, it is ok. If your kitten turns into an overweight cat, you might consider going to a scheduled feeding schedule to limit the amount of food they consume a day."
"
Pick what breed of cat you want.,
Network.,
Pick a queen (female) carefully.,
Find a good stud.,
Make a vet appointment for your queen just before you breed.,
Plan a budget.,
Consider carefully.",How to Breed Cats1," There are almost always plenty of kittens in animal shelters, and breeding pure-bred or pedigreed cats is a good way to make sure your kittens have something to recommend them over the rescue cats. Picking the breed that you like most is certainly an option, but if you have any concern about finding homes for the kittens, consider selecting your parent cats from a popular breed that isn't already represented in your area.;
, Many breeders won't sell a cat with breeding potential to someone with no experience in the world of cat breeding and showing.If you already have a cat, take it to some shows (most shows have sections for cats that aren't a specific breed), and make some contacts.

, In addition being in good health and of an age appropriate for breeding (at least 18-24 months), here are some things to take into account:


Does she display the standard characteristics of her breed?
Does she have the correct paperwork detailing her ancestry?
Does she have breeding rights?
Did her mother or grandmother have any pregnancy complications?
Cats that have been shown and done well will produce more desirable kittens, so consider whether you can show her successfully (or whether she has already been shown).
Is she friendly and sociable? (These are inherited traits!)

, Most of the things you look for in a queen are very similar to those you want in a stud - character, looks, breed status, and health are equally important. Stud owners should have paperwork that demonstrates the current health and breed status of their cat. It isn’t wise to use a pet cat as a stud. Normal behavior for un-neutered male cats includes aggression and spraying,and this behavior doesn’t necessarily cease if the tom is later neutered. Ask around at vets, cat shows, and breeders to find an eligible stud whose not too closely related to your queen. It’s worth traveling to the right stud if you want it to be easy to find good homes for your kittens.

, You need to make sure that both cats are healthy before breeding them. Some things to have the vet check for are:


Vaccinations should all be up to date
FeLV and FIV - these tests should happen directly before each breeding
Ringworm, ear mites and fleas
A stool check should be performed for internal parasites
Genetic diseases including polycystic kidney disease, hip dysplasia, patellar luxations, and heart disease.
Any breed-specific diseases, Raising kittens is expensive. The following are estimates of some costs that you should take into consideration:


Veterinary care - like human mothers, feline mothers need extra veterinary check ups to ensure that the pregnancy is going well, and can have unexpected complications necessitating procedures such as a C-section.

Pre-breeding check up - $700
During pregnancy check up with ultra-sound - $160 (or with x-ray $110)
Emergency C-section - at least $300Food - good quality food for your queen is important thought her entire life, but especially during pregnancy. You also need to make sure her kittens have good quality food as they are weaned - this is essential to their development. You should budget for things like fresh chicken, fish, special kitten food, and raw good quality minced beef, all of which are good for weaned kittens.Food for the queen during pregnancy and lactation - $147
Emergency food for the kittens if something goes wrong with their milk supply - $20


Registration fees - $155 for your first year as a breeder. If you want your kittens to have the advantage of a pedigree, you need to register yourself as a breeder and register your queen, and each litter.
Heating, in the winter. Kittens need to be kept warm all the time, and in the winter, this can add up to a sizable bill., There are a lot of unwanted kittens in the world, so you should be sure you want to breed more cats before starting. If your main reason for wanting to breed cats is to have kittens to play with, consider volunteering for your local animal shelter - most shelters send rescue kittens home with trained volunteers until they are weaned and ready to be adopted. Some other things to take into considerations are:


Money - can you afford all of the costs of kitten-raising if you don't manage to make a profit selling the kittens?
Time - breeding cats and raising kittens are both time intensive activities - you should not leave an expectant mother or little kittens alone for extended periods of time (even a work-day is too long).
Finding homes for the kittens - is there a market for bred cats in your area? Are you prepared to do the marketing required to find good homes for them? Any home is not a good home; you're responsible for making sure that the people who adopt your kittens aren't going to get tired of them, or get rid of them because the cat developed bad behavior due to poor treatment.
Ethical issues - while there are some people who are looking for specific appearance of characteristics in cats that are only found in purebreds, consider whether your kittens might end up in homes that would have been equally happy with a rescue cat. Every year in the US 1.4 million adoptable cats are euthanized in shelters because no suitable home for them can be found., "
"
Consider the situation.,
Get help from your veterinarian or local animal shelter.,
Provide food for the mother cat if she is still around.,
Feed the kittens.,
Weigh the kittens once per week.,
Leave kittens alone during their first week of life if the mother is around.,
Handle kittens gently.,
Provide a place for the kitten(s) to sleep.,
Keep the kittens warm.,
Allow the mother cat to help her cats if she is around/able.,
Help kittens urinate/defecate if necessary.,
Encourage litter box use at four weeks.,
Watch for problems.",How to Care for Newborn Kittens," The care that you give some newborn kittens will depend on a few things: the kittens’ ages, whether or not the mother cat is still caring for the kittens, and how healthy the kittens are. If you find a litter of kittens that have been separated from their mother, then you will need to provide the things a mother cat would, such as food, warmth, and help with toileting. Take some time to consider the situation before you start caring for the kittens.If you find some kittens that you think have been abandoned or separated from their mother, observe them from a distance of about 35 feet to see if the mother cat returns.
If the kittens are in immediate danger, then you will need to intervene without waiting for the mother cat to return. For example, you should intervene immediately if the kittens are in danger of freezing from the cold, left in a place that they might get run over or stepped on, or in an area where dogs might harm them.;
, Do not feel like you need to provide care for these kittens all by yourself. Caring for newborn kittens is a difficult job and you may not have everything you need to ensure their survival. Contact your local veterinarian or animal shelter for assistance. They may be able to provide a surrogate mother to help the kittens get proper nutrition or they may be able to help you with bottle feeding., If the mother cat is still present and caring for her kittens, then the kittens will be better off if you let their mother take care of them. But you can still help by providing food and shelter for the mother cat. Just make sure that you keep the food and shelter in separate areas or she may not accept either., If the mother cat is not around or is unable to care for her kittens, you will need to prepare their food for them and feed them yourself. The type of food that you prepare for the kittens will depend on how old they are. Make sure that you ask your veterinarian about any special feeding needs your kittens may have.When the kittens are 1-2 weeks old, bottle feed the kittens every 1-2 hours with a commercial milk replacer formula. Do not give cow’s milk to the kittens because it is too hard for them to digest.
When the kittens are 3-4 weeks old, provide formula in a shallow dish as well as some kitten food that has been softened with water. Offer these foods 4-6 times per day.
When the kittens are 6-12 weeks old, decrease the amount of formula that you offer them and begin to give them dry kitten food. Offer these foods 4 times per day.

, To make sure that the kittens are getting proper nutrition and putting on weight, you will need to weigh the kittens once per week and keep a record of their weights. Kittens should gain about 1 ¾ to 3 ½ ounces per week. Talk your veterinarian if you are concerned that the kittens are not gaining weigh fast enough., Mother cats may reject their kittens or get upset if they are handled too much, so it is in their best interest to leave them alone if she is still around. However, from the age of 2-7 weeks it is important to get kittens used to being held by humans., Be very careful when handling a newborn kitten. If you have children who will be handling your kittens, teach them how to be gentle and never allow them to hold the kittens unless they are being supervised. Newborn kittens are fragile and even a small child could cause serious harm to a kitten., If the kittens do not already have a place to sleep, make sure that you provide someplace for them that is warm, dry, and away from potential predators. Make sure that the place you choose for the kittens is out of the elements and away from drafts. You can use a box or a cat carrier that is lined with clean towels or blankets., If the mother cat is not around, you will need to provide a heating pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to help keep the kittens warm. Just make sure that the kittens can get away from the heat if they become too warm. Check on them often to see if they seem comfortable., If the mother cat is still around to help her cats use the bathroom, let her do her job. During the first few weeks of their lives, mother cats will lick their babies’ genital regions to help them urinate and defecate. Do not interfere when the mother cat is helping her babies like this., If the mother cat is not around, you will need to help the kittens to urinate and defecate during their first few weeks of life. Use a wet washcloth or a piece of damp gauze to gently rub each kitten’s genital region until it urinates and/or defecates. Wash or discard the cloth immediately and dry the kitten off before putting him back in with his litter mates., At about four weeks, the kittens will be ready to start using the litter box. To encourage litter box use, place a kitten in the litter box after it has finished eating. When the kitten has finished using the box, put it back in with its litter mates and then put the next one in the box. Allow each kitten a few minutes to use the box after each meal., If you notice that any of the kittens are not urinating or defecating when receiving help or when put into the litter box, then you should contact a veterinarian right away to find out what is going on. The kitten might be constipated or have a blockage that will need to be removed."

Know the time frame.",How to Tell If Your Cat Is in Heat," Another term for being in heat is ""calling."" This is because the female becomes very vocal and will frequently walk around the house wailing or otherwise vocalizing.This can sound like a plaintive, distressed cry, and can be loud and persistent enough to keep you awake at night.


If your cat is naturally chatty all the time, vocalization is not necessarily a sign she is in heat.
When a cat is ""calling,"" her cries typically becomes much louder and more persistent, and occur alongside other behaviors noted below.;
, Restless behavior and an inability to settle are characteristic of a female cat in heat.This restlessness usually occurs at the same time as calling.

, A female cat in heat is often much more affectionate than she would typically be. If you cat is naturally stand-offish, this will usually change when she is in heat.While in heat, your cat may rub around your ankles in such a persistent way that she becomes a trip hazard when you're trying to walk.
This behavior will also manifest in the rubbing of her cheeks and chin (where her scent glands are located) against furniture, and especially entrance and exit points such as door frames.
When in heat, a cat's scent changes subtly, and she enjoys spreading this around to advertise to that she'd like a mate to come visiting., A typical sign of a cat ready to mate is the tail deflection reflex. This simply means that when you rub her lower back, especially over her pelvis and tail base, the female sticks her bottom in the air and moves her tail to one side.This reflex is her way of making it easier for a male cat to gain access to her vulva to mate.

, This is a behavior in which the cat flattens her front quarters to the ground while sticking her bottom in the air, and then crawling along the floor in this posture., Some female cats in heat will roll around on the ground and wail at the same time.Understandably, if you don't know this behavior is entirely normal, it can appear alarming, and is a common cause of a panicked phone call to the on-call vet. However, this is not a sign that your cat is in pain.

, When a cat is in heat, it is typical for her vulva to become swollen. This mild swelling is uncomfortable, and will likely lead your cat to spend a lot of time washing the area.This swelling is too slight for the casual observer to notice, so don't expect to see a physical difference., Even home-loving cats get adventurous when in heat. If a a male cat doesn't come calling, then she is likely to go wandering for a day or so to seek one out for herself.If your cat is not spayed and you don't want her to get pregnant, keep her indoors during her heat and lock the cat flap so that intruders can't get in.

, Female cats are polyestrous, which means they go into heat many times a year. This is in contrast to dogs, which experience a diestrus cycle, coming into heat only twice a year. While in heat, your cat's womb will become swollen as its blood-supply increases in anticipation of a pregnancy. You will not be able to observe this, however, as there are no external signs of this process., The breeding season of feral cats is between spring and late summer. This means kittens are born away from the harshest of the winter weather, when their chances of survival would be reduced.Artificial light can fool a pet cat into thinking it is not winter. As such, if your cat spends much time indoors, the changing of seasons will have little or no effect on her reproductive cycle.Expect a cat that lives indoors to come into heat all year around.

, The reproductive cycle of a female cat is, on average, 21 days. Of these three weeks, expect her to spend as many as seven days in heat."

A confident cat moves with eyes wide, back slightly arched, head forward, and tail upright. If you notice your cat walking in this way, she's likely in a good mood and now would be a good time to interact with her.When relaxed, a cat will stretch out on her side or back. Her ears will be up, whiskers held to the side, and her paws may flex in contentment. She is probably approachable at these times, but be careful with petting. Cats position themselves in a somewhat exposed way when relaxed and may interpret physical contact as an attempted attack.If your cat has puffed up her fur, arched her back, flattened her ears, and dilated her pupils while swishing her tail she is behaving aggressively. For whatever reason, she feels threatened and needs space. Do not attempt to interact with your cat until she calms down.When your cat is anxious, she will try to look small by hunching down and wrapping her tail around her. Her limbs will be poised to run if necessary with her pupils enlarged and her ears held sideways. You should not touch your cat if she is behaving like this; she is nervous and needs space.When a cat is defensive, her ears will be flat, her teeth might be displayed, and she will be rolled on one side displaying her paws and claws. A cat is likely to lash out when engaging in this behavior and you need to give her space to cool down. She is likely to scratch you if she's behaving aggressively.;
, Cats communicate with people through eye contact. Unfortunately, many people do not realize this and often mistakenly intimidate cats through staring. Know how to show your cat your intentions are friendly.


A common complaint about cats is that they're drawn to those who dislike them. People who dislike cats tend to ignore them. Since cats hate direct stares (as it is a display of a threat), the cat feels less threatened and will approach to exploreLie down near your cat when she is relaxing. Look at her until she looks back and, when she does, slowly close your eyes and then open them a few times. Wait for your cat to do the same.If your cat turns away, this is a good sign. It means she does not see you as threat and feels no need to intimidate you. If she does not turn away, break the gaze so she does not think you're trying to challenge her. It may take several attempts at a slow blink before your cat is comfortable enough to look away after eye contact., Unlike dogs, cats are not very dependent on humans. While a relationship with an owner may be an important aspect of your cat's life, it is not as intense as it might be with a dog.Cats vary in the amount of socialization they need. To bond with your cat, you need to understand her personality.


Some cats are very affectionate and will want to be near their owner often. Other cats, however, may spend hours a day in a hiding spot. Do not push your cat to interact with you if she does not want to. Cats are very independent and their personalities are not subject to change.
Similarly, desired physical activity varies between cats. Some cats love to play and crave activity often while others show disinterest in toys. Once again, don't push it. While certain behaviors, like scratching and biting, can be trained out of a cat the fundamentals of a cat's personality remain fairly consistent over time. However, you should push your cat to get 5 to 10 minutes of exercise a day to maintain a healthy weight.

, You should never immediately pet a cat without an invitation. Cats do not respond well to this and may interpret it as an affront to their personal space.Cats needs to take the lead when it comes to social interaction.


Allow your cat to invite you in. When she's ready to interact with you, she'll let you know by displaying certain behaviors. She may rub up against you or rub her cheek on you with her tail held upright. Cats have scent glands in their cheeks and sides, and rubbing these areas against you means they're scent marking. This is a sign of affection and camaraderie and means your cat is ready to interact with you. If your cat approaches you, hold out your hand to see if she's interested in contact. Allow her to sniff your hand before you attempt to touch her.
Do not push it. If you simply sit in the same room with a cat long enough, she'll come to you when she's ready. Premature contact may cause her stress and result in a major setback of your bonding with her., Once your cat is open to being petted, you need to make sure she's relaxed and happy. Cats will convey comfort or discomfort through body language. Make sure you understand what your cat is trying to communicate.


Cats, unlike dogs, do not twitch or wag their tails when happy. If your cat wags her tail when being petted, you're doing something wrong. You should pet her in a different area or change the direction or pressure of the petting.Cats convey pleasure and trust in a variety of ways. Your cat may knead her claws in and out of a soft object or even your clothing. Cats sometimes lick and gently nip to show affection. She may bump her head against you or scent mark with her cheeks and side., Sometimes, your cat may roll over onto her belly. While some cats might enjoy or at least tolerate being touched on the stomach, most cats do not like humans to have contact with their underbelly. If you're interacting with a cat you do not know well, it's best to err on the side of caution.


Cats expose their stomachs for a variety of reasons. When in a face-off with another cat, exposing of the belly is a threat. Your cat is poising her back claws for defense, signifying her intention to attack.However, a cat may also display her belly to convey trust. A cat's stomach is delicate as many valuable organs are located in the stomach. Showing the stomach communicates your cat trusts you and feels safe enough in her environment to expose a vulnerable area. This is not, however, an invitation for contact.Many cats go on the defense when their stomach is touched, and may instinctively claw and attack. It's best to avoid touching the area, especially when dealing with a cat you don't know very well., Many cats enjoy the feel of being brushed, as it's similar to being petted and creates feelings safety and comfort. Brushing is also healthy as it helps a cat's coat stay free of debris and skin flakes while encouraging blood circulation.With a short hair cat, use a metal comb. Move from head to tail in the direction of the cat's fur. Concentrate on one section at a time and brush the whole body, including her chest and abdomen.For a long haired cat, you might need to groom more often as fur can become tangled. You should start with the abdomen and brush upwards towards your cat's neck. When you brush the tail and back, make a part and brush out the fur on either side. If there are any knots, there are cat-safe de-tanglers and powders you can buy at a pet store.When grooming, it's not a bad idea to check your cat's skin. Watch for bumps, bruises, or scratches, especially if you have an outdoor cat. Look for fleas and ticks. You can sometimes see evidence of fleas, if not the fleas themselves, by the small bloody scabs fleas leave behind., Playing with your cat is another great way to bond. Your cat will learn to associate you with positive moments as is more likely to be affectionate and friendly towards you.


Bird games are games that involve dangling a feathered toy in the air and allowing your cat to chase and jump at the toy. This simulates hunting instincts from the wild and is a great way to exercise and entertain your cat.Some toys are laced with catnip, an herb that simulates excitement in a cat. Catnip laced mice, rabbits, and balls are a good investment if you have a cat who's disinterested in playing.Early morning and late at night are the best time to play. These are the times of day when a cat has the most energy and playing with your cat at night could encourage her to sleep. You might not have time to play during these hours, but you can always buy your cat small toys she can play with on her own.5 to 10 minutes of daily play is recommended to keep your cat healthy and at a good weight., Cats are trainable with time and patience. They are not as motivated by praise as dogs and do not seek to please owners as readily, but can be trained with some time and patience. Teaching a cat tricks is a great way to strengthen your bond.


Use treats, but only treats your cat likes. There are many different types of cat treats and cats can be somewhat picky about food. You might have to experiment with different brands before you find a treat your cat is willing to work for. Buy a variety of cat treats as a supermarket or pet store and see which kind your cat prefers.Start by looking for specific behaviors you want your cat to perform on command. When you see your cat performing these behaviors, state the name of the trick, praise the cat, and follow up with a treat. For example, say you love it when your cat stands up on her hind legs and would like her to do this in response to the command ""Beg."" When you see your cat standing up, say ""Beg,"" praise the cat, and give her a treat. Eventually, she'll make the connection between the command and the behavior.Once the cat starts performing the behavior on command, practice. You want to solidify the connection between the command and the trick. Only attempt to teach one command at a time and limit practice sessions to 10 to 15 minutes.Use a clicker, a small device that makes a clicking noise when a button is pressed. Use this while using treats to reinforce the behavior. Eventually, you can cut down on treats. You want your cat to learn to perform without the constant expectation of food as a reward.Once one command is mastered, move onto another. You can teach your cat to sit, lie down, stay, speak, and even more complex command. Some cats, for example, can be taught how to walk on a leash. Get creative., Cats are more likely to bond with you if they feel comfortable. Make sure you provide your cat with a warm, loving home so she'll feel safe and secure.


If you have an extra room, make it the cat room. Put her toys, litter box, food, water, and bed in this room and allow her to come in and out as she pleases. If you cannot dedicate a single room to your cat, at least make sure a certain section of your home, such as a corner or closet, is a cat friendly area.Cats enjoy having places to hide. This doesn't necessarily mean they're frightened. They might just want some alone time. You can buy them a kitty condo or make your own condo using cardboard boxes and duct tape., Cats do not do well with change. If you have to make any adjustment to your living situation, do so gradually.


If you're having a new person move in with you, allow them to meet your cat a few times before making the move. Make sure your cat is comfortable with the new person and that they respect and understand the cat's boundaries.If you're moving in with someone else or changing locations, take the cat to visit the new home on a few occasions if possible.Introductions to new pets should be slow. Separate your cat from new pets initially, only allowing interaction through a door. After a week of door play, allow supervised face-to-face interaction. If there is any fighting, stay calm. Transitions can be difficult and it may take a few weeks before relationships stabilize."
"
Safety first.,
Start by visiting the cat.,
Stay calm.,
Make tentative moves toward the cat to see how it reacts.,
Feed the cat.,
Play with the cat.,
Bring a cat brush along.,
Eventually, you may decide to bring the cat home.",How to Bond with a Stray Cat," Don't compromise your own safety. This includes not going into any area that may be dangerous, such as a construction site, an abandoned mining area or a dilapidated building. Moreover, don't put yourself in a precarious position to try to reach the cat. Make sure you are on a solid surface that won't fall out from under you or cause you to slip or fall. Finally, do not attempt to touch a stray cat unless you are absolutely certain it won't attempt to bite or scratch you.


Bring hand sanitizer to clean your hands immediately after touching or carrying a stray cat.;
, Find where it hangs out. Use that place as a neutral meeting ground to allow the cat to become familiar with you. Over time, the cat will become comfortable the more you visit. At first, don't try to touch or crowd it in any way.

, When you first approach the stray cat, it may hide. Don't try to chase it out of its hiding place. Instead, just sit there and pretend not to pay attention to it. Do something else (bring a book to read or your favorite app to play with).


Wait a while. If the cat is still hiding, leave and come back the next day.
The cat may come over to you right away. If it does, look for signs of fleas or sickness.

, Once the cat is used to you and is willing to come closer, test how it feels about you. If you have determined that the cat is healthy, extend your hand without actually touching it. If the cat tries to scratch you, don't stroke or pet it. If it does not show aggression, then just let it sniff you. Once it seems okay with you, you can then consider stroking it. First let it get used to you, which includes letting it get used to your odor. This is important so don't push things too quickly.


If the cat starts to purr or rub itself against you, you've made a friend. Rubbing means it's transferring its scent to you and making you part of its family. So, don't worry––this won't do you any harm----in fact, you're making progress.
Allow plenty of getting-to-know-each-other time before petting the cat. It may take a few attempts before the cat will let you.
Be on your guard if the cat attempts to scratch you or lets out a yowl. It is giving you a serious warning. It may feel you're rushing it, so don't. In some cases, the cat may never stop trying to scratch, in which case, you probably won't be able to bond with it effectively. But can still care for the cat without direct handling.

, Bring dry or wet cat food and a water bowl. Come every day, preferably twice a day to feed it. Some cats love company when they eat; this may be a suitable time to stroke it, or to at least sit beside it while it is eating or drinking.


On the other hand, some cats are really bothered by being touched when they eat, so gauge the cat's reaction carefully.
Hand feed the cat some treats. This will increase bonding and the stray cat will enjoy it.

, Use basic cat toys, such as scrunched up pieces of paper, a stick with something dangling from the end, a long and large leaf or twig, etc.

, Cats love to be brushed although it can take time before a stray cat will trust you to do this. When it lets you, take it easy and brush gently and carefully.

, If you do, this should be done with care. Ideally, you should take the cat to a veterinary clinic first, especially if you own other cats or pets. The stray may be carrying an infection or disease that you haven't noticed.


Take along a suitable cat carrier. It must be strong, sturdy and safe for the cat. Borrow one if you don't already own one.
Book an appointment with the vet. Explain that you're bringing a stray in and that you intend to keep the stray after it has been checked, had its microchip read (if there is one) and vaccinated. The microchip (if present) will give you the opportunity to track down a previous owner.
Take the cat home. If the cat gets the all clear, take it home and begin its settling in time.

Feed him.,
Be around.,
Pet him while eating, try at his back with your fingertips, once he's used to it, try it on his head, then from his head down to his tail base, then try with your hand, until you can pet him with your eyes close.

,
Encourage him.,
Pet him.,
Familiarize him with grooming tools.,
Comfort him.,
Play with him.",How to Bond With a Feral Kitten," ""Hunger overcomes Curiosity"". A very familiar and popular quote for every wild animal. So try luring the little guy with some smelling food. Gerbers, Whiskas, Friskies, Fancy Feast or other strong smelling cat food will do. Or simply a piece of bread. Call the kitten with hissing sounds, meows, or purrs or whatever you want that can call it's attention. And place the food in front of you, for now, you may want to leave at a vantage point where you can see him but he can't see you. Repeat this for several days and weeks and he might then just eat it even if you're there. Or rather come to you even if you haven't given his food yet. Remember, cats are good time-keepers. They know when they should be fed, if you forget a feeding time, he'll think of you as someone who can't be trusted. And he won't show up for long.;
, When he's used to his ""eating time"" try the next step of being there, while he's eating. At first he might be skittish, double-thinking on eating, or running. But then again, ""Hunger overcomes Curiosity"" so he'll stop worrying about you and will start eating. After many times of successful feeding times. It's time for step 3.

,, You may have noticed that he's hanging out at your place or with you a lot even if it's not feeding time. Well, that's step 2 for gaining his trust and step 1 for bonding time. Now without food, pet him again, you should be able to pet him without fear or skittish movements. But if you're still unsure, try bringing along a bowl of cat food to distract him while you practice handling him.

, After a month or so of doing this, your feral kitten may have start to actually like you. The next step is to be able to pet his back-of-the-ear area (since cats tend to love that part), and at the base of his tail. Since that's the area where they ""mark"" you with their scent making you his territory.

, Successful petting leads to successful grooming. It may look a little too early to groom a feral kitten but a brush is all you need, try showing him a brush (he should be happy to play with you by now) at first he'll try to bite it, or bat at it, or even attack as if it were prey, thus, you need two brushes. One for batting, and one for grooming. While he's busy swatting at the other brush, you comb him with the other one, he'll just think you're petting him which will help strengthen your bond.

, During rains and scary moments when nature strikes, make sure you're there for him. Snuggle him and cuddle him every moment, animals are the most sensitive to danger. So he can feel things you can't.

, Play time is a must for every kitten. A piece of string, a shiny aluminum ball, a catnip filled bag or just an ordinary shoe box will keep your kitten busy for hours on end. But for an interactive game, a fishing rod tied with feathers, a string or a stick is best.

Identify when your cat will be fertile.,
Know what mating entails.,
Plan for second mating, if necessary.,
Make sure your cat doesn't mate with any other toms.",How to Breed Cats2," Cats will usually only be fertile during the spring and summer, though indoor cats who are exposed to a lot of artificial light may be fertile year round. Ovulation in cats is provoked by the act of mating, and if the cat doesn't ovulate, the cycle of fertile stages will probably repeat several times.Some cats won't demonstrate signs of this cycle in the presence of their owner, so pay attention to the tomcats in the neighborhood too - they will turn up when a female is in heat.The stages of the estrous cycle, excluding anestrus, which is when the cat isn't fertile in the winter are:


Proestrus - this stage may last one to two days, but may be as short as an hour, and isn’t seen in all cats. During this period, she may call to the tom, roll and rub on the ground, but won’t allow the tom near her.
Estrus - this stage usually lasts about a week, and is when the queen should be taken to the tom for mating. The primary sign of this period is her vocal call to the male with a specific type of yowl.This sound is generally a short-ish, plaintive, hollow sounding yowl that sounds almost like “aah-roo-ugh?” (though it can vary between breeds,so be sure to check with a breeder who is familiar with your breed) and will be accompanied by the cat doing all she can to get to any toms in the area. Interestrus - if the cat did not ovulate she will enter this period, which usually lasts about a week before estrous or estrus periods return. She will show no sign of reproductive activity during interestrus.

, The owner of the stud will usually take care of these arrangements, but knowing what to expect is a good idea. No reputable stud owner will hide any of his preparations from you, and you should check to make sure the owner knows what to do.


The tom needs a place to escape to just after mating takes place as the female often reacts viciously.
Be prepared to hear a bloodcurdling shriek from the female - this is normal.Immediately after mating, the female will probably frantically groom herself for about an hour, during which time she won’t allow anyone near her. After this, the estrous period will continue as it was before mating occurred until its natural end.
It is important to make sure a cat is bred more than once during an estrous period since she will not ovulate until after she has mated. Three breedings a day for the first three days of the estrous cycle should produce a 90% chance of the queen ovulating., If your cat does not become pregnant on her first visit to the stud, there are several possible timelines:


She didn't ovulate. If this is the case, she will become fertile again in about a week.
She ovulated, but didn't become pregnant - this period is called metestrus; it lasts 5-7 weeks, and during it she will not demonstrate any reproductive activity.She became pregnant, but the pregnancy was unsuccessful. If this is the case, she will become fertile again 2-3 weeks after losing the kittens. , When your female cat is in heat, she will call to any male within earshot, and desperately try to get outside to mate with any tom who responds to her call,but it isn’t a good idea to let her choose her own mate because then you won’t know anything about the kittens father, and any potential illness or genetic problem he may pass down to them. Even after the queen has been bred by your chosen stud, as long as the estrus cycle lasts, she will try to continue mating, and any of these matings could produce any of the kittens she produces."

Be prepared to take care of the kittens.,
Socialize the kittens.",How to Breed Cats3," There is no early diagnostic for feline pregnancies like there is for humans, so the earliest a pregnancy can be verified is at day 15 via an ultrasound. The following methods, when used by someone who is familiar with them, can be used to diagnose pregnancy in cats:


Abdominal palpitations from day 20 - these should only be undertaken by someone with a lot of experience because you can easily cause a miscarriage if you are too forceful, and there are other parts of her abdomen that may feel lumpy. At this stage, the kittens feel like evenly spaced swellings about the size of un-shelled peanuts. Between day 35 and 49, it's not possible to feel the fetuses due to the sacs of fluid they are contained in.
Ultra-sound - though the presence of kittens can be seen after 15 days, heartbeats appear at day 20.
A test for the hormone relaxin can detect pregnancy in cats after about 25-30 days.Morning sickness during the 3rd or 4th week of pregnancy - this doesn't occur for all cats, and includes apathy, vomiting and bring less interested in food, but only lasts for a day or two, and can easily be missed.
X-ray - past day 43 an x-ray will show the bone-structure of the kittens, and is better than ultrasound at counting the number of kittens.
External signs - by day 35 the nipples will begin to be pink and obvious, and the cat will noticeably increase in size. In the last two weeks, a pear-shaped abdomen will be noticeable. Shortly before giving birth, the cat will develop more noticeable breasts, and a milky fluid may be excreted from the nipples., The normal gestation period for cats is 63-69 days,so if you bred your cat intentionally, it should be easy to calculate her due-date to within a few days. If not, here are some other options for guessing when she will give birth.


A check-up with your veterinarian can provide a very accurate due-date. Your vet will probably use one of the diagnostic methods in determining whether a cat is pregnant to guess how far into her pregnancy she is.
Signs that queening is imminent include vomiting, crying, seeking out a place to have her kittens, and grooming.Remember when you last heard her giving the mating call discussed above (this sound is generally a short-ish, plaintive, hollow sounding yowl that sounds almost like “aah-roo-ugh?”) - this was a sign of the last time she was fertile, and the pregnancy probably began during that week.
Watch the tomcats in the neighborhood - the week they stopped being regularly found around your house is probably when she became pregnant

, You should make an appointment with your vet 2-3 weeks after mating, or as soon as you suspect she is pregnant if it may be more than a month into her pregnancy. At this point, you should get some recommendations for keeping your cat healthy during her pregnancy.


If the pregnancy appears to be normal, then one more visit about a week before the kittens are expected is all that's necessary. The vet will check to make sure that the kittens are healthy, and go over what you should do when they are born. , Cats generally prefer to be left mostly alone when giving birth, but your pet will probably be reassured to know that you are in the vicinity. Some things she will be looking for in a nesting spot are:


Easy access to food, water, and a litter box (but don't put the litter box too close as you don't want to invite an infection!)
It should be in a quiet, dark corner of the house with little traffic.
A box lined with cozy blankets is generally a good idea.
It should be somewhere that the kittens won't accidentally stumble out of - newborn kittens are blind and deaf, and the mother will want to keep them enclosed in a small space until they are old enough to jump out of it.
Remember, if she chooses a spot other than the one you have prepared for her, accept it - moving her will stress her out and may cause her to delay the birth.

, If any of the following occur, take your cat to the veterinarian immediately.


Any yellow-green or bright green discharge
Any bloody discharge
Each kitten born should be followed by a placenta, if the placenta does not emerge, take the cat to a vet to have it removed - do NOT attempt this yourself, it can kill the cat if done incorrectly. If you come upon your cat after she has already had one or two kittens, don't be alarmed if a placenta or two is missing, mother cats eat the placenta to regain the nutrients they contain.
No kittens have been produced 3-4 hours into labor
The queen is distressed, crying, or licking her vulva without producing any kittens., As each kitten is born, the mother should lick it to remove the embryonic sac. This will stimulate the kitten to breathe and move. If the mother doesn't do this, you will need to use sterile hands and a clean towel to remove the embryonic sac and wipe the kittens face clean. If the mother continues to show no interest in the kitten and it begins to shiver, dry it with a clean towel vigorously enough to make it meow (this is still very gently!), this should get the mothers attention.

, Newborn kittens need to eat every few hours. If the litter is especially large, often the smaller, weaker kittens (runts) will be excluded from nursing. Sometimes, there can be a problem with the milk supply as well. Notice if the kittens don't seem to be getting any milk. Consult a vet if the mother doesn't appear to be lactating, they can sometimes stimulate the milk supply, but make sure the kittens get milk as often as they need it. There are two options for replacing a mothers milk supply:


Acquire a surrogate mother - this means a cat who has kittens of the same age but has a very small litter. Cats are generally happy to accept surrogate kittens, provided they have a small enough litter of their own, and the surrogates are of a similar age to their own litter.
Hand feed the runts. To do this you will need milk formula specifically for kittens and a bottle with a teat designed for kittens. If you're having difficulty finding these, contact your vet for assistance. Make sure to follow the instructions on the milk substitute to make it the correct temperature and consistency.

Refer to the section in this article on reading your cat's body language to learn how to determine your cat's mood.


If your cat keeps running away from you, consider leaving behind a small treat in a place she can find. This will let her know that you are sorry and still care about her.
A frightened cat should be approached with care. Always give a frightened cat room to escape. She may actually need comfort and reassurance, especially if there was a loud, sudden sound. At the same time, however, she may want to be alone, which is why leaving an escape route is so important. A frightened, cornered cat may quickly turn aggressive.;
, What did you do to make your cat so mad at you? Did you make fun of her? Step on her tail? Or did you take her spot on the couch? Knowing what you did wrong will help you decide how to approach your cat. It will also help you decide how to go about apologizing to him or her. Here are some examples of what you might have done to offend your cat and what you could do to show you're sorry:


If you offended your cat by making fun of her, you will probably have to offer some treats and praise.
If you accidentally stepped on your cat's tail or startled her by dropping a pot, a simple cuddle may be all that is needed.
If you took your cat's favorite spot on the couch, consider vacating the spot and giving your cat a treat.

, If your cat runs away from you, she may be still be angry, upset, or frightened. Do not chase after your cat. Instead, try again a few minutes later. This will reassure your cat that you won't do anything to further harm or annoy her. Having a cat treat ready may also reassure your cat.

, Tell her ""I'm sorry."" You may even use your cat's name. Make sure that you are using a soft, calm voice, with a slightly higher pitch than usual.Your cat may not necessarily understand your words, but she will understand your tone. Do not use a loud, shrill voice; cats do have sensitive hearing and you will only annoy your cat.


Consider blinking slowly. A trusting cat will blink slowly. You can show your cat that you trust her by blinking slowly., Make sure that you take note of your cat's mood; if your cat appears angry or upset, then do not pet her. Refer to the section in this article on reading your cat's body language to learn how to best determine your cat's mood. If you don't know where your cat likes to be petted, here are some suggestions:Scratch your cat behind the ear. An even better place would be to gently stroke the area between your cat's eye and ear. Use the tip of your finger and slowly smooth over the fine hairs there.
Scratch your cat under the cheek and against the cheek. She may even forgive you for your offense and start rubbing against your hand.
Scratch your cat at the base of her tail. Place your fingers on the base of your cat's tail, where the tail and back meet, and wriggle your fingers, gently stretching with your finger tips.
Stroke your cat's head, back, and chest. Keep in mind, however, that not all cats enjoy being petted in these areas. Watch your cat's body language carefully for any signs of annoyance.

, Your cat could be upset with you because you have not been spending enough time with him. If your cat is more energetic, you could consider playing with him—although most cats would enjoy swatting at a piece of string. Here are some ways you can play with your cat:


Toss a piece of crumpled up cellophane or paper towards your cat. You can also use a toy mouse instead. Do not throw the toy at him, however. Instead, aim for a spot just before his paws.
Dangle a piece of string in front of your cat. Jiggle it an move it slowly back and forth, towards and away from your cat. You can even try running the string across his paws.
Purchase a laser pointer and point the laser on a spot on the wall or the floor. Once your cat is paying attention to the red dot, move the laser around. He may even try running after the laser.
Play with your cat using a cat teaser. A cat teaser is a long, flexible stick with some feathers or string attached to one end. Some teasers also have a bell. Hold the teaser by one end and wave the decorated end near your cat's paws. Gently flick it upward—he may try to jump up to catch it.

, If you have been ignoring your cat lately, you may notice that your cat has become less affectionate than usual. This means that your cat could be upset and lonely. You can apologize to your cat by spending time with him. This could be as simple as reading a book or listening to music next to your cat, or giving him a nice, long petting session. It could also mean that you have to set aside some time to play with your cat.

, If you made fun of or laughed at your cat, you may have offended her. Offer your cat a cat treat and tell your cat how wonderful and beautiful she is. Use a soft, gentle tone. Your cat may not necessarily understand your words, but she will know that you are talking to her and saying nice things to her.

, Cats can get upset if they don't get what they want. Sometimes, what they want is simple and harmless—such as sitting on that fluffy pillow. Other times, what they want could be harmful, such as a portion of your dinner. Some human foods can be very bad for your cat's health. If what the cat wanted was harmless, you could relent and let your cat have it. If what your cat wanted could be dangerous, then offer your cat something else instead.


If your cat wanted to sit on that fluffy pillow of the couch, let him do it. You could even pick your cat up and set it down on that spot. Give your cat a reassuring stroke or two.
If your cat really wanted that milk or tuna, you should give something else instead. Milk or cream can upset a cat's stomach, and tuna can be dangerous in large amounts due to its high levels of mercury.Consider giving your cat a yummy cat treat instead.

, Put three to five cat treats in your hand and kneel down close to the cat. If the cat is ready to forgive you, he will come over to you and eat the treats. At this time, you may try to pet your cat behind the ear (or any other favorite spot). If your cat does not approach you, leave the treats on the floor and step away. Do not take the treats away—this will only disappoint your cat.


Cat treats come in many different textures, including: soft and chewy, hard and crunchy, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, dried meats (sort of like jerky), and freeze-dried. You can even find dried tuna flakes in the cat treat aisle of a pet store.
Cat treats also come in many different flavors, including chicken, turkey, tuna, and salmon. You can even find catnip-flavored treats.
Consider getting a beneficial treat. There are also cat treats that help prevent hairballs and tarter. Not only will you be keeping your cat happy, but you will also be keeping him or her healthy., Be sure to leave it in a place you know where he will be able to find it. Here are some examples:


If your cat is hiding under the bed, consider leaving the cat treat just under the bed. Do not leave the treat too far out from under the bed. This will force the cat to craw out from her or her ""safe"" spot, and will make him or her feel anxious. Do not reach too far under the bed, or the cat may scratch you.
If your cat is really agitated, leave a treat near his food, or in his favorite spot. In fact, if you offended your cat by taking his favorite spot on the couch, you can leave the cat treat in that spot. This will let the cat know that you are sorry and that he can sit in this spot without being kicked off.

, Take three to five cat treats and place them on top of your cat's food during feeding time. If your cat is picky and does not like treats mixed in with his food, then leave the treats in a dish next to the food.

, Does your cat have a favorite flavor of cat food? If you feed your cat different flavors, choose his favorite one, and serve it during feeding time.

, If your cat is too agitated, you may be able to get her to calm down with a sprinkle of cat nip on the floor. If you do not like cleaning up messes (some cats will eat the dried catnip while others will just roll around in it), then you can give him or her a catnip toy.

, If your cat is interested in cat toys, you can buy a new toy and give it to her. Simply approach your cat, kneel down, hold the toy out so she can see it. You may leave the toy on the ground and back away, or you can toss the toy. This depends on how your cat likes to play with toys. Keep in mind that not every cat likes to play, especially older ones.


You can make your own catnip toy by cutting a small square from fabric and putting a spoonful of dried catnip in the center. Pull the sides of the fabric upwards, bundling the catnip up inside, and secure it with a piece of string.
You can also make another catnip toy by stuffing a sock with some cotton or polyester stuffing and adding a spoonful of dried catnip. Tie the sock off with some string.

, It will tell you what sort of mood your cat is in. If your cat is too angry or upset, your apology will mean nothing to him or her and will most likely result in you getting slapped across the face. This section will show you how to read your cat's body language, so that you will know when it is safe to approach her.

, The tail is the most expressive part of a cat's body, and is a good indicator of your cat's mood. Unlike dogs, cats do not ""Wag"" their tails when they are happy. Here are some more guidelines:If the tail is pointing up, with the tip slightly curled to the side, your cat is content and safe to approach.
If the tail is poofed up, your cat is frightened. You may try to approach your cat to calm him down, but do so slowly, and make sure that your cat can run and hide from you. A cornered cat may quickly turn into an aggressive cat.
If your cat is twitching or thumping his tail, then do not approach your cat. He is angry, and probably at you. Give your cat some time before apologizing.

, A cat's ears are very expressive, and will also help you determine how she is feeling. In general, if the ears are up, the cat is happy, and if the ears are down, the cat is not happy. Here are some more detailed guidelines:Are the ears up and in a normal, relaxed position? If so, you can go ahead and try to apologize to your cat.
If the ears are turned back, do not approach your cat. She is deeply offended and angry. Give her some time.she might be feeling scared. You can still approach your cat, but do it slowly and carefully.
If your cats ears are pressed back flat against the skull, she might be feeling scared. You can still approach your cat, but do it slowly and carefully.

, A cat's eyes respond dramatically to changes in light, but they also change according to mood. When looking at your cat's eyes, you will also have to take the lighting into account as well as the rest of the cat's body language. Here are some guidelines:If a cat's pupil is very large, he may be afraid. It could also mean that it is just dark in the room.
If a cat's pupils are narrow, he may be angry and agitated. It could also mean that the lighting is very bright.

, Are the whiskers pointing forward, teeth bared, and nose wrinkled? If so, your cat is still too angry to feel like being approached by an apologetic human. Try again later.

, Is the fur standing on end? If so, your cat may be frightened or agitated. Is your cat's fur flat against him or her? This means that your cat may be more relaxed; look at your cat's body for other clues to his or her mood, however., If the claws are extended or tensed, use extreme caution. Cats are fast, and your cat may be preparing to strike.

A cat slowly blinking his/her eyes may be showing affection, indicating the cat is comfortable with whoever might be around him/her.

, Since cats are more ""fluent"" than humans in body language, certain gestures will accompany vocalizations to reinforce their message.

Deliver commands to your cat.",How to Communicate with Your Cat2," Cats are always learning how to communicate with us. The more that you communicate with your cat, the faster he or she will learn.Use a slightly raised tone of voice to indicate friendliness and a lowered tone of voice to indicate displeasure or aggression.Using repetition will help your cat learn to anticipate consistent activities. You may want to repeat a word such as sleep or bed each time you go to bed. Eventually, your cat will begin to associate the repetitive word sound with your actions and may even get to the bedroom before you.

, Cats can be trained to understand words, but they will instinctively understand nonverbal cues. Creating a warm environment with clear expectations and few surprises can help strengthen your initial bond with a new cat.


If you blink slowly when making eye contact with your cat, she will usually respond by coming over to be stroked. This is seen as a very non-threatening gesture.
Try not to stare directly into a cat’s eyes. It tells her that you're unfriendly or aggressive.If your cat wants to go somewhere such as next to you on the couch, but he seems unsure, pat the space and use a soft, reassuring voice to invite him to join you.
Be consistent in your intent and expression. A common blunder many pet owners make is to say ""no"" but pet the cat at the same time. This is very confusing to the cat. So for example, if you want your cat to go away, a firm ""later"" and a gentle push, without showing affection, will let the cat know that her presence is not desired at this time. Most cats will try two to three times to invade a person's space, often from different directions. When saying ""Later"", be patient.
Never yell at or physically discipline a cat. This only frightens and angers the cat, and is counterproductive. Instead, to show displeasure, you can add a hard edge to your voice. The cat will pick up on that and sense unhappiness., Being consistent with the wording, tone, and other accompanying signals while giving your cat training commands will help both of you agree on and understand clear expectations.Develop a commanding tone to use with your cat when he or she is doing something that you consider to be wrong. Use a voice that comes naturally to you and can be replicated easily, but that is also distinct from your everyday talking voice. If you use this voice sparingly but seriously, your cat will learn to associate the voice with the idea that she is displeasing you.
Make a quick and sharp hiss or spit sound as a ""no"" command. This is similar to the sound made as a correction or warning in “cat language” and using it can communicate your intent more clearly to your cat.
With patience, cats can be trained to respond to commands, much the same as dogs. You can even teach your cat to shake your hand.

Understand how and why cats communicate.,
Observe meowing circumstances.,
Identify common non-meowing cat communication.,
Notice other specialized vocalizations.",How to Communicate with Your Cat3," Vocalizing is generally not your cat's preferred mode of communication. A cat's ""first language"" consists of a complex system of scent, facial expression, complex body language, and touch. Cats soon realize that we don't understand the non-verbal signals they send to each other, so they vocalize in an attempt to communicate in our language. By observing which sounds elicit which actions from us, a cat is always learning how to make requests or demands.

, If you watch what your cat is doing when he or she meows, you may be able to distinguish which meows are associated with which requests (or protests). While specific meows can vary from cat to cat, there are certain types of meows that are usually associated with specific cat emotions, such as purring or hissing.


The short meow is used as a standard greeting and general acknowledgment.
Multiple meows indicate excited greetings. You may notice a more enthusiastic greeting with increased meowing if you have been gone for a longer period of time than usual.
A mid-pitched meow may indicate a plea for something like food or water.
A longer, drawn-out ""mrrroooow"" is a more persistent demand for a need or want.
A low-pitched ""MRRRooooowww"" indicates a complaint, displeasure, or preparation to fight.
A loud, lower than mid-pitch ""Meow"" often signals more urgent begging for something such as food.

, While meowing is the sound that we most often associate with cat vocalization, cats make other common sounds as well.Purring, a throaty vibrating sound, invites close contact or attention. While cats can purr for a variety of reasons, purring is most commonly associated with easy contentment.
Hissing is a cat’s clearest sign of aggression or self-defense. It indicates that your cat is very unhappy, feels threatened or frightened, or is fighting or preparing to fight.

, While other types of vocalizations may be rarer than meowing, hissing, and purring, understanding them can help you interpret your cat’s communications more fully.A high-pitch RRRROWW! often indicates anger, pain, or feeling fearful.
A chattering sound can be a sign of excitement, anxiety, or frustration.
A chirrup, a cross between a meow and a purr with rising inflection, is a friendly greeting sound, often used by a mother cat to call to her kittens
A loud yelping or “reeeowwwing” sound may indicate sudden pain, as when you accidentally step on your cat’s tail.

Provide a warm, cozy place to sleep.,
Give access to quiet spaces.,
Remove dangers in the cat's space.,
Provide ramps and steps for accessibility.,
Give access to views of the outdoors.,
Provide easy access to food.,
Put food in elevated cat dishes.,
Give unlimited access to water.,
Give your cat a calm place to eat.,
Put the litter box in an easily accessible location.,
Consider putting multiple litter boxes in your home.,
Use a litter box with low sides.",How to Catify Your Home for a Senior Cat," As your cat ages, it may be more inclined to spend its time napping in a warm spot. Place your cat's bed in a location that gets lots of warm sun or is near a heating vent. In a great spot, your cat can spend it days cozy and contented.If you want to make your cat extra cozy and warm, consider getting it a heated cat bed, which plugs in and provides gentle warming.;
, If you have a multi-cat household or a home that is generally loud and active, you may need to provide an older cat with a space to escape the noise. Give your cat access to a quiet bedroom or a warm, sunny corner away from the noise.Make sure to let all family members know that the cat should be left alone when it goes to its quiet area.
Keep other pets out of this quiet area so that the senior cat can get some rest and relaxation.

, If your cat is losing its sight or is generally losing its function, you may need to adjust what objects are in its space. For example, if your cat has gone blind, you need to remove clutter that is in the cat's usual paths so that it doesn't bump into things. You don't want a cat that is blind having to navigate around random objects you leave lying around.Keep your furniture in the same locations, if possible. This will allow a cat who is losing sight to find its way around your home based on memory.
If you cannot remove all dangers, you may need to find a way to keep older cats out of dangerous areas. This can often be done with baby gates, as older cats are less likely to expend the energy to jump over them.

, If your cat has mobility problems, anywhere from minor arthritis to an inability to move around without a wheelchair or cart, it may benefit from some accessibility ramps or steps. This could include adding steps up to your bed, so that your cat can sleep where it has always slept. It could also include adding ramps in your home so that a cat in a cart can move around its home.Not all accessibility solutions mean adding stairs and ramps to your home. You can simply rearrange furniture to make it easier for your cat to get to a high spot. Putting a bench at the end of your bed, for instance, may make it so your cat can jump up onto that and then up further onto your bed.

, As your cat ages it will be less able to be physically active but it will still need to have its mind stimulated. With this in mind, give it easy access to a place where it can watch the world outside. Giving a senior cat a spot where it can view the goings on in the neighborhood will be give it a fun activity that is stimulating to its mind.Giving your cat a spot where it can watch the world may require that you install cat perches or some other way for the cat to get up to a window. It could simply mean that you put a piece of furniture next to a window so that the cat can sit on it and look outside.
This is especially important for cats that can't or don't want to go outside. It is common for very old cats to avoid going outside as much as they might have previously.

, As your cat ages it will be less able to climb up to food dishes on high points, such as kitchen counters. If you have traditionally fed your cat on a high surface, move its food down to the floor. Giving your cat easy access to its food will help assure that it eats enough food to stay healthy and happy.This is especially important for cats that have mobility issues, such as cats with arthritis or other age-related movement problems.

, While you shouldn't put your cat's food dishes on a high counter, it is a good idea to raise them off the floor. Putting your cat's food in an elevated dish, which lifts the food a few inches off the floor, will make it easier for your cat to eat its food.Elevated cat dishes allow your cat to be in a more neutral position when eating than bowls on the floor do. Basically, they make it so your cat doesn't have to bend over.

, As your cat ages, it is more likely to suffer from dehydration. Because of this, be sure to provide unlimited access to water. Also consider providing water dishes in multiple locations in your home, so that your senior cat can easily have a drink of water whenever it wants one.Transitioning your cat from a dry kibble diet to a wet, canned food diet can also help your cat get more water.
Consider providing a cat drinking fountain for a cat that is hesitant to drink water. These fountains recycle water in a stream, which can lure cats that are interested in running water into drinking., Some older cats have a hard time getting enough to eat if they are forced to eat in an area that is loud, noisy, or filled with other pets. Consider giving your older cat a quiet place to eat where it can be all alone and focus on its meal.This could be as simple as letting the older cat eat in the kitchen alone before you let other pets in to eat.
You could also give your senior cat its own special space, such as a landing or kitchen pantry floor, where only it is allowed.

, It is important to give your cat easy access to its litter box so that it is able to get to it without a lot of effort or discomfort. Placing the litter box in an area close to where the cat spends most of its time is important. Also, a cat with mobility issues should not have to climb up and down stairs to get to its litter box. This means that litter boxes in basements or other out of the way places may need to be placed somewhere closer to the cat's area.Putting a litter box in a central location in your home can be a drag but it is better to have a litter box there than to have accidents in the house.
Having a litter box in a central location in your home will also make you more likely to clean it regularly, as you will see it often and you will have to deal with the smell and sight of a dirty litter box.

, As a cat ages it will have less ability to wait to go to the bathroom when it has the urge. If you provide it with multiple litter boxes, your senior cat is more likely to make it to one and to not have an accident in the house.Providing multiple litter boxes is most important in homes that are large in size. If your cat never has to go far to get to its litter box, for instance if you live in a small apartment, multiple boxes is not necessary.

, As your cat loses mobility, it will be harder of it to get in and out of a litter box. Consider providing a litter box with low sides or a low entrance area. This will help assure that it uses the litter box when it needs to and that it doesn't choose somewhere else in the house to go to the bathroom.A litter box with low sides can be messier than a litter box with high sides. Try putting the litter box with low sides on a large mat that will hold stray litter in place and that can be easily shaken out or vacuumed regularly.
If you can’t find a litter box with low sides, try making your own using a plastic storage container. Cut out a low opening in one side of the container with a utility knife, then fill with litter and you are ready to go!"

Be sure your cat's fur is healthy and stays that way.,
Help them take care of their teeth.,
Be sure that their ears are clean.. Good routine ear care is very safe for you to do at home.,
Watch for behaviour changes.,
Be sure that they are using the litter box properly.",How to Keep Your Mature Cat Healthy," The quality of your cat’s coat will depend on her diet. As your cat gets older the quality of her digestive system becomes less efficient and the nutrients are not absorbed so easily. When hair coat becomes ragged and thin it’s a sign that your cat is unwell and needs to see the vet. She’ll be tested for hyperthyroidism which is the most common hormone abnormality in cats, and sometimes only responds to a prescription diet.


Older cats can also put on a lot of weight as they start to be less active, so it’s important to give a high quality diet with protein that is easy to digest alongside a balance of key nutrients
;
, Dental disease is also common in older cats and can cause distress as well as hinder eating. Diets today lead to tartar and the formation of plaque, and can cause lesions and cavities to form. Take your cat to the vets regularly to have their teeth inspected. A general anaesthetic will allow the vet to do a full examination and take x-rays. Treatment will take the form of antibiotics or surgery.

, Make cleaning the ears a part of your routine and keep the restraint as minimal as possible. Hold the tip of the ear between your thumb and forefinger and gently roll it so that you can see the inner part of the ear.


Examine the ear for redness or any discharge, and gently wipe with a cat ear cleansing pad. If the ear is sore you should visit the vet as this could be an indication of ear mites, a bacterial or yeast infection, or an allergy.

, Loss of memory and senility issues are often very apparent as your cat reaches old age. She’ll be prone to wandering and excessive meowing, all pointing to signs of dementia. Every cat has a certain level of communication. Some are quiet and purring, whilst others constantly meow. The change with senior dementia is the increased and the excessive vocalizations. She may be totally confused and unsure of her surroundings and this behaviour is more common at night. If howling becomes a problem, you should ask your vet about medication.

, Again this is a common problem and can be due to a behavioural or a health issue. When urinating starts happening indoors it can become quite a problem. This could be due to irritation of the bladder, kidney failure or diabetes. Aged cats also develop arthritis and neurological issues that all need a vet’s advice. Most diseases can be managed successfully when detected early.

Provide plenty of fresh water and make sure there is easy access to it.,
Assess your cat's needs in the following areas at least once a week:

Movement - is your cat slowing down noticeably?",How to Care for an Older Cat,"







30 centimeter (11.8 in)(1 ft) above the floor space for cats. Clean the area of the height of the back of a cat.

Try to maintain a stable home environment. Older cats don't handle ""change"" well. Change will stress the older cat, and stress can lead to health problems.;
, Does it avoid jumping up onto or down off of laps? - Ask your vet about Glucosamine and/or shark cartilage. Aspirin ""can"" be given, but the dosage must be regulated carefully by your vet.
Feeding - As cats age, they can lose their sense of smell. Unfortunately, the foods that smell good to them are not always the most nutritionally balanced ones... and kitty can become malnourished even if they are eating a good volume. Watch for ""pickiness"" in food as your first inkling that all is not well in this area. Feed your cat feline vitamin supplements, but cut back the volume of food if your kitty is overweight. Think ""high nutritional value, low fat value"" when choosing their food.
Kitty's claws. You can clip kitty's nails or file them down with an emery board to prevent the pain filled walking and stepping that come from broken and or overgrown nails.
Grooming - If your cat is starting to look somewhat tufty or tattered, it is likely because it has stopped grooming. This can be because of pain when moving, dental problems, etc. You may need to brush your cat's coat for them, and possibly bathe them as well. Clipping a long haired cat's coat several times a year is another good option.
Ability to handle temperature changes - Heat and cold may stress your cat more as it ages because it's body is losing the ability to regulate it's own heat. Keep your household temperature in a comfortable range for both you and the cat.




 He's 22 years old.

Litterbox usage - Age can cause a variety of problems here... arthritis makes it harder for the cat to get in/out of the litter box... Various kidney and digestive problems make visits to the box more necessary... Some things you can do include: keep the hair short around kitty's rear to help with cleanliness. You can treat the arthritis with help from your vet, and you can change litterboxes to a lower profile model. You can also consult with your vet about changing the cat's diet.

Purchase stairs when your cat begins to avoid high places.,
Purchase stairs to conserve space.,
Look for steps no taller than 7 ½”.,
Look for stairs at least 10” deep.,
Purchase a ramp if your cat has trouble walking.,
Purchase a ramp if your cat has never used stairs.,
Get a gentler slope for struggling cats.,
Choose a model with non-looping carpet.,
Buy a model with safety rails.,
Be sure that the model is tall enough.",How to Choose a Ramp or Stairs for Your Cat," Stairs are a great option for cats who find it uncomfortable to jump high but otherwise get around well. Cats like to hide illness, so you will need to watch attentively. If your cat suddenly starts to avoid high perches that it had once loved, then it might be time for stairs.Your cat might have a problem if it has begun to avoid its cat tree. Also consider stairs if it has begun to sleep on the ground. Most cats prefer to sleep in a high perch.;
, Stairs take up less space than ramps. They have a steeper incline and thus are not as long. If your cat can manage stairs, it might be the more convenient option than a ramp., Each individual step should be no more than 7 ½” or 19 cm tall. This should be a comfortable height for your cat to climb. A steeper incline could make it hard for your cat to use the stairs., Your cat likes to have space to maneuver on the step. Be sure that the steps are each at least 10” (25 cm) deep. Dogs are less interested in this space, so stairs designed for them might not have the depth required for cat stairs., Stairs are great for cats who can’t jump high but can otherwise get around well. When you suspect that your cat is beginning to have trouble even walking around, then it is time to move on to a ramp. It usually helps to get cats accustomed to ramps ahead of time, so consider buying them when your cat first experiences mobility problems.Cats like to hide their ailments, so it might be hard to tell when it begins to have mobility issues. By 15, you cat is likely to have some discomfort walking. Watch for changes in its gait. Look for signs that it is walking less or using less stairs less frequently.

, Some cats never take to stairs and will be especially unlikely to use stairs if you introduce them to your cat late in life. If you cat has traditionally avoided stairs or has never had a chance to use them before, a ramp might be a safer bet., A slope of 18 degrees might be necessary for cats with a very severe impairment. For those with only moderate difficulties, something as steep as 26 degrees might be appropriate., Carpet is optimal because it provides traction and prevents your cat from slipping off. However, your cat’s nails can get stuck in carpet that has small loops. Try a non-looping carpet like plush., There should be rails along the side of the stairs that will stop your cat if it begins to fall off. This is especially important if your cat is losing its sight; it might be the only way that it knows where it is going.If your cat loses its vision slowly, it will probably be hard for you to recognize the problem. Your cat will memorize the location of items in the household and act as if nothing has changed. However, it will bump into furniture more often than it used to, especially when you move furniture around. It might also seem more reticent to jump from high spots., The top step of stairs should be no less than 7 1/2” (25 cm) shorter than the surface it leads up to. A ramp should be high enough to be level with the surface."

Make safety a priority.,
Make adjustments to your cat's favorite games.,
Create new games for your cat.,
Keep playing with your cat.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Choose Toys for a Senior Cat," Lower-activity toys are toys that will stimulate your cat's mind but do not take a lot of energy or mobility to play with. Some low-activity toys that your cat might enjoy include:Paper bags
Cardboard boxes
Food puzzle toys
Cat trees;
, One of the ways a senior cat can get injured is from jumping and twisting. If your senior cat has mobility issues and you are scared of it getting severely injured, avoid getting it high-activity toys, such as motorized mice or fishing-pole toys.Jumping and twisting can be hard on older cats because older cats often lose agility in their bodies. This can be due to age-related health problems, such as arthritis, or just because of the cat's changing body as it ages., As your cat ages, it may be more hesitant to play with you due to physical discomfort or generally low energy. However, it is important to keep the cat playing for its physical and mental health. Try luring your cat into play with a feather toy, a catnip toy, or a treat hidden inside a ball.Toys that make noise such as a toy with a bell or crinkling toys can encourage some cats to play, especially those that my have visual impairments.
The smell of catnip may just lure your cat off its bed and into action. However, not all cats respond, or respond well, to catnip. If your cat doesn't, you will need to find something else to lure your cat into play. Perhaps your cat loves treats and you can incorporate a treat or two into a play session.

, When choosing toys, you should think about your cat's abilities and play to its strengths. For instance, if your cat is losing its sight in old age, which happens to a lot of older cats, then find it toys that don't require clear vision. A blind cat may still love to climb in and out of boxes, so then you should give it more boxes and less toys that require sight, such as fishing pole toys.Remembering your cat's strengths when picking out toys is key to finding it toys that it will enjoy playing with.

, As a cat ages it may not have the mobility or energy that it once did. Continue playing with your cat but make sure to think about its health when playing. The key to playing with a senior cat is to remember that the goal is giving it a bit of moderate exercise and quality time with you. The goal is not to make it jump super high or run as fast as it can.Keeping safety in mind does not mean that you need to be overly cautious with your cat. It just means that you should keep the cat's physical limitations in mind. Contact your vet if you are uncertain about any potential play activity.

, As your cat ages you should continue to play all of its favorite games but you may need to adjust them. If your cat loves to chase a ball, continue throwing them but just don't throw them as far or as fast. If your cat loves to jump at a ribbon, just don't twirl it as high. Making adjustments like this can really make a senior cat's play time more enjoyable and safe.


If your cat loves to climb and explore but is having mobility issues, consider installing cat shelves on your walls so that a senior cat can safely climb. You may also need to purchase a shorter cat tree for your senior cat.
If your cat loves chasing balls, consider playing with them in a contained area, such as the corner of a room. This will assure that your cat doesn't need to run long distances., As your cat gets older it may enjoy new games that take its mobility into consideration. For example, you could place one of your cat's favorite toys inside a tissue or cardboard box. The goal would then be for the cat to figure out how to get it out. This might work especially well for playing with a catnip toy and it does not require the cat to expend a lot of physical energy, just some mental energy.It's good to keep in mind that as it ages you should have your senior cat use its mind more than its body during play.

, Above all, you should keep playing with your cat as it gets older. The activity that playing provides, combined with the love and attention you give it when you play with it, can really enhance a cat's senior years.


If your cat is in ill health and doesn't have the energy it once did, you should still try to play with it. Stimulating a cat's mind can be a great help in promoting the healing of its body.
In general, older cats don't play for as long as younger cats do. However, you should play with them every day., If your cat cannot do some things it used to, such as play or climb, consult your vet to see if treatment is necessary. Many older cats may develop arthritis that impacts their ability to play, but your vet may be able to prescribe a mild medication that will make your cat more comfortable and able to take on its favorite activities."

Play with your cat.,
Keep a regular routine.,
Introduce a cat companion.",How to Keep an Old Cat Young at Heart1," One of the best ways to keep your older cat young at heart is to encourage ability-appropriate play. Playtime helps keep your cat’s body and mind active.Dangle a toy for your cat to swat at while they’re lying down.
Drag a ribbon across the floor.
Purchase motorized toys for your cat to chase (look for items with slower settings).;
, Cats thrive on routine. Making playtime a regular, scheduled part of your day helps to keep your cat happy and healthy, while helping them to feel calm and secure.


Aim to spend 30 minutes playing 1-2 times per day.
Schedule play time for before you head out for work each day.
Schedule a second play time for when you return.

, Cats are very territorial, and may not be initially open to sharing their space with a new cat. Nevertheless, the introduction of a new animal can help to stimulate your cat.The ideal companion will be:


Younger (ideally a kitten)
Smaller.
The opposite gender.
Fixed.

Be on the lookout for signs of illness.,
Schedule veterinary checkups more often.,
Provide dental care.,
Get potential health problems treated right away.",How to Help Your Cat Age Well1," In order to help your cat age well, you should be on the lookout for common signs of illness. This will allow you to get veterinary treatment started quickly. Some common signs of illness that you should look for include:Weight loss
Lack of appetite
Increased water consumption
Lack of usual grooming or self care
Lumps, bumps, or swellings
Coughing
Difficulty breathing
Bouts of weakness
Difficulty moving
Disorientation
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Changes to urination;
, As your cat ages, it should have veterinary exams more often because it is more vulnerable to illness. It is recommended that a senior cat (over 10 years) be seen every six months, instead of every year.This allows your veterinarian to catch diseases and injuries quickly and to start treatment for any developing problems immediately.When you get your cat regular veterinary exams it also assures that your cat's vaccinations are always up to date.
Your vet may want to run tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), a biochemistry profile, a urinalysis, and thyroid hormone testing to see how well your cat is doing., Your cat is likely to have more dental problems as it ages but you can prevent many problems with regular dental checks and dental cleanings. Look at your cat's teeth regularly to spot signs of decay or injuries. Also, brushing your cat's teeth at least a few times a week can remove plaque and tartar buildup, which can prevent dental decay.Proper dental care is key for preventing the need for tooth extraction or other dental procedures in old age.
If you are having your cat get regular veterinary exams, the veterinarian should also be assessing your cat's teeth and giving you recommendations for proper dental care.

, As your cat ages, it's important to get injuries and diseases treated quickly. Your cat's ability to fight off illnesses decreases as it ages, so getting veterinary care as soon as possible will increase your cat's likelihood of recovering from a health problem.


If you think that your cat might be sick but you're not sure, give your veterinary office a call. Describe the cat's symptoms and ask if they think you should bring it in.

Look at the selection of senior cats available for adoption, once you pick a shelter.,
Make an appointment to meet the cats you are interested in.,
Follow your shelter or rescue’s adoption process.,
Make an appointment with a vet right away.,
Allow your senior cat to adjust to your home gradually.,

Make sure your cat stays hydrated.,
Talk to your vet about which type of food is healthiest for your cat.,
Make sure your cat gets enough exercise.,
Get your cat to the vet at least twice a year.",How to Adopt an Old Cat," If you have other pets or small children, think about how they would interact with an older cat. Senior cats do best in quiet, low-stress environments, and they have trouble adjusting to major changes (like getting used to other animals or playful kids). If your other pets and/or kids are easy-going and gentle with animals, then bringing a senior cat into the home may be just fine., Depending on the age and overall health of the cat you plan to adopt, you may need to be prepared to set aside a certain amount of time and money for vet visits, special diet foods, and home medical care. Elderly cats can develop a host of health issues that need special attention, like diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and arthritis and joint pain.Most senior cats will need a general veterinary checkup at least twice a year. Cats with known health issues may need even more frequent visits.

, Before you bring any cat into your home, you should have a few basics on hand, such as:Cat food formulated for senior cats (or whatever food is recommended for the particular cat you wish to adopt)
Shallow food dishes
A comfortable cat bed
A few toys
A shallow litter box that a senior cat can easily get into and out of
You should also get a comfortable pet carrier that you can use to take the cat home from the shelter, and to carry your cat to and from medical appointments.

, Cats love to curl up in warm, cozy spots to nap or just hang out. Set up a soft cat bed near a window where lots of sunlight comes in. If you don’t mind your new cat friend hanging out in your bed, set up a bench or ramp at the foot of the bed so that they can climb up and down easily.

, Do an internet search for local shelters, ask around among friends who have recently adopted cats, or try using a service like Petfinder to help match you up with the shelter or adoption group that fits your needs.Some shelters specialize in senior animals. If you can find a shelter like this in your area, they may be especially well suited to helping you find the resources you need to care for your senior cat.Different shelters have different prices and procedures for adopting pets, and some may offer lower fees for hard-to-adopt animals, like elderly cats.
Read about the adoption policies and procedures for each shelter you find and decide which one works best for you.

, Many shelters will have online profiles for their adoptable pets, typically with a little information about each pet’s history, personality, and any special needs they may have. Look over the pet profiles, and pick out one or two cats that you would like to meet.

, Some shelters or rescues will allow you to walk in any time, but some may prefer if you call in advance and set a time to meet the cats.


Spend some time getting to know the cat(s) you are interested in adopting. This will help you get an idea of whether the cat has a personality that is compatible with yours.
Ask the staff at the pet shelter or rescue any questions you may have about the cat’s health and dietary needs.
If you have other pets and/or children at home, ask if the cat you are interested in does well in an environment with other animals or kids.

, Once you have picked a cat, you will need to pay any necessary adoption fees and fill out the appropriate paperwork. Depending on the shelter, you may need to bring in other family members to meet the cat, and there may be a waiting period before you can bring your new companion home., Even if your new cat was under veterinary care and observation at the shelter or rescue, it’s important to establish a relationship with a vet for your senior cat as soon as possible. Take your cat to the vet for a checkup and any necessary vaccines, and find out about any health concerns that the shelter or rescue staff may have been unaware of.


It may be a good idea to talk to a vet before you bring home your new pet. They can provide helpful advice on what to expect before you adopt a senior cat., Start out by keeping your cat in a single room (like your bedroom) for a few days, with access to food, water, litter, and other necessities, before letting them out to explore other rooms in the house., Elderly cats often need a little extra help with grooming, especially if they have arthritis or other health problems.Brush your cat every day to prevent mats and hairballs. Brush gently, since older cats often have sensitive skin.
Check your cat’s nails once a week, and trim them if necessary., Provide plenty of fresh water and, ideally, canned food. Dry food can contribute to dehydration, especially in older cats., There are a variety of retail store and prescription only cat foods formulated for cats with a variety of health issues and special dietary needs. Your vet can help you select the type that is best for your cat., Exercise can help senior cats stay happy and healthy. Get some wand toys and try to engage your cat in light play from time to time.If your cat seems to have trouble getting around, try installing ramps (up to your bed, the cat tree, or any other surface you want to encourage your cat to climb on) to help keep them moving and exploring., It is important for senior cats to get regular checkups, which can help catch health issues early. If you notice any signs of possible health problems, get your cat to the vet right away, even if it isn’t time for a checkup.Look for problem signs like:


Changes in appetite or thirst
Significant changes in weight
Unusual vomiting or diarrhea
Changes in personality
Lethargy or fainting
Difficulty using the litter box, or urinating and defecating outside the litterbox
Sneezing, coughing, or other respiratory symptoms
Signs of pain or stiffness

Announce your presence.,
Make your home safe and cozy.,
Make resources accessible.,
Shower your cat with love!",How to Keep an Old Cat Young at Heart2," Older cats can be hard of hearing or otherwise easily startled. You can prevent a nervous reaction in your cat by calling ahead into a room before you enter.You might say, “Alfie, are you in here?”
You might place a bell on door handles in your home.

, If your cat is having trouble getting around, stop to make sure they can access everything they need. Also, providing your cat with a nice, warm place to sleep is a great way to keep them feeling good.Provide a stool that helps your cat access a favorite sleeping spot
Provide a cozy cat bed
Set up a heating pad to help keep your cat warm
Keep the temperature in your house at a comfortable level

, If your cat is experiencing mobility issues, it may be time to reevaluate your litter box (or boxes). Additionally, if your house is large or multi-leveled, it is important to place cat resources—food/water and litter boxes—in more than one location.Choose a litter box with low sides.
Place litter boxes and food resources in multiple locations.

, Cats are most happy when they receive genuine attention. Continue to show love to your senior cats in the same ways you always have.You can show your cat love by:


Petting.
Taking naps together.
Brushing your cat’s fur.
Providing treats.

Feed your cat quality, age-appropriate food.,
Make sure your cat has access to clean drinking water.,
Give your cat lots of love and affection.,
Provide stimulation for your cat's mind and body.",How to Help Your Cat Age Well2," As your cat ages, its nutritional needs will change. For instance, it may need to eat fewer calories because it is less active during the day. If you have a senior cat, it should be given food that is designed to provide for its specific dietary needs.For example, cats with hyperthyroidism may need to eat food low in iodine.Cats with kidney disease may do better with canned foods that are low in phosphorous.Discuss changes to your cat's diet with your veterinarian. Ask them if they think that your cat would benefit from a senior diet and ask them for recommendations of what specifically to feed to your cat.
When switching your cat's food, be sure to do it gradually. Switching a cat's food all of a sudden can cause stomach upset and illness.

, All cats should have unlimited access to clean drinking water but it is especially important for older cats. Older cats are more at risk for problems with their kidney function and having access to drinking water can help to keep them hydrated.If your cat isn't interested in drinking water, and you are afraid it is getting dehydrated, consider switching the cat's food to wet food. The moisture in wet food can help to keep an aging cat hydrated.

, As your cat ages it may spend more time enjoying quiet time alone. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't still need quality time with you. Be sure that you are giving all the love and attention that you always have, and maybe even a little more.Many older cats love curling up on their owner's laps and getting lots of petting and affection. If your cat is having a hard time moving around, go to where it is instead of waiting for it to come to you and give it some love.

, As your cat ages it needs to continue to have lots of stimulation to keep both its mind and body active. Give your older cat puzzle toys to play with and play with it daily to keep it active. Even a few minutes of play each day can help an older cat to age well.Many cats love to play well into old age. They may not be able to play for as long, or as vigorously, but they still benefit from the exercise, attention, and brain stimulation.

Make sure your cat has easy access to everything it needs.,
Add stairs or ramps to allow easy access around your home.,
Provide warm and comfortable spaces for the cat.",How to Help Your Cat Age Well3," As your cat ages, it may not be as agile as it once was. This may make it difficult for the cat to access the items it needs on a daily basis. For example, a cat that has always eaten its food up on a high counter may have difficulty jumping up on that counter as it ages. With this in mind, think about all the things your cat uses on a daily basis and make sure they are easily accessible.Another example is your cat's litter box. If your aging cat has mobility issues, it may become difficult for the cat to jump in and out of a litter box with high sides. In this case, consider replacing your cat's old litter with a new one with low sides. Also, place it in a location that is easily accessible.
You may also want to consider placing food, water, and litter boxes in multiple locations in your home. This will make it easier for your aging cat to access these essential items at any time, especially if your home has more than one floor.

, As your cat ages it may need some help to get around your home with ease. Provide stairs, ramps, or other things to help your cat move onto high surfaces or to different levels of your home.For example, your cat may need help getting up to its sleeping spot on your bed if your bed is very high. Provide a piece of furniture as a halfway point for it to jump up to on its way up to the bed.

, Your cat may have been wild and active when it was young, but it is likely that it will slow down with age and spend more time napping. An aging cat usually benefits from having a warm and quiet spot that it all its own where it can go to get a cat nap. Provide your cat with such a space, preferably one that is warmed by the sun or a heating vent nearby.Your cat may pick a place that it likes to nap on its own. If your cat has a favorite spot, try to make that spot very comfy. Add a soft pillow or a heated cat bed to make the spot ideal.

Purchase a tank.,
Purchase a filter.,
Purchase an air pump.,
Purchase gravel or sand for the bottom of your tank.,
Purchase your ghost shrimp.",How to Take Care of Ghost Shrimp1," If you aren't planning on breeding your ghost shrimp, a small tank will do. Don't get anything smaller than 5 gallons (18.9 L). In general, ghost shrimp aren't picky about the shape or color of their tank, but as adults they can get aggressive with one another so giving them ample space is important.;
, Even though ghost shrimp do much of the cleaning themselves, a filter is necessary for a healthy aquarium. Now there are two types of filter you should consider. External filters are good for changing water and filtering out the bad stuff. Internal Sponge filters are highly recommended because they can also be as food source for shrimps. Filters come in a huge range of prices starting at about $25.00. For a few ghost shrimp a heavy duty filter is unnecessary.You must purchase an external filter that pulls the water out of the tank before filtering if you have a huge tank.

, Ghost shrimp need a pump in their tank to oxygenate their water. If you only have shrimp and have a hanging filter, you can skip the air pump. Pumps start at about $15.00 (you will still have to buy air tubing).

, Ghost shrimp are bottom dwellers and they get their sustenance from pieces of food that have fallen from above. Gravel or sand at the bottom of the tank works to catch their food and provide easy access to a meal. Gravel and sand can be bought at any pet store and will come in multiple different colors, styles and prices.

, Ghost shrimp can cost as little as 30 cents to as high as $3.00 for a single shrimp. Consider whether you want to buy a single shrimp or an assortment. Many pet stores and online vendors sell in them in bulk for a discount. Note that for many stores, availability is seasonal. When picking a shrimp out, pay attention to color: not all ghost shrimp are alike and can range from completely clear to red.

Buy a cooler.,
Layer the bottom of the cooler with icepacks.,
Cover the cooler with a moist burlap bag.",How to Keep Blue Crabs Alive1," Buy a regular sized cooler from your local depot or sporting goods store. If you are planning to store more than five crabs, it is recommended that you buy a larger cooler. This way you will not need to stack the crabs on top of each other.Alternatively, you can use a wooden bushel basket to store the crabs. This method is ideal for commercial watermen.;
, This will keep the temperature around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. A temperature cooler than 50 degrees Fahrenheit will kill the crabs. You can place a moist towel over the icepacks to keep the cooler moist and to prevent the crabs from becoming too cold.Alternatively, you can place ice, covered with a moist cloth, at the bottom of the cooler. However, you will need to drain the water from the melted ice periodically. Any standing water can cause the crabs to suffocate.Do not put ice or ice packs on top of the crabs.

, This is to ensure that the crabs stay moist. If blue crabs are not kept moist, their gills will dry out, and they will die. It is recommended that you use a burlap bag because it allows oxygen to pass through. The crabs need to be well oxygenated in order to stay alive.Place the cooler in a dark, shaded area away from the sun. This will also prevent the crab’s gills from drying out.Blue crabs can live out of the water for up to 24 hours as long as they are kept cool and moist."

,, Wait at least 24 hours before continuing. The purifier contains a special formula of salt and water purifiers, as sea monkeys are a hybrid brine shrimp and brine shrimp are salt water creatures; It also contains some eggs.

,


By now the eggs from the first packet have hatched and the baby sea monkeys are big enough to see. The egg packet contains more eggs, as well as a dye that makes the hatched sea monkeys easy to see, giving the illusion of instant life.

, Until you have algae in the tank, you need to add oxygen to the water so the sea monkeys don't suffocate.


To oxygenate the tank, either use a pipette to add air to the water, or gently pour the water between two different containers for a minute each day. You could also use an aquarium aerator.

, The sea monkeys should go to the top of the tank and swim around.

, They can last years if you take good care of them. They are living and breathing and do require care; it might not be much but you want them to have the best life possible.

Provide new shells.,
Consider size.,
Select the best type of shells for your crab.,
Consider other factors.",How to Help a Hermit Crab Change Shells1," First and foremost, if you want your hermit crab to change to a new shell, you must provide some options for him to choose from! Make a variety of shells available to your hermit crab.


Hermit crab shells can be purchased at pet stores, craft stores, or a variety of online retailers.;
, It is important to remember that hermit crabs grow very slowly. When selecting new shells, you will want to select a few shells that are roughly the same size as the one he is wearing, and a few that are just slightly larger., Different types of hermit crabs tend to prefer specific types of shells. You can select the best shells for your crab by choosing varieties suited to your crab’s type. If you are not familiar with different shell types, someone at a pet store can help you.For example, Coenobita clypeatus (or Purple Pincher) crabs generally prefer turbo shells.
Coenobita compressus (or Ecuadorian) crabs tend to prefer short shells (such as Thais biserialis, T. orbita, or T. haemastom shells). They also prefer shells that been previously warn, as the inner spiral has often been removed.

, You will also want to select shells for your hermit crab by considering the shape of their opening, as well the thickness of given shells. In both instances, look to the shell your crab is currently wearing for clues.


Most shells will have either a “D” or “O” shaped opening. Look at the shape of the opening for the shell your crab is currently using, and select new shells that mirror this opening shape.All crabs have preferences for the thickness of their shells. Investigate the thickness of the shell your crab is currently using. Then aim to provide alternative shells that share a similar thickness.Avoid painted shells. Many pet stores (or craft stores) sell painted shells for hermit crabs to use. These painted shells must be avoided! Although they are cute, the paint can chip and be ingested by your crab, causing him to be very sick. In some cases, the paint used may even be poisonous to crabs."
"
Sniff around for a fishy, rotten smell.,
Assume that your crab is molting.,
Notice when a crab is laying outside its shell without any signs of transitioning.,
Move the crab and observe the results.,
Keep an eye on a buried crab.",How to Know when Your Hermit Crab Is Dead1," This is the surest way to identify a dead hermit crab. If your hermit crab dies, it will begin to decompose – and its carcass will begin to smell putrid. If you can't smell anything, pick the crab out of the tank to get a closer whiff. If you smell a salty, rotten scent, there's a good chance that your crab has passed away.;
, Hermit crabs periodically shed their exoskeleton, and this process often involves losing body parts. The crabs are immobile for a short time while it regains muscle control and its new exoskeleton hardens up. If you disturb your crab while it is molting, you may seriously endanger it – so be patient. Assume molting before death., This can be a sign that the crab is dead, or it can just be a by-product of the molting process. If you find what appear to be a dead crab next to a shell, have a closer look to see if it is just an exoskeleton. If is it hollow and crumbles easily, it is an old exoskeleton. Look inside the nearby shell, and you might find a freshly-molted crab hiding out.


If the immobile crab is obviously not an exoskeleton, try picking it up to see if it moves. If it does not react, it's probably dead.

, If you can't figure out whether your crab is dead, move it to a new location and note exactly how it is positioned. Try placing food on the other side of the tank to give the crab a motivation to move. Leave the tank, then come back to check within the next few hours. If the crab moved while you were gone, then you know it's alive. If not, it may be sleeping or molting.

, It is perfectly natural for hermit crabs to bury themselves; this can indicate that the crab is molting, or just that it feels threatened. Smooth the sand around his hiding spot, then look for tracks to get an idea if he is coming up at night for food. If it has been weeks since your crab buried itself, you can carefully sweep off a bit of sand from around his hiding spot to check for a rotting smell."

Choose a senior-specific diet.,
Schedule more frequent visits to the vet.,
Watch for changes.",How to Keep an Old Cat Young at Heart3," Talk to your vet about moving your cat onto a senior specific diet. Additionally, older cats may prefer to eat smaller amounts more often.Look for special cat food blends that aim to help with joint pain, urinary tract problems, and other common issues for older cats.
If your cat has grown picky, try warming up the food.

, Just like humans, older cats are prone to more ailments. As such, frequent vet appointments can help detect problems early on.Consult your vet to determine how often to bring your cat in.
As a general rule, take your cat to see the vet about every six months.

, Medical issues can develop quickly in an older cat, even despite frequent vet check-ups. So be sure to watch for any sudden changes to your cat’s body or behavior.Look for things like:


Weight loss.
Loss of appetite.
Changes in activity level.
Changes in litter box behavior.

Feed your ghost shrimp twice a day.,
Keep the water at 65-82°F (18-28°C.).,
Add plants to your aquarium.,
Give your shrimp companions.,
Keep baby ghost shrimp away from other fish.,
Don't fret if your ghost shrimp doesn't make it.",How to Take Care of Ghost Shrimp2," Give them as much as they can eat in about 1-3 minutes. They should be fed sinking pellets that fall to the bottom of the tank.

, Purchase a heater that you can attach to your fish tank if you are living in a colder climate.

, Ghost shrimp like a medium level of fine-leaf vegetation in their tanks. Make sure to purchase aquatic plants from a pet store. Also, Ghost Shrimp can tell the difference between a real and a fake plant. If you want them to feel a lot more like home, it is suggest that you use actual plants. Plus, they do look very nice!

, Ghost shrimp live well with other aquatic creatures like snails and small fish. Don't put them in with fish that are too much bigger than them or they will get eaten.

, Wait to add them to community tanks until they are adults. You don't want them to be dinner for a bigger fish.

, Ghost shrimp are known to live up to 2 years, but just because yours doesn't live that long doesn't mean you did something wrong. If your ghost shrimp doesn't last, don't feel like a failure--it might have nothing to do with your quality of care.

Buy a standard five-gallon bucket.,
Place a mesh lid on top.,
Feed them once or twice per day.,
Keep them cool.,
Allow crabs to warm to room temperature before cooking.",How to Keep Blue Crabs Alive2," Drill holes into the sides and bottom of the bucket. The holes need to be big enough to allow water to flow through, but small enough to ensure that the crabs cannot escape.Alternatively, you can buy a specially designed wooden box to store the crabs in.
This method is ideal if you live near the water where the crabs were caught. If not, use the cooler method to store the crabs.

, Go to your local hardware store and buy wire mesh. Take your mesh and bend it over the top of the five-gallon bucket. Staple the sides of the mesh, that overlap the top of the bucket, to the sides of the bucket.When you buy the mesh, the dimensions should be at least one inch larger than the size of your bucket.
Use a heavy duty staple gun to fasten the mesh to the sides of the bucket.

, If you are storing live blue crabs in the water, you will need to feed them. Adult blue crabs will eat oysters, hard clams, dead or live fish, crabs (including blue crabs), shrimp, organic debris, aquatic plants, and the leaves and shoots of sea lettuce, eelgrass, salt marsh grass, and ditch grass.Feed them once or twice per day.

, Keep the crabs cool and moist in a cooler or bushel basket. The optimal temperature is about 50 degrees fahrenheit. Any temperatures colder than that can kill the crabs.Do not refrigerate them. Because the temperatures in a refrigerator are too cold, refrigeration will kill blue crabs.

, Chilled crabs will be in a dormant state and can appear to be dead. Before cooking, let the crabs warm to room temperature. The crabs will become animated once they are room temperature. This way you can tell which crabs are alive and which crabs are dead.Never cook dead crabs.

"
"
Limit shaking.,
Keep them in one spot.,
Don’t pile them up.",How to Keep Blue Crabs Alive3," Stress can also cause blue crabs to die. Once dead, blue crab meat is mushy and unsuitable for cooking and eating. Too much shaking can stress blue crabs. Therefore, avoid shaking your cooler or bushel basket while storing and transporting the crabs., Dumping or moving the crabs from one storage space to another can cause stress, as well. Try to store the crabs in one spot. If you need to move the crabs from one cooler to another, do not dump them into the other cooler all at once. Place them one by one into the other cooler., Piling blue crabs on top of each other will also cause undue stress. To avoid this, have an extra cooler or bushel basket handy in case you run out of room in your first cooler or bushel basket."
"
Boil new shells.,
Moisten shells with saltwater.,
Place shells where the crab can see them.",How to Help a Hermit Crab Change Shells2," When you obtain new shells for your hermit crab, it is very important for you to make sure the shells are safe and sanitary. You can do this by boiling your shells. First, use a brush to remove any sand or debris from in the inside and outside of your shell. Then, submerge your shells in boiling distilled water, and boil them for 15-20 minutes., After your shells have been boiled, they must be moistened with ocean water, or salt water. (Purchasing a saltwater solution from a pet store is the most effective option.) As you wait for your crab to select a new shell, you will want to periodically re-moisten the insides of your shells. This will draw you hermit crab toward the shells, and make the shells more attractive to him.Avoid tap water. Most tap water contains trace amounts of copper or other heavy metals. Hermit crabs are extremely sensitive to these metals, and they can hurt your crab., Once your shells have been properly prepared, place them where your crab can see them. Position them out in the open, on the ground level (substrate) of your crab’s habitat, so that your crab will encounter them daily.


Once a week (or every other week) you may want to remove the shells, wait a few hours, and then put them back. If your crab has become accustomed to the shells, he may not really recognize them anymore. Removing and reintroducing them may encourage your crab to investigate, and possibly even change shells.This is also a good time to re-moisten your shells with saltwater.

"
"
Check the size of your tank.,
Ensure proper humidity.,
Make sure the temperature is right.,
Provide enough new shells.",How to Help a Hermit Crab Change Shells3," In order for your hermit crab to want to change shells, he needs to feel healthy, comfortable, and secure. The first component of a healthy “crabitat” is a good-sized container. You need to estimate five-gallons of space for each hermit crab.The best tanks will be made of glass, but plastic may be suitable as well. Avoid mesh or wire cages.
Look for ""aquariums."" If you are unsure, ask a pet store sales person to assist you.

, Proper humidity is essential for your crabs comfort and health. Encourage your crab to change shells by maintain a relative humidity level of 70-80% in his tank.Install a hygrometer to inform you of humidity levels. When the level drops below 75, spray a fine mist of water into your crabs cage.
Maintaining the right temperature will help to maintain the humidity levels of your tank.

, The right temperature is also crucial is your crab’s health and happiness. Maintaining a temperature of 72-80 F (22-27 C) in your “crabitat,” will keep your hermit crab comfortable and happy, and may encourage him to change shells.Use a heating pad under your cage or install heat lamps to increase the temperature of your tank.

, Watching your hermit crab change shells can be fun and entertaining, but far beyond its entertainment value, having access to numerous, clean shells is essential for your crab’s survival. Help create a healthy environment by ensuring that you have at least three viable, alternative shells available per crab.Remember to be patient. Ultimately, you cannot make a hermit crab change shells. Your hermit crab will only change to a new shell when he is comfortable, growing, happy, and most of all, ready.

"
"
Determine whether your crab is molting.,
Look for a ""fat bubble"".,
Isolate a molting crab from other crabs.",How to Know when Your Hermit Crab Is Dead2," Your crab may be molting if it is out of its shell and not moving. Signs of molting include general lethargy, less antennae activity, tangled and confused-looking antennae, an ashy exoskeleton, and dull eyes (like human cataracts). Your crab may remain still for long periods of time, and it may even bury itself in the sand as a safety tactic.


Smaller, quickly-growing crabs can molt every few months, while larger crabs tend to molt about once a year. Note the dates and duration every time that your crab molts; this way, you'll know what to expect. If your crab is new, or if you haven't seen it molt before, you'll need to wait it out until you're certain.Wait several days. If there is no fishy smell, there's a good chance that your crab is molting. Molting usually lasts about two weeks, so you may need to wait some time before you are absolutely sure.

, Consider whether your crab has been eating a lot over the past few days. Before a molt, a crab will store extra fat and water in a small blackish ""bubble"" – usually on the left-hand side of the abdomen, just under the fifth pair of legs. However, do not assume that a crab is molting just because he has made a bubble., Molting crabs are vulnerable to stress and injury from other hermit crabs due to their inactivity and their soft new exoskeleton. If one of your crabs is molting, and you have other crabs in the same tank, put the molter into a temporary ""isolation tank"" so that it can shed in safety and privacy. It is very important that hermit crabs are not disturbed during the molting process.If you only have one tank, improvise an ""isolation cell"" within that tank. Cut off the ends of a 2-liter soda bottle, then sink the edges into the sand to protect the molting crab. Be sure that the top of the ""isolation cell"" is open so that oxygen from the surface can replenish the space.

Dig up a buried crab and dispose of it if you smell a rotting-fish odor.,
Throw your dead crab out with the garbage.,
Bury your dead crab.,
Do not flush your dead crab down the toilet.,
Prepare the tank for a new crab.",How to Know when Your Hermit Crab Is Dead3," To be sanitary, scoop the dead crab up along with the sand it was buried in. Dispose of the crab and the sand in one swoop.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap after handling a dead crab.

, If you have no qualms about trashing your deceased crustacean, you can simply place the carcass into a standard waste bin and put it out for garbage collection. Put the body into a Ziploc bag, lay it carefully into the trash, and let it be.

, If you can't bear the thought of throwing out your crustacean friend, consider burying him beneath a foot of soil. This is a very personal decision, and you need to do what you must to feel okay about the situation. Make sure that you bury him deep enough that other animals—dogs, cats, raccoons, etc.—cannot dig up the body.


Feel free to bury the dead crab along with the sand from his cage or tank. The sand may be contaminated, and burying is a great way to safely dispose of it.

, The flush may seem like a quick and easy solution, but it is not a sanitary choice. There's a chance that a rotting carcass will contaminate the water supply. Bury or trash your dead hermit crab instead., If you want to replace your departed hermit crab, clean the tank before you introduce your new pet. Clear away any sand that may have been contaminated by a rotting dead crab; clean the sides of the tank; replace any water.

Offer a variety of foods and treats.,
Learn what your crab likes.",How to Hand Feed a Hermit Crab," Pick up your crab with your dominant hand and hold him gently but securely. Allow your crab to relax, and gently try to coax him out of his shell a bit. He might stay hidden in his shell if he is scared, so give him some time to adjust.Never pick your crab up by his front, or anywhere near his claws, as you might run the risk of getting pinched.This process might take time, especially if you’ve never tried it before. If your crab hides in his shell when you hold him, you may need to get him used to being held a bit more before you can hand feed him.;
, You can purchase one online from a specialty store, or you can make one yourself. Simply use something thin and at least a few inches long, like the stem of a pen cap. Put a tiny piece of food on the end of the stem.Don’t use anything with a sharp point on the end. Since you’ll be using this object like a spoon, you won’t want to put anything near the crab’s mouth that could potentially poke or hurt him.

, These are the long, thread-like parts that come out of his head, near his eyes. He uses these parts to sense his surroundings, and also to taste his food. Place the food you want to feed him near his antennae so he can taste it and decide if he likes it and wants it.The crab will decide if he wants the food or not, and if he does, he will use his small claw and maxillipeds, or mouth parts, to pick apart the food and push it into his mouth in tiny bites.

, If you try to feed your crab and he seems to have no interest in eating, don’t force it. Set him down back in his home and let him be for a while. You can always try again later when he might be more hungry, or even try again with a different food that might be more appealing to him.If you get the hang of hand feeding your hermit crab, he might ultimately become easier to handle and more willing to be held, as he will associate being held with getting yummy food and treats., If you have children, especially, avoid letting them hold the crab over tile or wood floors. Dropping a crab from that distance onto a hard surface can ultimately be fatal for the crab, as it could damage or rupture his tiny internal organs., Even though hermit crabs are not carriers of diseases like many invertebrates, it’s still important to keep your hands clean, both for yourself and the safety of your crab.If you have chemicals on your hands, even those from certain lotions or household cleaning products, you might transfer these things to your crab when you handle him. Wash your hands prior to handling him to avoid this.

, There are plenty of things you probably already have around the house that are safe and enjoyable for your hermit crab to eat. Many fruits and vegetables are great for feeding to your crab.Use a food processor or blender to grind up your crab’s food into tiny pieces. This way, he will be better able to eat it when you give it to him.

, Household ingredients like onion and garlic should be avoided, as well as things like catnip, chocolate, dill, eucalyptus, rosemary, and thyme. Before feeding anything to your crab, do a search to make sure it is safe.

, Hermit crabs are omnivores, so it’s important to balance their intake of vegetation and meat. All kinds of crustaceans, including lobster, shrimp, and other crabs, are great sources of meat.

, At the local pet store, or at the place you bought your crab, there is likely to be a selection of crab food that you can buy already made, blended, and packaged. You can always purchase this kind of food to feed your crab with.


Be mindful of preservatives in this kind of food. Preservatives are not good for crabs, so if you can, try to choose a food that doesn’t have any. Check the ingredients label for things like Ethoxyquin, copper sulfate, or BHT (butylhydroxytoluene). These can be toxic to your crab.These commercially made foods can also become boring and bland for your crab to eat day after day. If you do choose to purchase and use this kind of food, try mixing in other things once in awhile to keep your crab interested.

, You can buy many different kinds of pre-made treats at your local pet supply or grocery store, including freeze-dried plankton and shrimp, fish food flakes, and even seaweed. Giving your crab treats will help keep his diet varied.A varied diet is important for hermit crabs. You don’t really need to worry about them overeating or being overfed, due to the way their metabolisms function. They’re more likely to eat too little, especially if their food choices aren’t enticing or interesting. Changing up their food each day will help keep your crab interested in eating., Just like any other pet, your crab will like certain foods while disliking others. The way to learn what he does and does not like is by trial and error. See what foods he responds to the best, and which foods he turns away from.Even though they do have specific tastes, hermit crabs are not very picky eaters. You will be more likely to see your crab turn away from food if he is bored by it rather than because he doesn’t like it at all.

Find the right container.,
Create a salt water mixture.,
Fill the container to the correct level.,
Be careful not to let your hermit crab drown.",How to Give Your Hermit Crab a Bath1," You can use just about any bowl or small container to serve as a hermit crab bath if you intend to help the crab bathe yourself. If you are going to keep a hermit crab bath inside the tank, you may want to use a small water bowl designed for pets in tanks to ensure the crab can enter and exit the water easily.Choose a bowl with a flat bottom so the crab can easily maneuver while in its bath.
If you will not be present as your crab bathes, ensure it is able to easily get out of the water.
Hermit crabs can knock over light bowls, so if you leave a bowl in the tank, ensure it is heavy enough that the crab can’t knock it over.;
, Hermit crabs drink freshwater, but need to be bathed in a salt water solution. There are a number of products available for sale at your local pet store to help you add the right kind of salt to your water.Products like Hermit Crab Salt or Oceanic Salt provide the right sort of salt content for your hermit crab bath.
Use distilled, room temperature water instead of tap water to ensure there are no chemicals that could harm your hermit crab in the water.
Use one teaspoon of salt per every one hundred milliliters of water for the best mixture.

, Once you have your container and your salt water mixture, you will need to fill the container to the correct height to serve as a hermit crab bath without putting the crab at any risk.


Do not fill the container so the hermit crab would be completely submerged in water, instead make it so the top of the water will be just below the top of the hermit crab’s shell.
If you are keeping the crab bath in the tank, make sure there are pebbles in it and a way to exit the water so the crab does not end up trapped in the container.

, Hermit crabs love a good bath, but don’t forget that they are land crabs and require oxygen to breath. Keeping the crab submerged in its bath for too long could kill a hermit crab.Do not leave the hermit crab unattended in the bathing container if you are bathing your crab separate from its tank and it is unable to climb out of the container on its own.
Only keep your hermit crab in the water for a few minutes, then return it to its tank.

Understand how sand crabs behave in the wild.,
Observe how sand crabs naturally feed.,
Know the mating habits of sand crabs.",How to Feed Sand Crabs1," They burrow into the littoral sand where the tide meets the shore, and they scavenge most of their food from what they find buried in the sand. The term ""sand crab"" describes a variety of large (often predatory) and small (often scavenging) species, and you must suit any feeding regimen to your particular crab. Consider the differences between large and small sand crabs:


Larger sand crabs tend to feed on live or decaying prey that they find while burrowing. This prey may include smaller crabs, baby turtles, and the carcasses of dead shorebirds. As larger crabs burrow, they aerate the sand. This helps to keep air and water circulating in their habitats.Smaller sand crabs feed on mollusks, worms, plankton, and algae. They are mostly scavengers: they keep their ecosystem clear of decomposing organic matter, which could host harmful bacteria.;
, The crabs bury themselves in the sand, facing the ocean, with only their eyes and front antennae exposed. When the tide recedes and washes over them, they unfurl a second set of antennae that filter tiny plankton from the water. The movement happens very quickly. Thus, a sand crab can gather several morsels from each receding wave.


Most crabs can move in any direction—forward, backward and sideways—but a sand crab moves only backward. Thus, it must position itself carefully to reap its meals from the waves.

, In the wild, mating occurs mostly in spring and summer. A female may produce as many as 45,000 eggs. She carries them on her abdomen until the eggs hatch – about 30 days later. For two to four months, the larvae drift as plankton, and currents can carry them far across the sea.Sand crabs can reproduce during their first year of life if the water is warm enough. They don't usually live longer than two to three years.

Move slowly when reaching for your hermit crab.,
Pick the shell up from the back.,
Open the palm of your other hand underneath him while continuing to hold the shell from the back.,
Keep all of your fingers touching each other.,
Place your hermit crab on your hand, and let go of his shell.,
Feed your crab.,
Choose a time when your hermit crab is relatively active and out of his shell.,
Brush all sand off of your hermit crab.,
Avoid letting your crab walk around on carpet or similar surfaces.,
Do not move around when you are handling them.,
Don’t panic if your crab pinches you.",How to Hold a Hermit Crab," Always make sure to move very slowly when trying to handle a hermit crab. Hermit crabs have compound eyes and can detect movement very well. If you move quickly, they’ll definitely see you and they’ll certainly be startled and will try to run away or defend themselves.;
, When you go to pick up your crab, make sure to pick him up from the back. If you try to pick him up from the front, the crab might pinch you with his claws. The initial moment when you pick up the crab is key, so don’t botch this up, and don’t pick him up from the front of the shell or try to touch his head, claws, or body., After you’ve picked up the crab, hold him by the back of the shell then outstretch the palm of your other hand underneath the crab’s walking legs. The reason that you outstretch your hand is so the crab has somewhere to rest his legs, and so he’s not panicking and trying to grab onto to your dominant hand and pinch you.


Flatten your other hand underneath the crab. Make sure that your hand is completely flat and that none of your skin or fingers are vulnerable to getting pinched by the crab.
If he tries to pinch you, slowly raise him up with your other hand just a couple of inches, and then try to lower him again.
Make sure you do this just a couple of inches from the ground of his terrarium or above a table. If you drop him, you don’t want to drop him more than an inch or two., Keeping all of your fingers together will prevent the hermit crab from pinching you with his claws. It will also provide a large, flat area where the crab can stand up. In addition, your crab will feel safer if there is a solid surface beneath him., Once you’ve got the crab to rest his legs on your hand, let him go and allow him to move around on your hand. After being released on your hand, your crab should become more relaxed.


Make sure your hand is only a few inches off of a table or the floor.
Don’t be afraid to let your crab move around freely on your hand.
Try to relax and keep a steady hand.
If your crab gets close to falling off your hand, pick him up by the back of the shell and redirect him., Feeding your crab while handling is definitely one way to get your crab used to and comfortable with handling. In fact, if you properly hand feed your crab, he will actually look forward to and enjoy handling.


Put some oats or fruit in your hand when your crab is relaxed.
Make sure your crab is comfortable.
If you try too fast, your crab might pinch you., Make sure to pick a time when your crab is already active. If your crab is not active, he won’t really do anything, and he might not even come out of his shell. The best way to engage with your crab is to make sure he’s already interested in moving around.


Never shake the crab’s shell.
If the crab doesn’t want to come out, and isn’t moving around, don’t force him.
Figure out when the best time for handling is depending on your crab’s habits and feeding schedule., If you can do so without scaring him, try to brush off as much sand as you can before picking him up. This will enable you to see him better. It will also help when you hold him, as he’ll be less likely to slip out of your fingers.

, While it might be tempting to put down your crab outside of his terrarium while you’re handling him, you need to be careful about where you put your crab down. Certain surfaces are unsafe for hermit crabs. Avoid:


Carpet. The fuzz or lint from carpet will cause problems for your crab.
Any surfaces that might have chemical traces or residues present.
Any surfaces that might present drop dangers, like table tops or stairs., One of the most important parts of handling a crab is staying still and moving slowly and deliberately. Staying still and moving slowly will ensure the safety of your crab and minimize the chances of you getting pinched. If you move around, the crab might get scared about falling and might pinch you.

, While a crab pinch might not be comfortable, it’s not the end of the world. Chances are, you’ll get pinched sooner or later. When this happens, stay calm. Try to get the crab to walk in the other direction – lure him with food or something. He should let go. If this doesn’t work, put your hand in the crab’s terrarium, and he’ll probably let go and walk off."

Provide your crabs with a glass tank.,
Install the substrate.,
Install a humidity gauge and two thermometers, One for the cool end, one for the warmer end.,
Give your crabs hiding places and plenty to climb on.,
Place a fresh water dish and a marine salt water dish in the bowl.,
Make sure you have other shells inside so they have options to change shells if they want to, and make yourself familiar with the type of shells your crab species prefers.,
Provide a wide variety of foods.,
Make sure to offer frequent servings of seaweeds and algae, proteins in the form of meats, calcium rich foods, organic earthworm castings, chitin sources such as meal worms and shrimp, and fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Keep educating yourself about your crabs, and enjoy!

",How to Create a Hermit Crab Habitat," Plastic does not hold heat or humidity well, and should only be used as temporary transport. Your tank will need a lid to hold humidity in. Your crabs can also climb the glue in the corners of the tank and escape, so many owners use a mesh lid covered with Plexiglas.;
, This should be aragonite sand (best choice) or coco fiber ( brand name Eco Earth in the US). Aragonite sand can be found in reef stores, coco fiber should be expanded with ocean salt water. Never use anything with cedar or any other conifer in your hermit crab tank.

, Hermit crabs need a range as they are cold blooded and rely on being able to move to the temperature in their environment that their body needs. Humidity should be 70-80% at all times. Spritzing alone will not do this.


A moist substrate will help you keep humidity up, as will a container of terrarium moss. Do NOT use peat moss. Sponges are a bad idea as well as they harbor bacteria and can make you and your hermit crabs sick.






The temperature at the cooler end of the tank should be about 70-72*F, and up to 82*F at the warm end. Extended periods of cool temperatures can make your crabs sick or kill them.
You can create a warmer end by placing an under tank heater (UTH) on the bottom of one end of your tank. Be sure to attach a thermostat so the temperature does not go above 82*F. UHF's can reach temperatures over 100*F even though they don't feel that hot to you, and can cook a buried crab. You can also place an overhead light with a heat bulb in it. Some use a clamp lamp or a reptile hood made just for heat lamps. Crabs need a day and night cycle, so if you need heat on them at night, use a Moon Glow bulb that releases no UV rays.







, Avoid any conifers and do not ever use metal inside the tank.

, Some casual studies have found that ""Hermit crab salt water"" does not have any salinity to it, and lacks vital nutrients that are present in ocean salt water that the hermit crabs need. Provide your crabs with a dish of marine salt water. You can purchase the salt at your pet store in the aquarium section.


Make sure the water dish is at least half as deep as your largest crab, and give your smaller crabs a way to climb out of the bowl, such as small glass pebbles or uncoated river pebbles.






As for fresh water, chlorine will blister your crab's gills, so you must use a water conditioner that removes chloramines and heavy metals, as many homes have copper pipes and hermit crabs are especially sensitive to copper.







, Keep in mind that painted shells can be dangerous for your crabs. Often the crab was forced into the shell, and the paint will begin to chip and peel and the crabs will eat this paint, which may not be good for them despite the paint being ""non toxic"" for humans. It was not tested on hermit crabs, thus you must keep in mind it can be harmful to them.

, Hermit crabs are scavengers and require a very diverse diet. Your hermit crabs cannot live on commercial foods alone, and there is a large following that is of the understanding that the preservatives in the commercial foods actually contribute to molting abnormalities and toxicity that builds up in the crabs.

, Your crabs also need cellulose found in things like cork bark, so add some to your tank for climbing and eating, and grape wood and cholla wood are also good sources of cellulose, and will help your tank look natural and interesting. You can also find hemp nets made from natural hemp that your crabs will like to munch on and climb on.

Remove your crab from its tank and place it in the bath.,
Move the crab around a bit once it’s in the water.,
Allow your crab to come out of its shell and move around.,
Return your clean hermit crab to its tank.,
Be sure to bathe your hermit crab as needed.",How to Give Your Hermit Crab a Bath2," Be gentle when removing your hermit crab from its tank to avoid stressing the crab out too much. Use slow movements when approaching the crab and don’t make sudden movements while you are holding it.Taking your crab out of its tank too often can stress the crab out and cause it to retreat to inside its shell for extended periods of time.
Try to make the process a pleasant one for the crab by being gentle and slow moving.

, Once you place the crab down into the salt water solution, it may be too afraid of the process to recognize that it is now in a salt water bath it will really enjoy.Swish the crab around a bit so the water in the container comes into contact with the crab’s legs and splashes into the shell to make sure it understands that it is in the water.
Leave the hermit crab alone for a minute after to allow it to come out of its shell.

, After a minute or two the crab will begin to emerge from its shell and crawl around in the container. Allow it to move around freely as it bathes itself and replenishes the water in its shell it uses to stay moist.Let the crab explore the container and move about freely as it cleans itself.
Don’t leave the crab in the water for too long. Allow it to crawl around for a few minutes, then remove it when it either seems like it is trying to find a way out or recedes back into its shell.

, If you do not leave a bathing bowl in your hermit crab’s tank, you will need to return it to its home now that it’s nice and clean. Be careful not to frighten or stress out your crab in the process.


You may want to allow your crab to crawl around on a paper towel first to dry off a bit.
Be gentle as you remove the crab from its bath and return it to its tank.
Do not bath your crab more frequently than once per day, as otherwise it may become stressed out and refuse to leave its shell.

, Hermit crabs require frequent baths in salt water in order to maintain their health, but there are some variables that may affect how often your hermit crab needs a bath.Hermit crabs require bathing daily if the humidity levels in the habitat of the crab are less than 70%.
If the crab lives in a habitat that maintains higher than 70% humidity, bathing may be infrequent and sporadic, as the moisture levels in the air will enable to crab to maintain proper moisture levels in its skin.
Regardless of humidity level, bathe your hermit crab if you notice mites or small insects crawling around on your crab.

Consider the challenges of removing sand crabs from the wild.,
Set up a tank with fresh beach sand and seawater.,
Regularly refill the tank with seawater.,
Consider getting a hermit crab instead.",How to Feed Sand Crabs2," They are saltwater shore-dwellers, and they need high temperatures to survive. Sand crabs live in rhythm with the tides, and it can be difficult to replicate the delicate littoral ecosystem in which they thrive. Furthermore, sand crabs feed on such a diverse diet that you may have a hard time giving them the variety they're used to.

, In the wild, sand crabs bury themselves deep in wet sand and catch plankton with their antennae. Replicate this process by filling your crab's habitat with beach sand, then pouring seawater over the sand a few times each day. Use any glass aquarium. Bear in mind that sand crabs cannot dig in sand that is too dry or densely-packed.Try to bring the beach sand directly from the ecosystem where you got the crab. Local beach sand is more likely to contain the insects and microorganisms that your crab needs.
Sand crabs naturally gather in shoals, so it should be okay to put several sand crabs in the same tank. Remember, however, that large crabs like to eat smaller crabs.

, Homemade saltwater will not do; it needs to contain algae and plankton. You can buy plankton, algae, and aquarium-grade seawater at some aquarium-supply and exotic pet stores. Be warned that these supplies can be expensive.


Understand that this tactic is a short-term experiment to study the behavior of a sand crab. It is not necessarily a sustainable, long-term way to keep a sand crab as a pet. If you only need to study the sand crab for a short time, consider returning it to the wild when you're done.

, Sand crabs are difficult—sometimes nearly impossible—to keep as pets. If you are looking for a crab that's easy to raise and feed, consider getting a hermit crab. Do your research, create a habitat, and learn to care for hermit crabs.Aquarium hermit crabs thrive on practically any food, from algae and leftover fish food to beef, eggs, and vegetables. In the wild, hermit crabs have been known to eat leaves, fruit, and even wood. You can also buy commercial hermit crab food that mimics the crab's natural diet.

Choose a high-quality commercial crab food.,
Pick different colored and textured vegetables.,
Provide wood for your crab.,
Give them enough protein.,
Give your crab treats.,
Supplement your crab’s food with calcium.,
Feed your crab at night.,
Use shallow dishes.,
Give your crab water.,
Control the humidity level.,
Clean your crab’s enclosure.",How to Feed Hermit Crabs," There are several varieties of commercial crab food available that you can use as the basis for your crab’s diet. What’s more, you can alternate between these and provide your crab with a well-balanced diet.


Hermit crab food is available in pellet form, in gel form, in powder form, or like canned dog food. If you choose any of these types of food, give small crabs about 1 teaspoon per day.Generally, all forms contain many nutrients not found in every human food, like tannins, carotenoids, and cellulose, to name a few.There is some conflict over whether or not to feel your crab commercial crab food. However, the consensus is that organic food is better than non-organic, and that you should avoid buying commercial food that has copper sulfate or ethoxyquin.;
, Hermit crabs not only love vegetables and fruits, they are able to consume a wide variety of them. You should change up the menu by rotating between kale, broccoli, bananas, and any other safe fruit or veggie, like mangoes, papaya, and coconut. This will help keep your crab from getting bored with the same old food, in addition to providing a well-balanced amount of the vitamins and minerals found in different veggies.You can serve vegetables raw as long as you rinse them thoroughly in water (without soap!).
Some believe it is important to note that the main source of nutrition should be from a commercial crab food, with vegetables and fruits being added only as a supplemental treat., Crabs love wood because they can play on it and they also enjoy eating it. A positive feature of wood is that it lasts longer and does not have to be replaced daily. It is also abundantly available right outside your front door.


There are several types of wood for their enjoyment, like Birch, Oak, Ash, or Cholla, to name a few.Your crab is a little creature, so there is no need to feed them multiple times a day. Feed your crab once daily in order to keep the fruits and veggies fresh.
Foods like wood will last considerably longer, so change the wood when you see it gets slimy, old, or otherwise unappetizing.

, Many new crab owners neglect to provide an adequate protein source or variety. Protein is important for maintaining a crab’s musculature, exoskeleton, and also for aiding in the processing of carbohydrates. More protein makes for a stronger crab.


You can select from a wide range of widely available protein sources like animal protein (turkey, unseasoned beef, duck), seafood (lobster, catfish, cuttlefish), or grubs (bloodworms, earthworms). You can even source some of these from your own yard (just dig up some worms after a fresh rain).
You should include a fresh protein source on a daily basis. Fresh in this case means that each day you’ll need to provide new food, replacing the old protein.
The protein sources you serve can be raw or cooked, including meat. Crabs do enjoy eating meat off of the bone, but they do not do well with sauces or butter. Make sure to exclude these. Seafood can also be served raw or steamed.

, Just because protein is essential for your hermit’s diet, it doesn’t mean you can’t treat the little fella from time to time. Aside from fruits and veggies, you can give your crab a little peanut butter as a treat. Just be sure to look at the ingredients so you can avoid extra sugars and other unwanted items.Natural peanut butter will be best. Honey, washed grass, trail mix, and popcorn are other favorable treats.

, While hermit crabs are omnivorous and eat just about anything, they may be some extra attention when it comes to ensuring they have a complete diet.


It’s important to supplement their food with calcium source. Give them calci-sand substrate, crushed oyster shell, or cuttlebones. Each of these is calcium rich, which will help shell maintenance and exoskeleton development. Neglecting this could lead to an unhealthy crab., Crabs are nocturnal so feed at night or in the evening. If you have trouble remembering, you can always set a timer. Better yet, make feeding time a part of your daily routine.


It’s strongly recommended that you remove the meat and seafood the following morning to avoid attracting flies and other pests.

, The dishes you choose will have a great impact on your crab’s well being.


Taller dishes won't allow your crabs to freely access their food. The optimal height for a food dish is one that is shallow.
Crabs are also sensitive to metals. Make sure you choose dishes made of plastic or ceramic.
The best type of dish will also be non-porous. The tiny imperfections in porous materials (stone, some plastics) permit the growth of bacteria and germs.

, Your little friend will need a place to drink, bathe, and play. Put a shallow dish a fresh water in the enclosure daily. Your crab will decide when and what quantity to drink.


You’ll need to treat any tap or bottled water with a water dechlorinator. This is crucial because hermit crabs are sensitive to chlorine and chloramines (a combination of chlorine and ammonia that affects their gills).If you have an Ecuadorian hermit crab (land crab), give it one bowl of fresh water and one bowl of salt water. These crabs require both types of water to keep their gills wet (yes, crabs have gills!). Without both salt and fresh water the gills dry out and the crab suffocates.

, The amount of moisture in the air directly affects the health of your tiny crab, so keep an eye on it. You should strive to maintain a level of about 70% humidity in your crab’s home. Keeping the environment humid only requires that you place a natural sponge inside of a dish of water in the enclosure, which helps disperse the moisture.Be sure to place the sponge in close proximity to the tank heater. This will ensure the water evaporates from the sponge.

, Make sure you keep on top of cleaning your crab’s enclosure, including the dishes.


You may notice a residue or film on the water dish. Even though this is a common, natural occurrence, you need to clean it off regularly. As an additional note, when you change the water, also clean other undesirables from crabitat, like crab feces. This will help reduce water contamination, as well as cut down on any odiferous emanations from the crab’s home.

Do not use mite spray on your crab or your crab’s tank.,
Keep the tank clean.,
Remove any spoiled food in the tank.,
Check your crab for mites on a daily basis.",How to Eliminate Mites from a Pet Hermit Crab Tank," To clean the tank, you first need to place your crab in a holding container so you can give the tank and the accessories a good clean. The container can be a clean plastic tub or bin. Your crab will likely run around the holding container while you clean his tank.You can leave a small bowl of dechlorinated water out and place it next to the holding container so it comes to room temperature. You can then use this bowl later to clean any mites on your pet so he is mite free when he goes back into his clean, mite free tank.;
, If you’d really like to make sure there are no mites left in the tank at all, you can use a small vacuum to suck out any mites in the tank. Do this before you wet the tank, as the vacuum will work better on a dry surface. Focus on the corners of the tank as this is where the mites tend to like to hang out.

, Once you have removed the accessories, you can wipe down the tank with a wet paper towel. Press down on the sides and bottom the tank to swish any mites and remove them. Make sure you do this in the corners of the tank, as this is often where the mites like to hide.You can also rinse the tank out with tap water to drown and wash away any mites still in the tank. Try to eliminate any black flecks in the tank so the tank is spotless and clean.

, Mites do not like direct sunlight, so once you rinse and wipe down the tank with plain water, you should let it dry completely in the sun.You can also let the tank dry indoors overnight. Once the tank is dry, you can place the sterilized tank accessories back into the tank.

, If you do not mind saying goodbye to your crab’s tank accessories, including any substrate on the floor of the tank such as sand, you can dispose of them. This is the easiest way to get rid of the mites in his tank, as this will ensure your crab’s tank does not contain any infected accessories or substrates.You should also throw away any toys that your crab played with in the tank, as these are likely also infested with mites.
Dispose of them by placing them in a garbage bag and removing the garbage bag to the garbage bin right away. This will prevent the mites from crawling back into the tank or from getting into other areas of your home.

, If you cannot afford to throw out the tank accessories, you can boil them to get rid of the mites and place them back in your crab’s tank. Use distilled water to boil any substrate, like gravel, any rocks, and any tank accessories for at least 20 minutes. This includes food dishes, extra shells, and climbing toys like coral. This will help to sterilize the accessories and get rid of the mites.Allow the accessories to cool before you place them back in the tank.

, Another option is to bake any substrate, such as sand, gravel, or pieces of wood, on a cookie sheet. Bake them for at least half an hour and allow them to cool before placing them back in the tank.If you are worried about burning pieces of wood in the oven, you can sterilize the wood in your microwave. Put them in the microwave for two minutes and keep an eye on the wood to ensure it does not catch fire.

, While the crab’s tank is drying, you should give him a good clean too so he does not bring mites back into the tank. Use room temperature dechlorinated water to give your crab a bath at least one to two times.Place your crab in the bowl of water. Turn your crab upside down to get all the air bubbles out of his shell. Then, pour the water off your crab into the bowl. The mites will drain off your crab along with the water. Pour out the mites in the water, down the drain of your sink. Do this once more or until all the mites on your crab are gone. Make sure there are no mites in your crab’s shell.
You can also use a paper towel to squish any of the mites on your crab gently and carefully. Draining, wiping, and rinsing your crab should all help to remove the mites.

, You can get mite specific medication for hermit crabs from a vet that specializes in arthropods or from an exotic pet supply store. This is a good option if you have tried the plain water method and the boiling method, but the mites still have not gone away., Commercial mite spray that is not specified for use on hermit crabs can hurt your crab. They should not be used on your crab or on the tank.You should also avoid using bleach solution to clean your crab and your crab’s tank. There is a high amount of chlorine in bleach that can blister your crab’s gills and make him ill.

, To prevent the mites from reappearing in your crab’s tank, you should give the tank a thorough weekly clean. To clean the tank effectively, you should remove your crab from the tank and place him in a holding container. You can then use the plain water method to clean the tank and boil or bake the tank contents to sterilize them.If you keep a sponge in your crab’s tank to boost the humidity, you should smell the sponge to ensure it smells clean and not rotten. If it smells rotten, you should replace it. You can also place the sponge in the microwave and nuke it for several minutes to kill any mites.
Clean the lid of the tank, if you have one, once a day to keep pests like mites from getting into the tank. You may want to consider taping down the lid of the tank to prevent dust and pests from floating into your crab’s tank.
Avoid keeping live plants near your crab’s tank, as plants can attract their own pests, including mites. The mites can then move from the live plant into your crab’s tank.

, Mites are often attracted by your crab’s food and can burrow into the food, such as dried shrimp and plankton-type crab food. You can try feeding your crab only dry food for a little while, as strong smelling wet foods or fresh foods can attract mites.You should also remove all crab droppings in the tank on a daily basis and replace your crab’s water in his water dishes to keep it clean.

, You should take some time every day to give your hermit crab a mite check up. Examine him in the light for any small moving specks on his shell or on other parts of his body.If you notice that he has any mites on his body, you should give him a full immersion bath in dechlorinated water and do a thorough cleaning of his tank and the tank contents. This is the only way to ensure the mites are eliminated from your crab and his tank, and have a lower chance of coming back.

Add some seashells.",How to Decorate Your Hermit Crab's Tank," are you giving it enough food? Is he moist? (He should be!);
, Are you giving it enough of the correct kinds of food? Land Hermit crabs require a varied diet that consists of all the nutrients needed to keep them happy and healthy. That also means that they will most likely hide the food that they don't finish between little cracks in your decorations or bury it in the substrate. Be aware that this can cause mold, which is very harmful to hermit crabs, so be sure to sweep through the substrate every few days to check for buried food/mold.

, Hermit crabs can't burrow in the glass floor or gravel.


The substrate doesn't have to be anything fancy. It can be moist (not dripping wet but sandcastle consistency), play sand, beach sand, Eco Earth (coconut fiber), or a combination of both sand and coconut fiber. Make sure the substrate is deep enough that your biggest crab can completely dig under and cover himself. Just remember to replace it when it gets dirty, or to save money you can bake the used substrate in the oven and heat it to sterilize it..

, Hermit crabs usually live in moist, warm climates. That is the type of climate that must be maintained in a crab habitat. Your tank should maintain a temperature of at least 75 °F (24 °C), but the best range would be between 78 and 82 degrees, Under tank heaters and aquarium hood or reptile cage hoods that have dual lights in them work to add extra heat to a habitat. Moisture can be maintained by misting the tank, adding wet sea sponges inside or outside of the water bowls. Buy a good thermometer/hygrometer set to place in the tank (about 1/2 to 2/3's up the tank wall). Monitor this and make sure you keep the temperature and humidity within the correct ranges.

, You can use just about anything that your crab can reach for a food dish, as long as it isn't metal (metal is bad to use in your tank). It is also recommended that you have two dishes/pools of water in the tank, one filled with dechlorinated salt water (which can be mixed using products found at pet stores such as Instant Ocean, some pet store will also sell pre-mixed sea water by the gallon). The other bowl should be filled with fresh dechlorinated water. You can purchase a tap water dechlorinator at any pet store, which will remove all heavy metals, chlorine and chemicals from your tap water. A few drops will dechlorinate a large amount of water , so one bottle should last for quite a while. Make sure that the pools are deep enough so that your largest crab can immerse themselves, but make sure there are glass stones and a sponge in each bowl to make sure smaller crabs can get out easily to make sure they don't get stuck and possibly drown.

, Make sure they're clean by boiling the rocks and microwaving the wood before placing the items in your tank. Also, NEVER put any pine woods in, as this is harmful to the crabs.

, If you put them in, the crabs will eat them. But if you want them to stay, put fake Silk plants in there. If you do want your crabs to eat the plants, be sure they're hermie friendly.

, Have at least three correctly sized shells per crab in the tank. Even if they don't try them on, the shells will become ""toys,"" as your crabs will drag them around and climb them. Be sure they're clean, though. Boil them in dechlorinated water to make sure they're safe.

"
"
Set up a pot full of water (the hotter the water, the faster the boiling begins).

,
Place the pot on the stove.,
Do not allow the shells to boil for less than 26 minutes or more than an hour.

,
For best results, boil shells for 45 minutes.,
Remove the shells from the pot and set them out for an hour.

,
Once this is done you may place them in the tank.

",How to Clean a Sea Shell (for Hermit Crabs)2,", The stove top should be on HIGH.


Adding the shells is about the easiest step to both ways.

, You should also wipe away any dirt or grime from a hermit crab's dishes. Make sure to use dechlorinated water here as well. Then, place them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will remove any bacteria from the dishes.Make sure the water you use is dechlorinated.
Set the dishes aside to cool and dry. Wait until they're cool to the touch before returning them to the tank.

, You want to make sure you rinse anything you've cleaned thoroughly. Once again, use dechlorinated water.If you used bleach solution on the toys, make sure to rinse them until they no longer smell like bleach., Use a clean rag or paper towel. Run it along the sides of the tank until they're completely dry. You should not re-add anything to the tank until you have it completely dry., Food and water bowls should also be dried off before returning them to the tank. Use a clean rag or paper towel to gently rub toys and supplies until they are completely dry. Then, return the supplies to the tank., You will want to replace the substrate that was scooped out. Pour a fresh layer of substrate over the old substrate.If it's been a few months since you last changed the substrate, make sure to change it completely instead of just adding a fresh layer.

, You can now safely return your crabs to the tank. Remember to grip them underneath the armpits using your thumb and index finger. This will prevent the crabs from biting or pinching."

Make a list of your pet’s symptoms so that you can relay these to the doctor., When some puppies know that they are sick, they may try to run away from home because they have a natural instinct to hide in order to stay safe from predators while in a weakened state. Keep your puppy safe and inside so that it is not tempted to flee., Put together a comfortable bed for your puppy and try to lure it to the bed using treats or toys. Your puppy will likely be eager to rest if it is feeling ill.

, Try to calm your dog with a soft voice and soothing words. Your puppy takes its cues from you, so stay calm and reassure your puppy that it will be okay. They will pick up on your loving tone and will feel more at ease.

, Encourage your pet to drink water, as this will help to ease their stomach. However, drinking too much at once could have a negative effect on your puppy, so monitor its water intake. If your puppy is unable to swallow water without vomiting, contact your veterinarian right away.

, If your puppy is able to eat, feed it white meat, such as boiled chicken or boiled fish (cod or coley), with white rice. You should give your pet one cup of food per 10 pounds of weight each day.

Breathing difficulties
Seizures that don’t stop within one minute
Inability to urinate
Swellings around its face, eyes or throat
Loss of movement in the rear legs

, Look up the number for a local pet doctor either online or in the phone book. Clearly specify what you have observed the puppy's symptoms to be, and express your worries. It’s a great plan to choose an animal hospital that’s been accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), especially if there is a chance that your puppy may be seriously ill.


Sometimes, the veterinarian will know immediately what is wrong with your dog, so they may tell you over the phone to ease your concern. However, sometimes they will not be sure until they check the puppy in person.

, Ask for the soonest available appointment, and agree upon a meeting time. Take note of the agreed-upon appointment so that you do not forget. Try to be patient, since although your puppy's sickness is your number-one concern, the doctor may have a full schedule of appointments already. If you're worried, ask what you should do for your dog in the time leading up to the appointment.

, Due to its discomfort or pain, your puppy may be reluctant to get into the car with you. Some dogs also get anxious about visiting the veterinarian or about meeting new people.

Attempt to find the owner.,
Take the dog to a veterinarian.,
Take steps to protect yourself from rabies.,
Make sure that you get the appropriate vaccinations.,
Talk to your vet about any emotional or behavioral problems your new dog might have.",How to Care for a Neglected Dog1," If you find a stray dog with no tags, take the dog to a veterinarian or a rescue shelter to have the dog scanned for the presence of a microchip. These chips register dogs in the event that they escape their homes, are lost, or are abandoned.Some stray dogs have accidentally become separated or lost from their owner, and they are actually a much loved family pet. In these cases, reuniting the pet with their owner is definitely the right thing to do, no matter how much you have fallen in love with the stray.


It might also turn out that the dog is chipped but the owner has deliberately dumped him. Identifying the owner via the chip could allow the authorities to prosecute the owner for neglect.;
, If you’ve just acquired a stray dog, be sure to take him to visit a veterinarian as soon as possible. It is important for you to be as informed as possible about your new canine companion. Your vet will be able to distinguish between a dog that’s recently gotten dirty and a dog that’s been neglected to the point of becoming filthy. Your vet will also be able to tell if the dog has been a victim of animal cruelty, physical abuse, and/or extreme neglect.


The vet will look for any signs of ill health which could explain the animal's poor state, as well as assess cuts or injuries, and advise you as to what treatment is necessary to fix these problems.
If you got the dog from a shelter, you can also direct many of your questions towards them. They may have records on the original owners of the dog.

, Even if the dog you are caring for does not seem rabid when you take him in, it is possible that he has rabies and may begin to show signs after several days. There is no way to be sure about whether or not a dog is rabid, other than to biopsy its brain, which requires waiting until the animal dies or euthanizing it. Do not attempt to catch a dog that seems aggressive or that is acting in a strange way. Call animal control to catch the dog.If you are determined to care for the animal, talk to your veterinarian about testing its blood for the presence of rabies antibodies. This test will not distinguish between actual rabies and a rabies vaccine, but if it is negative you will know that the dog has not been infected or vaccinated.

, Canine parvovirus, distemper, canine hepatitis, and rabies are considered core vaccines by the American Animal Hospital Association’s Task Force. Every country has a similar list of “core” vaccines that you should give your dog. Ask your veterinarian about mandatory and non-mandatory vaccines to consider.Get a rabies vaccination. Cases of canine rabies in the US each are uncommon, just in case the animal becomes rabid and bites you.If you already have a dog, make sure your dog isn't in contact with the one you adopted until the stray has had its vaccinations and its behavior is stable.

, Emotional pain is often obvious to a veterinarian who has experience dealing with neglected animals.If the previous owner of your dog terrorized, taunted, isolated, abandoned, or over-pressured your dog, a vet will be able to help you identify the signs.For example, a rejected dog may be either attention-hungry or excessively independent.

Isolated seizure that lasts less than one minute
Occasional vomiting and diarrhea lasting longer than one day
Fever
Lethargy lasting longer than one day
Not eating for more than one day
Difficulty defecating
Limping or acting painful
Excessive drinking
Swelling that comes on gradually
Lumps or bumps that suddenly appear or current ones that grow
Any other odd symptom or behavior (shivering or whimpering)

, For puppies and dogs older than 6 months who have previously been healthy, you can withhold all food for up to 24 hours if the primary symptoms are vomiting or diarrhea.


This also includes treats and rawhides.

, Never withhold water from a sick dog, unless he vomits it up. If this happens, contact your veterinarian for advice.

, After you withhold food for 24 hours, and your dog is behaving more normally, you can gradually introduce a bland diet for 1-2 days. A bland diet for a dog includes one part easily digested protein and 2 parts an easily digested starch.


Typical protein sources include cottage cheese or chicken (no skin or fat) or boiled hamburger.
A good starch is plain cooked white rice.Feed your dog one cup daily (split into 4 servings 6 hours apart) per 10 pounds of weight.

, Make sure your dog gets plenty of rest by restricting how much exercise and play time he gets. Take him out on a leash to relieve himself, but don’t let him play while he feels poorly. This is especially important if he is limping.

, Pay attention to how much your dog is defecating and urinating while he is ill. If you normally let him outside by himself, use a leash while he’s ill so that you can watch how much he urinates or defecates.


Do not punish your dog if it has an accident inside the house—stool, urine or vomiting. They cannot help it if they are sick and may hide from you if they are punished.

, Make sure you keep a very close eye on your dog, in case the symptoms get worse. Do not leave your dog on his own. Do not leave him alone for the day or weekend. If you must leave the house (for example, you need to go to work), have someone check on your dog every 2 hours.

, If you’re unsure about your dog’s symptoms, or if he seems to be getting worse, call your vet for advice.

, Don’t leave the dog outside or in the garage. The dog may have trouble regulating its temperature and you won’t be able to close observe it for a change in symptoms.

, Provide a dog bed with blankets in a spot where you can easily and frequently monitor your dog. Choose blankets with your scent on them so that your dog will feel comforted.


It’s a good idea to choose a spot with easily cleaned floors, such as in a bathroom or kitchen. Then, if your dog vomits or has an accident, you can clean it up easily and quickly.

, While your dog is sick, keep the sound down and lights low. Think about how you like the environment when you are sick. Your dog will appreciate similar ambience. Limit visitors and noise from vacuums, children, and the television. This will allow your dog to get the rest he needs.

, It is a good idea to keep your sick dog away from other dogs. This will help prevent any transmission of diseases. This quiet time will also give your dog some time to rest.

, Foods that are safe for humans can be deadly to dogs. Products like xylitol are especially dangerous for dogs. This is present in sugar-free foods and tooth care products.


Other toxic foods include bread dough, chocolate, avocados, alcohol, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, and other foods., Never give your dog human medication unless you have checked with your veterinarian. These medications can be toxic to dogs and they may make illnesses worse.

, Always monitor your dog when he is outside. Keep potentially toxic substances out of his reach. These can include pesticides, antifreeze, fertilizers, prescription medications, insecticides and other items.These items can be poisonous and potentially lethal to a dog.

Consult your veterinarian.,
Make sure your dog stays warm.,
Know how your vet will treat distemper.",How to Care for Dogs with Distemper1," The first sign of distemper in dogs is eye-discharge that can be watery to pus-like. Your dog may also develop a fever or a cough, have nasal discharge, become lethargic, vomit, have a reduced appetite, and diarrhea.Later symptoms may include neurological problems like seizures, twitching, and partial or complete paralysis. However, these symptoms may show up earlier in puppies.
A dog's normal temperature ranges from 99.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common signs of a fever in dogs are red eyes, lack of energy, warm ears, warm, dry nose, shivering, loss of appetite, coughing, and vomiting.;
, If you suspect that your dog is either sick or coming down with distemper, make sure to separate your dog from any other pets you own. Distemper is very contagious, and dogs usually become infected through airborne exposure. Healthy dogs can also become infected through secondhand contact, such as contact with the infected dog's toys, water and food bowls, and bedding.Place your dog’s bed, toys, food and water bowls in a separate room. While treating your dog, confine your dog to this room to decrease contact with other pets. If you need to let your dog out, make sure your other pets are in a separate room.

, If you identify early signs of distemper in your dog, contact your veterinarian immediately. Let the office know that you are worried your dog might be developing a case of distemper. This way, the vet can see your dog immediately. Your veterinarian will administer routine blood tests to rule out any other possibilities, and to confirm that it is distemper.


Call the office and say, ""Hi, this is Kristen. I am very worried that my dog might have distemper. My dog is showing signs of eye and nasal discharge, and I cannot get it to eat food or drink water. I would like to see the vet immediately. When can I come in?""

, When your dog is sick, it is important to keep it warm, especially if it has a fever and chills. Provide your dog with extra blankets to keep your dog warm. You can also fill a hot water bottle with hot water to provide extra warmth.Wrap the hot water bottle with a cloth and place it underneath your dog’s blankets near its body.

, Unfortunately, there is no cure for distemper. Therefore, treatment usually consists of supportive care, and efforts to control symptoms associated with distemper, such as dehydration, vomiting and diarrhea, and neurological problems.Your vet will prescribe medications that can control vomiting, diarrhea, and seizures, and administer fluids if your dog becomes severely dehydrated.

Consider getting the dog professionally groomed.,
Remove any parasites.,
Take a look at your dog's teeth.",How to Care for a Neglected Dog2," Some neglected dogs will only need a bath and a bit of brushing, but many neglected dogs are severely matted. Severely matted fur often requires sedation in order to clip away the matted coat. This is because these mats are so tight to the skin that it is painful for the dog to have them removed. In addition, the dog needs to keep very still or the skin could accidentally be cut.Talk to your veterinarian if the dog has matted fur and needs to be sedated to remove the mats.

, If the dog is nervous or even a little aggressive, get a closed-end muzzle for the dog. Then, brush or comb the dog to remove any parasites, preferably outdoors. If the vet administered a spot-on treatment like Frontline, don't bathe the dog for at least 48 hours. Follow any other instructions your vet gave you to combat fleas and worms.To remove ticks, collect the following: rubbing alcohol, tweezers, and paper towels. Settle the pup down and rub the alcohol on the ticks, then start plucking those nasty ticks off of him. Be sure to dig the entire head of the tick out as well, because the tick may still survive. The dog may whine or wiggle if you hurt it, so soothe the animal by speaking softly and petting it., Dogs have powerful bacteria in their mouths, but depending on your dog's health or previous living situation, it may need to have its teeth cleaned. In general, vets say dogs should have their teeth cleaned at home weekly.They may also benefit from a professional cleaning now and then. How often your dog should go for a professional cleaning depends on the dog. Ask your vet for their recommendation.Pet stores sell doggie toothbrushes and toothpastes that taste good to dogs. In order to brush your dog's teeth, restrain them (most likely between your legs). Hold their head with your left arm and open their mouth with your left hand. Then brush in a circular motion with you right hand.Give them a treat afterwards. Eventually, they'll learn to love their at-home doggie dental appointments.

Feed it.,
Give your dog a place to sleep.,
Consider your dog’s bathroom needs.",How to Care for a Neglected Dog3," A neglected dog is almost always a hungry dog. If you found the dog, then offer the dog water to drink, and if he is thin or emaciated, offer him a small amount to eat. Chose something bland such as boiled white rice. Giving a full sized meal or rich food is likely to upset the dog's stomach when he isn't used to eating. In the short term, feed little and often, such as 4 - 6 small meals spaced through the day. This allows the stomach to get used to having food in it.


An emaciated or thin dog needs building up, but do this slow over the weeks and months to come. Aim to give 2 to 4 meals a day of good quality food. Avoid foods that are high in cereal content (cereal is listed first on the food label) as this is harder to digest as it ferments in the gut, which is likely to cause stomach upsets.Chose a good quality food that is age appropriate (puppy food for juniors, adult food for adults). Look on the food label and chose one that list actual meat as the top ingredients (as opposed to meat meal, which is processed organ and offal)., Provide a soft blanket in a quiet corner and leave the animal alone to rest. It is best to restrict the dog to one room so that he isn't overwhelmed. Provide him with a bed, and praise him when he uses it to help him realize this is his space.


It is best to restrict the dog to one room so that he isn't overwhelmed. Provide him with a bed, and praise him when he uses it to help him realize this is his space. At this stage you may not know if he is house trained or not, so put puppy pads by the door just in case.
When the dog wakes, give him a chance to go into the yard for a toilet break. Likewise take him out immediately after eating and about half an hour later as food in the stomach stimulates the bowel to move.

, A stray dog may not be house-trained. Do not punish the dog for going potty inside, as this may further damage the animal's already nervous disposition. Watch the dog's habits and bring it outside every few hours, allowing it enough time to sniff around, get acquainted with the area, and then do its business.

Give meals at the same time, let him out to go potty, and take him for walks at a predictable time each day. Here is a sample schedule that might help you: :7:00am: wake up and let dog outside
8:00am: feed dog breakfast
8:30am: let dog outside
1:00pm: let dog outside
5:00pm: let dog outside
7:00pm: feed dog dinner
7:30pm: take dog for a walk
9:00pm: let dog outside
10:00pm: bedtime

, A dog that has just been neglected needs a loving and responsible pack. Make it feel loved and let it know that you will care for his future needs. Loving the dog doesn't mean that he should be given free rein to do what he wants. He actually appreciates the security of having someone in charge and will thrive when given kind guidance.


Pet your dog regularly. Do so carefully. Many neglected dogs will be hand shy. It may even respond violently, if it has been the victim of physical abuse. Until you understand your dog’s temperament be gentle and very careful, but make sure to pet him every day. By making physical contact with your dog, he’ll learn to trust you and will be comforted by this contact., Remember that dogs are social creatures by nature and they love to play. Play is a great way to bond with the animal and to help it get the exercise it needs. Play is also a great way to teach your dog how to behave around you. Pick out a variety of toys like tennis balls, pull toys, squeak toys, and frisbees. Take the dog outside and let it run around with these toys., Once your dog has regained his health, you can start to train him in basic obedience. If the dog is not trained, then be patient and never chastise him for getting things wrong or being disobedient. Ignore puddles or accidents - and instead praise what he does right. Start by teaching simple such as essential commands such as ""sit"".


Try “click-and-treat-training”. In this type of training, the pet is empowered by having the opportunity to find a way to make you click and thus receive a reward. Once pets figure out how the game is played, they may prefer the “game” over the reward. Tell your dog to “come” and click. Do this repeatedly. Then try just clicking and see if the dog comes."

Evaluate the situation carefully.,
Approach the person if you think that they may be neglecting their dog.,
Report the person to the proper authorities if you suspect neglect.",How to Care for a Neglected Dog5," If you are suspicious that a dog owner may be neglecting his dog, be sure that you understand the situation before you try to do anything. Look for signs that the dog is being neglected. There are some obvious signs of neglect to be on the lookout for:


No shelter
Collar too tight
Lack of grooming
Mange (missing hair, body covered in sores)
Starvation, It is important to be tactful when approaching someone who you suspect is neglecting their dog or you may make the situation worse. You might offend the person or even worse, that person may take out their aggression on their dog. Bring the subject up in casual conversation and don’t accuse them of neglect. Say things like, “I’ve noticed your dog spends a lot of time outside” or ask “how’s your dog doing? He’s such a pretty dog.” Don’t put the person on the offensive.Try to understand their situation before you jump to any conclusions. Poor dog care resulting from poverty is different than malice.
Figure out how you can best help the dog. You may offer to lend a helping hand. You could offer to walk or play with the dog when the owner isn’t around. Or you may need to contact the authorities.

, It is important to report a dog owner who you suspect is neglecting their dog, but the prosecution process can take time. Keep in mind that animal cruelty officers do their best to respond to reports as quickly as possible, but they get a lot of complaints.You can dial 911 and ask to speak with the animal cruelty officer. Contact the Humane Society of the United States at 1-866-720-2676 or a similar agency in your country."

Clean the wound.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Dilute your disinfectant.,
Apply the disinfectant.,
Cover the wound with antibacterial ointment.,
Place an absorbent pad on the wound.,
Wrap the injured paw and protect it from additional injury.",How to Care for a Dog's Torn Paw Pad2," Gently rinse the foot under lukewarm water, or fill a bucket with clean warm water and submerge the paw. Submerging the paw is helpful for washing out any debris that may be in the area. If necessary, you can use tweezers to remove any debris., If your dog’s paw continues to bleed after you have removed any debris and washed the wound, use a clean bandage or cloth to apply light pressure to the area until the bleeding stops.If you cannot control the bleeding after 5 minutes of continuous pressure, seek veterinary care.Lying the dog down and elevating the injured paw will help slow the bleeding.

, You will need to apply an antiseptic like povidone-iodine (e.g., Betadine, Pyodine, and Wokadine) to kill any germs near the wound. Applying the antiseptic at full strength, however, can burn your dog’s paw. Diluting to a solution of one part povidone-iodine to 10 parts warm water is suggested. It will appear to be the color of weak tea., Once any blood and debris are removed and the wound has been cleaned, swab the area with a cotton ball saturated in the diluted povidone-iodine solution and allow the area to air dry.

, You can either use a salve designed for humans, such as bacitracin (e.g., Neosporin) or one developed specifically for dogs (Vetericyn). The antibacterial ointment will help prevent infection and is safe if your dog happens to lick it., The first layer on the wound should be sterilized and nonstick. It should be large enough to cover the entire injury. Some good brands for non-adhering dressing pads include Telfa and Medtronic. You can find them at most pharmacies and some grocery stores or convenience stores.

, Lightly wrap the absorbent pad and the foot pad with a self-adhering bandage designed for animals (such as Vertrap, Pet-Flex, or Pet Wrap). Leave the front toes out, and wrap the paw up to the wrist joint. The claws of the paw should be nearly touching. If the claws are separated or if the foot feels cold, you have tied the bandage too tight. Remove and try again.This will not only protect the injury from being infected, it will also offer additional cushioning for the foot pad.
Be sure the pressure is appropriate for your dog; you don’t want to cut off his circulation. The wrapping should be snug enough that it stays on their foot but loose enough that you can place two fingers under the bandaging. Tying the bandage too tight can cut off the blood supply to the paw and may even cause limb death. Call your vet if you are worried about tying the bandage too tightly.

"
"
Change the bandage daily.,
Stop your dog from licking or chewing at the bandages.,
Use a dog boot when going outside.,
Reassess the situation after a few days.,
Treat infection promptly.",How to Care for a Dog's Torn Paw Pad3," Until your dog’s paw is healed, you will need to replace the wound dressing each day, or more often if there is additional bleeding or seepage. Since dogs sweat from their paws, you will need to keep a close eye on the bandage to ensure it stays dry and clean., Dogs may try to lick or remove the gauze and bandage, and this will lengthen the time it takes for the wound to heal. Additionally, it could lead to infection. You can use a taste deterrent, such as bitter apple spray, on the outside of the bandages to dissuade your dog from licking or chewing on it.


If the taste deterrent doesn’t work, you may have to use an E-collar, the lampshade-shaped collar that restricts movement, for a few days., Even though your dog is injured, he will still need to go out for a walk or potty break occasionally. To further protect your dog’s paw and to keep the recovery on track, use a dog boot to cover the wound and bandages when going outside.

, If, after three days of treatment, the wound continues to bleed or opens up, take your dog to a veterinarian for further treatment., An infected paw can cause long-term problems if not treated quickly. During the healing process, look for swelling or redness in the paw pad, which may indicate an infection. When changing your dog’s bandages, a foul odor or moist discharge could also be signs of an infection. Another sign of possible infection is if your dog suddenly seems to be in more pain or even refuses to walk. If any of these occur, consult your veterinarian immediately."

Inspect your dog’s paws after being outdoors.,
Keep your yard clean.,
Pay attention to the weather.,
Moisturize your dog’s pads to keep them in good condition.,
Prevent overuse injuries.",How to Care for a Dog's Torn Paw Pad4," After outdoor time, make sure no debris is lodged in the dog’s paw that can cause problems or tears. Clean in between your dog’s toes for pebbles, seeds, and other debris that can irritate and cut them. You can remove these with tweezers.You can also have a bucket of water nearby to quickly rinse the dog’s paws when he comes inside.It is a good idea to be proactive regarding caring for your dog’s paws. If you catch an issue early, it will be easier to treat.

, Not all injuries can be avoided, but you can do some simple things to help keep your pet healthy. One is to check your yard for broken glass, small pebbles, or metal to make sure none of these can get lodged into your dog’s paws. Preventing injuries is much easier than treating them., Your dog’s paws are sensitive to extreme weather conditions. Hot pavement can burn your dog’s pads, and snow, ice, and salt can be equally damaging. When it’s extremely hot outside, try to take your dog out before dawn or after sundown to avoid heat-related blisters or irritations on your dog’s pads.Dog boots or foot wax can help protect his paws in cold or snowy weather.

, You can help keep your dog’s pads healthy and strong by moisturizing them and preventing them from becoming cracked and dry. Be sure to use a pad moisturizer designed for dogs, as human products are not good for them. Your vet can recommend one.Or, you can massage them with vitamin E., Just like human athletes, dogs need time to get their bodies used to a new fitness routine. If you take up hiking or running, gradually acclimate your dog and his paws to this new activity to prevent chafing or cracking."
"
Know the symptoms of dehydration.,
Monitor your dog’s water and food intake.,
Rehydrate your dog with a syringe.,
Liquefy your dog’s meals.,
Administer appetite-stimulating medication.",How to Care for Dogs with Distemper2," Symptoms of dehydration are reduced skin elasticity, pale and dry gums, sunken eyes, concentrated urine, lethargy, and increased heart rate.Check skin elasticity by lifting the skin between your dog’s shoulder blades. If the skin slowly springs back or stays lifted, then your dog is dehydrated to severely dehydrated.
If your dog is severely dehydrated, take it to the vet immediately. The vet can administer fluids intravenously.

, If you notice that your dog’s water bowl is still full after an hour or two, try placing the water bowl in front of your dog. If your dog refuses to drink, then you will need to administer fluids manually. A dog should be drinking one ounce of water for each pound of body weight. If your dog weighs 20 pounds (9.07 kg), then it should be drinking at least 20 ounces (567 grams) of water a day.A loss of appetite is another symptom of distemper. If your dog will not eat its regular, dry food, then try feeding your dog softer, canned food. Additionally, you can try feeding your dog baby food, particularly the meats.
If the dog is vomiting, then do not feed him.

, If your dog refuses to drink water, you will need to rehydrate your dog manually with a syringe. You can buy a syringe from a pet supply store. Fill the syringe with water. If your dog will not open its mouth, it is ok. Just lift your dog’s lip and administer the water near the back part of the jaw and near the gums. Your dog will reflexively swallow the water.You will need to give your dog one cup of water per 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of body weight every two to three hours.
If your dog is also vomiting, give the water gradually in the beginning, for example, one or two tablespoons every 15 minutes.

, If your dog will not eat canned food, you will need to liquefy your dog’s food and administer it with a syringe. You can liquefy canned food by blending it with water and/or milk. To make the food more appealing, you can add small amounts of smelly foods, such as liverwurst, or chicken and beef liver.You can also feed your dog nourishing liquids, like plain chicken broth (without onions and spices). Chicken broth not only provides nutrients, but it will also hydrate your dog.

, Appetite-stimulating medication will increase your dog’s appetite. Consult your veterinarian before administering these medications. Your vet will be able to diagnose the severity of your dog’s inappetence, and prescribe an appropriate medication.

Recognize the symptoms of an oncoming seizure.,
Stay calm.,
Move sharp objects away from your dog.,
Offer your dog comfort when it is over.,
Contact your veterinarian.",How to Care for Dogs with Distemper3," After your dog has recovered from respiratory signs, sickness, and diarrhea, your dog might develop neurological problems like seizures, twitching, and paralysis. A common symptom of an oncoming seizure in your dog is an aura. If your dog is experiencing an aura, you will notice a change in your dog’s behavior. This period can last for seconds or hours.For example, your dog may become more vocal, like whining or barking, shy away at nothing, become nervous, or salivate.

, If your dog is beginning to seize or experience auras, do not stress out. Instead, talk to your dog in a soothing, reassuring voice. This will comfort both you and your dog.You can say for example, “It’s ok. I’m here. I won’t let anything bad happen to you. I will be right next to you.” While you are saying this, reassure your dog by petting it.

, Your dog will not be able to control its movements during a seizure. Therefore, remove potentially sharp or dangerous objects away from your dog to prevent it from hurting itself. Also, do not put your hand in your dog’s mouth to hold down its tongue. Your dog could accidentally bite you if you do this.Time the duration of the seizure with a watch or your phone. This will be important information that you can report to your vet. If the seizures last a long time, this can be very dangerous.

, When the episode is over, comfort your dog immediately. Your dog will be confused and disoriented. Comfort your dog by petting it and talking to it in a soothing voice. Have your dog lie down in its bed to prevent it from walking and bumping into things.Say in a soothing voice, ""You're ok. I am here for you. You'e a good girl. Everything will be ok. Don't worry.""

, Tell your vet that your dog just had a seizure. They will most likely ask you to bring your dog into the office. Relate to your vet what happened during the seizure and how long it lasted. A long seizure is a seizure that lasts for one minute or longer. Your vet may prescribe a medication, or discuss other options to prevent any future seizures.You can say, ""Hi, Janice. My dog had a seizure yesterday afternoon around 2:30 p.m. Before the actual seizure, my dog began to act frightened and confused. She was whimpering. By the time I went over to see what was up, she had collapsed on her side. While on her side, her feet were moving in a circular motion. This went on for about six to eight seconds. Afterwards, she seemed very confused.""

Schedule an initial checkup with your vet.,
Seek recommendations for a trustworthy veterinarian.,
Contact potential veterinarians.,
Trust the vet to do their job.,
Allow your vet to do lab tests.",How to Check the Health of a New Dog1," If you already have a vet you know and trust, take your dog to see them without delay. Catching any potential infections as early as possible is vital to your new dog’s survival. This step is especially important if your new dog is a puppy. Early diagnosis of a viral infection of another contagious disease can save your new dog’s life., If this is your first dog, it is worth seeking referrals or doing some research of your own. Ask friends and family where they take their pets for veterinary care.Keep in mind that different veterinarians will have different levels of experience and philosophies.Local dog shelters and breeders are great places to ask someone about local vets.
The American Animal Hospital Association’s website is a good resource to help locate the options in your area.

, Reach out to a veterinarian office you’re considering and ask to speak with a vet or assistant. Ask them a few questions to see if they provide thoughtful responses. Since you’ll potentially be trusting them with the health of your dog, it’s important that they actually care about your concerns.For example, ask the vet about their experience with your dog’s breed, their perspectives on things like vaccinations and medications, their services, and payment policies.If a veterinarian is rude or impatient with your questions, it’s likely best to look elsewhere for your dog’s medical treatment.

, One of the reasons it’s so important to choose a good veterinarian is that you want to be sure they give your dog thorough check-ups. When meeting a new dog, these check-ups can be extensive.Be sure to use an appropriate dog carrier to safely transport your dog to the vet, or keep them on a leash.
The vet will check your dog’s heart and lungs, eyes, mouth, ears, abdomen, and limbs. They’ll be looking for any signs of congenital issues, infections, and developmental concerns.
The first exam your dog receives is especially important. Future evaluations will depend on a good initial check-up to determine your dog’s normal skin, fur, and body conditions, as well as behavior and other health indicators.

, Blood, urine and fecal (to check for worms and parasites) tests will allow your veterinarian to get a much better read on your dog’s health. In particular, these tests can tell you and your vet whether the dog’s organs are functioning fully, if they have an infection that has not yet led to symptoms, and if their immune system is in good shape.While an physical examination can tell your vet a good amount about your dog’s health, blood tests in particular provide more thorough and more certain information.
Initial blood tests are also important to provide baseline blood values. This can help your vet diagnose potential diseases or other issues later in the dog’s life.

Keep your dog rested for two weeks.,
Put up ramps and stair-gates to keep him off his leg.,
After two weeks, take short, 5-minute walks twice a day.,
Give your pup NSAIDs, like Metacam.,
Carefully consider giving your dog aspirin.,
Much like aspirin, carefully consider paracetamol as a pain reliever.,
Consider putting your pup on a diet.,
Take your dog swimming.,
Keep him off linoleum or laminate flooring.,
Learn what a torn ACL looks like.,
Take your dog to the vet for a proper diagnosis.,
Carefully consider surgery.,
Rest assured that most animals can and will recover normally with time.",How to Care for a Dog with a Torn ACL," A dog with a torn ACL will redistribute his weight onto his remaining three legs, which places extra strain on them. He is therefore less mobile and needs to be rested.


For the first two weeks this means strict rest to let the initial inflammation in the joint settle down. Keep your dog from jumping on furniture or into the car, and stop him from using stairs. He should not be walked at all, and when he goes outside to the toilet he should be kept on a lead in case he runs off, chasing whatever he sees in his periphery.;
, Part of caring for a dog with a torn ACL is making sure he rests. To stop him going upstairs, try putting a child's safety gate across the bottom of the staircase. Likewise, try to avoid having your dog jump up or down to and from the car. For large dogs that are too big to carry, invest in a collapsible ramp for him to walk up and down.


Move his things as necessary. If his room is upstairs, make a temporary, make-shift spot for him downstairs so he can feel more comfortable and have a space all his own. This will help him ease into this new, more confined routine.

, The principle here is not to overstress his good legs and to give the injured leg time to heal. He must be kept on a lead because running or chasing places a strain on the joints and could disrupt the tissue healing.


By resting the dog you are waiting for fibrous tissue to bridge the ends of the torn ligament and this scar tissue eventually stabilizes the joint. Some of the surgical procedures, such as the de Angelis suture, provide temporary stabilization whilst scar tissue forms, and it is this fibrous tissue that eventually provides permanent stability.

, A torn ACL is a painful condition and moderate pain relief through medication can be incredibly helpful to your dog. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have a high safety margin (when used correctly), provide a good level of pain relief and are safe for long term use. NSAIDs commonly prescribed by vets are meloxicam (Metacam), carprofen (Rimadyl), and robenacoxib (Onsior).


The maintenance dose of metacam is 0.05mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. The oral suspension contains 1.5mg/ml; a typical 30kg Lab requires 1ml daily on his food.
NSAIDs are prescription drugs that reduce inflammation and dull pain by inhibiting the COX-2 enzymes that mediate inflammation within joints. They also having fewer effects on the COX-1 enzymes that maintain blood flow to the stomach and kidneys. Because of this, these drugs are less likely to cause the potentially serious side effect of gastric ulceration and have a higher safety margin than drugs such as aspirin or paracetamol.

, In a healthy, well-hydrated dog, aspirin has a place if no other pain relief is available – especially if your vet gives you the okay. The recommended dose is 10mg/kg given twice a day, with or after food. Aspirin commonly comes in 300mg tablets, so a typical dose for a 30kg Labrador would be one tablet twice a day with food.


Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) can provide mild to moderate pain relief, but long term use can be associated with side effects such as gastric ulceration. This is because the aspirin reduces the blood supply to the stomach, gut lining, and kidneys. The side effects are minimized if given with or after food.
Aspirin should never be given to a dog on steroids or on NSAID medication. This is because the combined drugs are even more potent and will more likely cause gastric ulceration, with possibly fatal consequences.

, A veterinary approved prescription is preferred, but if no other pain relief is available, it is acceptable to give your dog paracetamol with food, as long as care is taken to observe the correct dosage.


The dose is 10mg/kg by mouth, twice a day, with or after food. Most tablets are 500mg and so a 30kg Labrador can take a maximum of three-fifths of a tablet twice daily. If in doubt, always give a lower dose and for small dogs, consider using the pediatric suspension.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) provides mild to moderate pain relief. Overdose causes liver damage by overloading the liver with a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-aminobenzoquinonimine. Great care should be taken not to exceed the recommended dose or liver failure could result.

, It is possible the ACL tore because of extra weight causing additional strain on the ligament. Also, a dog with one torn cruciate is at risk of tearing the ligament in the opposite leg, because he is putting all his weight on three legs rather than four. Thus, losing weight is important to increase his mobility in general but also to decrease strain on his other joints.


Putting an overweight pet on a diet is an essential part of caring for him. Talk to your vet about what's appropriate for your pup as each dog will require a different diet regimen. While you're discussing how much he should be eating, ask about what foods to feed him, too. Your vet may be able to recommend a special diet while he's healing.

, Swimming is excellent non-weight bearing exercise that will help keep your pup's muscles toned and give him mental stimulation as it's not likely it's something he does often. After the initial period of strict rest and lead walks, if the dog is showing signs of improvement, then two or three hydrotherapy sessions a week can help improve his muscle tone and keep joints supple.


This is another issue that's wise to ask your vet about. You don't want your dog over-exerting himself and ruining what progress he's made. Your vet will know if his ACL has healed enough for this to be an appropriate part of his healing regimen.

, When caring for a dog with a torn ACL it is important that he walks on surfaces with good grip. The enemy of any dog with mobility issues is linoleum or laminate flooring because they are slippery. The last thing you want is a dog who is struggling on three legs to slip and cause himself an additional sprain or strain.


If necessary, cover your linoleum or laminate flooring with non-slip rugs. Don't be tempted to use towels or blankets – those will just slip and slide over the floor, potentially worsening the likelihood of slipping.

, The main symptom of a torn ACL is that of a hind limb lameness – that is, he'll be limping on the injured leg. Your suspicions should be increased if your dog has a painful or swollen knee that came on after physical exertion, such as chasing a Frisbee or jumping up wildly.


However, don't diagnose your pup yourself. It's always best to get a professional's opinion.

, While checking your pup's ACL, your veterinarian will need to check the dog for other problems such as fractures, dislocations or a sprain, too. It's possible a torn ACL is just a fraction of the problem.


Your vet will probably suggest sedating your pup in order to perform an ""anterior draw"" test, as well as screening radiographs. A positive anterior draw test demonstrates that the tibia (shin bone) slips forward against the femur (thigh bone) when pressure is applied to the lower limb.

, There is considerable debate amongst canine orthopedic experts as to whether surgical correction of a torn cruciate (ACL) is essential or not.The argument for surgery is that an unstable joint is more likely to develop arthritis in the long term, plus the recovery time to full function is shorter after surgery than with conservative management.


Arguments against surgery include: surgery being painful and invasive, the cost, the risk of complications and the fact that a lot of dogs do well without surgical intervention. Complications from surgery can include serious infections that necessitate revisional surgery to remove infected implants, or even nerve damage that may be so severe it necessitates limb amputation.

, A majority of animals will recover good use of the affected limb after several months with just conservative treatment. This is especially true for smaller dogs that weigh less than 15kg (33lbs). With your care, your pup will be just fine.


The recovery time for larger breeds is longer and it can be physically more demanding for a heavier dog to cope with using only three legs for a few weeks.However, recovery is still possible.

Look into the dog’s medical history.,
Maintain preventative medications.,
Fight infection and infestation with one medication.,
Monitor the dog’s dental health.",How to Check the Health of a New Dog2," Depending on the age of the dog and where you got them, there may be veterinary records or other information that you should know about. For instance, if you got the dog from a shelter, they will provide you with all the information they have on the dog, including medical records, immunizations and vaccines, and other medication regimens.


Reach out to any vets that have worked with the dog in the past as well. This can be especially helpful if you’re getting the dog from a previous owner that did not keep records themselves.

, One of the major health risks for dogs is heartworm. Fortunately, prevention is low cost and easy to administer. Treatment for heartworm, on the other hand, is dangerous and expensive. As such, it’s important to find out if your dog if heartworm free and has begun a preventative medication regimen. It is also important to administer preventative medication for fleas and ticks. Talk to whomever provided your dog to you about what tests and medications have been specifically administered.If you’ve gotten a puppy, follow your vet’s advice regarding when to start providing heartworm, flea, and tick medications. Do not provide medication to your dog without their vet’s approval.
If you need additional motivation to protect your dog against heartworm, fleas, ticks, and other parasites, note that many parasites can be transferred from dogs to humans.

, Aside from heartworm and other parasites, your new dog is hopefully already receiving treatment to prevent fleas. In fact, many medications that prevent parasites also kill fleas. Ask your doctor which specific medication they recommend, as they will take into account your dog’s age and the relative level of certain infections in your area., Don’t overlook your dog’s dental health. While your vet will check their teeth at their check-up, you need to monitor for signs of gum disease and keep up on their dental hygiene as well. Dogs’ jaw and heart health, in fact, have been linked to their dental health.In particular, don’t ignore bad breath. This is usually the first sign of a potentially more serious condition. If their breath is ever bad enough to make your gag, take them to see the vet.

Monitor the dog’s diet.,
Ensure your dog is well hydrated.,
Know the physical symptoms to watch out for.,
Monitor any behavioral changes.",How to Check the Health of a New Dog3," Your decisions regarding what to feed your dog are extremely important to their long term health. Of course, they may already be used to a certain food when you get them. Talk to whomever you get the dog from, as well as your vet about what you should feed your dog, what size portions you should provide, and how often.Ask whomever was raising your dog before you specific questions. For instance, you not only want to ask what type of food they fed your dog, but also things like “How much did they tend to eat and how often?”
If you got your dog from a shelter, the dog has almost certainly been adequately fed. However, you may be able to provide higher quality food and nutritional supplements that can help keep your dog happy.

, Hydration is an important component of your dog’s health. It is also easy to overlook. Further, even if your dog is well-hydrated at the time of their check-up, you need to ensure they stay hydrated generally.As a rule of thumb, your dog should be drinking between 0.5 to 1 ounce (15 to 30 ml) of water each day per pound (.5 kg) of body weight.
To check for dehydration, pull up on a pinch’s worth of your dog’s skin on the back of their neck. It should quickly slide back into position. If it slowly returns and leaves a small “tent” of skin, your dog needs to be drinking more water.
You may also check your dog’s gums for signs of dehydration by touching them with your finger. If they feel sticky or dry, make sure to provide more water for your dog.

, There are a handful of seemingly innocuous symptoms that may require veterinary treatment. Familiarize yourself with these symptoms ahead of time and seek assistance from your vet if they last longer than two or three days.Warning signs you should mention to your vet include persistent vomiting or diarrhea, constipation, coughing and/or wheezing, skin irritation, irregular fluid discharges, any lumps or bumps on the skin or body, and any signs of pain or discomfort.

, Whenever you notice something is different about your dog’s behavior, be sure to monitor the development closely. If it lasts a few days, call your vet and share your observation with them.Examples of behavioral changes include shifts in eating or drinking habits, weakness or lethargy, and persistent limping.

Learn your dog's age in actual years.,
Inspect your dog's teeth.,
Assess the condition of the teeth.,
Assess your dog's size and growth.,
Assess your dog's muscle tone.,
Examine your dog's coat.,
Inspect your dog's eyes.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Calculate Dog Years1," Knowing your dog's actual biological age is necessary to calculate his age in dog years. It also helps you make decisions during his life that are usually based on age, such as when to spay or neuter and when to change to a senior diet.


Finding out your dog's age is easy to do if you have the dog's records or got him when he was a puppy.
However, if you don't have this information readily available, there are other ways to determine his age. Most of these methods involving an investigation of a number of physical characteristics, including the condition of the teeth, size, coat condition, and eye conditions.;
, Look at the stage and condition of the teeth.


Determine what stage the teeth are at. Puppies will usually have all of their baby teeth by the time they are 8 weeks old and should have all of their permanent teeth by the time they are 6 to 7 months old. They start getting their permanent canine teeth, the longest ones, usually right at 6 months old, which makes this the easiest time to accurately age a puppy. If they have all of their permanent teeth and they are white and clean, they could be up to 1 1/2 to 2 years, but probably around 1 year old., Between the ages of 1 and 2 years old, many dogs will start to show some yellowing on their back teeth. Tartar buildup starts shortly after this.Most dogs will start to show wear on their incisors, the teeth along the front of their mouth, between 3 and 5 years. The wear on the teeth will gradually increase as your dog ages. Significant tartar build-up with evidence of gum disease (look for red, inflamed gums) can be seen after they are 5 years old. Missing teeth usually means that the dog is a senior and could use some dental care.The stage and condition of the teeth can help to give you a good estimate of your dog's age, but remember that there are many factors besides age that can affect their appearance including breed, genetics, chewing behavior, and history of dental care.

, If your dog is continuing to grow, then he is less than 1 1/2 to 2 years old, depending on overall size. Small dogs have reached their full height and length by around one year of age, but large and especially giant breed dogs may take until they are 18 months to 2 years old., Younger dogs are more likely to have more muscle definition because they generally have higher activity levels. In contrast, older dogs can be a little bonier or fatter from decreased activity.Watch your dog when he moves around. You may find he moves with a little more stiffness; this is also a sign of aging., Younger dogs usually have soft, fine coats. Older dogs tend to have thicker and coarser fur that can sometimes also be oilier. A senior dog may also have grays or patches of white, particularly around the snout., Younger dogs tend to have bright, clear eyes without tearing or discharge, whereas older dogs' eyes can be cloudy or opaque., Your vet can estimate your dog's age based on a comprehensive physical exam or tests that evaluate the bones, joints, muscles, and organs. This is the best way to get an accurate assessment of your dog's actual age."

Keep your dog from chewing or licking his stitches.,
Try not to let the dog scratch the stitches.,
Make sure the wound and stitches are clean.,
Keep the wound and stitches dry.,
Monitor the stitches.,
Cover the incision.",How to Care for a Dog With Stitches1," After the painkillers and anesthesia wear off, your dog might try chewing or licking his stitches. This can not only damage the skin, but also cause infection. Try to deter him from doing this. You can try disciplining him if he starts to bother the stitches; it may also be necessary to put a muzzle on him.If you have to, have your dog wear a cone collar to prevent him from bothering his stitches until they are healed. Make sure to leave it on for the duration of the healing process. If you take it on and off, your dog might start rebelling when you try to place it on him.You might have to leave it on for up to two weeks.
You can also get a neck brace, which makes a dog unable to turn his head. This might help if the cone collar is getting in the way.;
, Once the wound starts healing, it may start to itch, which means your dog will want to scratch. If this is the case, try to deter this behavior. Sometimes, the cone collar can help. If it doesn’t, then cover the stitches with gauze or bandages. Keep supervising your dog to make sure she’s not scratching them.You can also put booties or wraps on her paws and claws to keep the wound from getting hurt.
Scratching can rip open the stitches and the wound. Dirt and bacteria on the dog's nails can also infect the wound.
Scratching and rubbing can also cause swelling. If the wound swells too much, it might cause the stitches to break.

, Make sure the dog doesn’t get muddy or get the incision dirty. This can cause infection or other complications. This means keeping him from going outside on his own or letting him roam around muddy or wooded areas.Don’t apply ointment, cream, disinfectants, or anything else without your vet’s permission. Don’t use solutions like hydrogen peroxide or alcohol because it can harm the healing process.
You should change the dressing according to your vet’s orders.
Make sure the dog’s bed is clean. Place a clean sheet or towel on the bed each night and replace when it becomes even lightly soiled.

, Do not bathe your dog during the recovery period. The incision and stitches shouldn’t get wet. Moisture can encourage bacteria to multiply and cause an infection. In addition, moisture softens the skin, which makes it a less effective barrier against infection.


To keep the stitches and bandages dry when the dog goes outside, place a plastic bag or plastic clingwrap around the area when she goes outside. Just remove it as soon as the dog comes back inside., If there are no bandages, then look at the stitches a couple of times a day. This helps you notice changes or infections. This is very important for the healing of your dog.The healing wound should look clean with the edges touching each other. You may see some bruising around the incision, and the incision might be slightly redder than the skin around it.The incision might be slightly puffy or raised. Minor seepage, like a drop of clear or blood-stained fluid, may occur. However, if you notice abnormal swelling, steady seepage, thick discharge, or yellow-green discharge, contact your vet.
Look for any swelling, heated skin, odor, discharge, irritation, or new damage., If you can’t keep the dog from licking or touching the stitches, you can cover the stitches. If the stitches are on the dog’s torso, try putting a t-shirt on him. Make sure it’s cotton, so it will breathe. Just make sure the t-shirt fits the dog and isn’t too large or too tight. You can tie the shirt to keep it from moving up the dog’s torso.This is helpful if you have multiple dogs and can’t keep them separated.
You can also cover the stitches with a bandage. This might be necessary if the wound is on a limb.
If the dog scratches at the wound with a back leg, try putting a snug-fitting sock on that paw so the nails can’t rip at the stitches."

Keep common household cleaners up and away.,
Avoid using fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.,
Wash new bedding before use.,
Buy safe chew toys.",How to Avoid Harming Your Puppy1," Common household cleaners like, glass and wood cleaners, disinfecting wipes, all-purpose cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, and laundry detergents, emit harmful vapors. Keep your puppy safe by storing these chemicals in high cabinets, i.e., at or above eye level. You can also store these chemicals in the garage. Try not to store them in low places, like under the sink.Alternatively, you can buy non-toxic household cleaners. Earth Easy, Seventh Generation, and Green Works provide safe alternatives.
You can also make your own non-toxic cleaners. Mix ½ cup of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of castile soap, and ½ teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide for a powerful disinfectant.
Many laundry detergents also contain chemicals that can be harmful to your pet, especially if you wash your pet’s bedding with these detergents. Buy detergents that are non-toxic and pet friendly like, Soap Nuts Laundry Liquid or Nellie’s All-Natural Laundry detergent.;
, Fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides also contain chemicals than can harm your puppy if it comes into contact with them. Even if you don’t use grass fertilizers, your neighbors may.


Instead, corn gluten is a natural and non-toxic alternative to chemically based grass fertilizers.If your puppy wanders into a neighbor's yard, who uses these chemicals, make sure to rinse your puppy and its paws off with water.

, Many new home furnishings, clothes, bedding material, and wood products, like wood paneling, laminated wood flooring, and wood-veneer furniture, contain formaldehyde. Formaldehyde emissions (fumes) are very harmful for your puppy.Protect your puppy by washing his new bedding, including bedding that will be used by your puppy, before use. Also, wash new clothing before wearing it.
Before placing newly bought wood furniture inside your house, let it sit outdoors for a few days to “gas out.”
If you plan to buy a dog house for your puppy, buy solid wood dog houses.

, Buy hard rubber or nylon toys for your teething puppy to chew on. These toys are ideal because they are practically impossible to destroy. Buy the right size toys for your puppy to ensure that your puppy does not choke on them. Your puppy should not be able to fit the whole toy in its mouth; if it can, then it is too small.Avoid chew toys that have small, sharp metal pieces, long strips or fibers, cooked real bones, sheets of plastic film, thin, squeaky rubber toys, and toys with foam stuffing. All of these toys are either made with materials your puppy could choke on, or, if digested, cause damage to their digestive tracts."

The vet may keep your dog overnight if she still seems loopy from the sedatives she was given, or if she cannot walk on her own.;
, Take a friend along when you collect your dog from the clinic. It is often tricky to remember instructions when you are anxious to see your furry companion again. Your friend can be an extra pair of ears, to listen for instructions that you might forget in the heat of the moment.


A friend can also hold doors open and assist you in getting your dog into and out of the car.

, Most clinics give comprehensive verbal and written instructions describing what to do after your dog has had surgery. Before you arrive at the clinic, it is also a good idea to write down any questions you might have concerning postoperative care.


Writing your questions down and going throughout them one by one with your vet may help you to feel more prepared to take care of your dog.

, Once you get your dog home, she will need some peace and quiet so that she can rest and recover. Do not arrange surgery the same day as a big dinner party in the evening, as having a large group of people around will not be relaxing for your dog.


You should also resist inviting people over to come and visit your dog. While she will of course be pleased to see these people, having them there will also make her want to get up and move around while she should be resting.

, Many people wonder if they should stay home with their dog for days after surgery. This is not necessary. It is, however, a good idea to be home for the first 24 hours after surgery so that you can make sure that your dog is eating, alert, going to the toilet, and not in too much pain.If anything happens that concerns you during this first 24 hour period then always phone your vet for advice.
If you have no choice but to leave the house, consider getting a trusted pet sitter and walking her through this information.

, During the evening, after your dog’s anesthetic has begun to wear off, you will be able to feed her. However, give her a light meal, rather than her regular portions. The anesthetic can make some dogs feel nauseous, and eating a full meal may cause your dog to vomit.


Consider a small portion of cooked chicken breast, rabbit, cod, or turkey along with a little white rice or pasta.
Alternatively, you could get food that is designed for a dog experiencing nausea. These foods include brands like Hills ID or Purina EN.

, It is fine to return your dog to a normal diet the following day. Keep in mind that it is normal for a dog who has had surgery to not defecate for two to three days.

, During the first three to four days after her surgery, you can leave your dog alone for four hours at a time. These four hours will allow her time to sleep and rest, but will also help you to be around enough that you can spot problems she may have.


Refer to the section on helping a dog in pain to find out what signs to look for.

, Assuming there have been no serious complications by this point, your dog should do fine when left at home alone. After this point, it's mostly a matter of giving her time to heal until the sutures are removed, 10-14 days after the surgery.

, Some clinics send the patient home with Primapore (an adhesive dressing) covering the incision. Keeping this in place for 24 hours allows a seal to form over the incision which protects it from getting infected with bacteria.


Some clinics do not use Primapore anymore, as removing it can irritate the dog's skin.

, Do not let your dog or any other animal lick the incision, as this carries a high risk of infection and breaking the stitches. To prevent her from doing this, there are a variety of cone collars to choose from. These collars are variously described as looking like an Elizabethan ruff, a lampshade, or a bucket with the bottom taken out. Most are made from clear plastic.


Pick a collar that fits your dog. The narrow end of the collar sits around the dog's neck and is held in place with her regular collar. The wider end of the cone should project two to three inches (5–7.5 cm) beyond her nose, so the collar is between her and the wound.
Alternatively, you can get the dog an inflatable neck brace, to prevent the dog from turning her head. These look a lot like life-saver inflatable rings and are fitted to the diameter of your dog's neck.

, If you have several dogs, any number of them might try to lick your recovering dog’s wound. To keep this from happening, find a T-shirt that is large enough to cover your dog’s whole body down to where the incision was made. Have your dog wear the T-shirt for 10 to 14 days. Cotton T-shirts work well for this, as they are very breathable.:


Pull the t-shirt over your dog’s head and put her two front legs into each sleeve of the shirt. Pull the shirt down so that it covers the incision, and tie it up so she can walk around. If the shirt is long enough, you could also cut two holes in the bottom that you can put your dog’s back legs through.
If the T-shirt becomes soiled, replace it with a clean one.

, Look at the incision, but do not touch it. A healing wound should be dry, with no seepage of fluid from the incision. As part of the healing process, the wound edges may swell slightly which helps to push them together.

, Be vigilant for signs of heat, swelling, or discharge from the wound. Contact the vet immediately if there is any blood or pus leaking from the incision. Most often the blood comes from a small blood vessel leaking out into the fat layer beneath the skin, rather than major internal hemorrhage, but call your vet regardless to make sure it is nothing serious.Likewise, pus is usually a sign of a superficial infection at or just beneath the skin, rather than an infection tracking out of the abdomen. However, your dog may need antibiotics to settle the infection so that it doesn't delay the healing of the wound.

, Unless advised to do so by your veterinarian, do not touch the incision. However, if your dog goes outside and gets a muddy tummy, then it is acceptable to gently wash dirt from the incision. To do this:


Create a saltwater solution (a teaspoon (5 mL) of salt mixed into a pint (0.5 L) of water that has been boiled, then cooled to a skin-safe temperature). Dip cotton balls into the solution, and then gently dab them over the wound to remove any dirt or grime from the incision.

, If the wound is undressed and exposed to the air, make sure your dog sleeps on clean, dry bedding so that the wound doesn't get contaminated.

, The principle of rest is to avoid anything that might stretch the incision, increase blood pressure, or dislodge ligatures. In an ideal world, rests means just that—rest. Lots of lying around in bed, with no stairs, no jumping, and no walks.

, This means no runs, games of Frisbee, or playing catch. It also means no running up and down stairs or jumping on and off furniture. Think about borrowing a child's stair gate for the duration of your dog’s recovery so that you can block off the stairs.


If you own a large dog who likes to sleep with you, do not let her walk up the stairs to get to your bed. If you are concerned about your dog’s health, you can sleep downstairs on the sofa beside her.

, Take your dog out into the yard on a collar and lead, rather than letting her roam freely. Keeping her on a lead can help you to restrain her and keep her from injuring herself if she sees something that she wants to chase.

, Don't let your dog jump in and out of your car. If necessary, take a friend with you to help lift a big dog into and out of the trunk when you collect her from the clinic or take her somewhere other than your home.

, If your dog is going stir crazy and has so much bottled energy she is bouncing or jumping at doors, check with the clinic to see if a short walk is okay. Always keep her on a leash during the walk.


Three to four days after her surgery, you can consider taking your dog for a walk. Try to keep the walk to five minutes in length, and walk on flat ground.

, If you have other dogs in the house who want to rough-house with your recovering dog, keep them under constant supervision so that they can't jump on her. Do not play tug-o-war with your dog, or any other games that involve movement.


If you are concerned that you cannot keep your other dogs under control, consider asking a friend to watch those dogs until your recovering dog’s stitches have been removed.

, If you have a hyperactive dog that absolutely refuses to take things quietly no matter how hard you try, let the veterinary clinic know. They may recommend a mild sedative to slow her down a little.

, As with any major surgical procedure, it is important to make sure the patient is not in pain. Most clinics use a combination of painkillers (an opioid and a non-steroidal) on the day of surgery, and send your dog home with an oral painkiller to continue taking at home.


Keep in mind that some dogs are more sensitive and will feel more pain than others. The average length of time that pain relief is required is generally four to five days, but your dog may need more or less time.
Do not use any unprescribed painkillers without veterinary advice.

, Each dog reacts differently to pain; some become vocal and whine, while others withdraw and try to hide. General signs of discomfort are listed below::


Restlessness: Pacing, inability to settle, and sitting down and then standing again, can all be signs of discomfort.
Vocalization: Whining and crying. This is sometimes an attempt to get attention rather than a sign of pain. Try to avoid fussing over the dog when she cries; if she learns that you will not reward her, but continues to whine, she is probably in pain.
Body Posture: A dog in pain often wears a ""miserable"" expression with tipped down ears, doleful eyes and a lowered head. Her body is often hunched and she may not be able to lie in her favorite position.
Behavior : Some dogs change behavior when in pain, of which one example is becoming snappy or aggressive. Other dogs withdraw, as if trying to hide away from the pain.
Not eating or drinking: Some dogs (especially Labradors) eat no matter what, but others go off their food if uncomfortable.

, If you feel you dog does not have adequate pain relief, contact the clinic. There are other painkillers, such as tramadol, which can be added to the NSAID prescription to top up her pain control.

, Most veterinarians want to schedule a check-up between three and ten days after the operation. However, should you become concerned before this, always contact the surgery for advice. Signs to watch for include:


Not eating or drinking after 48 hours: Your dog should be eating by now and could be in pain if she is not. Don't wait the extra day before seeking advice.
A discharge from the wound: A healing wound is usually dry. If there is a discharge, especially blood or pus, seek advice.
Sickness or diarrhea : Sometimes the anesthetic agents can cause tummy upsets in sensitive animals, however, in a pet that has had recent surgery, bring her to the vet if you see that she is nauseous.
Weakness, lethargy, or a swollen tummy: If your dog seems weak and is not recovering her energy, or if her figure changes and her tummy looks swollen, seek immediate vet advice.

Understand how size impacts dog years.,
Determine the size of your adult dog.,
Calculate for your dog's age after 2 years old.",How to Calculate Dog Years2," The most accurate dog year calculations consider the size of the dog. Smaller dogs do tend to live longer than larger dogs, although they may mature more quickly in the first few years of life. A large dog may mature more slowly initially but be considered a ""senior"" at age five. Medium-sized dogs are somewhere in the middle in terms of maturation and lifespan.In other words, after they reach adulthood, larger dogs will be considered older in dog years than a smaller dog of the same age., You can weigh your dog at home or, for a more accurate assessment, have your dog weighed at the vet. Here are general categories based on dog size:Small dogs: 20 pounds or less
Medium dogs: 21 to 50 pounds
Large dogs: 51 to 100 pounds
Giant breed dogs: 100 pounds or more.
Note that most dogs are considered adults by the time they are two years old. For dogs of all sizes the relationship of dog age to human years is the same for the first two years of a dog's life. For example, irrespective of whether he is small, medium or large, a dog that is 1 year old is about 15 years old in dog years. At 2 years old, he is 24 in dog years. After they reach 2 years old, however, is when a dog's size begins to affect his age in dog years., For every year after your dog is 2 years old, add the following number of years to 24 (his age at 2 years), based on your dog's weight: for small and medium dogs add 5 years, for large dogs add 6 years, and for giant breed dogs add 7 years.Consider the age of a pug at 10 years old. At 2 years old, the pug is 24 in dog years. Every year after that, he ages by 5 years. This means that by his 10th year, he is actually 64 years old in dog years.
A giant-breed dog, such as a Great Dane, ages more rapidly after age 2. At 2 years old, he is 24 in dog years. Each year after that, he ages by 7 years. By his 10th year, he is in fact 80 years old in dog years.

"
"
Take your dog's age and subtract by 2.,
Multiple that number by 4 and then add 21.,
Be aware that this calculation is just a rough estimate.",How to Calculate Dog Years3," Note that your dog needs to be at least two years old. This when dogs are considered to have reached adulthood., Now you will have an estimate of your dog's age in dog years.For example, if your dog is 10 years old, then his age in dogs years is 53.

, Because this method does not take your dog's size into consideration, it cannot be completely accurate.


This calculation will be more accurate for smaller dogs than larger dogs. For example, as we calculated above, when factoring in size, a Great Dane at 10 years old is 80 in dog years, whereas this method would calculate his age in dog years to be 53.
However, this method is an easy trick to calculate dog years quickly if you don't know your dog's size or are in a hurry.

Schedule the surgery when you can be at home.,
Avoid excess activity.,
Keep your dog away from other dogs.,
Contact the vet if you have concerns.",How to Care for a Dog With Stitches2," Unless the surgery is emergency, try to schedule the surgery at a time where you can be at home with your dog. You want to watch for any odd symptoms, make sure your dogs rests and doesn’t over do it, and just be there for your dog.


During this time you shouldn’t have a lot of house guests. Keep your home quiet and calm for your dog so she can rest.

, When your dog has stitches, you should limit his physical activity. Stretching or over-exertion can cause swelling of the operation site. Don’t let your dog run up and down stairs, jump up to greet people, or engage in other hyper activities. It may stretch the operation site, causing inflammation which leads to swelling, pain, and discomfort.Keep the dog on a leash for seven to 14 days after the injury or surgery. This helps avoid too much activity and helps keep the dog from getting into something that might infect the wound.This may be hard at home. If you can't keep your dog calm, you may need to put him in a kennel to keep his activity level down.
Use barriers to keep the dog from going up the stairs. Whenever you leave the dog alone, put up barriers to keep him from running around or jumping on things.

, Other dogs also pose a risk to your dog when she has stitches. Other dogs might want to lick your dog’s wounds, so keep her away from other dogs during the healing period. This includes dogs in your own home.You may also need to keep her in a kennel to keep her away from other animals.

, Your pet’s health is the first concern. If you notice any excess bleeding, unusual swelling, or discharge from the wound, contact your vet. If your dog start running a fever, gets sick, throws up, or shows any other signs of poor health, also contact your vet.


If you are unsure about anything, call your vet or e-mail her a photo. She can help you determine if your dog is healing normally."

Feed properly.,
Wash food and water dishes frequently.,
Install a safe puppy gate inside and outside the home.,
Don’t feed your puppy before a car ride.,
Handle your puppy correctly.,
Do not place your puppy on high surfaces.",How to Avoid Harming Your Puppy2," When feeding your puppy, make sure you give them the right amount of food, as well as the proper kind of food. For example, puppies need to be fed high-quality brand name puppy food. Try to limit “people food” because this can cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies and imbalances, bone and teeth problems, and obesity later on. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.Here’s a guide to feeding your puppy the right amount of food:Eight to 12 week-old puppies need four meals a day.
Three to six month-old puppies need three meals a day.
Six months to one-year-old puppies need two meals a day.
Once your dog is one year old, one meal a day will suffice.

, Clean your puppy's water and food dishes at least once a week. Clean them with regular soap and water. Try to avoid soap that may have chemicals that will harm your puppy, such as dish washing detergent. Make sure all the soap is removed by rinsing and drying the bowls well.

, Installing puppy gates inside the home will prevent your puppy from escaping through an opened front or back door. Gates inside the home will also prevent your puppy from going into areas of the house that are deemed unsafe. Unsafe areas can include areas that contain household plants that are poisonous to dogs, as well as areas with a lot of wiring and electric cords.Install gates outside that will prevent your puppy from escaping, as well as prevent other dogs from getting inside your back yard. Gates that are safe for the backyard are ones that have safety latches.

, Let your puppy become accustomed to the motion of the car by gradually increasing the length of the car rides. If your puppy still gets sick from car rides, even if you do not feed it, you can buy over-the-counter motion sickness drugs by the name of Meclizine, Bonine, or Antivert. Administer the medication one hour before the car ride.It is best to talk to your puppy’s vet before you administer these drugs. Your vet will tell you when and how much medication to administer to your puppy.

, When handling your puppy, make sure to place your hand under your puppy’s chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting your puppy’s hind legs and rump. Do not lift or grab your puppy by the forelegs, back of the neck, or tail. If your puppy is heavy, lift it from its underside, supporting its chest with one arm and its rear with the other., If you place your puppy on a surface, it may try to jump down. If it jumps from a surface that is high above the ground, it could break a bone, suffer head trauma, or even cause death in extreme situations.

"
"
Never hit your puppy.,
Administer punishment at time of the offense.,
Do not leave your puppy in the crate all day.",How to Avoid Harming Your Puppy3," Puppies are naturally curious, so they might get into a bit of trouble. However, if your puppy does something you do not approve of, never resort to hitting your puppy. This can cause your puppy to become fearful, anxious, or even angry or mean itself. There are better, more effective ways to punish your puppy.


If your puppy gets into trouble, say a firm, “No,” and make it sit. Once it sits like you told it to, give it a treat to reward the good behavior.
You can also use remote correction to correct your puppy’s behavior. This is so your puppy will not associate you with the correction. For example, use a hand-held air horn to correct your puppy’s behavior. Sound off the air horn behind your back so your puppy does not see that you did it. Or, rattle a can containing coins or pebbles behind your back., Never punish your puppy after the fact. If you punish it after the fact, your puppy will have no idea why you are punishing it because the offense happened too long ago. Therefore, you will not be able to correct the behavior, and your puppy will not understand why you are punishing it., Puppies confined in crates or cages for long periods may develop disturbing habits, like eating its feces. This is usually caused by boredom. If do not have any one to watch your puppy while you're at work, place your puppy and its crate inside a small room in your house. Then, create a bathroom area in the room by placing newspapers in a corner away from the crate.

Find the dew claw.,
Check for a healthy dew claw.,
Decide whether to declaw.,
Examine your dog's dew claw.,
Visit your groomer.,
Find the right length.,
Trim the nail.,
Go to the vet.,
Treat a break or crack.,
Treat an infection.",How to Care for a Dog's Dew Claw," The dew claw is the claw that most dogs have on the inner portion of their lower leg, a little ways above the rest of the paw. Almost all dogs naturally have dew claws on their front legs, and some have them on the back, as well.Some dog owners opt to have their dog’s dew claws removed when they are still puppies to avoid potential injury or tearing. If you have a rescue dog or a dog from a renowned breeder, it is possible that they may not have dew claws per the choice of their previous owners.;
, The dew claw is prone to cracks, breaking, and tearing, so it is important to check regularly to ensure that the claw is healthy and not causing your dog any pain. Look carefully at the claw once every week or so to see if there is any chipping, peeling, extended cracks, or other symptoms of an injured dew claw.A healthy dew claw should be smooth and a relatively consistent color. Some color variation along the claw is normal, but discoloration such as red or brown within the claw may indicate bleeding or other injury.

, While there are no strict veterinary guidelines regarding if you can have your dog’s dew claws removed, the general school of thought on the subject is leave it there unless otherwise necessary. Declawing generally happens when the dog is still small, and must be done by a trained veterinarian.Declawing may be beneficial for dogs that work, hunt, or otherwise spend a lot of time being active outdoors or in variable environments. Farm dogs, hunting dogs, service dogs, and police dogs are often declawed to help prevent the claw from catching or sustaining injury.
If your dog is not going to be performing intense physical activity and will live more like a household pet, it is generally considered easier to keep the claw and maintain it properly.

, Trimming your dog’s dew claw is important for their continued health and well-being. Trimming too close or with the wrong tools could actually cause injury to your dog, though. Decide whether you are capable and comfortable trimming your dog’s claw.If your dog has dark, opaque claws, trimming them is likely best left to a professional. The claws have a fleshy bed called the quick that extends partway down the claw. Cutting into the quick is painful and could seriously injure your dog. If you cannot see the quick, it is best not to cut their nails yourself.
Make sure that you have a nail trimmer meant specifically for dog’s nails. The types of nail trimmers humans use can cause cracking and splitting on dog nails. Head to your local pet shop to get trimmers that will keep the claw healthy., If you do not feel comfortable trimming your dog’s dew claw on your own, take your dog to your local groomer. Many groomers offer walk-in and a la carte nail trimming or grindings. Generally, your groomer will be faster, safer, and less traumatic for your dog than trying to trim the nails yourself.


Ask your groomer about nail grinding options, as well as nail trimming. A grinding uses a rotary nail file to slowly grind the claw down to an appropriate length. This not only trims the nail, but rounds it out to prevent catching, cracking, and splitting., If you decide to trim your dog’s nails, you need to determine the right length for the nail. The nail is too long and needs trimming if it starts to curl and wrap around upward and back toward the dog’s leg. Trim the nail to a length that cuts away the curl, but leaves visible room between the quick and the cut.It is imperative to not cut the dog’s claw too short. Always opt for longer if you are unsure. You can go back and trim more if necessary, but cutting too close could cause serious pain and injury to your dog.

, Once you have found the right length, trim the nail using nail clippers made specifically for trimming dog claws. Unlike nail trimmers meant for human use, these put pressure on the sides of the nail, instead of the top and bottom, which helps prevent painful and potentially dangerous cracking and splitting.Using dog nail trimmers is advisable for at-home groomers instead of using a grinder. Those unexperienced with grinders may cause accidental injury to the nail or nail bed.

, If your dog has a nail injury that has cut them down to the quick, get your dog to your vet or the nearest animal hospital immediately. This is a painful injury for your dog, and requires professional treatment and often sedation.If your dog will let you, treat the bleeding using gauze or a band-aid. Then, rush your dog to the vet for further evaluation and treatment.

, If your dog sustains a dew claw injury that has not cut them to the quick, treat the break or crack in the nail quickly to prevent further damage. In these cases, it is still a good idea to call your vet for advice and further information.Remove the broken pieces. If your dog breaks or chips part of their nail, remove the broken pieces using your claw trimmers to prevent further injury.
Stop any bleeding by covering the injury using clean gauze and applying pressure to the area for a few minutes.
Clean the wound by bathing the paw in warm water to remove any immediate dirt or debris. Then, use an antiseptic spray or wipe only on the toe that was impacted to prevent potential infection.
Bandage the wound with a gauze wrap or a bandage meant to work on a pet’s foot, available from your vet or at local pet stores. Change the bandage daily to keep the wound clean until it heals.
Consult your vet to ensure that your dog does not need to be brought in and to get further recommendations for treatment.

, Your dog’s dew claw may become infected due to trauma or injury around the claw, or due to fungal infections. Treat an infection of the dew claw quickly with evaluation and care from your vet.Symptoms of a dew claw infection include soreness and inflammation around the dew claw, nail overgrowth, unexpected peeling and chipping of the nail, and discoloration.
If you believe your dog may have an infected dew claw, contact your vet immediately to schedule an appointment. Your vet will best be able to advise you on proper physical and medicinal treatments.
Treatment may include antibiotic or antifungal medication, as well as medicated foot baths or soaks. In extreme circumstances, removal of the nail plate may be necessary.

Diagnose brain cancer.",How to Care for a Dog with Brain Cancer," If you dog has been diagnosed with brain cancer, you should discuss different cancer treatments with him. He may also recommend you see a veterinary oncologist, who is a vet specialist that deals with animal cancer treatments. Discuss all the different options with him, since the treatment will vary depending on your specific dog's case.


Your vet or the vet oncologist can also offer insight into what the treatment will entail, what your dog will go through, and how much it will cost.;
, If you cannot afford treatment for your dog or your dog's prognosis is not positive at all, you may need to plan a palliative care program. Palliative care is supportive care that focuses on maintaining or improving your dog's quality of life without giving him treatment to slow the progression of the cancer or help him fight it. It is similar to hospice care in humans, where you aren't giving up on him but being realistic about his chances of survival. This can be done by giving him:


Diet and nutrition support.
Giving him medications, such as pain medications or steroids to help with symptoms.
This can also include psychological support for the dog's family., You may consider brain surgery to extend your dog's life. Brain surgery on dogs is very rare and requires a specialist veterinary neurosurgeon. The surgeon will go in and try to remove as much of the primary tumors as possible with as little damage to the other brain tissue as possible.


This method can be done on its own or in addition to other treatments., In most cases, surgery should be followed by radiation or chemotherapy. These methods are used to shrink the size of the tumor or stop the tumor from growing. The combination of these methods with surgery will likely give your dog the longest post surgery lifespan.


These treatments will be overseen by a veterinary oncologist at her clinic or at an animal hospital. However, chemotherapy may be given to your dog and monitored at your local veterinarian office.
Radiation is more common, while chemotherapy is not given as often.
Similar options may be available if your dog has tumors in other portions of the body as well., While your dog is battling cancer, you need to monitor her eating habits. She will likely have days where she will eat normally, but there will also be days when she will not eat much at all. Talk to your vet about the best food to feed her, which may be wet, canned, or dry.


Keep her food in an easy to access location, especially if your dog has trouble walking.
Softer foods are generally easier to eat than dry foods, especially since one of the symptoms is swallowing difficulties.
Also monitor how much your dog is drinking every day as well. You don't want her to dehydrate. Clean and refill her water bowl every day. If she needs to drink more, place a few more water bowls around the house to encourage her to drink., Dogs with cancer are likely to be wobbly or unsure on their feet, so your dog may need extra safety precautions. Make sure his access to stairs or steps is protected with a baby gate or blocked off in some way. Only let him go up and down stairs if you can help him.


Watch his movements carefully when he is outside. Don't let him wander unsupervised around the yard. He may wander off or injure himself.
Also watch him closely around other animals to make sure they don't roughhouse or fight.

, When a dog has brain cancer, she is more likely to have accidents. Keep a check on the fur around her bottom for fecal matter and urine. It may collect on her fur if she can't get out in time to go or if she goes while lying down. If this happens, wash the area with soap and water and dry it thoroughly. This will keep the skin from getting irritated.


If this happens often, talk to your vet about your dog's quality of life. It may be time to consider alternative options.
Use waterproof pads under her bedding if she has accident often., Dog brain cancer generally falls into two categories. Your dog may have a tumor that develops within the brain or the surrounding tissues in the area. He may also develop brain cancer from tumors that have spread from other parts of the body into the brain.Tumors that spread from other places in the body generally have a worse prognosis, because the dog has much more cancer to deal with than just that in the brain., When your dog is in the early stages of brain cancer, it can be difficult to recognize the symptoms because they are very similar to those of aging or of minor infections. They can also be vague, non-specific, and can vary from case to case. This can make it hard for most owners to realize that their dog has a medical problem. To compound the problem the symptoms are typically vague and non-specific. Some of the symptoms your dog may have include:Atypical or strange behavior
A change in appetite
Depression
Weight loss
Inappropriate urination
Weakness
Head tilt
Vomiting
Problems swallowing
Loss of balance or drunken gait
Seizures
Loss of vision
Voice change

, Once the brain cancer has progressed, your dog may experience different symptoms. These can depend on the part of the brain that is being attacked by the cancer. The later stage symptoms include:Confusion or acting confused
Hiding
Walking or pacing in circles
Pressing her head into walls or other surfaces
Difficulty or inability to stand
Paralysis
Coma

, If you notice any of the symptoms in your dog, take him to your veterinarian. She will diagnose his conditions from your description of the symptoms, the behavior she sees, a physical examination, and additional testing.


If your vet suspects brain cancer, she may do a spinal tap to test spinal fluid. She will likely refer you to a nearby specialty clinic or university that has a CT or MRI machine that can be used on dogs. These tests are needed because brain cancer does not show up on normal X-ray images.
If any of these tests make your doctor think it is cancer, she will perform a biopsy on the tumor to be 100% sure of the cancer diagnosis.
Your vet should be cautious for any mental changes in your dog if he is over five. Any significant neurological changes in this age group can be because of brain cancer.
Your vet may perform chest or abdomen X-rays to see if the cancer has spread from or to another location.
She may also run blood and urine tests to help rule out any additional possibilities that may causes his symptoms. "

Watch your dog.,
Part and inspect your dog's fur.,
Identify that you are dealing with a hot spot.,
Check areas surrounding the hot spot.,
Contact your vet.,
Trim or clip the hair from the surface of the hot spot.,
Clean the wound.,
Leave the antimicrobial shampoo on the dog for 10 minutes.,

Use an Elizabethan collar if your dog keeps licking or biting the lesions.,
Trim your dog's toe nails.",How to Treat Hot Spots in Dogs," Notice if your dog scratches or licks a particular spot constantly. This is usually a sign that he is suffering from some sort of skin irritation.;
, Examine more closely the problem area you have identified. Hot spots can be difficult to see with the naked eye because they tend to spread under the cover of the dog's fur. Usually by the time you notice them, hot spots are well established and growing rapidly. , Hot spots are red, moist, hot and irritated rashes. Other identifiers of hot spots include discharge and an unpleasant odor.Hot spots are most commonly found on a dog's head, hip or chest area.
Dogs with long hair and thick coats are most commonly affected.
Dogs who are not groomed regularly and have matted coats are also prone to developing hot spots, as are dogs who swim or are frequently in the rain.Dogs with hip dysplasia or anal sac disease are also more likely to suffer from hot spots because they tend to lick the skin on their hind end., If you do identify a hot spot, take some time to carefully check the rest of the dog’s skin. Part the fur in the area surrounding the hot spot and examine for any other moist or reddened areas. All spots need to be treated immediately and, if possible, you should try to ascertain the underlying cause of the hot spot (flea bite, scratch, allergy, etc.)., If this is your dog's first hot spot, seeing a vet is crucial. Your vet can give you an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan., Exposing the hot spot to air will dry out the moisture and help speed up the healing process. Be careful not to pull the hair, irritate the skin or cut your dog's skin.Disinfect your scissors or clippers before clipping. In cases where there is a lot of discharge emerging from the hot spot, you will need to clean your clippers frequently while removing hair. Otherwise, the clippers will become plugged with debris. Remember to clean and disinfect the instrument after use.Have your dog sit or lie down for this process. Get a second person if you need help keeping the dog still.
To avoid accidentally cutting your dog's skin, don't cut too close to the skin itself and instead leave a quarter inch of stubble.If the affected area is too large, shave it., Use an antimicrobial shampoo that you can purchase at a vet's office or a pharmacy for humans.A good product will contain chlorhexidine as an ingredient.You can also clean the area with a mild, water-based astringent or antiseptic spray.Consult your veterinarian before use of any product on a hot spot., This will allow the medication in the shampoo to settle into the affected area and begin working. Rinse thoroughly after 10 minutes and dry the affected area completely.If using an alternative solution, read and follow the accompanying instructions on how to apply.

, Your vet will usually prescribe a topical medication, such as a Gentamicin or Betamethasone spray. Your vet may also recommend oral antibiotics, depending on the situation.You can apply an antibiotic treatment on the wound up to three times per day., The air will help the wound heal more effectively, whereas more moisture will facilitate the wound's growth.


Keep in mind that hot spots can't be covered with a bandage because this traps moisture in and thereby worsens the wound., If there is a buildup of discharge, repeat the shampoo process (shampoo, rinse, dry) to keep the wound clean., This check should be done daily, particularly if it is hot or humid out.

, Hydrocortisone spray and Benadryl tablets work well. The appropriate dosage is 1 tablet per 50 pounds.


Your vet may also prescribe steroids. Steroids work well for severe spots, but may cause side effects and can be harmful in the long-term. In addition, if the steroid is stopped before the spot is completely gone, the hot spot may come back and be worse than before.
Avoid using creams on the hot spot. Creams keep moisture in the area, and the spot needs to dry completely before it can heal.

, The cone-shaped collar will restrain your dog's reach, making him unable to further irritate the wound.An Elizabethan collar should not be used as the sole means of treatment for hot spots. Collars don't treat the hot spots but prevent your dog from making the lesions more severe. Untreated lesions will only grow and become more serious, in addition to being painful for your dog.You can wrap a sock around one of the dog's rear feet and tape it into place if the hot spot can be scratched by a rear foot.

, This keeps your dog from having a ready way to scratch the area and spread the infected discharge."

Identify the common symptoms of a stroke.,
Differentiate between the symptoms of a stroke and the symptoms of other conditions.,
Understand how the length of stroke symptoms is central to a diagnosis of a stroke.,
Be aware that conditions other than a stroke can cause similar symptoms to those of a stroke.,
Contact your veterinarian if you suspect a stroke.",How to Recognize a Stroke in Dogs1," The symptoms of a stroke are varied, from sudden loss of balance to altered consciousness. Review the signs of a stroke and keep an eye on a dog you suspect is having a stroke. You want to be able to identity any of the key symptoms.


Extreme weakness: There may be a neurological weakness of the limbs. This means that the nerves are not working and therefore do not give the legs the right information about how to stand up and support the dog. Although the muscles are strong enough to support the body, they do not receive the right nerve messages and so the animal is extremely weak and unable to stand.
Nystagmus: Nystagmus is the technical term for when the eyes flick rapidly from side to side, as if watching a tennis match on fast forward. This is a common indicator of stroke, although it can also happen for other reasons, such as meningitis. Again, once nystagmus starts it can last for days. It also makes the pet feel nauseous, because it invokes a form of motion sickness. Because of this, the dog may vomit and lose interest in food.
Sudden loss of balance. Be on the look out for a dog that cannot coordinate its limbs.
Altered consciousness: In severe strokes some dogs may seizure or fit, whilst others may lose consciousness. This means they are unaware of what is going on around them and do not respond to their name or other stimuli.;
, A stroke is a sudden event. You should suspect a stroke if a pet that was fine and normal 5 minutes ago, is now struggling to get up. If the dog is struggling because its dizzy, such as if they have heart disease, this episode may pass within a few minutes, once the dog has caught its breath be able to rise and walk around. A dog that has had a stroke, however, will remain disorientated for hours or even days.


Please note, this symptom also overlaps with inflammation in the balance mechanism in the inner ear.
In addition, there is a sliding scale of weakness, depending on the severity of the stroke. Sometimes if it is only mild the dog can stand and walk around slowly as if drunk, other times the dog is incapacitated, lies on their side and is barely conscious.

, To be classified as a stroke, technically the symptoms must persist for longer than 24 hours. If the symptoms resolve before this, and yet there is a strong suspicions of a blockage in the brain, it is instead known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) . TIAs are a strong warning sign that a full blown stroke is on the way, and so always seek veterinary attention so any underlying causes can be corrected to reduce this risk.

, Because these conditions are vastly different, the treatment will differ. However, do not worry too much about labelling your dog's condition but instead seek urgent help.

, There are several symptoms that can point towards your pet having had a stroke. However, do not be too concerned about reaching a specific diagnosis at home, because calling the symptoms a stroke is just a label. What is important is that if you see one or some of these signs you should get urgent veterinary attention for your pet."

See a veterinary behaviorist if your dog’s depression continues.",How to Tell if Your Dog Is Depressed," Most healthy, happy dogs are highly sociable creatures. If your dog is not greeting you as excitedly when you come home – less of a tail wag, less energy and movement – or loses interest in activities he once enjoyed, he may be depressed.


Instead of running to the door to greet visitors, a depressed dog may slink away and find an out-of-the-way corner to curl up and go to sleep.
Be particularly concerned if your dog hides from you. Dogs that hide are usually injured, sick, or depressed.On the other hand, depressed dogs sometimes follow their owners around everywhere they go, yet show no desire to interact.;
, Happy dogs have seemingly endless energy. For every mile you walk, he goes four – out-and-back, and out-and-back again. He nags you to throw the ball repeatedly, and your arm grows tired before his enthusiasm runs out.


However, when depressed, your dog no longer pricks his ears up when you get his lead, and instead of charging off across the park, he trudges head-down at your heel. When you stop to talk to friends, he may sit, or even lie down.
This change from active and energetic to inactive and lethargic may indicate depression., If your dog wanders from room to room and can’t find a place to settle down, he may be depressed., All dogs sleep a lot, particularly when their owners are gone. However, you should be concerned if your dog continues sleeping when you get home, or if he stays curled up instead of coming to the window or door for things that once attracted him, like the mailman or a passing dog., Most dogs will eat less and lose weight when depressed.On the other hand, just like humans, some dogs may eat more as a form of comfort.Watch for:


Refusing treats that he once loved.
Weight gain or weight loss.

, Tearing up shoes or chewing on walls, books, furniture, or pillows are often signs of lack of exercise, which may lead to depression. Depressed dogs may also be more prone to have accidents in the house. Try not to be angry. Take them out more to ensure they have plenty of time to pee or poop outdoors., If your dog begins to growl, snap, or otherwise act aggressively when you try to interact with him, this may be a sign of depression., Dogs squint, making their eyes appear smaller, when they are in pain, stressed, or depressed.Depressed dogs may also be reluctant to make eye contact with anybody, even you.


Of course, some dogs have ""sad"" eyes at the best of times, due to naturally droopy eyelids rather than depression, so exercise a little common sense when interpreting sad eyes as a sign of depression.

, For example, your dog may fail to prick up his ears at the sound of things that normally interest him, such as you calling his name, or his collar and lead being fetched prior to a walk.

, Licking or chewing their paws is a comfort mechanism for dogs, and can be a sign of depression., Depressed dogs tend to keep their heads lowered when standing or sitting. When lying down your dog prefers to rest his chin on the ground, and rarely raises his head in response to activity going on around him.

, When a dog is depressed, the tail is held down or between the legsand doesn't wag as readily. When you encourage your dog to wag his tail, the motion is subdued and half-hearted. , Depressed dogs tend to stand in a passive way, with their heads down and tails lowered, barely reacting to encouragement. Your dog may give the impression of feeling sluggish, and will lack interest in what's going on around him.

, When dogs are stressed, they tend to shed much more heavily.If you pet your dog and your hand comes away covered in hair, or if you are suddenly having to vacuum much more often, your dog may be depressed.

, If your dog is behaving in an unusual manner, it is wise to get him checked out by a vet. There is often a cross over in symptoms between depression and sickness, and it is not always easy to tell the difference because both sick and depressed dogs tend to be off their food, and are reluctant to exercise., A healthy dog is unlikely to become depressed for no reason, therefore it is helpful to know if a recent event has impacted your dog's mental well-being. Dogs are routine driven, so the most common trigger for canine depression is a change of routine.Changes in routine that can trigger depression may include:


Stress: In doggy terms stress includes anything that stops him from getting the attention he is used to.
A stay-at-home owner who now goes out to work.
A new baby, or puppy, in the household.
The sudden loss of a companion (human or canine).
Moving house.
Being re-homed.
Major building work or renovations in the home.

, Go for more walks, play games your dog likes (fetch, tug-of-war), try a canine sport like agility, train your dog to do tricks, head to the dog park. When you watch TV, sit on the floor at your dog’s level instead of in a chair. Whatever you decide to do, make sure it is fun for both you and your dog. Spending enjoyable time with you is the best way to help your dog overcome his depression.

, If your dog has recently lost a canine companion, consider getting a new one. If your dog is home alone for long hours, try daycare a few days a week or having a walker come by. Also plan trips to the park so that your dog can socialize., The mistake many owners make when dealing with a depressed dog is that they fuss over them when the dog is behaving abnormally.


For example, if you make a fuss out of your dog when he doesn't eat, you inadvertently send him the message that he is doing a clever thing by not eating.
A much better way of handling the situation is to put the food bowl down and ignore the dog until he decides to eat. Then once he takes a mouthful, heap him with praise.
This reinforces positive rather than negative behaviors and will help to lift your dog from his depression.

, Try to keep a depressed dog in his regular routine, since this helps him feel secure, and reassures him that all is well with the world.

, It is possible that your dog has a chemical imbalance and may need drugs like Prozac, as well as a behavioral modification program, to overcome his depression.

Get the dog to stand up or lie on its side.,
Put your hand where a back leg meets the belly.,
Feel for a heartbeat in the dog's chest.,
Find a pulse on the back feet.,
Set a stopwatch for 15 seconds.,
Count the beats.,
Multiply by four.,
Determine if the pulse is normal or not.,
Seek veterinary help.",How to Measure a Dog's Pulse," You will be feeling for its pulse, so you need to be able to access the dog's chest and belly., The most reliable place to take a dog's pulse is its femoral artery, in the groin. Put your fingers over the depression where the dog's back leg meets its belly, and press gently.If you can't find a pulse right away, move your fingers around in the area until you feel it.Your dog can be standing or lying on its side while you feel for its pulse.

, If you can't locate the femoral artery, try to find a pulse by feeling the dog's chest. While your dog is standing up, face your dog and place your hand over the rib cage.


You should be able to feel the heartbeat just below the dog's elbow joint.If none of this works, place your hand of the dogs left side, just behind the front leg. A pulse can often be felt in this way., Finally, if you don't have success with these approaches, you can sometimes feel a pulse near a dog's back feet. Feel the dog's foot with your fingertips, halfway between the toes and the ankle/wrist joint.This is called the ""pedal pulse.""

, Heart rates are measured in beats per minute (BPM). However, it is easy to lose count when you are trying to take a pulse for a full 60 seconds. Instead, set a stopwatch for 15 seconds.You can use a watch with a second hand or the stopwatch function on your phone.

, Place your fingers on the area you've chosen to feel for a pulse, start the stopwatch, and count the beats of the dog's heart until the the time is up.


Use your fingers only. If you use your thumb, you may end up feeling your own pulse, especially if you press too hard., To convert your measure to BPM, all you have to do is multiply by four.Four times 15 seconds is 60 seconds, or one minute.

, Knowing your dog's heartrate is only helpful if you know what it should be. The bigger the dog, the slower its pulse will be. Generally, the following is considered normal:For dogs under 20 pounds: 70-180 bpm.
For dogs over 20 pounds: 60-140 bpm.
For puppies up to six weeks old: up to 220 bpm.
Note that for some dogs, their pulse may quicken when they inhale and slow when they exhale. This is a normal condition called sinus arrhythmia., If your dog's pulse is above or below the healthy range for its weight, or is weak or irregular, seek the attention of a veterinarian as soon as possible. This can be a sign of serious health issues.


A fast heart rate might just indicate your dog is anxious. A persistently fast pulse, however, could indicate your dog is suffering from blood loss, dehydration, fever and heatstroke.A slow heart rate could indicate your dog is in shock or is suffering from heart disease.A slow pulse could also be a sign of sinus bradycardia, which is caused by slower-than-normal firing of the sinoatrial node of the nervous system. While this condition is often benign, it can also be related to neurological or respiratory disease, and can also be brought on by hypothermia.Heart issues should be considered a medical emergency. If your regular vet is not available to see your dog right away, search online for an emergency veterinary facility near you. This goes double if your dog is injured or has other obvious symptoms."

Keep your hands out of your dog’s mouth.,
Soothe your dog after the seizure.,
Pay attention to the duration of your dog’s seizures.",How to Help a Dog Who Has Canine Epilepsy1," Your dog is going to be scared and confused during and after a seizure, so it is crucial to do everything that you can to help them feel less afraid. If your dog suffers from frequent seizures, you will also want to learn how to recognize the signs of a seizure so that you can prepare. Some simple steps that you can take to comfort your dog during a seizure include:Placing a cushion or pillow beneath your dog’s head. This will help to protect your dog's head during a seizure.
Speaking to your dog in a low, soothing voice. Say things like, ""It's okay, buddy. That's a good dog. Easy, easy, I got you.""
Petting your dog in a calming, gentle way. You may also consider letting your dog lay across your lap or holding them if they are a small dog.;
, It is a misconception that dogs will swallow their tongues, and under no circumstances should you stick your hand or fingers into your dog's mouth when they are having a seizure. You will get bit. Do not try to put any objects into your dog’s mouth either or your dog may break a tooth or even choke., It is important to get your dog calmed down before taking any other action. Sometimes the seizure may restart if your dog is very nervous and/or tries to get up before they have recovered. Continue soothing your dog and stay close for a while after the episode.To help your dog relax, keep the room quiet. Turn off the television and TV and don’t allow more than one or two people in the room. Take other pets out of the room as well.

, Try to keep track of how long the seizures last. If your phone is handy, taking a video of the event may also help the veterinarian to diagnose your dog.


If the seizure continues for longer than five minutes, get your pet to a veterinary emergency room as soon as possible. Long seizures can exhaust the respiratory muscles and this can interfere with your dog's ability to breathe."

Keep calm.,
Make sure your dog is comfortable.,
Phone the veterinarian and seek an urgent care appointment.,
Understand what your veterinarian will do for your dog.",How to Recognize a Stroke in Dogs2," If you believe your dog has had a stroke, the first thing to do is keep calm. Your dog will need your help in order to survive, so keep your wits about you and focus on helping your pup.

, Put the dog in a quiet, warm environment. Make him or her as comfortable as possible by placing it on a padded bed and removing nearby furniture it could hurt itself on.


If your dog is unable to stand, turn it to lie on the opposite side of its body every half an hour to reduce the risk of pneumonia because of blood pooling in one side of his lungs.
Put water near your dog so it can drink without getting up. If it doesn't want to drink for a long time, wipe its gums with a wet cloth to give it some moisture.

, If this emergency happens on a weekend or late at night, call your vets emergency line. If you get not response, you may need to find an emergency veterinary clinic to take your dog to.


Make note of your dog's symptoms so you can relay them to the veterinarian over the phone. It's important to know the strength and length of symptoms, so that you can properly communicate the severity of your dog's condition to the vet.

, The priorities for treatment of a dog that has had a stroke include minimizing swelling to the brain and maximizing oxygen to the brain.This will be done with medication and medical care. In addition, your veterinary office will be able to take care of secondary concerns, such as keeping your dog hydrated and comfortable.

Understand the basics aspects of a stroke.,
Figure out if your dog is in an ""at risk"" category for stroke.,
Think about other risk factors.,
Know that dogs differ from people.",How to Recognize a Stroke in Dogs3," A stroke is caused by an interruption to the blood flow to part of the brain. It is a hallmark of strokes that they have a sudden onset, because of the sudden nature of a blood clot switching off the blood supply to part of the brain. The exact symptoms depend on which precise area of the brain is affected, but there are several symptoms held in common, no matter where the blood clot lodges.A stroke is almost always caused by a blood clot which lodges and causes obstruction in the blood vessel, but it is also possible that it's caused by a plug of fat that has dislodged and circulated to the brain. A stroke can even be caused by a plug of bacteria in the brain.
For many years there was dispute amongst veterinarians about whether animals had strokes or not. But this argument has now been largely won by the ""yes they do happen"" camp, because sophisticated imaging techniques, such as MRI scans, have produced pictures of the blockages in the brain., Those dogs most at risk are often older, and have pre-existing health condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or Cushing's disease. Some veterinarians anecdotally report that dogs with underactive thyroid glands are at increased risk of stroke, but the data to prove this is lacking.

, Other problems that can predispose a dog to a stroke include heartworm, where larvae can break off and circulate to the brain to cause a blockage. Also at risks are dogs with a history of clotting problems, with kidney disease, a high fever, or cancer.The lowest risk group for stroke are young, fit dogs with no health problems that are regularly treated against heartworm.

, Be aware that a stroke in a dog has a different presentation to in people. Whereas a person may be affected down one side of their body and their speech may be affected, this is not the case with dogs. They present in the ways described above."

Take your dog to see a veterinarian.,
Ask about medications.,
Expect sedative effects.,
Talk to your veterinarian about sedating your dog during stressful situations.,
Monitor your dog’s condition.",How to Help a Dog Who Has Canine Epilepsy2," Once the seizure is over, it is important to take your dog to the veterinarian for an examination. This examination will consist of numerous tests to rule out other causes of seizures, which will help your veterinarian to determine the best treatment option for your dog. If these tests are all negative, then your dog may be suffering from primary seizure disorder and your veterinarian will discuss medications with you.

, There are several medications available that reduce the number and severity of seizures in dogs. Most of these medications need to be given daily and will need to be continued for the rest of your dog’s life. The primary options include:Imepitoin. This is a new medication and has replaced phenobarbital as the treatment of choice. It reaches therapeutic blood levels faster than other medications, quickly suppressing seizures by returning the brain to equilibrium.

Phenobarbital. This is another common medication used for dogs with epilepsy. It works by suppressing seizure activity in the brain.

Potassium bromide. This drug is used if phenobarbital causes health problems. Sodium bromide may be used as an alternative to potassium bromide. They both decrease seizure activity in the brain.

Gabapentin. This antiepileptic drug is commonly combined with another medication to help control generalized seizures.

Diazepam. This drug is commonly used as a sedative instead of a regular drug to control seizures, but it may be used if your dog’s seizures are frequent and long-lasting.

, Most anti-epileptic drugs will cause some sedation early on, but most dogs will adjust to this sedative effect. Sometimes, too, combination drug therapy can help lessen sedation if your dog seems to react strongly to one medication.


Keep in mind that medication may affect your dog's liver and kidneys, so you should weigh the cost/benefit of treatment versus coping with the occasional seizure.

, If your dog is very high strung, you may have to use sedatives to prevent seizures during times of stress. Talk to your veterinarian about giving your dog an occasional sedative for these types stressful situations.You may want to sedate your dog on certain holidays, such as Independence Day in the USA, or others holidays when fireworks are used.
You may also want to sedate your dog if you will have a full house and your dog is stressed by strangers.
Even during thunderstorms, you may need to tranquilize your dog to get them through the frightening noises and flashes of light.

, Canine epilepsy, while treatable in most dogs, is a progressive problem. Even with medication, some dogs may continue to have seizures now and then. If episodes become more frequent or severe, consult your dog’s veterinarian immediately.Keep in mind that as your dog gets older, seizures and episodes can become more frequent and severe.

Understand the types of epilepsy.,
Know how to identify a grand mal seizure.,
Identify a generalized seizure.,
Watch for signs of an oncoming seizure.",How to Help a Dog Who Has Canine Epilepsy3," Dogs suffer from two main types of epilepsy: primary and secondary. Primary epilepsy tends to strike young dogs (under two years of age) as it is a genetic disorder although it can take until the age of six to manifest.This condition is also known as idiopathic epilepsy. Secondary epilepsy may occur at any age. This type of epilepsy is often due to another problem that affects the neurological system, such as an infection, a disease, a brain injury, a stroke or brain tumor., In a grand mal seizure, the dog falls to its side and becomes rigid while thrashing its limbs. It may howl, salivate, bite, urinate and/or defecate during the seizure, which will last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Keep in mind that not all dogs have grand mal seizures. Some dogs may have less severe or obvious seizures., Some dogs may suffer from seizure that prompt them to move in a strange way or do something repetitive such as licking or walking in a circle. Pay attention to any unusual behavior that your dog displays. If you are unsure if this behavior is a seizure or not, talk to your veterinarian., Prior to a seizure, your dog may sense that something isn't right and begin to react. You may notice your dog doing certain things before a seizure such as:Acting clingy
Pacing
Whining
Vomiting
Looking dazed or confused

Brush your dog every day.,
Give your dog a weekly bath.,
Reduce your dog’s stress levels.,
Purchase a doggy leotard.,
Talk to your vet.,
Be wary of supposed quick fixes.",How to Control Shedding (Dogs)1," Remove your dog’s excess hair in a controlled way by brushing it regularly, at least once a day. These brushing sessions should not last long, only a few minutes, but should become part of your regular routine. You can use a rake-style brush to reduce a thick undercoat, or even a brush-glove to mimic the action of petting and reduce your dog’s anxiety.Many people prefer to brush their dog outdoors to reduce fur scattering in the home. If you do this, just make sure that the weather is suitable, not too cold or wet.
If your dog is a family pet, get everyone to take turns doing the brushing by assigning them ‘brush duty’ on particular days.
If you take your dog to a groomer on a monthly basis, ask them what tools they would suggest for daily grooming. They may suggest a mat brush for difficult areas or even a blade-style comb.;
, Bathing your dog on a regular basis will wash away excess hair while keeping it clean as well. Choose a warm water temperature and bathe your dog in a bathtub for the quickest and easiest process. For even better results, apply an anti-shed shampoo, such as Groomers Blend Shed Defense Shampoo or Shed-X Shed Control Shampoo.Keep a close eye on your dog’s skin and if you notice signs of dryness, such as flakes, go ahead and spread out the baths to every other week.
Anti-shed shampoos work by moisturizing your dog’s skin. You can also create homemade dog shampoo by blending 1 cup of raw oatmeal with 1 quart of water and 1 cup of baking soda., Heavy shedding can be a sign of stress in some dogs. If you’ve made a recent life change, such as moving, that could have your dog stressed out, make sure to spend some extra quality time with them. Exercising or playing outdoors is often a good way to reduce stress and strengthen your bond with your dog., This may sound a bit odd, but there are various full-body and shirt-style garments that dogs can wear to minimize shedding in the home. The hair falls off into the garment, which is then washed frequently. Some owners also use these items, such as Shed Defender, as a way to reduce their dog’s stress during car rides or thunderstorms., You can either ask your vet about the shedding during an annual visit, or you can make a specific appointment to discuss this issue. Expect your vet to look over your dog and then present you with a variety of options. If your dog is excessively shedding, it is possible that they need allergy medication or even treatment for the itching that comes with fleas or other pests.Make an appointment immediately if you see open sores or a rash on your dog’s skin as it may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as mange., If you look around online, there are a variety of websites and blogs that offer creams or bizarre suggestions to reduce your dog’s shedding. Apply common sense to these solutions before you attempt them on your pet. Using a fabric softener sheet as a brush (one digital suggestion), for example, can leave your dog with chemical burns."

Pour ½ cup (120 ml) of water into a glass.,
Soak the toothbrush for 30 minutes.,
Replace the toothbrush.",How to Clean Your Dog's Toothbrush," Sharing toothbrushes can lead to an exchange of microorganisms. Use a separate toothbrush for each of your dogs to prevent infection or illness., After brushing your dog’s teeth, rinse the toothbrush under warm water. Remove any toothpaste, food particles, and debris from the toothbrush with your thumb. You can also use a toothpick to remove smaller particles., Place your dog’s toothbrush upright in its own open-air holder. Do not store it in a drawer or a closed container. Closed spaces create moist environments where mold, bacteria, and microorganisms can grow.Store your dog’s toothbrush in a separate holder to prevent cross-contamination with your toothbrush.

, Then, add in a ½ cup (120 ml) of white distilled vinegar to make a 50% vinegar solution.Vinegar is a natural disinfectant that will not harm your dog.

, Place the head of your dog’s toothbrush into the glass with the mixture. Let it sit in the mixture for 30 minutes. Remove the toothbrush after 30 minutes, and rinse it well with warm water.Disinfect your dog's toothbrush every four to six weeks, or as needed.

, When you can visibly see discoloration, a buildup of residue, and a matting or fraying of the toothbrush bristles, then it is time to replace your dog’s toothbrush with a new one. Your dog’s toothbrush should look clean and straight at all times.Try to replace your dog’s toothbrush every four months.
You can also purchase a pack of disposable toothbrushes at your local pet supply or grooming store, or online.

Inspect the general condition of your dog's ears.,
Look for parasites and foreign bodies in the ear.,
Inspect the ears for any signs of a yeast infection.A yeast infection makes the ears smell funky, itchy and produce a brownish discharge.,
Look for the signs of a bacterial infection in the outer part of the ear.Bacterial ear infections can range from a mild infection easily cleared with medication to serious infections causing the dog to feel very unwell.,
Keep an eye out for anything that might be a tumor, but remember that these are rare.Occasionally, odd lumps or bumps are found in and around the ears.,
Purchase a commercial dog ear cleaner or make you own with common household products.,
Dip a cotton ball into the liquid.,
Gently swab the inside of your dog's ear flap.,
Irrigate your dog's ears fully only if it's recommended to do so by a veterinarian.,
Let your dog clear out its ears after cleaning.,
Clean your dog's ears regularly.",How to Clean Your Dog's Ears," Have your dog sit or stand near you so you can see easily in its ears. If all you see is dirt or normal earwax you can begin cleaning your dog's ears.


Look for any drainage of fluid from the ear (clear or gray/brown), thick waxy material, or any scratches, scabs or wounds. If you see any of these signs DO NOT clean the ear and contact your dog’s veterinarian for advice.
You will not be able to see deep into the ear canal, as at the base of the ear, where it meets the head, it takes a sharp turn. Therefore, it is not advised to do a deep cleaning into the ears without instructions from your veterinarian. NEVER use a Q tip in the canal itself as you can compact material into this sharp turn or even rupture the eardrum.;
, Dogs can harbor any number of unwanted entities in their ears. Dogs that frequently run through grasses or wooded areas can get foreign bodies such as plant awns, grass, or seeds in their ears. If you notice any of these problems, you can first try to (very gently) remove the offending object or try to clean the ears to remove these things. If this doesn’t work, you will need to take your dog to your veterinary professional.


Mites, ticks and fleas all enjoy the relatively hidden spots in and around the ears. Mites make the ears intensely itchy and can make the ear produce a thick, brown discharge. You will need to have a veterinarian diagnose and treat ear mites. Ticks and fleas can be killed (and prevented) by the various topical flea and tick prevented easily purchased from your veterinarian.

, These fungal infections need special medicine to clear the infection; cleaning alone will not cure a yeast infection, in fact it might make the condition worsen. Take your dog to its veterinarian if you see any of these symptoms.

, A veterinarian needs to be involved in the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial ear infections due to the potential for serious complications.

, Most times these lumps and bumps are nothing but skin cysts or reactions to trauma or bug bites.


Carefully watch these at home. If they don’t go away within a week, grow larger, or bother your dog, consult a veterinarian.

, Either cleaner can be used on the outer portion of the inside of the ear flap. The procedure for cleaning the ear is the same with a commercial ear cleaner as it is with the homemade version.


Mix a few tablespoons of vinegar and the same amount of rubbing alcohol together in a clean bowl. Make sure it is at room temperature prior to using, as no one, dogs included, likes cold fluid on their ears. This mixture is safe to use on the visible inner part of your dog’s ears. DO NOT use this mix if you suspect your dog has an ear infection and do not pour into the ear canal itself.
There are many good all-purpose dog ear cleaners on the market. Ask your veterinarian for advice on what you can purchase locally. You can also ask for recommendations at your local pet supply store.

, Squeeze out the excess so the cotton is wet but not dripping. If you have a very small dog, you may want to use half of a cotton ball.


Alternatively, you can wrap a piece of gauze loosely around your pointer finger and dip it in the liquid. The gauze shouldn't be sopping wet. If you accidentally put too much cleaner on it, wring it out a bit and continue. This is a gentler alternative to a Q-Tip, which can make your dog a bit uncomfortable. Just hold the gauze in place with your thumb and index finger.

, Remove all dirt and debris you can see. If your dog has very dirty ears, the process may take quite a few cotton balls. As long as you're gentle and stay towards the front of the hearing canal, your dog should tolerate this procedure very well.


Clean gently though, as the skin can be easily broken. Vinegar and alcohol can sting broken skin.
Make sure to gently clean out the crevices as dirt and wax can build up in these areas.
Clean the inside of both ears.

, If your veterinarian advises, usually because the ears are packed full of dirt and wax, you can use the ear cleaner to irrigate (or drench the ears). This should remove much of the sticky thick material from the ear canal.


To do so, position the tip of the ear cleaner bottle right at the opening to the ear canal inside the ear flap. Squeeze the bottle to drench the ear canal with fluid. Gently rub the base of the ear (thumb on one side, fingers on others) and massage the ear (very gently!) in this manner for 60 seconds.
Use gauze or cotton to clean out the gunk that comes out of the ear. Most likely you will use a lot if the ears are full of debris.

, It is natural for your dog to want to shake his or her head after cleaning. Let it do so, but turn your face so you don’t get fluid or debris in your eyes. This will help to clean any excess cleaning fluid out of the ear canal.


After your dog has shaken out any excess liquid, give the ears another wipe with gauze or cotton balls. This will remove any material brought out from the ear canal during the head shaking.

, A weekly ear inspection and cleaning (if necessary) would be a great schedule to adhere to and will help you keep on top of any potential ear health problems. Dirt accumulates rather fast and can lead to an infection, especially with floppy-eared canines.

Choose the right dog food.,
Add oil to your dog’s food.,
Add a supplement to your dog’s diet.",How to Control Shedding (Dogs)2," A food with a high protein and moisture content can result in a healthier coat for your dog and may lessen shedding. If you use dry dog food, look for brands that list meat (chicken or beef, usually) as the primary ingredient. This will ensure that the food has a substantial amount of protein, which promotes hair health. If you use wet dog food, the high water content will benefit your dog's coat by keeping their hair follicles hydrated.Some anti-shed dog foods also add in various types of omega-3 fatty acids as a way to enrich your dog's coat and lessen shedding. These dog brands are often categorized as ""premium"" by veterinarians and may cost a bit more.

, This is a cheap and easy way to add nutrients to your dog’s diet. Simply spoon olive oil directly onto your dog’s food prior to serving. You should go by the rule of 1 teaspoon of oil for every 15 pounds of weight. You can also use vegetable oil, but it will give your dog the extra moisture without the fatty benefits of olive oil.If your dog has a sensitive stomach, consult with a veterinarian prior to adding oil to your dog's diet.

, If your vet determines that your dog’s shedding is not serious, but can be addressed, ask them about giving your dog supplements. Some supplements on the market contain vitamins (D-3) or oils (flaxseed). Some are flavored or chewable to appeal to finicky dogs.Make sure to follow your vet's instructions regarding supplement use. Too many supplements can actually harm your dog’s health instead of helping it.

Get rid of hair ASAP.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Use couch and seat covers.,
Use a sticky roller.,
Use an air purifier.,
Control your dog's allergies.",How to Control Shedding (Dogs)3," The longer that hair stays in your home, the more likely it is to become matted and stuck in difficult-to-remove places. As soon as you see a clump of hair, grab your hand-vac and pick it up. Or, wipe down the area with a wet paper towel to remove dander as well. This constant up-keep may seem tedious, but it will create a cleaner home., Dog hair has a tendency to get stuck in carpeted floors, which reduces scatter, but can create an unsightly accumulation of fur. At least once a week, spend a bit of time vacuuming your floors and baseboards. To remove dog hair on hardwood floors, use a wet sweeper or mop., Even if your dog isn’t allowed on the furniture, its hair will find its way there anyway. Avoid ruining your furniture by investing in quality slipcovers or simply throwing sheets or towels over your couch or chairs. Wash these covers on a regular basis and take them off when you are expecting company.Some dog owners also find it worthwhile to purchase furniture with slippery fabrics, such as leather, which makes it possible to wipe off any hair accumulations.
If you choose to forego slipcovers, remove dog hair from fabric furniture by putting on a pair of rubber gloves and then wiping your hands across the item’s surface.Don’t forget to clean your window coverings as well, especially if they are made from textured fabrics. They will accumulate dog hair over time, often concentrated in the parts close to the floor., This is a great option for in-home quick hair removals and for removing hair from clothing. Simply roll a sticky roller over the object and the hair is picked up. The best investment is to purchase a washable roller that you can throw in the laundry between uses., If your dog is shedding hair they are likely dropping dander and dead skin cells as well. To remove these potential allergens, it is a good idea to use a plug-in air purifier. You can get a small purifier to place in a central location in your house fairly cheap., Your dog's own dander and hair may make their own allergies worsen over time. If you find that your dog seems to suffer from an ongoing cold, if they sneeze a great deal, or itch their skin constantly, you may want to consult with your vet. It is likely that your vet will talk with you about a medical treatment for allergies.

Get the right tool for the job.,
Use products that can assist you with grooming.,
Choose a soft brush for daily brushing.,
Make sure that all tools are in good repair.,
Consider using a professional groomer.,
Avoid putting the dog in an uncomfortable position.,
Place the dog on a soft, non-skid surface.,
Allow grooming sessions to be short in duration.",How to Choose Grooming Tools for an Aging Dog," As with grooming all dogs, it's important to have tools that are made for the dog you are grooming. However, it can be even more important with older dogs, as their body surfaces can be more easily damaged due to mishandling. For instance, remember that there are separate tools for getting mats out of a dog's coat, daily brushing, or combing out long or short fur.


For example, using a brush made for short fur on an elderly dog with long fur can damage its coat and even rip out skin due to the delicate nature of older dog's skin.;
, As your dog gets older you may need to do new types of grooming associated with aging. There are products, such as detangler, that can help you to do this grooming. For example, if you are trying to get rid of mats in your dog's fur, you can buy products that help get them out, such as mat detangler.This new grooming includes keeping sensitive areas, such as its rear end, clean that your dog used to clean on its own. In order to do this, you can buy products designed to help.
Products designed to assist you with grooming are usually available at pet stores. Consider browsing the grooming section at your local pet store and see if any of the products may be of use to you.
If you can't find what you need at your local store, it is probably available online.

, In order to keep an old dog's fur from getting matted and unsightly, you should brush it daily. However, you should use a soft brush to do this daily brushing. A soft brush is easier on the dog's coat, and it will reduce the risk of damaging the dog's fragile skin.


Brushing a dog daily is actually more important as the dog gets older. As it gets older the dog will be able to do less and less grooming itself and will need to rely on you to keep its coat in good condition.It may take more time to actually get tangles and debris out of a dog's coat with a soft brush. However, the extra time you spend brushing your dog gently will be wonderful for bonding with it and soothing it.

, Having tools that are damaged or in disrepair can make the grooming process uncomfortable or even painful for an elderly dog. Make sure clippers are oiled and working well, that trimmers are sharp, and that brushes and combs don't have broken or sharp tines or bristles.Grooming tools that are in disrepair can injure an older dog. For example, if a brush has a sharp metal bristle it can rip a older dogs skin, as the dog's skin may be very thin due to age.

, As your dog ages, it will need more attention paid to its physical upkeep. This means that it should be groomed more often to avoid matting, overgrown nails, and general uncleanliness. In order to keep up with this maintenance, you might consider taking your dog to a groomer that is skilled at this type of work.A good professional groomer will inspect your dogs overall hygiene and may find problems that you did not know existed such as fecal matter sticking to the fur and skin or urine scalding.If you are unsure where to take your dog for grooming, get a recommendation from your veterinarian or a friend that you trust., An older dog may not be able to get into, or stay in, a standing position.However, loss of mobility does not mean that a dog shouldn't get groomed. Instead, work with the dog to find a variety of comfortable positions it is willing to get into that, in combination, can allow you to do all the grooming you need to do.


Trying to get an aging dog into a position that is uncomfortable or even painful for it will only make the process more unpleasant for the dog.
If your dog experiences pain or discomfort sitting or standing in certain positions, talk to your vet to get recommendations regarding how to make your dog more comfortable.

, An aging dog needs to be allowed to be as comfortable as possible if you want it to cooperate with the grooming process. In order to make it comfortable you need to place it on a soft surface that is not slippery. The softness will keep its body comfortable and the non-skid surface will help it to stay steady when you are grooming it.A good surface to use is a rubber kitchen or bath mat. They are soft, non-skid, and can be easily cleaned after the grooming process is over.

, An older dog may need to move around and stretch its body to remain comfortable. If you sense that your dog is getting uncomfortable, allow the grooming session to end and return to it later when the dog is energized.


If you are taking your elderly dog to a groomer to get groomed, you may want to stay there while the dog gets groomed. This will allow you to be there if there are any problems but it also makes it so that the dog does not have to stay at the groomers for any longer than is necessary.

Prepare your dog.,
Be systematic about brushing.,
Spray on some coat conditioner.,
Use a rubber brush or curry comb to loosen dead skin and dirt.,
Use firm, but gentle strokes.,
Brush in the same order every time.,
Groom your dog's ears.,
Take care of your pet's feet.,
Remove any remaining loose, dead hair.,
Tailor your grooming routine to your dog's specific breed.,
Avoid over-grooming.",How to Brush Your Dog1," Find a safe, quiet place to brush your dog. If the weather is nice, outdoors is a good bet because you won't have to worry as much about cleaning up the dead hair. Make sure your dog feels comfortable with you, and speak in a calm, reassuring voice throughout the grooming session.


Ask your dog to sit, and then give them a treat. Always try to start your grooming ritual on a good note.
Let your dog sniff the brushes and tools you are using, before you begin.;
, Try to follow a regular schedule, and brush short and medium haired pets about once a week. Long haired dogs usually need to be brushed daily. For all brushing steps, begin at your dog's head and work toward his tail. Brushing the same way every time will help keep you from skipping a step, and will also be reassuring for your dog.Some professional groomers say that starting with the tail and working forward helps keep very nervous dogs calm, because they can't see what is happening at first.If you plan to bathe your dog, brush her first. Tangles become tighter and harder to remove when they are wet.

, If your pet has very tangled hair, or if he has long hair that is prone to mats, spray on a commercial pet coat product such as mink oil before brushing. This will help loosen knots and tangles., Rubber curry combs are great to use on the paws, ears, and tail, as long as you work gently. Using the rubber comb in a gentle, circular motion all over your dog will help distribute oils and keep her coat soft and shiny.Never use a metal curry comb on your dog – these are used to clean fur out of other brushes. Metal curry combs are too harsh to use on your pet's delicate skin.

, On thick coats, brush against the grain starting at the skin and brushing outward. Then start over, brushing in the same direction as hair growth. For all other coats, brush in the same direction the hair grows.


Brush the hair close to your pet's skin, but do not brush the skin itself. This can cause red, irritated skin called “brush burn,” which may need to be treated by your vet.Use long strokes for long-haired dogs.
Use short strokes for dogs with short or wiry hair.

, Brush your dog's neck ruff and any feathering on her legs. If your dog has longer hair around his neck on on his legs, you may want to use a comb to detangle any knots before brushing. Then gently brush his underbelly, sides, back, rear end, hind legs, and tail.


Be very careful when brushing your pet's delicate underbelly. Never brush directly on the skin.
Also be very careful when brushing his face – for most dogs, facial hair can be groomed with a damp cloth. Longer hair can be gently groomed with a comb.

, Cleaning your dog's ears weekly will be make him feel more comfortable, and will help avoid ear infections. If your dog has long hair on his ears, trim it gently with scissors. Check the area thoroughly for ear mites, ticks, and fleas. Then use a cotton ball or piece of surgical gauze soaked in an ear cleaning solution, or a baby wipe wrapped around your finger and gently wipe the inside surface of your dog’s ears.Avoid using water in your dog's ears – it doesn’t evaporate very easily and can lead to ear infections.
Never use Q-tips or try to put anything in your dog's ear canal – this can easily cause a painful ear injury.
If you notice an unusual smell or a discharge coming from your dog’s ears, bring it to your veterinarian’s attention.

, Keeping the hair on your dog's feet neat and tidy not only looks good, it reduces the number of things that will get caught there, like burrs, road tar, ice chunks, bugs, and road tar. Trim the hair on the top of your dog's foot carefully with scissors, along with the hair on the bottom of his paw so that the hair is about even with the pads of his foot. Do not try to trim the hair between the toes or pads of the feet – you could injure your dog if he moves suddenly., Follow with a comb on long haired dogs to remove loose hair. You can also use a small, hand-held vacuum if you are careful and your dog isn't afraid of the noise. If your dog has a smooth, short coat like a Chihuahua or Boxer, use a chamois cloth to polish her coat., Various breeds of dogs have different types of coats, and they each have their own grooming requirements. How frequently you need to groom, are based on three main factors: whether his coat is short or long (over one inch), whether he has a single or double coat, and whether he has feathering (longer fringe on the neck, ears, legs, and tail.)Breeds with long, silky, single coats – such as Maltese and Yorkshire Terriers – are highly prone to tangles. Comb these dogs daily, or at a minimum once every two days.
Breeds with feathering – such as Cocker Spaniels, Shih Tzus, Lhasa Apsos, Irish Setters, and Golden Retrievers – will require frequent combing along with brushing.
Double coated dogs – such as Pomeranians, Shetland Sheepdogs, Siberian Huskies, and Samoyeds – shed more than other dogs, and their undercoat needs to be brushed thoroughly during shedding seasons.
Many short haired breeds – such as Chihuahuas, Labrador Retrievers, and Greyhounds – can go as long as two weeks between brushing.

, Try to stick to a regular routine when brushing or bathing, and always work gently. It's difficult to hurt your dog by brushing him too often, but brushing too hard or with the wrong type of brush – for example, a slicker brush on a short-haired breed – can cause painful skin irritation.Bathing too often can strip the natural oils from your pet's skin, causing dry, itchy patches.
Bathing without the proper coat conditioning can dry his coat, making it brittle and dry.

Consult your vet.",How to Clean Your Dog's Teeth," Do not use human toothpaste or toothbrushes to clean your dog’s teeth. Human toothpaste contains high amounts of fluoride, which is poisonous to dogs. Visit your local pet supply or pet grooming store to purchase dog toothpaste and a toothbrush. You can also make your own doggie toothpaste by mixing baking soda with water.Mix a tablespoon of hot water with two tablespoons of baking soda. To add freshness to the paste, add a pinch of cinnamon to the mix.;
, Bring your dog to the bathroom, or an area away from noise and commotion, and close the door. Also, choose a space that has good lighting so you can inspect your dog’s teeth thoroughly.Bring some doggie treats with you so you can reward your dog for good behavior throughout the process.

, Get your dog accustomed to having its teeth brushed by massaging your dog’s lips with your finger, first. Massage your dog’s lips in a circular motion for 30 to 60 seconds once per day for a week.


This step is especially important if your dog has an adverse reaction to its mouth being touched. If your dog has an adverse reaction, stop what you are doing. Try again after a minute.
Reward your dog with a treat for good behavior.

, The following week, move on to touching your dog’s teeth and gums with your finger. Wrap your finger in gauze. Lift and hold your dog’s upper lip. Gently rub your finger in a circular motion over your dog’s upper teeth. Do this for 30 seconds.Hold down your dog’s lower lip and apply the same circular motion to its bottom teeth for 30 seconds.
Practice doing this once a day for a week. Remember to give your dog a treat for good behavior afterwards.

, Introduce the toothpaste to your dog by placing some on your finger. Let your dog smell and lick the toothpaste from your finger. By doing this, your dog will get used to the taste and texture of the toothpaste.You can do this either before or after you massage your dog’s teeth with your finger.

, Introduce the toothbrush by touching the front, side, and back teeth with the brush. Touch both top and bottom teeth with the brush. Do this for 30 seconds on both top and bottom teeth once per day for a week.Make sure to reward your dog for good behavior afterwards.

, Once your dog is familiar with the whole process, you can begin to brush its teeth. Before you start, place a dab of toothpaste on your finger and let your dog lick it off. Then, place more toothpaste on the toothbrush., At a 45-degree angle, place the toothbrush on its upper teeth while holding its lip. Massage the teeth with the toothbrush in small, circular motions, just like you practiced. The sides of the teeth that touch the lip will have the most plaque and tartar build-up. Focus on these areas. Only work on small areas at a time, lifting your dog’s lip as necessary.When removing tartar and plaque, use downward strokes for the top teeth.
Hold down your dog’s bottom lip and massage the outsides of the bottom teeth in the same circular motion. Use upward strokes to remove tartar from the bottom teeth.

, Once you have cleaned the outsides of the teeth, attempt to brush the insides of the teeth. Your dog might resist. If it does, don’t fight your dog, but cease from brushing. Only small amounts of tartar accumulate on the insides of the teeth. Therefore, it is not as important as the sides of the teeth.Don’t forget to reward your dog for good behavior afterwards.

, It is recommended that you brush your dog’s teeth daily, but at least three times a week. Since smaller dogs are more likely to develop dental issues, it is recommended that you brush their teeth every day or at least five times a week.Healthy gums are pink, not cherry red or white, and show no signs of swelling or bleeding.

, Nylon, rubber, or toxin-free rawhide chew toys are also a great way to keep your dog’s teeth and gums strong and healthy. Chewing on a toy can help massage the gums and scrape away soft tartar.Reward your dog with treats that are specially formulated to keep your dog’s teeth healthy.Chew toys and soft chews should not replace regular brushing.

, Have your vet examine your dog’s teeth to rule out any existing infections or diseases. Ask your vet about the dental care your specific dog’s breed needs. Some dogs, especially smaller dogs, are more prone to dental diseases and infections, like gingivitis and gum disease. Your vet can recommend a teeth-cleaning regimen that caters to your dog’s needs.


Take your dog to the vet immediately if it is suffering from any of these symptoms: inflamed or swollen gums, loose or decayed teeth, tooth pain, i.e., pawing at the mouth, lumps in the gums, i.e., mouth tumors, or fluid filled blisters under the tongue or near the corners of the jaw, i.e, salivary cysts."

Accept your dog’s natural scratch reflex.,
Identify your dog’s ticklish spots.,
Brush the saddle region carefully.,
Steer clear of ticklish feet, tails, and ears if you can.",How to Brush Your Dog Without Tickling It1," Any time you touch a dog's sensitive areas, it creates a ticklish/itching sensation for the dog. This causes a reflexive response in which a dog will kick one or both of its hind legs.Your dog cannot control this reaction, much like how you cannot control the way your leg kicks when a doctor strikes your knee.You cannot train or punish this reaction out of your dog; you simply have to accept it and work around it when brushing.;
, While most dogs are ticklish in the chest, side, or belly areas, the exact spots will vary in each canine companion. (Think of how we humans have different ticklish spots as well.) If you have two dogs, maybe even sibling pups, one may have no problem having its belly brushed while the other flails around wildly at the slightest touch. Use trial-and-error to figure out where to brush and where to avoid (when possible).Give your dog gentle, playful pets and scratches up and down its body. Any areas that elicit a scratch reflex are probably too sensitive to brush unless absolutely necessary.

, Despite the variation in ticklish spots from dog to dog, the saddle region is a fairly common area for sensitivity. The saddle encompasses the stomach, lower back, and ribs.Any type of touch in this area may set off your dog's scratch reflex, including a light stroke.If you have to brush this area due to excessive dirt or tangles, do so quickly, gently, and carefully. Prepare for a reaction from your dog, and don’t linger with the brush in that area. Don’t admonish your dog for reacting; provide praise and a treat when you're done instead.

, While not every dog will react the same way to having its ears, tail, or feet touched, these areas do tend to be sensitive to touch. When you begin to brush your dog's body, try to focus most of your brushing on less sensitive areas like the head and upper back.Generally speaking, these extremities aren’t going to get too tangled in fur anyway, so just leave them alone if your dog is ticklish there. If they do need to be brushed and your dog is simply too sensitive, see a professional groomer.

They are available at any pet store.Dog brushes have softer bristles and are designed to give you easier access to those hard to reach areas.Choose a brush based on the size of your dog. You can use a bigger toothbrush for bigger dogs, but a smaller dogs will need a brush that will easily fit into its mouth.
There are also finger brushes that fit onto the end of your finger and can provide better precision. But, these brushes also increase the likelihood of your dog accidentally biting your finger.
Do not use an adult human toothbrush to brush your dog's teeth. You can use a soft child’s toothbrush if necessary.
Other options to try if your dog resists the brush include specially designed pads and sponges.;
, Like brushes, there are many different toothpastes made for dogs. Do not ever use human toothpaste to brush your dog's teeth.Human toothpaste contains fluoride and sometimes other ingredients that can be toxic. We don't swallow toothpaste when we brush, but many dogs do. Eating human toothpaste can cause vomiting and possible kidney damage.Dog toothpaste is available in many different flavors to help make brushing easier and more pleasant for your dog.
You may have to try several flavors to find the one that works best for you and your dog., The ideal time to start brushing a dog’s teeth is when it is a puppy.You can start as early as eight weeks of age.


Starting young can help a dog become accustomed to the feel of the brush and the act of brushing.It will not, however, make much difference in the overall cleanliness of a dog's teeth. This is because it will not have all its permanent teeth until it is six to seven months old.

, When you brush your dog's teeth can have a big impact on how successful you are. Try to brush the dog's teeth when it is calm and relaxed.A good time to try this is after the dog has been exercising or playing. It will hopefully be tired and less likely to struggle with you.

, When first starting to brush your dog's teeth, take it slow to gradually get the animal used to your hands in and around its mouth. Frequently touch around the dog's mouth and muzzle with your fingers.It may take time for it to get used to you touching this area.

, Start the process by letting the dog lick a small amount of toothpaste off of your finger. This will help you determine how well it likes the toothpaste. It will also help the dog to get used to the taste, making it more likely accept the toothpaste when it is on the toothbrush.After the dog licks the toothpaste, rub your finger along the teeth and gums while lifting the lips. This is the same motion that you will use when brushing and will help with transitioning to using a brush., Next, show the toothbrush to your dog and let it inspect the brush before putting it in its mouth.


You can also let the dog lick some toothpaste off the brush. Praise the dog for this behavior. This will help the dog become accustomed to the brush being around its mouth., With or without using toothpaste, gently brush one or a few of the easiest to reach teeth. The canine teeth are the longest and usually the easiest to to reach.Gently lift the upper lip and place the toothbrush onto the teeth. Then, slowly brush back and forth.
This will help your dog get used to the new feeling of the brush on their teeth and gums, and also lets you see how they respond.
Some dogs will be receptive to brushing, but if your dog is reluctant or acting aggressive, proceed cautiously. Ideally, try it while a friend or family member can pet and help to calm the dog.
Using a calm and soothing voice can also help to keep your dog calm. If your dog continues to resist or to be aggressive, try giving it a break and trying again later or another day. If this behavior continues, consult with your veterinarian or dog trainer for advice on what to try next.
After brushing just a few teeth, reward the dog with a treat and end the session., Once your dog is used to the taste of the toothpaste and the feel of the toothbrush, it is time to combine the two. Place a small amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush and slowly and gently start to brush in the same area as before. Then, gradually move along the entire outside surface of all the upper and lower teeth.Increase the number of teeth you brush each time until the dog is comfortable having all of them brushed.Try to brush along the entire gum line. This allows you to get them used to the act of brushing without having to try to open the dog's mouth.Limit the brushing sessions to just a few minutes each. It may take a few sessions to get your dog used to the process.
Throughout the process, praise the dog in a calm voice while brushing., Once you are able to brush the outsides of all the teeth in one session, you are ready to try brushing along the inside surfaces.Put one hand over the top of the muzzle, lifting the upper lips, and open the dog's mouth. If the dog is reluctant to open, applying gentle inward pressure can help to get it to open its mouth.
Once the mouth is open, brush a small area of the inside teeth surfaces. As always, go slowly, brushing small areas to start. Move on to larger areas as the dog becomes more accustomed to brushing.Your dog's tongue naturally helps to control tartar build up along the inside surfaces. Brushing there will make a big difference though.

, The more often you brush your dog's teeth, the more it will get accustomed to your hands in and around its mouth. This will make brushing easier over time.Brushing your dog's teeth every day is ideal. It will help to prevent periodontal disease that can lead to pain and dangerous infections.If your dog has loose teeth, seems sensitive around its mouth, or is bleeding orally, consult a veterinarian before you continue brushing.Start slowly and try to work up to daily brushing. If you are unable to brush every day, try to brush as often as possible.

, Using a toothbrush and toothpaste is ideal. But, if your dog will not tolerate brushing, there are other options available. If your dog will not tolerate a toothbrush, try applying toothpaste with a thin piece of material.


You can use an old pair of stockings, a worn washcloth, or a piece of gauze wrapped around your finger.Using this method to ""brush"" will create some friction while applying the paste and help to slow plaque build-up.

, Chew toys can help wipe away soft tartar and massage the gums. They also prevent boredom and reduce stress.Give your dog rawhide, nylon, and rubber chew toys. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation.
Giving your dog chew toys and bones is a good supplement to regular brushing. They are not a good replacement for brushing in the long term.

, Feeding dry dog food and treats rather than canned food will help to slow the build-up of plaque and tartar.There are also special foods designed to aid in cleaning teeth as a dog eats, but these are not meant to replace brushing.

, Other alternatives to brushing include sprays and gels that you can apply regularly. They contain ingredients that help to deter the bacterial growth that causes tartar build-up.Consult with your veterinarian about using these and other products.

, If your dog will not accept you cleaning its teeth, bring it to the vet and have it done for you.


Also be sure to discuss your dog's dental health at your regular vet visits."

Apply coat conditioner directly to the mat.,
Untangle the mat slowly.,
Be patient with your dog, and give him breaks if necessary.,
Use scissors sparingly.,
Reward your dog.,
Avoid shaving your double coated dog.",How to Brush Your Dog2," Use a generous amount of a commercial conditioner and massage it into the affected area. If a small mat isn't treated immediately, it can turn into a serious and painful problem. Coat conditioner helps to loosen the tangles so you can remove them more easily., Mats can be very hard, packed with dirt and hair, and can become jammed against your dog's skin. Even very small mats made of five or ten hairs can pull the skin under the dog’s arms and can cause infections from the transfer of bacteria around genital areas. Parasites like ticks and fleas also like to hide in mats, so you should always take care of them as soon as possible.Try to untangle the mat manually with your fingers before you begin with the comb.
Use the wide teeth of the comb first, holding the mat firmly in your fingers so you don't pull your dog's hair when you pull at the mat.
Use the finer teeth of the comb once you have broken up most of the mat.

, This is a difficult process for your dog, as well, and if he moves or jerks while you are grooming him you might accidentally hurt him. If you are rough or impatient while grooming your dog, it can erode the trust between you.Remember that most dogs will try to chew out a hair tangle when it starts to bother them, so the area may already be quite sensitive before you begin.

, If you can't remove the tangle you may be able to cut it out with scissors. Put the comb in your dog's hair between the tangle and his skin, then cut the mat out with scissors. This will help you avoid cutting your dog.

, When you finish your grooming session, always reward your dog with a nice to treat to thank them for being patient. This will encourage them to look forward to the next grooming session.

, With proper grooming, shaving any breed of dog is rarely necessary, and should only be done on the advice of your vet or a trusted professional groomer. You should never shave your dog if you have one of the double-coated breeds, like Pomeranians, Shetland Sheepdogs, Siberian Huskies, Samoyeds. The outer coat on a double coated dog protects them from extreme heat and cold, UV rays, and bug bites.


Groom your dog's undercoat more thoroughly in the Spring and other shedding periods. If the undercoat becomes matted, air can't circulate between the outer coat and the skin and your dog loses his ability to stay cool in warm weather.
Shaving the undercoat will not prevent shedding.
Some dogs, especially older dogs, will not regrow their top coat after being shaved. They will be left with a patchy, scruffy undercoat and no protective outer coat – permanently.

Offer treats.,
Brush from head to tail.",How to Brush Your Dog Without Tickling It2," Some dogs, especially younger puppies and dogs that have not had much exposure to grooming, may be frightened of grooming tools. If this is the case, it can be helpful to let your dog sniff the brushes to see that they're nothing to be afraid of.Do not let your dog chew on the brushes. Some puppies may try, but this will set a bad precedent for future grooming sessions.

, There are many different types of detanglers available for grooming a dog's coat. The best type of detangler includes a conditioner to soften the coat. You can even buy instant detangler that begins to work immediately upon application - simply spray the coat thoroughly and start untangling mats., Shedding blades and universal slicker brushes can help work out mats and remove loose fur, leaving your dog's coat thick with healthy fur. However, these brushes can be painful for the dog if you use it to brush the entire coat. Instead, use one of these specialized brushes to target problem areas in the coat where you notice clumps and tangles.Detangling before you brush can help prevent snags on your dog's coat.
Be gentle as you work out the tangles and mats. Pulling too hard at a mat could hurt your dog's skin, which could potentially lead to an infection.

, Some dogs will be resistant to getting brushed, even if it does not tickle them. They may be frightened or confused about what's happening. If your dog struggles, offer treats to keep it calm and distracted.Choose special treats that you usually reserve for special occasions. For example, pieces of cooked chicken or turkey may distract your dog better than kibble.

, It's generally best to brush with the grain of your dog's coat. The only exception is for thick outer coats that have a soft undercoat (like a sheepdog's coat), in which case you should brush with the grain on the outer coat and against the inner coat's grain.As you brush, start as close to the skin as possible without scratching your dog's skin, then work the brush outwards.
Use gentle strokes. Being too firm with a brush can end up hurting your dog.

Choose a detangler.,
Get the right brush for your dog's coat.,
Decide where to brush your dog.",How to Brush Your Dog Without Tickling It3," You may need a detangler, depending on factors like the length of your dog's hair and the amount of time since you last brushed your pet. A thick coat full of mats will not be easy to brush, and it may cause the brush to get caught in your dog's coat.Use a spray-on detangler or grooming mist to loosen mats and soften your dog's coat.
You can buy dog detanglers at most pet stores or through an online retailer.

, There are many different types of brushes available for dog grooming. The type you use for your pet will depend on its coat type and how long your dog's fur is.Short, smooth coats (hounds, retrievers) will need a soft or medium brush. Choose a brush with short bristles that are close together.
Short, wiry coats (terriers) do best with a slicker brush or a firm bristled brush. If using a bristle brush, make sure the bristles are short and close together.
Medium and long ""flowing"" coats (retrievers, spaniels) need either a wire-pin brush or a bristle brush with soft or medium bristles. If using a bristle brush, make sure the bristles are long and more spaced apart.
Thick outer coats with a soft undercoat (sheepdogs, collies, shepherds) will require the use of a firm bristle or wire-pin brush with long, wide-spaced bristles. Use a slicker for tangles and mats.

, When you brush your dog, you'll be pulling off a lot of loose fur and dander. Depending on how clean you want to keep your home, it may be easier to brush your dog outside. If you choose to groom your dog inside, you may want to put down a matt or some towels to make the cleanup easier."
"
Use a bristle brush for almost any type of coat.,
Use a wire-pin brush for long or curly coats.,
Try a slicker brush to remove tangles.,
Try an undercoat rake on very thick fur.,
Use a rubber curry comb.,
Use shedding blades with caution.,
Use the correct brushes for your dog's breed.",How to Brush Your Dog3," For breeds with longer hair, choose a brush with longer bristles in more widely spaced rows. For shorter coats, choose a brush with shorter bristles that are closer together. For softer hair, use a soft-bristled brush. For very coarse hair, choose a brush with very stiff bristles., Wire-pin brushes are made with or without rubber tips on the wire bristles. Try this type of brush if your dog has an especially wooly or curly coat, or if he has medium to long hair of any type., A slicker brush has very fine wire bristles and is very good at removing mats, burrs, and tangles. A wood-handled comb is also used for this purpose - try to find one with a set of wide teeth and a set of finer teeth., If your dog has very thick fur with an insulating undercoat, such as an Akita, this rake will help groom this thick hair. An undercoat rake is very versatile and can also be used on other dogs, or even long-haired cats., Similar to the curry combs used to groom horses, these are great for short haired breeds such as Dobermans and Beagles., Shedding blades are designed to remove loose, dead hair. Used improperly, they will remove chunks of healthy hair and may even slice your dog's skin., Choose brushes that complement your dog's particular coat type. Dog brushes are designed to perform specific functions on certain types of hair. Using the wrong type of brush for your dog's coat may irritate the skin.Smooth coat (Bull Terrier, Dachsund, Chihuahua) – Use a bristle brush once every one to two weeks, and brush against the grain to loosen and remove dead hair.
Double coat (Rottweiler, Chow, Husky and Collie) – For long or short double coats, brush weekly throughout the year and more frequently during shedding seasons. Use a slicker brush to groom the undercoat, then go over the outer coat with the same brush. Use a wide-tooth comb to groom the longer layers and remove tangles.
Wire coat, or Broken Coat (Airedales, Irish Wolfhound) Use a stripping comb lightly over your dog's back, gently pulling out the hairs to thin the overgrown, wiry coat – wire coats are not attached to the skin like other hair types, so this does not hurt your dog when done gently. Then brush the coat in layers from the skin outward with a slicker brush.Curly coat (Poodle, Bichon Frise) - Use a slicker brush against the grain to fluff it up, then bathe and blow dry while brushing with the slicker brush with the grain.
Long coat (Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese) – Use a slicker brush on the coat in the direction of the hair, then go over the entire coat with a soft bristle brush.
Flocking coat or Cording coat (Bergamasco Shepherd, Komondor or Hungarian sheepdog) – These dog's coats are made of hair, not fur, which gradually clumps together to form natural “dreadlocks.” Although they have long hair, breeds with flocking coats are considered to be non-shedding. They also do not need to be brushed.Hairless coat (Mexican Hairless, Inca Orchid, Chinese Crested) – Hairless breeds don't need to be brushed at all, but they do need to be bathed on a regular basis.

Turn dog over.",How to Brush a Long Haired Dog," Dog brushes come in different sizes, shapes, and characteristics. You’ll need at least one or two of these to do a good job, so take into consideration your dog’s breed, hair type, and needs when selecting brushes.For instance, wire-pin brushes work well on curly or wooly coats and on medium to long-haired dogs like retrievers, spaniels, and setters. They may or may not have rubber-tipped ends. Do not use brushes with tips, because these can pull and tear out a healthy coat.You can use bristle brushes on all coat types. However, the longer and coarser your dog’s hair, the more widely spaced and stiff the bristles should be.
Slicker brushes have fine bristles made from wire and are especially good at getting rid of tangled hair, as well as touching up the “furnishings” like the ears and the hair on the hocks. Make sure to have one if your dog gets mats in his coat.;
, Some breeds like Newfoundlands and collies need extra care and attention because of their long hair or thick undercoats, which tend to mat more than others. A long-toothed or de-matting comb is a useful tool for such breeds.Either of these combs will help you to deal with tangled hair. They are also good at removing clumps of loose hair when a dog is shedding its winter undercoat.
Look for a sturdy tool for this purpose. Steel combs work well, for example.

, The skin and hair around a dog’s face is pretty sensitive. To make sure that you don’t accidentally hurt your pet, or if he has short hair around the eyes and ears, look for a soft-bristled face slicker., Detangler will help you to tease out the hardest mats and tangles in your dog’s coat, with the help of a long-toothed comb or slicker brush. Water, on the other hand, gives the coat some elasticity while you brush.Hair with elasticity from water is less likely to break.
Put the detangler and water in two separate spray bottles for easy use.

, Make sure that your pet is comfortable and ready to be groomed. You may want her to lie down, for example. Then, take the spray bottle and lightly mist the dog’s coat from head to tail.


The water will make brushing easier, getting rid of static electricity and giving the hair strands elasticity.Pay attention to how hard you brush. Go gently. If you can hear the sound of each stroke, you are probably pulling the coat too much. In that case, go more lightly or use a different style of brush.

, Begin at the head with the slicker brush. Be especially gentle here and make sure to avoid your dog’s eyes. If she has a long “beard,” hold the hair out and comb gently so that you do not pull or scratch her skin.In general, you’ll want to brush back against the “lay” of the fur. This means to work against the natural “grain” of the hair, and then to brush it back into place.
Going against the lay of the fur will help to loosen dead hair and to stimulate your dog’s skin. You will not be able to do this on a breed with corded hair, however, like a poodle, puli, or komondor. In that case, brush with the lay., Continue to use the slicker brush to work out the hair on and behind the dog’s ears. Take care to be gentle here, too. Look for tangles, as many dogs develop them in this area.


If you come across a tangle or mat, spray it with a bit of detangler before slowly trying to tease it out with a comb.
Avoid tackling larger tangles in this sensitive area. Either leave it to a professional or cut the mat out with clippers.

, Another area that tends to mat is the fur under your dog’s collar. Take off the collar and brush firmly around the neck, using a comb or wire-pin brush. Then move on to the “ruffs” – the thick, fluffy fur on the dog’s neck, shoulders, and chest.


Restore the collar once you are done with this area.

, Take the slicker brush again and move to the legs. While many dogs have short hair here, which does not need brushing, he may have “feathering” or long hair on the back of the legs. Gently tease this hair, using detangler if it is needed., First, turn the dog over and use the slicker brush to work against the lay of the hair, moving from his chest down to the belly. Keep in mind that this area is sensitive – particularly the genitals – so be extra careful and gentle.


Because of its sensitivity, it’s probably not a good idea to tackle large mats on your dog’s belly. Instead, leave them to a professional groomer.
Once you’ve done the belly, switch to a regular wire-pin brush to do his sides and back. Work against the lay when possible.

, Rear-ends can also be sensitive areas for dogs. You might do a test-run with the slicker brush to see just how sensitive your pet’s is, before deciding whether to do the rest with a wire-pin brush or comb.Then, take a long-toothed comb and move to the tail. A long-haired dog may have lots of tangles and matting here. Use detangler and a comb for difficult spots.

, Many dogs, but especially ones with long and thick double coats, will get mats. Be patient with any and all of these problem spots. Above all, make sure not to pull too hard at the hair and hurt the animal.With a slicker brush, look for mats in the usual spots: behind the ears, in the pants, and under the forelegs.
Hold the fur at the base of mats, and then use a long-toothed comb to try to tease the hair apart.
For larger or difficult mats, apply detangler and work the liquid into the hair with your fingers. Wait 3-5 minutes before returning with a dematting comb. Start at the loose end of the mat and, with a sawing motion, move the comb slowly in toward the tangle’s base.
Take a slicker brush once the knot is loosened and make short strokes in the mat, moving toward the dog’s body. Last, take a long-toothed comb and comb out the whole area to remove any loose hair.

, Regular grooming will keep your dog healthy and happy. Brushing removes dirt, fleas, and parasites, spreads out the hair’s natural oils, and keeps the animal’s skin clean. It will also allow you to note any injuries, bumps, or irregularities on the dog.Long-haired dogs should be brushed once a day, ideally. Brushing will remove tangles, promote a healthy coat, and reduce the amount of dander in your home.Brushing also makes other grooming steps like bathing, trimming around the feet, and clipping toenails easier.Done regularly and right, brushing should be an enjoyable experience for your dog and a bonding experience for you both.

, Many long-haired dog breeds have what it called a “double coat.” This means they have a fluffy undercoat for insulation, covered by a coarser outer coat. “Rolling” this undercoat removes dead hairs, spreads out natural oils, and prevents a good deal of matting.To get started, mist the dog from head to tail with water from your spray bottle. As before, the water should get rid of static electricity.
Have dog next lay down on her side. You will want to do one flank at a time.

, Starting at the shoulder, brush back against the lay of the fur. Hold the dog gently near the head and brush the hair toward her head to create a part.Continue to back brush small areas of fur – about 2 inches of coat per stroke – until you reach the dog’s pants.
Once you have brushed all the fur from the head to the pants, gently brush it back to its normal lay.

, Now, do the other side. Turn the dog over, mist, and repeat the procedure. Brush back with the wire-pin brush, working from the head to the pants, and return the hair to its normal lay when done.


Try to roll the dog’s coat once per week throughout the year. When done, you should be able to easily run a comb through the length of the coat.
Take a closer look at areas where the comb sticks – you may find small mats, burs, or insects there.

Remove all fur from the brush or comb.,
Prepare a solution of water and vinegar or shampoo.,
Dip the brush bristles or comb teeth into the solution.,
Rinse with clean water.,
Spray a disinfectant onto the clean brush.,
Place the brush on a towel to dry.,
Inspect brushes and combs for signs of wear.,
Store tools in a dry, warm space.,
Repeat brush cleanings weekly.",How to Clean a Pet Brush or Comb," Before preparing your cleaning solution, pick out visible hairs and dirt from the brush’s pad and bristles. You can do this with your thumb and forefinger, or with an old toothbrush or comb.Don’t worry if you can’t dig out every last speck of visible dirt or dander. The soak will loosen up and extract most things, so just aim to remove the most glaring clumps of hair and buildup.;
, Depending on your preference, you can add vinegar or pet shampoo to a large mixing bowl of warm water. A vinegar-based solution should contain equal parts vinegar—either white or apple cider varieties will do—and water. If you're using shampoo, you only need to add two or three generous squirts to a bowl full of water.


When choosing a pet shampoo, check the label in order to avoid harmful ingredients such as carcinogens, tar, propylene glycol, or perfumes. If possible, opt for an organic shampoo with few ingredients., Once you’ve removed excess hair and dirt, you should submerge your grooming instruments in the cleaning solution for between five and thirty minutes. This step is important even if you’re planning to disinfect with bleach or an antibacterial spray. After all, most disinfectants—including bleach—don’t remove dirt or grime, so you can’t just substitute one for the other.Pet brushes and combs are generally made of plastic, but if you own one with a fabric pad, don’t soak the entire head of the brush. If you do, moisture can accumulate in the fabric and eventually cause mold., After soaking, your brush or comb will still have some residual dirt or hairs clinging to the bristles or pad. You can remove this remaining buildup by rinsing it in clean water and then lightly shaking it to whisk off any excess moisture.You can also dip your brushes in another bowl of clean, pure water if you don’t want to rinse them in the sink., While vinegar and shampoos have some antibacterial properties, you should apply a separate, stronger disinfectant if you’re worried about germs, viruses, or other bacteria. You can buy aerosol, enzymatic, or essential oil disinfecting sprays from the store, or you can make your own solution with water and 10% bleach.If you have a lot of tools to clean, you might want to consider purchasing an ultraviolet light. Since UV light kills bacteria, you can lay all of your implements under the light to dry rather spraying each one individually.

, Rather than using your newly cleaned and disinfected brushes immediately, set them out to dry thoroughly before subsequent use. Place them with the bristle side facing downward so that water doesn’t drain into the handle or brush head.You can also use an old dish rack if you don’t have the counter- or floor-space for laying out your grooming tools. Just be sure to arrange them in such a way that the moisture drains out of the brush and not into the handle or head.

, Even the most diligently cleaned brush or comb will eventually show signs of wear and tear. Visible signs of deterioration mean that you should replace the brush or comb, so check your tools frequently to make sure they’re holding up well. Cracks, broken bristles, or extracted teeth are all indicators that your brush or comb has reached the end of the road., You probably know that you should keep brushes and combs away from chewing, playing animals, but keeping them out of reach from your pets isn’t the only criterion for safe storage. Your grooming tools also need a warm, dry area to reside in between use, as cold temperatures keep germs alive longer, and moist conditions promote the growth of mold.If you live in a particularly humid climate, you might want to purchase a dehumidifier to keep your brushes dry. Just be aware that dehumidifiers can corrode a rubber pad, so opt for hard plastic brushes if you’re going to use one., Since your brush gathers new dirt, hair, and germs every time you brush your pet, you should wash your brushes frequently. Some owners prefer to do so after every use, while others prefer a weekly or even biweekly schedule.


Whatever schedule you decide on, be aware that you’ll need to clean your brushes more frequently any time your pet is experiencing a skin irritation, pest problem, or other virus.

Dogs have very sensitive skin, and mats can pull and put stress on the skin.Pet your dog, talk to him in a calm voice, and give him treats as you begin.Try to get the dog to lie down if you can.;
, Before you begin, you can spray your dog's coat with a detangling spray. This can help loosen up mats and make them easier to brush out.Leave the detangling spray on the coat for a few minutes.Detangling sprays may not always work. They will not work on severe mats in your dog's coat., Use a slicker brush to locate the mats. A slicker brush has wire bristles that are slightly bent at the ends. Make sure the bristles don't touch your dog's skin.Mats are often found around the ears, below the neck, under the belly, and along the back legs.

, Take the base of the mat into your hand, at the section closest to your dog's skin. This protects your dog's skin from excess pulling and damage as you try to work out the mat. It also keeps you from giving your dog's skin brush burn since your hand is between the brush and the dog's skin., When you find mats, start to untangle them with your fingers. Make sure to be extra gentle. Mats pull painfully at your dog's skin. Ease the hair in the mat apart a little at a time.This will take awhile, so you need to have patience., Cornstarch is often used as a dematting aid. It can help loosen and untangle the fur.You can also try spraying a light coat of coconut oil onto each mat and then combing out.

, When the mat is very tangled and your fingers aren't working, try picking through it with a comb or other dematting tool instead of just combing through it. This picking action helps break up the hair. Lift the tool in and out of the hair instead of pulling in through. Go from the ends up towards the base. You want to loosen the hair. Don't worry about separating completely., Once you separate as much of the mat as you can with your fingers, run through the mat with a dematting comb. Pull the comb through the mat from the base to the tip.If the mat is bad, comb through from the tip to the base to lessen the strain on your dog's hair. Use a teasing motion instead of combing straight through.
Make sure to keep a hold on the mat so you don't pull at your dog's skin.

, If the mat doesn't come out after using your fingers and a comb or brush, try a mat rake. Comb it gently through the mats. The mat rake has sharp teeth that help cut through the mat., Once you have gotten the mat loosened enough, use your slicker brush to finish brushing the mat. Make sure to brush in the direction the hair grows.Continue brushing out the rest of your dog's coat."
"
Use a mat splitter.,
Try electric clippers.,
Take the dog to the groomers.,
Avoid using scissors.",How to Brush Mats out of Dog Hair2," If the mat won't break apart or loosen with your fingers, the rake, or comb, try a mat splitter. Keep holding the mat at the base. Use the mat splitter to cut the mat into smaller strips. After you cut it into smaller sections, try to work through it with your fingers or a comb.Use a sawing motion when you cut the hair.Be careful using a mat splitter. It has a razor sharp edge and can seriously injure your dog. Always watch out for the ears, folds of skin, loose skin, and the tip of the tail., When everything else fails, try clippers. Use the clippers to slowly shave away the mat. This may leave a bare patch where you have shaved the coat.Make sure to watch carefully as you trim away the mat. Do not cut too close to your dog's skin., If the mats are too difficult to remove, or your dog is not cooperating, take your dog to the groomers. They can shave the dog or use their knowledge, experience, and tools to remove the mats easier than you can., Though some people suggest using scissors, you should refrain from using them on your pet. You can seriously injure your dog, especially around the sensitive areas like the ears.Scissors can cut the skin or pull and strain it. Even dematting tools can be dangerous due to their razor-sharp blades.If you are uncomfortable using these sharp objects on your dog, then take him to a professional.

Meet with the pet sitter.,
Sign a contract with the pet sitter.,
Write detailed instructions for the sitter.",How to Choose the Right Care for Your Dog While on Vacation1," If you’ve decided that you’d like to hire a pet sitter to watch your dog while you’re away, you’ll need to start to identify potential candidates. Searching online, asking for recommendations, and looking for listings in local stores will help you to compile a list of potential hires.Organizations like the National Association of Pet Sittersand Pet Sitters Internationalallow you to enter your zip code to find pet sitters near you.
Websites like Care.com, SitterCity, Angie’sList may have profiles for local pet sitter that includes their information and their pricing.
You may also find local postings for pet sitters at pet stores, groomers, and veterinarian offices.;
, Speak with other pet owners that you know to see if they have any referrals for reliable pet sitters. A recommendation from a trusted friend may be more reputable than an online listing or advertisement.Veterinary technicians often pet sit on the side to earn extra income, so you could start by checking with your veterinarian to see if they have a list of available pet sitters for you to choose from.
Ask friends and family members that you know have used pet sitters in the past.
You can also look online to see whether there are reviews of the pet sitters available from past customers. While these can be helpful, you will need to decide how much weight you will give online recommendations.

, With pet sitters, you can decide whether you'd like the pet sitter to stay in your home and watch your dog or have them visit your home each day.


For pet sitters that visit each day, your dog will be alone for the rest of the time. This is a good option if your dog doesn't mind being alone, but is not ideal for dogs that have separation anxiety or are destructive when left alone.
In-home pet sitters will cost more, but your dog will be able to spend more time with a human and have their full attention.

, Ideally, the pet sitter will be insured so that you are not liable for any potential accidents that may occur on your property. Check your homeowner's insurance to see what sorts of damages are covered under your policy if the pet sitter is staying in your home.


This may not be possible if you are using a pet sitter that is not a professional, like a student who pet sits part time.

, Confirm their pricing, see if they offer discounts for multiple dogs if applicable, and double-check their location and their references. Make sure that they are available for the days you’ll be away on vacation. Pet sitters can become fully booked during busy seasons, especially around the holidays, so contact potential sitters with a few weeks' notice.


Compare prices between your top choices to see if one sitter is significantly more affordable than the other. If possible, don’t let cost deter you from selecting the best sitter. Professional pet sitters will likely charge more, but they are often insured and offer additional services, like GPS tracking or medical care, that others do not.
For pets with medical conditions, look for pet sitters that have experience dealing with dogs with health problems. If needed, make sure that the pet sitter can administer medication to your dog.

, Ideally, you will be able to meet with the pet sitter before you leave for vacation. If you really trust a recommendation that you’ve received, you may be able to forego this step. During this meeting, you’ll want to confirm that this pet sitter has successfully worked with dogs before, is trustworthy, and gets along with your dog.Bring your pet to this meeting, or hold the meeting at your home, so the pet sitter has a chance to meet your dog. If possible, let the pet sitter do a test walk with your dog to see how they handle your dog.

, Now that you’ve met the pet sitter and have decided they are right for your needs, you can officially hire them. The two of you will need to agree on a price and a payment method. It is best to get this in writing, and to also have them sign a contract saying that they will watch your dog during the specified dates.


Write a covering letter and give it to your veterinarian just in case circumstances make it necessary. In the letter, express what your preferences are in the event of an accident or the pet's ill health, and also express that you are giving the pet sitter authority to sign consent forms on your behalf.

, Leave the pet sitter with detailed instructions so they can adequately care for your dog while you are away. You will need to leave them with your contact information, your veterinarian’s phone number in case of an emergency, and the phone number of a trusted neighbor or friend who can help if needed. Include information about your dog’s routine, personality, preferences, bathroom habits, and any medications they might take."

Dog proof the house.,
Gather your supplies.,
Establish house rules.,
Learn about his past.",How to Care for a Rescued Dog1," Making your house safe for your dog will save you a lot of stress when you bring him home. Move household chemicals out of your dog’s reach. Protect your furniture with a throw or slip cover if your dog will be sitting on it. Look for any long cords, tassels, or dangling items that may be attractive to your dog.If you have a yard, make sure that your fence is secure. Your dog should not be able to jump over it or dig underneath it to get away.;
, Purchase a crate, baby gates, bedding, water bowls, food bowls, flea comb, 20 foot (6.1 m) leash, food, toys, and grooming supplies. When you go to pick up your dog, take his buckle collar, ID tag, leash, and a harness/collar with you.These supplies can be purchased from your local pet store.
It is important that you get these supplies before you bring your dog into your home. You want to start out on the right foot. The earlier you can establish consistency, the better.

, If you live with other people, sit down and discuss the house rules for the dog. Where will the dog’s crate, bed, and bowls be? What will the dog’s schedule be like? Also, remind everyone to be calm and inviting when meeting the dog for the first time. Avoid hugging, kissing, or patting the dog on top of its head.Discuss how the dog will be introduced to each member of the household. The dog should only meet one person at a time.

, Try to find out as much as you can about your dog’s previous life. This will help you deal with any behavioral or medical issues your dog may have. Some questions you should ask are:


Was the dog abused?
How did the dog end up at the shelter?
Has the staff noticed any behavioral problems?
How is his health?

Research boarding kennels in your area.,
Determine what you want out of a kennel.,
Arrange to visit kennels.,
Choose a kennel.,
Prepare your dog for the kennel.",How to Choose the Right Care for Your Dog While on Vacation2," Kennels can be a great option for your dog while you’re away. They’ll be able to interact with other dogs in a safe environment with staff who are trained and love dogs. You can search for local kennels online by entering your zip code, asking for recommendations from trusted friends and family, or by asking your veterinarian for a recommendation.


Be aware that most kennels will ask for proof that your dog has been fully vaccinated since they will be in contact with other dogs.

, These days, some boarding kennels can be described as luxury pet hotels while others are much more basic. If your dog has health problems, make sure the kennel is equipped to administer any medications that your dog needs.Basic kennels will typically have indoor and outdoor areas for dogs to exercise and socialize with staff members and other dogs, a place for your dog to sleep, and routine feedings.
You will pay more for any additional amenities you want for your pet. Luxury kennels may include grooming, one on one playtime with a staff member, playtime in a pool, special treats, and even dog massages.

, Seeing the boarding kennel in person is one of the best ways to determine whether this is the kennel you want to use for your pet. Make sure the kennel meets your standards, budget, and will be comfortable for your dog.Ask about the kennel’s daily schedule. This should cover when dogs are fed, exercised, socialized, when they go outside, and when they can sleep.
Make sure the boarding kennel has insurance, the staff seem knowledgeable about dogs, and how many other dogs are typically being boarded.

, Now that you’ve toured a few different boarding kennels in your area, you can finalize your plans. You’ll need to ensure that the kennel has room for your dog during your vacation days and that their prices are within your budget. Depending on the season, you should try to book a kennel at least three weeks before you leave for vacation. During the holidays, you should try to book a month in advance since kennels can book up very quickly.There is typically a contract agreement that both you and the kennel will sign to ensure that both parties follow through on their agreement. You may have to pay a fee to hold your reservation at the kennel and you may have the option to pay in advance.

, Before you leave your dog at the kennel and go on vacation, you’ll need to make sure that they are prepared. Your dog’s health should be first and foremost. Make sure that they are up to date on their vaccinations, any pest prevention methods for fleas or heartworm, and that they are in good health. Alert the kennel ahead of time if your dog has any health needs, like they need insulin daily for their diabetes.If the kennel doesn’t offer the dog food that you use, you will need to pack a container with enough food to last your dog while you’re away to give to the kennel staff.

Socialize your dog with strangers and new dogs. They’ll be spending their days with other dogs and unfamiliar staff members so they need to be comfortable meeting and interacting with them in this new environment."

Ask a friend to watch your dog.,
Prepare your dog’s belongings.,
Write down your dog’s information.,
Thank them for watching your dog.",How to Choose the Right Care for Your Dog While on Vacation3," Ideally, you have a close friend or neighbor who would be happy to watch your dog while you are away. They may already have dogs that are friendly with your dog, or they enjoy your dog’s company.They may not be able to watch your dog during those dates, so it is a good idea to have a few additional friends you could ask as a backup.

, Unlike a boarding kennel, your friend probably does not have all the items your dog will need. Your friend will appreciate that you’ve taken the time to collect these items so they don’t have to worry about providing them.Leash.
Food.
Bowls for food and water.
Toys.
Dog bed.
Any medications, if needed.

, Just like you would with a pet sitter, you’ll need to write down care instructions for your friend to reference. Even if your friend already spends a lot of time with your dog, it is best to give them this information as a precaution.Be sure to include the contact information where you can be reached at during your vacation your veterinarian’s phone number in case of an emergency. Include information about your dog’s daily routine, when they are walked and fed, any medications they take, and their bathroom habits. Give them a key to your house just in case they need to go and retrieve something for your dog there.
Let the person know if your dog is microchipped. If your dog is not microchipped, then you might want to have your dog microchipped before you go to increase the chances that your dog will be returned to you if they get lost.

, Always offer to pay them to watch your pet. While they may refuse payment, you should bring them a small gift back from your trip or take them to their favorite restaurant to say thank you.


You should also offer to return the favor and watch their pets the next time they are away on vacation. You could also offer to house sit if they do not have pets.

Give him space.,
Be patient.,
Be firm, but kind.,
Introduce noises gradually.,
Recognize signs of separation anxiety.,
Deal with separation anxiety.,
Let him sleep around others.",How to Care for a Rescued Dog2," Your dog will need time to adjust to his new environment. He will want to examine your house and smell everything. Take him on a tour of the house while his leash is still on. Allow him to take in his new environment.Your dog may pant, pace, have an upset stomach, or chew or drink more than usual at first. This is completely normal. He is just excited and nervous.

, Depending on his past, your dog may be shy and has not been housetrained or socialized. Because of this, your dog may be afraid of new things or engage in unpleasant behaviors like eating his own feces or marking his territory.Pay attention to how your dog responds and adjust your behavior. For example, if you are trying to teach a new command and your dog becomes tense or starts looking out of the corner of his eye, you need to give your dog some space and stop what you are doing.
Dogs like to run away when they are scared. Keep the crate door open so your dog can always retreat when he feels overwhelmed.

, Do not punish your dog for misbehaving at first. Your dog will not make the connection between punishment and bad behavior. Instead, your dog will be scared of you. If your dog misbehaves, stop the behavior and then give your dog a treat for stopping.For example, if your dog is biting shoes or trying to pee in the wrong area, tell your dog, “No, don’t do that” in a firm voice. Once your dog stops, give him a treat and give him some praise.

, Do not yell or make loud, sudden noises around your dog. You do not want to scare him. Use a soothing tone anytime you are speaking to or around your dog. Introduce new noises like the television or vacuum slowly. Try to keep the house quiet for the first couple of weeks. For example, after a couple of weeks, you may start watching TV when the dog is in the room. Once the dog is used to the TV, you may vacuum around him. Always judge his reaction. If he looks scared, reassure him that everything is fine and allow him to retreat into his crate.
Make sure that everyone else in the home keeps it relatively quiet as well.

, Living in a new environment often triggers separation anxiety. Your dog may become anxious when you leave him home alone and act out. Dogs typically do not do these behaviors in front of their owner. Common signs of separation anxiety include:Urinating and defecating when you leave him alone
Barking, crying, or howling when left alone
Destroying objects (e.g. door frames, doors, household items) when left alone
Trying to escape from a confined area
Eating feces when left alone
Pacing in straight line or in a circular motion.

, Do not spend all of your time around your dog when you first bring him home. If you are home all day, go to another room for 5-10 minutes to give your dog space. Before you go to work, go through your normal routine so your dog learns the signs that you will be leaving soon.Give your dog a treat or a toy when you leave so that he associates your absence with something positive.
Have brief absences before you leave your dog home alone while you are at work.
Start with 5-10 minute absences and build up to 40 minutes. Most of your dog’s anxious behavior happens in the first 40 minutes he is alone.
If the anxiety is not getting any better, talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s behavior.

, Your dog should sleep in the same room as you or other housemates. This helps your dog understand that he is a member of the group. Your dog should have his own bed or sleep in his crate. Make sure your dog can see you from where he is sleeping.Do not allow your dog to sleep in the bed with you. Your dog may take this as a sign that he is in charge.

Research breeds of dogs.,
Look for an affectionate breed.,
Think carefully about breeds known for excessive aggression.,
Watch out for breeds considered difficult to raise.,
Don’t assume loyalty, or lack of it.",How to Bring Up a Loyal Dog1," If you’re looking for a dog whose breed is known to be loyal, talk with local dog breeders or pet-store owners to find out which breeds they view as being the most loyal. Breeds that are commonly considered among the most loyal include: Collies, Boxers, Brittanys, and Labrador Retrievers.Since dogs have individual personalities, a dog of any breed can be a loyal, loving companion. However, some breeds are genetically more predisposed to be loyal than others.
The loyalty and disposition of the dog will be especially important if you have a family, or if there will be young children around the dog.;
, Breeds that have an even temperament and are known for their affectionate, devoted nature are more likely to grow into loyal adult dogs. Affectionate breeds will require less rigorous training and should easily develop a trusting, loyal bond with their owners. For an affectionate dog, look into breeds including:Newfoundlands. These dogs, although very large, are known to be affectionate, docile, and remarkably loyal to their owners.
Golden Retrievers. This is a common breed for good reason: Golden Retrievers are even-tempered, loyal, and great with small children.Welsh Corgis. These dogs are playful and have sweet personalities, making them a loyal breed.

, Many breeds of dog have been purposefully bred to strengthen their hunting or fighting abilities, or possess a naturally aggressive nature. Other breeds have been inbred or over-bred to the degree that dogs of these breeds often have common behavioral problems. However, this does not necessarily effect loyalty, as dogs with behavioral issues can still be loyal to the individual owners.


Aggressive breeds include: Shar Peis, Chihuahuas, Jack Russell Terriers, Giant Schnauzers, Cocker Spaniels, Chow Chows, and Dachshunds.Aggression aside, several of these breeds are simply temperamental or difficult to control. Pit bulls can respond aggressively to teasing or tormenting, and other breeds (including Chow Chows) often only bond with a single owner.Dog aggression is unrelated to size. Many people are under the misconception that larger dogs are more likely to be aggressive—this is not true. In fact, most of the aggressive breeds are smaller dogs., Even if a breed of dog is not specifically aggressive or violent, these dogs may be challenging to raise for other reasons. Some breeds lack affection, while others are bad around children or require large amounts of training and handling.Unless you are well aware of the challenges of raising a difficult breed, opt for an easier type of dog. Difficult breeds include:


Bullmastiffs are huge dogs that require large amounts of training to control. They also do not get along well with other dogs.German Shepherds are a very energetic, intelligent breed, and will need plenty of care and training. If neglected or mistreated, they can become aggressive.
Akitas are a large breed of dog, who require long walks (at least 30 minutes) daily. The breed also sheds heavily and requires a lot of training, making it a poor choice for inexperienced dog owners.Bulldogs suffer from many health problems as a result of their overbreeding. They also usually cannot swim, easily suffer heat exhaustion, and require many hours of training., Dogs are creatures with individual personalities, who are not completely behaviorally determined by their genetics or breeding. While individuals of a certain breed may tend to act with or without loyalty, there are many factors outside of breeding that influence a dog’s behavior. Many of those factors have to do with you, the owner.


Even dogs from breeds often considered aggressive or difficult can be loyal, if you train the dog properly from the start, meet its breed-specific needs (large amounts of exercise or grooming, etc.), and treat it with respect and affection.

Feed him twice a day.,
Potty train your dog.,
Exercise regularly.,
Establish care with a veterinarian.",How to Care for a Rescued Dog3," Keep your dog on the same feeding schedule for the first few days. He probably ate once or twice a day at the shelter. Maintaining the schedule will keep your dog from getting diarrhea due to a new regimen. If he was only eating once a day, you can begin to transition him to eating twice a day. Divide his meal into two and give him the majority of his food during his first meal. Gradually increase the amount of food he gets at the second meal until he is eating twice a day.Allow your dog 10 minutes to eat and then get rid of any leftovers. This will keep you from overfeeding him.
If possible, feed him the same food he was given at the shelter and slowly transition into the food of your choice.
If your dog was living in shelter, he may have had to fight to make sure he got something to eat. This can result in him being territorial about food. If you notice that your dog is barking or lunging when you get too close to his food, feed him in a crate or a bathroom. Eventually your dog will learn that he does not need to guard his food., Take your dog outside to use the bathroom first thing in the morning, one hour after a meal, as soon as you get home from work, and right before bedtime. Praise your dog when he uses the bathroom. If your dog has an accidents or pees in the wrong place, do not punish him. This will only teach him to fear you.If you will not be around to take your dog to the bathroom, keep him in his crate. Dogs will usually not use the bathroom in their home.
Try to take your dog to the bathroom at the same times each day. This will help him develop a routine and feel secure.

, Your dog will need to have at least one exercise session each day, but the amount and duration of exercise will depend on his individual needs. Pay attention to your dog’s preferences as well. Some dogs may be happy with a walk while other dogs may want more intense activities like running or playing fetch.If your dog is breathing heavily and no longer wants to participate in the activity you are doing, it is time to end the exercise session. For example, if you were playing with a stick and he no longer wants to bring the stick back, take a break.

, Your dog should visit a veterinarian within the first week that you bring him home. Your vet will do a general checkup, discuss preventive health care, and determine any special needs that your dog may have. Try to have the visit scheduled before you bring your dog home. Consider buying pet insurance to help with the costs of care.

Purchase necessary items before you bring home your dog.,
Give your dog time to acclimate to your home.,
Puppy-proof your house.,
Be patient with dogs that have suffered abuse.,
Develop a regular schedule with your dog.",How to Bring Up a Loyal Dog2," Whether you’re adopting an 8-week-old puppy or bringing home an older dog from a result shelter, you need to be prepared before the dog arrives.Visit a local pet-supply store, and ask the clerk what they recommend that you purchase for the type and age of dog you’re bringing home. Plan on purchasing:


Water bowl, food bowl, and a bag of dog food or puppy food.
A leash and collar.
A soft blanket or bed that your dog can claim as their own.
Stain remover and carpet or tile cleaners.
Bones and/or synthetic chew toys.
A dog kennel or cage to keep the animal in when you leave the house.

, Regardless of a dog’s age, it will be stressed and confused the first time it’s brought into a new place, such as your house or apartment. Rather than giving your dog run of the house immediately, it helps to introduce them to each new room slowly.Walk your dog through the house to give them time to adjust—this will lead them to trust you and grow in loyalty.


Similarly, if other people or pets live with you, introduce your new dog to them one at a time.This will increase the dog’s trust for, and loyalty to, each family member.

, If you’re adopting a puppy, you’ll need to make sure that fragile, valuable, or easily damaged items are out of reach.Decide ahead of time when you’ll feed the puppy—puppies need to be fed three to four times a day, and these meals should come at regular intervals. Finally, show your puppy an outside area where it can go to the bathroom, and give it plenty of positive affection.If you already own a dog, you’ll need to give the two dogs—whether puppies or older dogs—time to get familiar with each other. Hold one of the dogs on a leash, and have a friend hold the other dog on a leash. Let the two dogs smell each other, while praising and petting them both. Keep the dogs in a controlled environment, such as a fenced backyard, as they begin to play together., If you’re bringing home a dog that has been mistreated or abused, you’ll need to exercise extra patience when bringing the dog home. Help your dog move beyond their abusive past by giving them a private, safe space—a crate or a kennel—that they can retreat to when they please.Avoid putting the dog in stressful situations or playing too aggressively, as the dog may take this as a sign of abuse and become afraid or aggressive.


Also give the dog plenty of time in a low-stress environment to acclimate to other people in your house or apartment.

, Dogs feel comfortable with routines, and will be more affectionate and loyal towards you if you maintain a daily routine for the dog.Feed your dog at regular times. Whether you feed your dog once or twice a day, make sure to do it at the same time daily. For example, you could feed your dog shortly before leaving for work, and again shortly before you eat your own dinner.
Take your dog for daily walk. This is especially important if you live in an urban area without a large backyard. Walking your dog at a consistent time—say 6:00 in the evening—will help your dog establish a routine, and also keep your dog from experiencing boredom.

Form an emotional connection with your dog.,
Train your dog to obey your commands.,
Use positive training with your dog.,
Do not unnecessarily punish your dog.,
Be loyal to your dog.",How to Bring Up a Loyal Dog3," This is a crucial step in developing loyalty in your dog: loyalty will develop out of an emotional connection between owner and dog. If you show your dog that you care about it and that it can trust you, the dog will develop a sense of loyalty. Praising your dog, petting it kindly, and giving it treats will all help you endear yourself to your dog.Stimulating your dog physically and mentally will strengthen this bond. Play with your dog and walk it often, and train the dog to keep its mind sharp., Obedience training is a crucial step towards developing loyalty in a dog. If your dog views you as the alpha in the social structure and respects you enough to obey commands, they’re more likely to behave well and treat you with loyalty.You can take your dog to an obedience-train class, where they will not only learn simple commands (sit, stay, come), but will also be socialized with other dogs and people., Implement a system such as reward-based training (in which the dog gets a reward or treat for correctly following a command) with your dog. Your dog will become more obedient and will also view you as a source of food and other good things.This will help your dog develop trust towards you, which in turn breeds loyalty.

, While there will be times when it’s appropriate to punish your dog, you must punish it correctly and never with violence or cruelty. Punishments are often ineffective, as your dog may not understand what it’s being punished for and may learn to fear or avoid you.If you choose to punish your dog—for example, by taking away its favorite toy after it’s destroyed one of your possessions—make sure to implement this punishment while the dog is in the act of misbehaving. Otherwise, the dog will not understand what it’s being punished for.If you excessively discipline your dog to maintain its obedience, it may grow to fear you and treat you with aggression.To train a loyal dog, focus on positive reinforcement.

, The best way to ensure that any dog will be loyal to you is to treat your dog with loyalty, love, affection, and respect. Train your dog to obey you, and hold it to the rules that you create. Dogs develop loyalty towards owners who care for them (food, bedding, warmth, etc.) and who protect them, play with them, and pay attention to their needs.

Dog breeds that have gentle dispositions include: Great Danes, Beagles, Newfoundlands, and Pugs.


Consider what you want in a dog: would you prefer a lazy, mellow pet, or a dog that is athletic and high-energy?
If you’re set on getting a purebred animal, look into the breed’s history. If you’re looking for a gentle pet, avoid dogs that have been bred for violent activities such as guarding or animal hunting.;
, To ensure that you find a gentle and pleasant dog, opt for a dog whose breed is considered friendly and easy-going. Breeds known to be high-strung, or which require excessive training or high maintenance, may not develop into the gentle dog you’re looking for. A few outgoing, fun-loving breeds are: Irish Setters, Beagles, Boxers, and Welsh Corgis/Breeds that are commonly considered affectionate include: golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, Irish wolfhounds, Collies, English bulldogs, and Great Danes., Aside from breed characteristics, you want to do everything possible to ensure that your specific dog is an affectionate, gentle, and pleasant pet.If possible, spend some time with a potential pet before you bring it home. This is especially important if you’re adopting a grown animal from a pet shelter, since adult dogs will be less likely to change their behavior in a new home.


If you’re bringing home a puppy, you should still try to spend time with it before the adoption to make sure that it’s gentle.
If you have your choice of a number of puppies (an entire litter, for example), spend time with the puppies and choose one that seems outgoing and personable., Rather than punishing your dog for mistakes they have made, which will teach your dog to fear you, positively reinforce their good behaviors. When your dog obeys a command or completes a task correctly, praise your dog and give them a treat or piece of food.Taking your dog to an obedience training course is a great way to have your dog trained quickly and effectively. Make sure that the training instructors themselves use positive reinforcement, and other gentle training methods.

, To ensure that your dog will along well with other dogs and other humans (the dogs’ owners) and will have a pleasant disposition, avoid secluding your dog.Let it interact with other animals and humans frequently, and always in a safe space where your dog won’t feel threatened or uncomfortable. These interactions will help your dog develop social relationships and healthy interactions with humans and other dogs.


One way to socialize a new dog—especially a puppy—is to have a “puppy party.” Invite various friends, especially people who are calm and enjoy being around dogs.You can also invite other dog-owners to bring their dogs over to meet yours, or agree to meet at a dog park to let the dogs run together., Dogs can be remarkably unpleasant when they walk improperly on a leash and refuse to walk with their owner, or drag their owner along behind them. Make the walk walk by your side, and don’t let it pull on the leash.


If your dog gets excited or aggressive when another dog is near, continue your walk. If you give in and let your dog approach the strange dog, your dog with this this behavior is acceptable.

, Although roughhousing and play-biting can seem cute and affectionate when your dog is a puppy, as the dog matures, this behavior becomes unpleasant and can even be painful. Prevent your dog from biting by pulling back or yelling “Ouch!” when it play-bites. Move away from your puppy for a couple of minutes. When you return, resume gently playing.This behavior mimics the way that puppies learn to tussle and play with one another in their litters.
Preventing your dog from biting will let it know how to behave gently.

, If you play a game—fetch, for example—and repeatedly tease your dog, you run the risk of teaching it that playtime is unpleasant and should be avoided. This can diminish the bond between dog and owner, and will result in a less gentle adult dog.


Avoid playing other rough games with your dog. Even a game like tug-of-war can teach your dog that it’s OK to take things away from humans, and that ripping objects out of your grasp is appropriate.

, After-the-fact punishment has been shown to work ineffectively.For example, it’s not helpful to yell at your dog after it has broken a household object or gone to the bathroom inside, unless you catch it in the act of misbehaving. Instead, use training and positive reinforcement to teach your dog proper indoor behavior. Then, when the dog does something good, praise it with a treat and by showing it attention.


Punishing your dog after misbehavior can be counterproductive, as many dogs will take the attention being lavished on them as a positive sign.Dogs often feel as though any attention is good attention, and may be more inclined to misbehave if they think it will get your attention.

, A well-trained, well-behaved dog will be a pleasant and gentle companion and friend. Teach the dog to behave well inside the house from an early age, and you’ll have fewer instances of disobedience and unpleasant behavior. If your dog clearly knows your behavioral expectations, it will behave well and be a pleasant pet.


Don’t let your dog jump up on friends or visitors.
When you are feeding the dog, give it food after you’ve already eaten. If the dog is begging and whining while you are preparing its meal, say something like “leave me alone” in a firm voice. When the dog leaves you alone and the meal is prepared, then you can feed it.

There are many products in your house and yard that are dangerous to dogs and should be kept well out of reach by locking them in a storage area or putting them somewhere the dog doesn’t have access to. Some of the more common ones include, household cleaners, insecticides, fertilizers, and mouse and rat poisons.
Both house plants and plants in your yard or garden can be toxic, including rhododendrons, chrysanthemum, and oleander. Identify the plants in your home and garden and then contact your veterinarian or look online at sites such as the ASPCA and Pet poison helpline for complete lists of pet toxins.
Also, medicines both human and animal, can be toxic to your dog, especially if consumed in large amounts. Some of the foods that we eat, including chocolate, onions, raisins and grapes, and even sugarless chewing gums, can be toxic to dogs as well and should be kept well out of reach.;
, Before you bring your dog home one of the first things to decide on is where your dog will be spending their time. Think about what areas of the house they will be allowed to access and what areas you want to keep off limits. These rules should be enforced from the very beginning to avoid confusion.


Your dog will need designated areas to eat and sleep and plenty of space to play and exercise. Initially you may want to limit the areas the dog has access to so that you can watch them closely until you get to know them and their behavior better.
The kitchen or another area that is convenient to clean is a good place to set up food and water bowls. Once you decide on a place, you will want to keep them there at all times.
Next decide where your dog will sleep. Some people like to have their dog sleep in the bed with them, while others prefer to get a doggie bed or crate for them to sleep separately. Be aware that once a dog is allowed to sleep in your bed it can be much more difficult to get them to sleep in their own.
The size and activity level of your dog will determine the space needed for play and exercise. Usually, the larger the dog, the more space they will need., Your dog may come with some of these things, but you will need a collar and a leash that are appropriate for your dog's size, and a toy or two for starters. You will also need a food and water bowl, as well as food.


If you know what food your dog has been eating, it is best to continue feeding them that same food, at least initially. Coming into a new home can be stressful for any dog and changing foods may add to this stress. If you decide to change foods later you can, but be sure to do so gradually over the course of 5 to 7 days. This will help to avoid problems such as diarrhea or tummy upsets that can occur when changing foods too quickly., You could also make your own dog food. Don't feed your dog too much sugar, fried food, or other treats for people. These will harm your dog's health over time. NEVER feed a dog chocolate.


Generally, large breed dogs should be fed a large breed puppy formula until they are around one year of age. They then should be transitioned to an adult diet until changing to a senior diet at around six years of age. Small and medium breeds should be fed puppy formula until around one year of age when they should be changed to an adult diet.
If a young dog becomes overweight it is fine to switch them to adult food (which is less calorific) before they are 12 months old.

, Different dogs have different needs when it comes to food. If your dog is under one year old, he or she may need several meals a day. This can be reduced to twice a day for most dogs when they are around six months old. It is normal for some dogs as they get older and usually less active, to only want to eat once a day.Try to feed your dog at the same times every day. This helps your dog to know when mealtime is and helps you to know how much your dog is eating. This can be important if you are trying to housebreak a dog, if a decrease in appetite occurs, and also in preventing obesity.

, The appropriate amount of food should be measured out to allow you to gauge how much your dog is eating. Allow your dog to eat for about 10 – 15 minutes and then the bowl should be picked up until the next feeding time. If they don’t eat all of the food at this time they will be hungrier and more likely to finish it at their next feeding.


A good way to tell if your dog is getting enough or too much food is to monitor their weight and appearance. While for some more active breeds with certain body types, seeing their ribs can be normal, for most dogs that is a sign that they are not getting enough to eat. Also, if you can’t feel their ribs then they may be getting too much to eat. Always check with your veterinarian if there is a question about what your dog should weigh or look like.
Free feeding, which is having food always available, can be an easy way to feed; however, it is discouraged. The good eater is liable to gain weight, and the fussy eater doesn't get the excitement of mealtimes. Try to stick to feeding your dog on a regular schedule.
Puppies that are becoming overweight may need adjustments to their feeding amounts and exercise routines. It is best to consult with your veterinarian before making any changes.
Dogs should be switched to a senior diet at around eight years of age. This helps to prevent excessive calorie intake and weight gain that can occur in an older, less active dog. It is essential to always have fresh water available at all times., Keeping your dog's water bowl full of fresh water is essential. Dogs need to be able to drink when they're thirsty, and there's no harm in them drinking as much water as they want. You can put a few ice cubes in the water to keep it nice and cold when it's hot outside.

, Dogs need to be able to run around and play to stay healthy and happy. In general, take your dog for at least one, 30 minute, walk a day, although this may not be near enough activity for a high energy dog.


Simply taking your dog outside to relieve itself isn't enough exercise. Make sure the dog gets tired out a bit every single day.
The amount of exercise your dog needs will depend on their age, breed, health, and overall level of energy. Younger, very energetic breeds will require much more exercise than older, less active ones. Keep in mind that some breeds are not suited to as much exercise as others.
If you can, find a place where it's legal to remove the leash and let him run around and stretch.
To avoid damaging developing bones and joints in puppies, it is generally recommended to not take them running or do other repetitive high impact type of exercises, such as jumping from high places. As always ask your veterinarian for exercise recommendations.
Interacting with your dog by playing a variety of games will keep your dog stimulated both physically and mentally while also helping to build a strong bond between the two of you.Also depending on your dog's activity level and your schedule, doggie day care can be a great way to give your dog the exercise they need while allowing them to interact with other dogs and people.
Insufficient exercise can lead to boredom, which can cause many behavior issues including destructive ones. It can also lead to obesity, which can cause many related health issues and should be avoided at all costs.
As well as exercise, mental stimulation is vital for a healthy dog. Consider playing games daily, training, and using puzzle feeders, as ways of preventing boredom.

, Different dog breeds require different grooming strategies. As a whole, dogs should be brushed once a week or so to help them shed hair. Long haired breeds may need more frequent brushing to avoid developing tangles and also may require regular trims. Some breeds get hot in the summer and feel better when they're shaved as it starts getting warm outside. Determine what grooming habits are best for your dog's fur and nails.


Check for fleas and ticks while you groom, and remove them with a flea and tick comb. A quality flea prevention medication from your Veterinarian may be needed.

, Dogs don't need baths nearly as often as humans, but when they start to smell or get into mud and other messes, it's necessary to give them baths. Try to use lukewarm water and a natural, gentle shampoo that is made specifically for dogs and that will not irritate their skin.


Dogs like to run around after a bath, so you might want to time the bath so that the dog can run around outside afterward.
Bathing and grooming is also a good way to make sure you notice if your dog has a cut or bump that needs medical attention., Regular veterinary check-ups can help prevent or detect problems early. Routine vet visits include a physical exam, fecal check, and a heartworm test. Your vet may also recommend routine blood work to check for underlying issues that haven't surfaced yet and are best treated as early as possible.


Common regular medications that your vet may recommend include, heartworm preventative, regular dewormings, and flea and tick preventative depending on the season and what area of the country you live in.
Make sure that your dog has had all of their necessary immunizations. This will help to keep them happy and healthy. The standard immunizations for dogs include Rabies, which is administered at 12 weeks of age or older and then every 1 to 3 years depending on your local laws and your vets recommendations. Distemper, Parvovirus, and Hepatitis are usually administered together. Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks of age and then annually, as adults, again based on your Veterinarian's recommendations., Spaying and neutering are procedures that prevent unwanted pregnancies and can help to eliminate many health and behavioral issues. Neutering can prevent testicular cancers, prostate problems, urinary marking, and some aggressive behaviors in males. Spayed females have a greatly reduced incidence of mammary tumors and no possibility of uterine infections or uterine cancer.


Ideally a puppy should have this done at around six months of age. Discuss this procedure with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits or at the first visit after adopting an adult dog., Knowing your dog's normal eating habits, activity levels, and weight will help you to recognize when things change and are easy ways to track their health. Monitoring regular potty habits will help you to notice any changes that can indicate health issues. Regularly checking your dog's mouth, teeth, eyes, and ears will help to identify problems as soon as possible. You should check for lumps and cuts regularly. You should observe for any changes in the way your dog walks or moves.


Consult your Veterinarian when you notice any changes in your dog's normal condition.

, When bringing a new puppy or adult dog into your house, one of the first things to accomplish is teaching them to relieve themselves outside, instead of indoors. Dogs of any age can be trained with the proper guidance.


Until trained, there are a few rules to follow that will help with the process. Limit the areas your dog has access to so that they can be watched closely for signs that they are about to go and can be immediately taken out. Establish a schedule for taking them out that includes, first thing in the morning, after meal times, anytime you come home, and just before bedtime.
Puppies will need to go out more frequently when younger and as a rule can hold their urine for an hour for every month old that they are.
Keeping your dog on a leash, even when indoors, will allow you to monitor them more closely until they are trained. Also, when taking them outside, keep them on a leash so you can teach them to go in a specific location and to be sure that you know when they have gone.
You can use a word such as ""go"" to teach them to go in a specific location. If you catch them starting to go inside, tell them ""no"", take them outside, and tell them to ""go"". Always praise them when they go where they should.
If they have an accident in the house, be sure to clean the area thoroughly to help prevent them from wanting to go in the same place again.
Never spank or scold a dog for going inside. The dog will only learn to fear you.

, This will give your dog a place where they feel safe and content when you are not home and this is another popular option to prevent accidents.


With this method, try to make the crate a fun place by giving a treat or toy and limit the amount of time that they spend in the crate to less than 4 hours at any one time, much less for younger puppies. When taking them out of the crate, immediately take them outside to their spot and don't forget to praise them when they go., Dogs are generally good natured and most play well with children. Still, some like to bite and scratch a little too hard while they play, so it's important to train them how to play nicely. Reward your dog for playing gently and ignore it when it starts to bite. Eventually he or she will learn that it's more fun to be gentle.

, Barking is a normal activity for dogs and is one form of their communication, but too much barking is a common and annoying action that many dog owners want to correct. There are many different types of barking and some require very specific actions to try to curb the problem. This is usually a slow and gradual process that also requires a lot of patience.


There are some general guidelines for teaching your dog not to bark at every little thing. Identifying factors that cause them to bark and then eliminating them, such as closing the blinds or putting them in an area where they can't see what they are barking at is a good first step. When they don't stop barking, place them in a quiet room or their crate, with no stimulation, and allow them to calm down. Reward them as soon as they stop.
A natural instinct is to yell at your dog for barking, but that can make them think that you are barking with them.
If your dog is a compulsive barker, try increasing exercise and play times.
Dogs that bark for attention should be ignored and never rewarded until the barking stops.
This can be a difficult issue to correct and may require the help of a trained behaviorist or trainer. Bark collars should only be used after consulting with a trained professional., Basic commands, such as sit, stay, and come are a helpful ways to keep your dog safe by helping to prevent them from straying too far and getting lost when off leash outdoors. These also help to teach your dog their place in your relationship and to help them to bond more firmly with you.


Other commands provide a fun way for you and your dog to interact and play. You can teach your dog to sit, teach your dog to come, teach your dog to stay, teach your dog to lie down, and teach your dog to roll over.

If an owner is present, ask the owner if the dog is friendly. Make sure the dog wants to be petted. You can easily alienate a dog by approaching one that is nervous or agitated.A friendly dog is easily noticeable. A friendly dog will wag its tail and approach you to sniff you. Some friendly dogs may not approach directly, but may wag their tails and offer other signs they are friendly.
Avoid approaching a dog that's looking you straight in the eyes, barking shrilly, crouching, or growling.;
, Even if a dog is friendly, you can easily frighten a dog by approaching too quickly. When approaching a stray dog, do so slowly to assure the dog you're not a threat.Crouch down slightly to appear small and not frighten the dog.

When a dog sniffs your hand, do not move. This could startle a dog.

, If a strange dog becomes aggressive, take proper precautions. You want to avoid being bitten. Stop as soon as a dog begins barking or growling and talk to it in a calm, soothing voice.Never turn your back on an aggressive dog. If it pivots around you, keep turning so you're facing the dog.
Do not run from an aggressive dog. Wait until the dog stops moving and then slowly back away. Keep your eye on the dog as you move backwards.

, Remember, no two dogs are the same. You want to treat every dog as an individual and pay attention to its likes and dislikes. Some dogs may love belly rubs, while others may dislike them. Some may love playing fetch, while others may find it stressful. Each time you come across a new dog, pay attention to that dog's specific body language to make sure you're interacting with it in a positive fashion."

Create an area just for your new dog.,
Dog-proof the area.,
Include a safe space.,
Have the supplies you'll need ready.",How to Care for a Recently Rehomed Dog1," When you bring a dog into your home, it can be overwhelming. Try to make a space that's just for the dog. It's a good idea to pick an area where the dog can't do much damage if it forgets its house training, as dogs tend to do in new environments. An area with easy-to-clean floors is a good idea.Keep in mind that your dog may become accustomed to sleeping in that area, so pick a place you don't mind your dog living in permanently.;
, Once you've decided on an area, it's a good idea to make it dog proof. That means you need to remove any chemicals or plants that could be toxic to your dog. In addition, tape down cords so that your new dog can't chew or pull up the cords. Finally, remove any items that the dog could break and injure itself on, as well as any items you don't want destroyed., When a dog is in a new environment, it will want a safe place to retreat to when it feels overwhelmed. A dog bed is a good example, but a crate can be even better, as your dog will view that as its ""home"" within your home.However, it is important to use the crate for training purposes only. Do not just get a crate and leave your dog in it. Your dog should only be in the crate for short lengths of time.


Get a large enough crate. A crate gives your dog a safe space to call its own. However, it needs to be large enough to accommodate your dog. Your dog should be able to stand up, sit comfortably, and lay down. Otherwise, the dog may find the crate uncomfortable.Never use a crate for punishment. If you put your dog into the crate as a punishment, then this defeats the purpose and your dog will no longer feel safe going into the crate.
Do not leave your dog in the crate for more than a few hours. You should never leave your dog in the crate overnight or for extended periods of time because this can cause them to feel anxious and depressed due to a lack of exercise and interaction., You'll need the obvious items, like food and water bowls, food, a leash, and a collar. You'll also need things like an ID tag for the dog (with your information on it), brushes and shampoos (to groom the dog), and an enzymatic cleaner (to clean up after the dog).If possible, talk to the previous owner or shelter about what food the dog was on. It's best to keep the dog on it, at least for a little while."

Visit a dog park.,
Volunteer at a local shelter.,
Hang out with a friend’s dog.,
Walk dogs.,
Foster a dog.,
Choose to adopt.",How to Become a Dog Lover2," If you want to do some more active research on dogs, visit a local dog park. Do a search for parks near you. Some are specifically designated for small dogs, while others are for larger ones.


When you're there, ask people if you can pet their dog. Talk with them about why they chose the dog they have and what they like best about that particular breed.
You may want to bring a few treats for the dogs. This will help them to warm up to you. Be aware though, that you may gain more friends than you feel comfortable with, as the dogs may swarm at the scent of treats!

, One of the best ways to be around dogs, is to find a local shelter where you can volunteer. There are many opportunities for volunteers including feeding and walking the dogs. Don’t worry if you’re not there yet, though!


Do an online search for local animal shelters. You should be able to find more information as to how to volunteer, but if you’re having a hard time, give them a call.
There are usually a lot of great opportunities and what’s more, there are a lot of great benefits to working with the animals. You’ll discover new things about yourself, while helping to improve a dog’s situation., If you’re not quite ready to be around a number of dogs, try starting with a friend’s pet. It may be an easier transition if you have the owner close by to monitor the interaction.


You may feel more comfortable meeting at a local park, while the dog is still on a leash. Ask your friend to meet you there.
Once you’ve gotten to know the dog, you may feel more comfortable being around them at home. Let them smell your hand first and try bringing a dog treat with you, to start building the relationship.

, If you’re interested in getting some exercise and being around dogs, you may want to consider walking your neighbors dogs.


You should start with just one dog. Familiarize yourself with the animal prior to the first walk. Ask to see the leash and learn about his/her walking habits.
It may be best to start with a smaller dog, as they are often easier to control on a leash.
Do not take on the responsibility if you can’t ensure your safety and the safety of the dog, while walking.

, After all of your dog research, you may begin to feel like you’re ready to take on the responsibility of owning a dog. However, if you’re not quite ready to commit to 11 years, which is the average lifespan of a dog, you should consider fostering one.


Local shelters are often looking for foster families to provide temporary comfort, love and support to the many homeless dogs.
Terms and conditions vary greatly, so be sure to ask a lot of questions. You should know everything from what your financial responsibilities will be, to how the dog interacts with other animals and children.If you have a child in your home, make sure you try introducing the dog to your child before committing to the animal. Even if the shelter says they are good with children, you will want to make the introduction on your own.
Understand that if you fall in love with the dog, you may not be able to keep it and it may only be with you for a very short period of time.
You should also be aware of the challenges you could face when fostering an animal. Many have come from poor conditions and bad situations. They may have health or behavioral issues.

, You’re finally ready to take the leap and transform into a true dog person. Adopting a dog is a very big step! Remember, you’re committing to your new friend for 11 to even 20 years.Adoption should never be taken lightly. The worst thing you can do to a dog is to give him/her back to the shelter because you are unable to handle the responsibility.
Read up on the breed you’re considering adopting. You should learn about potential health issues, as well their unique characteristics.
Determine what the financial responsibilities will be and what basic care of a dog entails. If you work all day, you may need to find someone to let your dog out for potty breaks. These are all things to take into consideration before making the lifelong commitment.

Take the dog to the vet.,
Plan on being home.,
Take the dog home from the shelter or home.,
Let the dog explore.,
Give your dog a chance to approach family members.,
Provide chew toys.",How to Care for a Recently Rehomed Dog2," It's usually a good idea to get the dog checked out by a vet before bringing it home, particularly if you have other animals and especially if the dog is coming directly from another home. That way, you can make sure your new dog is happy and healthy and doesn't need to be treated for any problems that could make integrating into your home more difficult.


You might consider asking your veterinarian to microchip the dog. This will help to increase the chances of finding the dog again if they get out and get lost.

, When you first bring your dog home, it's a good idea to be home with the dog for the first few days. It helps your dog get acclimated to you and the environment at the same time before you need to return to your normal life. Try bringing your dog home on a weekend, for instance., When you go to pick the dog up, you'll need to have several things on hand just in case, including the leash, tag, collar, and carrier. A dog travels best in a carrier at least at first. Also, the tag and collar are important in case the dog somehow escapes while in transit.For safety reasons, it is important to keep your dog on a leash when you are outside (unless you are in a dog secure fenced-in area). Do this until you are certain the dog will not run away from you.

, The first thing that needs to happen when you get to your house is the dog needs to use the bathroom. Once that's done, take the dog inside, and let it move around the house, exploring. It's going to take some time for the dog to adjust to the new environment, so try not to get in its face right away.If the dog is not house-trained, then you will need to do this as well. Either way, be sure to show your dog where to go potty, such as by taking them to the same spot outside every time they have to go. Let them out to go potty several times per day, such as after their meals, first thing in the morning, midday, and before you go to bed at night.

, It's important to go slowly when introducing your dog to the family. Try introducing the family one person at a time. Always let the dog approach the person, rather than the other way around, as the other way can seem threatening.


Let the new dog explore without other pets around. The new dog wants to see its new territory, and exploring gives it a chance to see what its new place is all about. Have the other pets outside or locked in crates/other rooms while the new dog explores.
After that, do the opposite. Let the old pet explore the house while the new dog is locked up because it gives the old pet a chance to get used to the dog's new smell.Next, let them sniff each other through a door. They can get accustomed to each other's scent. You can also try crate-to-crate. Finally, let them meet face-to-face. If they get aggressive, you may need to keep them apart for longer.

, When your dog first gets to your house, it may want to chew on household items that you don't want destroyed. Providing solid chew toys gives the dog something to chew on, providing a safe, healthy distraction from your household items."
"
Crate train your dog.,
Let your dog get used to you leaving.,
Be patient.,
Give your dog a chance to settle in.,
Socialize the dog.,
Understand what may be triggers.",How to Care for a Recently Rehomed Dog3," Have the crate ready with a blanket in it when your dog gets home. Show the dog the crate, talking in an encouraging voice. To help the dog get used to the idea, place some treats inside the crate. Keep using treats to get the dog to go inside. You can use a toy if that's more motivating for the dog.Next, try feeding the dog in the crate. Wait a week or so before you start this process. Place the food bowl as far in as the dog will go. If the dog goes all the way in, try closing the door just while it's eating. Each time you feed the dog, close the door a bit longer.
Teach them a command for the crate. You can use whatever command you want, such as ""kennel,"" ""bed,"" or ""crate,"" as long as you are consistent. Use a treat to call the dog over, saying the command word. Get them to enter the crate with the treat, then give them the treat. Close the door, and sit with the dog for about 10 minutes. After a few minutes, leave the room for a bit. Once your dog can do this step for about half an hour without you in the room (without getting anxious), you can start leaving the dog alone in the house for short periods in the crate.
After that, you can try crating at night. It may help to start the dog in the same room as you.

, Most dogs will have a little separation anxiety, especially if they've been in a shelter before coming to your house. To help with the anxiety, put a toy in the dog's crate, and leave the dog for short periods of time at first, showing that you'll always come back to the dog., A re-homed dog is getting used to new rules. What was fine in their old house may not be fine in yours, such as sleeping on the bed. The dog may take a while to adjust, and you need to be patient. An old dog can learn new tricks, as long as you give them the time to do so., Don't overwhelm the dog with too much family time in the first couple of days or so. Let the dog get used to the environment without bombarding him with four people at once. You can visit with the dog one or two at a time, but try to limit too many people at once., While you shouldn't overwhelm the dog with too many people in the first couple of days, you should try to socialize the dog with friends and family in the first couple of weeks. Have them come over and visit, so that your dog can learn to distinguish between strangers and friends.Don't force people on the dog. Let the dog approach them.

, When you get a new dog from another home, you don't know what went on in that home. Therefore, you may find that certain things are triggering for your new dog. In an abusive home, newspapers, collars, and leashes may all have been used to abuse the dog and could be triggers, for instance.If something is a trigger, you're going to need to be patient with the dog. You'll need to give the dog time to adjust to using it or wearing it. In the case of a leash, you can let the dog drag it around the house for short periods, just to get the dog used to it. Be sure to supervise the dog, as it can get tangled up in the leash. Also, offer positive reinforcement such as treats and praise.
If it's something the dog doesn't need to use, such as newspapers, try keeping it out of the dog's sight as much as possible.

Wait to see your dog's personality.,
Reinforce good behaviors.,
Skip the pity.,
Don't be afraid to call in reinforcements.",How to Care for a Recently Rehomed Dog4," It can take a little time before you see your dog's true colors. In the first few weeks, it's still going to be nervous and maybe a bit shy or skittish. After a few weeks, you'll get to see the dog's truer self, so don't give up.For some dogs, it may even take several months for it to really feel comfortable in your home.

, In your dog's old home, it may have learned some bad behaviors. To help it acclimate, try reinforcing good behaviors. For instance, your dog may forget it's house training for a bit. If it does ask to go outside, reward it with a treat when it comes back in. If you find the dog to be noisy, reward it with a treat when it's being quieter.Never punish (yell at or hit) the new dog for bad behavior. This may cause him or her to fear you. Instead, focus on rewarding the dog for positive behavior.

, If your dog has been in a bad situation, pity is a natural reaction. But pitying your dog just means that you may end up not giving it the training it needs. You shouldn't be mean to it. However, being consistent in the way you enforce rules is important, so your dog knows how to act., Getting a re-homed dog can be a challenge, especially if you've never had one before. However, before you take your dog to the shelter, ask for some help. Talk to the rescue, to see if they have suggestions, or call your vet to see if they have recommendations. They may be able to help you deal with behavioral problems.You could also work with a trainer, particularly one that has experience with re-homed dogs.

Learn your dog's moods and feelings.,
Pay close attention to your dog’s body language.,
Give your dog space.,
Respect your dog.,
Keep your dog safe.,
Feed and give water to your dog.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Walk your dog daily.,
Bathe and groom your dog.,
Attend a brief dog training class.,
Keep all learning a fun experience.,
Play with your dog.,
Pet your dog.,
Discipline your dog.",How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend," This requires being observant and learning what you can about your own dog's temperament.


Use their body body language to learn how your dog is feeling and if they are comfortable.
If you just adopted or purchased this dog, give it some time to adjust to its surroundings before overwhelming it with attention.
Dogs will try to tell you things that they need and want. They may bring you their favorite toy or a tennis ball if they want to play, or whine by the door if they need to go outside. Paying attention to the cues that your dog gives you will help you to address their needs and wants.;
, A dog’s body language can tell you how they are feeling about a situation, their mood, or if they are receptive to other dogs and people in their space.


Dogs that have relaxed body positions, are enthusiastically wagging their tail or thumping it on the floor, have a happy expression on their face like a smile, and are in a play bow (bowing the front of their body towards the floor with their tail wagging) are happy and receptive to play!Dogs that are scared or anxious may try to avoid you by backing away from you, turning their head and body away from you, and hiding behind another person or object. Anxious dogs also may have their tail between their legs, and have wide bulging eyes (this is called a half moon eye). A dog that is aggressive may growl, guard their favorite possessions, snap at you, snarl, lunge off their leash, and bite., All animals need down time and to be alone so they can rest. Just like humans, dogs can become overwhelmed, tired, and cranky. If they're tired, they may try to tell you that they'd like to be alone by avoiding you and going to a space they enjoy sleeping in. This doesn't mean that your dog doesn't like you, they just need some time to themselves and to reset.


Give your dog space when they are tired, seem agitated, or appear to be afraid.
Once you are able to learn your dog’s body language, you need to respond appropriately to what they are communicating to you.

, Whether you have had this dog for a few weeks or for many years, you should always treat them with respect and love. If you want your dog to become your best friend, you also have to be their best friend. Friendships are built on mutual respect and care; the way that you treat your dog will become the ways that your dog will treat you. When you treat them with care and attention, they will reciprocate in their own way.


Never harm or hit your dog. This is animal abuse and you should not have a dog if you cannot refrain from hurting them. If you have a dog that you find yourself abusing, immediately surrender the dog to a shelter where they can be well taken care of.If you suspect that your dog has been harmed by someone else, you should take them to the veterinarian immediately. Contact law enforcement or your local animal control agency and let them know that your dog has been harmed.If your dog does not trust you, it will take time to develop a relationship. Dogs that have been rescued from abusive situations may take a longer time to warm up to you and to feel safe. Be respectful of the fact that they need more time to feel comfortable, and let the relationship progress at a slower pace.

, Your dog's safety can be threatened by things outside and inside of your home. Keeping your dog safe will help them to live a long and healthy life so that you can spend more time together!


Dogs are unable to eat many food items. You should avoid feeding your dog from your table as part of your behavioral training, but be aware that certain foods pose serious health risks to your pet. Some of the more common foods that dogs can never eat include chocolate, avocado, grapes, fruits with pits, garlic, and onions.Always keep your dog on a leash when you take them on a walk. Many cities and states have laws that forbid dogs to be off leash, but it's always a good idea to stay on the leash. Leashing your dog can help keep them away from other dogs that may be aggressive, busy roads and intersections, and the risk that they may run away.
Pet proof your home. Like babies and small children, dogs are curious creatures that can get into things they shouldn't. Lock away your cleaning products, any medicines, buy a trashcan that your dog can't open, and lock doors to rooms you want to keep off-limits., This may seem obvious, but feeding your dog is absolutely essential both to your relationship and the health of your dog.


Let your dog watch you fill their food and water bowls. They will associate you with food and understand that you are providing for them.
Feed your dog at specific times during the day rather than leaving food out all day. This is a good way to help your dog build a routine and to further associate you with food and caring for them.
There are many different types of dog food. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are unsure of what to choose. Some dogs are pickier than others and prefer certain types of dog food over others. It may take a few tries to find a food that your dog likes.
Treats are a great way to motivate your dog to do tricks or to reward them for good behavior. Give treats in moderation to keep your dog at a healthy weight.

, A healthy dog is a happy dog! Good preventive medical care helps them live a longer happier life.


Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations and worming.
If your dog does have medical problems, their medical care can become very expensive. Pet medical insurance is one option to help moderate your costs.When you have a strong bond with your dog, your dog will begin to understand that you are concerned about their health and wellbeing when it comes to medical procedures or vet visits.

, Your dog will need plenty of exercise to keep healthy and spending time together walking is a good way to bond with your pet. Again, they will associate you with going on walks, which many dogs find to be their favorite activity!


Purchase a good quality leash. If you have a larger dog that is strong, you may want to consider buying a harness to attach to a leash.
Take your dog out regularly for good long walks.
Train them to behave appropriately on a leash. They should not be pulling you along the road. They should heel and stay close by your side and walk at your pace.
Take your dog to the dog park and let them socialize with other dogs and people. Your dog can bond and meet new friends while they enjoy being outside and running free.
Always clean up after your dog and carry plastic bags on your walks to dispose of your dog’s waste.

, Depending on the breed of your dog, they may require more frequent or complicated grooming.Generally, try to brush your dog’s fur once a week to prevent knotted, matted hair.
Give them baths. Some dogs love baths, some are not such big fans. Wash them at least once a month, or whenever they are muddy or dirty.. If you use a gentle shampoo, you can bathe your dog up to once a week.
Depending on the breed, you may need to take your dog to the groomers so they can give your dog hair cuts that are appropriate for the breed.
Trim your dog’s nails. Like humans, dogs’ nails grow continuously. Unless your dog is very active and wears them down on pavement or concrete, you will need to trim their nails when they become long. There are special dog nail clippers, but regular nail clippers can be used as well., If you have never trained a dog before, a dog training class is a helpful way to learn the basics.


Training your dog can help keep them safe, healthy, and sociable.
As the owner, you are the leader and guide in your relationship with your dog. They rely on you for their health and well-being so it is important to set boundaries with your dog in regards to undesirable behaviors.
Obedience classes help you and your dog to establish good communication when they learn to respect and follow your verbal and physical cues.

, When you are training your dog, mix it with play!


Many dogs, especially working dog breeds, enjoy tasks and are bred to perform jobs. These dogs may benefit from participating in an agility training course, receiving more exercise, and spending more time outdoors.Many dogs are motivated by food, so small treats can be a positive motivator when they correctly do a trick or a specific behavior.

, Play encourages a healthy relationship and gives you an opportunity to continue to bond with your dog.


Games like fetch or tug of war are great ways to give your dog some exercise and for them to have fun. Try different games to see what your dog enjoys.Some dogs are less interested in playing with you than others. Some may prefer to play independently or with other dogs. This is okay! This is just your dog’s personal preference and you should respect that.
Keep track of games and toys that your dog likes better than others! Knowing what your dog does and doesn't like is a healthy way to bond over shared interests, like playing together.

, Physical contact is a great way to show that you care about your pet. Most dogs love belly rubs, pats on the head, and pets. When you pet your dog, studies have shown that both you and your dog release a hormone called oxytocin, which makes you both feel calm and happy.Snuggling and cuddling with your dog helps to de-stress both of you, while encouraging a strong physical bond.
Some dogs like more physical contact than others, and there are times when even the cuddliest dog needs their space. Just like with humans, sometimes dogs want to be close to you and in physical contact, and during other times they don't.
Physical contact helps to solidify the emotional and relational bond between you and your dog. It demonstrates that you both love, respect, and care for each other.
Grooming also shows your dog that you care about their wellbeing, and it helps to foster a physical bond while keeping your dog healthy and clean.

, Disciplining your dog is essential in maintaining good boundaries in your relationship.


There are different ways to discipline your dog, but you should always refrain from hitting your dog. If a dog has done something that it shouldn't have, like gone on your couch or eaten off your plate, you can make them sit and sternly tell them, ""No! Bad dog! Don't do that!""Dogs that love and respect their owners will often feel guilty for their actions. After you have disciplined the dog, it may try to cuddle with your or apologize for its actions. They are cognitively aware that you are upset with them and they want to rectify the situation.
Use discipline that is appropriate for the scenario. The discipline that you would use if your dog barked when it shouldn't have versus tearing up your couch will be very different.

Scruff your cat to discipline him.",How to Hold a Cat by the Scruff," Strong-smelling perfumes or colognes may be bothersome to him. The scent of a dog may be especially unsettling., Calmly petting him and allowing him to rub up against your hand will relax him. You may need to spend extra time on this step, depending on if your cat has a calm or skittish temperament., A cat can be held by the scruff with a collar on, but this is not recommended unless you are experienced with handling cats in this way. Although the scruff is flexible, the collar is not, and you might tighten the collar around his neck by accident., Having your cat on a sturdy and even surface, such as a table or counter top, will allow you to scruff him more easily.You could also use the floor as a supportive surface, if your cat seems to be more comfortable on the floor.

, Rest your hand at the back of your cat’s neck and gently grasp the loose skin in this area with your entire hand. Grasp as close to the ears as possible to lessen the chances that your cat will struggle or attempt to bite you.Your cat’s ears should go back slightly when you grasp the skin right behind the ears. This will let you know that you are grasping in the right place.
When you tighten your grasp, the skin should still feel relatively loose in your hand. If it feels tight, you may have grasped too much skin; loosen your grip slightly. Your cat will probably let you know if you are holding the skin too tightly.
Do not grab too little scruff. This could cause you to pinch your cat’s skin. Re-adjust your grip to pick up more skin.
Unless your cat is very aggressive, you should notice that he doesn't mind the grasping at all; he might even become very still. Sometimes this alone is enough to stop your cat from doing something you don't want him to do, or to calm him while you clip his nails or give him medication.

, Before attempting to lift your cat by his scruff, remember that cats, especially older ones, typically do not need to be held this way. Unless it’s a mother cat carrying her young from one place to another, cats usually do not need to picked up by the scruff.If you need to lift your cat after scruffing him, keep in mind that this will be easier with kittens because of their light weight., Lifting a heavy cat by his scruff could place extra tension on his neck muscles and skin, which would be uncomfortable and painful for him.To avoid this tension, providing extra support for his weight will be needed.


After grasping the scruff of a heavy cat, fully support his back end with your other hand. Depending on the size of your cat, you may need to wrap part of your other arm around his hindquarters.Pick him up only when you are securely supporting his back end.

, Although scruffing is not painful for your cat when done properly, it can become uncomfortable if done for too long. Also, keep in mind that even the most patient cats will get tired of being held this way and may try to swing around to loosen your grip, or kick you with their back paws.It is important to remember that your cat is essentially trusting you in a very vulnerable position. If he senses that you are being too rough or are anxious, he may not want to cooperate with being scruffed.
Unless your cat feels like he’s being attacked, he should just hang there and look at you, waiting for you to put him down. Some cats will vocalize softly, as if to say ""Hey, I'm not the biggest fan of this, so let's get this over with soon.""

, If you have lifted your cat, release the scruff after gently putting him back down gently on a supportive surface.


Provide positive reinforcement afterwards to reward him for having good behavior when being scruffed. Examples of positive reinforcement include petting, talking, and treats.Do not release your cat's scruff by dropping him. While a healthy cat won't get injured in this way, he will learn that you are too rough and he might not be as cooperative the next time you pick him up by the scruff.

, Mother cats carry and control their kittens by firmly grabbing the scruff with their mouth. If you've ever seen a kitten get handled this way by its mother, you'll see that the kitten instinctively becomes still and draws his limbs close to his body. Many cats will continue to do this as adults when they are grabbed by the scruff., Avoid scruffing your cat in situations that would agitate the cat or increase the risk of injury for you or your cat.


When your cat is sleeping−just like how you would not want to be grabbed when you are sleeping, scruffing your cat when he is sleeping would startle him.
When your cat is eating–let him finish eating first before doing something that may require him to be scruffed.
When he is agitated or excited−he may be particularly difficult to calm down or handle while he is worked up, which could increase the likelihood of you being scratched or bitten.If your cat has arthritis or is obese–scruffing can strain the neck muscles, which could be especially painful in a cat with arthritis or who is extremely overweight.
If your cat does not have much scruff–some cats simply don't have much of a scruff. You should be able to sense this when you grab the scruff. Don't attempt to hold your cat if he has a meager scruff.
If your cat is old−adult cats may feel humiliated or embarrassed when being scruffed., Although your cat may not be a fan of getting his nails trimmed, keeping him as still as possible will help you clip his nails more quickly and keep you from getting scratched or bitten. Trim his nails when he is calm and relaxed, rather than he when is stressed or worked up from vigorous play.Your cat should be laying down on a supportive surface (eg, table, counter top) when you scruff him to trim his nails. This will be more comfortable for both you and the cat. This step may require 2 people (1 person scruffing, 1 person trimming the nails).
If you are trimming your cat's nails or administering medication to him, you will not need to lift him in the air after scruffing him. In these instances, you would gently push his head toward the supportive surface and use your other hand or arm to gently restrain his back end., Combing out mats in your cat’s fur is not the most comfortable experience for your cat; it may even be painful for him. Since he may want to move around when having the mats combed out, keeping him still will be important.Just like with trimming your cat’s nails, place him on a supportive surface prior to scruffing him to comb out the mats.
Use a wide-toothed comb.With your free hand, hold the mat as close to the skin as possible and comb it out from the bottom to the top–just as you would do if you were combing out a knot in person’s hair. , Cats can be particularly difficult when someone tries to give them medications. Keeping your cat still will increase your chances that you will be able to give him his treatment.Scruff him on a supportive surface.
If you are trying to give him a pill, tilt his head up slightly while you are scruffing him to put the pill in his mouth.
For injectable medications, it may be safer to have your veterinarian or veterinary technician will scruff the cat and administer the medication, rather than trying to do this at home.

, This should be done sparingly, since scruffing him may actually make the situation worse.If you must scruff him to discipline him, say the word ‘no’ while you are doing it so that he knows that he has misbehaved.Also, scruff him gently to discipline him. Scruffing your cat roughly when he is in trouble will likely agitate him.

You have the best possible chance of catching cats if you can get them to develop a routine of coming to your house (and no one else's) for food. This way, by the time you decide to start trapping cats, they'll feel safe around your house and won't suspect your trap. Ask your neighbors to cooperate by not leaving food out for the feral cats — you don't want the cats to be at a neighbor's house when your trap is out.


You may also want to alert your veterinarian that you intend to trap a feral cat (or cats) and will bring them in for treatment. However, since you don't know exactly which night you'll be catching a cat, don't commit to a firm date.;
, Leave a dish of food in an easy-to-access spot each evening. Remove the dish and clean it every morning, then repeat the following night. To encourage the cats to develop a habit of coming to your house for food, put the food out at the same time, in the same place every night.


In terms of food, you ideally want something both that tastes good to the cats and has a strong scent. Canned fish work well — tuna, mackerel, or sardines in oil are all good choices.Chicken, liver, and other meats also work, as does canned cat food., Cats generally aren't stupid animals — they'll be wary if their food suddenly appears one night in the middle of a metal cage. To get the animal accustomed to seeing and smelling the trap, leave it out for several nights right next to the food. You can even eventually put the food inside a trap that is tied open.


Be patient — taking the time to get a cat used to this trap now will make it much easier to trap the cat in the long run.
You will want to use a standard, box-style live trap for this task. See the section below for more information on which types of traps are (and aren't) appropriate.

, If you get the chance, try waiting about 20 feet away the trap one night (or, if possible, behind a nearby window.) Take notes on the cats as they arrive and begin to feed — assign each one a name or number so that you can keep track of them. Look for signs that might tell you whether each cat is a feral or a stray (i.e., a cat that was raised outside versus one that at one point had a home.) Identifying signs of a stray cat will help the animal agency that it winds up at find it a new home.



Stray cats (cats that used to have a home) generally:Feel more comfortable approaching humans
Are more likely to be by themselves
Are more likely to have a friendly, open appearance (tail up, eye contact, etc.)
May make more noise





Feral cats, on the other hand:



Will usually stay away from humans
Are more likely to live in packs or colonies
Are more likely to have a guarded, tense appearance (low, slinking posture, tail down, etc.)
Are usually silent
Will often have fairly clean coats





, Even if your feral cat eventually gets used to feeding at your house, they can still be wary of food left inside a trap. To give the cat extra incentive to go for the bait, skip one day of feeding him. This will leave him extra hungry the following night, which will make him more eager to take risks (like crawling into you trap) to get food.

, The sort of trap you should generally use for cats is the same sort that's often used for skunks, raccoons, and other small pests. The trap should look like a long rectangular wire cage with a slanted trap door at one end. The door swings shut when the cat steps on a pad at the rear of the trap while trying to eat food. These traps are commonly sold at hardware and hunting goods stores — make sure you buy one that's big enough to fit a fully-grown cat.


Depending on their size, live traps can retail for anything from $20 to about $100. Generally, for a reliable trap, this money is worth it. Don't try to save money by improvising your own trap unless you're an experienced trapper — there's a risk the cat may escape or be injured.

, The evening after you skip feeding your cat, put your trap out with a little food on a small dish or paper towel behind the pressure plate. Ideally, the site of the trap should be perfectly flat so that the trap doesn't shake or rattle when the cat walks into it and scare the animal away.


You may also want to put something heavy (like a rock) on top of the trap so that it is weighed down and won't move when the cat enters.
Though it's not required, you may also want to place a piece of newspaper or a towel on the floor at the front of the trap to make the cold metal floor of the trap more inviting. This will also prevent the cat's feet from slipping through the bars when you pick the trap up. You will want to put a very small amount of food at the front of the trap as a teaser. Cover the trap with a towel or sheet so the cat feels confined and safe after being trapped.Some people like to put a flattened cardboard box underneath the trap for easy clean-up. This isn't essential, but it can keep food bits from the bait trail from working their way into the ground.

, Trappers are somewhat divided on the issue of whether or not it's a wise idea to cover the trap with a towel before leaving it out. Those in favor believe that the towel helps to camouflage the trap and comfort the animal once it's caught.On the other hand, those against it believe that being able to see through the trap makes it seem like less of a threat to the cat. Whether or not you cover your trap is up to you — if you follow the rest of the steps, it's not likely to make a major difference either way.


If you do cover the trap, ensure that the towel you use doesn't interfere with the mechanism of the trap before you leave it out.

, Now, all you need to do is wait. If you want to stay near the trap, make sure you're far enough away that the cat won't be threatened by your presence. Assuming you set your trap out at dusk, you'll want to check your trap at least once before you go to bed. After that, you'll want to check on the trap as soon as you wake up in the morning to see whether your trap has caught anything. Note that some animal societies even recommend keeping constant surveillance on the trap.Note also: It is inhumane to leave a cat (or any other animal) in a trap for prolonged periods of time. Inside a trap, an animal has no access to food or water (unless you provide it), no room to stretch out, and no way to move away from its urine or excrement. In addition, in weather that is very hot or cold, staying in a trap for any length of time can be dangerous and may even lead to the animal's death from exposure, so it's extra-important to check the trap as soon as you can.

, Up to this point, we've only mentioned standard box-style live traps in terms of options for trapping cats. While there may be other effective options available, you will never, ever want to use a trap that has a chance of hurting or maiming the cat. Traps you should definitely avoid include:Steel jaw traps (i.e., bear traps)
Wire or rope snares
Traps that grip or crush the body
Any trap that hangs the animal by a limb

, As soon as you notice that you've caught a cat, carefully remove any towels you may have laid over the trap and check to see that the cat is healthy. Use caution here — though some cats may be docile, feral cats that are not accustomed to people may become agitated. Look for obvious injuries or signs of malnourishment and contact a vet right away if you find any. Cover the cat again as soon as you can — this will calm it and keep it from thrashing and yowling.


If you notice that your trapped cat is a lactating female, you will need to take it to the vet and release it as soon as possible. Lactation is a sign that a mother cat has kittens, who can not generally survive on their own for long periods of time.
If you end up trapping a neighborhood pet or a wild animal, simply release it according to the directions below.

, If you can't immediately take the cat to the vet, put it in a safe but secluded spot away from children and other animals, like a garage or basement. Keep the trap covered while you do so to keep the cat calm. Most importantly, wear hand protection (especially if you're dealing with a feral cat) to protect yourself both from scratches and microorganisms that may be present on the cat.


You may also want to elevate the trap on pieces of wood or bricks so that waste will fall through the wire. Place newspaper under the elevated trap.
If you intend to trap more than one cat you should put 1-2 more traps than cats you expect to trap out when you start the process.
Avoid feeding the cat. Opening the trap gives the cat an opportunity to lunge for the exit or scratch you. In addition, if the vet ends up recommending surgery (such as spaying or neutering) for the cat, the procedure will be easiest if the cat has an empty stomach.

, Even if the cat you've trapped appears perfectly healthy, it's important that you take it to the vet as soon as you can. Feral cats can sometimes be carriers of diseases, though the risk of a seemingly healthy cat having an extremely dangerous disease like rabies is very, very small.More likely, however, is that the feral cat will breed if released without seeing a vet. As mentioned above, large feral cat populations can quickly become nuisances to the neighborhood, so it's wisest to have the cat spayed or neutered.


Note that some vets offer discount rates for spaying or neutering feral cats as a service to the community.If the cat is unhealthy or requires serious medical care, be prepared to make a decision with your vet about whether or not to humanely euthanize it. For a feral cat in the wilderness, a major medical condition can mean a slow, painful death.

, After the cat has seen the vet, simply take it to the place where you originally caught it and open the trap. Use hand protection as you handle the trap. Allow the cat to leave on its own — don't give it a goodbye petting.



Do not take the cat to someplace unfamiliar when you release it. The cat will usually become disoriented, get lost, and eventually die if you do this.After you release the cat, wash both the trap and your hands with bleach, soap and water.

Tell the difference between a stray and a pet.,
Try to approach the stray.,
Check for tags.,
Provide shelter, water, and catnip for a potential stray cat.,
Consider contacting a professional.,
Set a trap yourself.,
Check the trap frequently but carefully.,
Decide what to do with the cat once it is trapped.",How to Handle a Stray Cat1," Both lost strays and outdoor pets can be skittish or friendly, so it's hard to tell from behavior. The cat is probably a stray if its fur is messy or dirty, or if it looks skinny or injured. If the cat lets you touch it, check the paw pads. Stray cats that have lived outdoors for a few weeks will have hard, calloused feet compared to the soft paws of a family pet.


If the cat tries to hide, doesn't look at you, and doesn't meow, it might be a feral cat, that was never a pet.
Keep an eye out for lost cat notices on store windows and telephone poles in your neighborhood, and in local newspapers and websites.
Be extra vigilant in winter. Strays are desperate for shelter and food at this time, and pets are unlikely to spend much time outside. Fresh tracks after a snowfall are an easy way to track strays if you get up before heavy traffic begins.;
, If you think the cat is a stray, approach slowly while speaking in a soft voice. If the cat acts skittish, try bending down to its level. Hold out your hand and call it with a sweet voice. If that doesn't do it, return to the area later with a strong-smelling food, like tuna or dried liver.Try different tones or pitches, as some cats respond better to a higher or lower voice, or even ‘meow’ sounds.
Don't get too close if the cat seems tense or nervous. If the cat feels cornered, it may bite or scratch.

, If the cat has tags and lets you get close enough to read the phone number or address, contact the owners to find out whether the cat is supposed to be outside.


Some tags have the contact info for a veterinary clinic instead. The vet may not be legally allowed to give you the owner's contact info, but they can pass on a message.

, This may help to keep a lost cat near you until you can assist it. Place the food outdoors very late at night, in a small space that a cat could access but a larger animal could not.


In sub-zero temperatures, oil from a tin of sardines poured over kibble works well.
Do not leave food out until you suspect you have a stray, since this may just attract wildlife or feed other people's pets (who may be on controlled diets).

, If you cannot approach the cat, you could ask Animal Control or a local animal shelter to capture it. Find out their policies before you make the call, especially if the cat does not have tags. Many shelters euthanize cats that do not seem adoptable. Others offer a more humane trap-neuter-release (TNR) program, so the cat returns outside but doesn't grow the feral cat population.


Shelters generally offer a better chance at a good life for strays than they find on the streets. In a shelter, the cat will not die of starvation, injuries, or exposure.

, If you would rather catch the cat yourself, buy a humane cat trap from a hardware store, or ask animal control if they have any available for loan. Cover the trip plate and wire bottom of the trap with newspaper, so that the cat won't instinctively avoid stepping on the trip plate. Bait the trap with a small amount of strong-smelling food. Herring, mackerel, or sardines canned in oil (but not pickled) are excellent choices.


Do not set the trip plate on a hair trigger. If the cat triggers it prematurely and escapes, it may never come back. It's better to risk the plate not going off, since you can put out more bait and try again.
Too much food will create a mess if the cat panics and scatters it or vomits.
In exceptionally cold weather, cover the trap with a sheet or towel, then heap snow over this covering to help keep the cat warm and calmer once it has been trapped.

, Check the trap as often as possible, but approach slowly to avoid scaring away the cat at the wrong moment. If the trap doesn't work in a day or two, try this longer-term approach:


Disable the trap.
Every day at the same time (preferably dusk), put out food near the trap.
Gradually move the feeding spot closer to the trap, and eventually inside it. If the cat won't go inside, try covering the trap with a towel sprayed with cat pheromone spray.
Once the cat is eating consistently inside the trap, set it to trigger.

, Once you have captured the cat, contact a local shelter to ask about local laws. In some areas, you are required to take lost pets to a shelter so the owner has a chance to find it.Make a decision based on the shelter's response and on the cat's appearance:


If you do not plan to look after the cat at home, arrange in advance for a shelter or animal control agency to pick up the cat. Keep the cat in the trap in a quiet, dark area while it waits. Minimize the amount of time the cat has to wait, as this is extremely stressful for the animal.
A stray pet tends to have a dirty coat, and a tendency to meow and make eye contact. It may eventually relax, come up to the front of the cage, or investigate toys or people that come near the cage.Continue on for advice on finding the owner or adopting it yourself.
A feral (untamed) cat typically stays in the far back of the cage, may shake or bang the walls, and ignores toys and people.Learn more about how to handle the animal, along with other ways to confirm that it really is feral.

If your cat has just had kittens, then the best thing to do is to leave your cat on her own for a while.,
After an hour, come back to see her and the kittens.,
When your cat lets you pick up the kittens, don't move your cat or take the kitten out of the room or away from its mother.,
Slowly slide your hand under the kitten's stomach.,
Pinch the scruff of the kitten's neck with your other hand, but not too hard.,
Slowly lift your kitten up and take your hand from underneath it.,
Let go of the scruff of its neck and place the hand that was holding it underneath the kitten's front legs.,
Move your hand that the kitten's back legs are on sideways against your chest while removing the hand holding its front legs.

,
Your kitten should be standing on its back legs against your chest with its front paws against your chest.,
Put your free hand on its back and let it move onto the palm of the hand that is holding its back legs.",How to Hold Newborn Kittens," Don't touch her or try to move her. Just give her about an hour to relax.;
, They should all be born and clean by now. If you have a strong bond with your cat, then she is more likely to let you handle the kittens. If you don't, then try to stroke the kittens. If she hisses at you, then leave the kittens alone, but let them get used to you. Do this for a few days and then try stroking them. Your cat will soon see that you mean no harm to the kittens and will soon let you pick them up. However, if when you try stroking them, your cat hisses at at you, then just have your hand near the kittens.

, Sit down to reduce the chances of the kitten getting injured if it falls. Make sure the kitten is still before picking it up to ensure you don't hurt it by trying to grab it.

, Keep your hand there to get your kitten used to the feeling. It shouldn't be that scared of you because it knows your scent.

, Keep holding it like this for a while. If the kitten struggles, then let it go and try again.

, Then quickly put your hand underneath its back legs.

, Then, slowly bring the kitten towards your chest and keep it there.

,, Don't let it stay in this position for long.

, Use your other hand to stroke it. Then put it back against your chest, pick it up by the scruff of the neck, place your other hand underneath its stomach, and slowly put it back down. Do this a few times a day and remember to play with it and get it used to its name.

Put food out at the same time and place daily. Food is usually the easiest way to get feral cats to come into your vicinity., Don't try to grab the cat, or even touch the cat, as most feral cats are extremely skittish and loathe to be touched by humans. Instead, stay outside and sit quietly in a chair nearby after putting out the food. Stay extremely still and remain quiet while the cat feeds.Let the cat control the situation. If it comes over to you and rubs against you, great. If not, just sit there are be quiet. It's still getting used to being around you., The safest way to trap a feral cat, or a wild animal of any kind, is to use a safe live trap, such as the Havahart brand. A medium-sized trap should be fine for most feral cats and raccoon-sized animals. Most brands of live trap work essentially the same way, but follow the instructions particular to the model you get.


A live trap has openings at both ends and a basic trigger in the center on which to put food. When the cat enters the cage and triggers the trap, the doors shut, enclosing the cat inside the cage. It's easy to transport and comfortable for the cat.
In some cities, spay and neuter organizations will provide live traps to borrow for people hoping to bring cats in. Research your options locally if you don't want to buy one yourself., Set up the appointment a few days before you try to trap the cat to give the animal time to get used to the trap and give yourself enough opportunities to catch the animal. Make sure that the vet will use dissolving stitches, so that the cat will not need a return visit before you release it back to the colony.Let the veterinarian know anything you know about the cat, such as its sex, any health issues you might've noticed, and whether or not you have any idea about the cat's age.

, You can open the doors of most live traps without setting them, allowing an animal to pass freely in and out of the trap without actually trapping it. You might consider setting out the food at the regular time to let the animal get used to the cage and let it get some of its scent and pheromones in the space to make it more comfortable., You will need a quiet, protected spot to keep the trapped cat before the clinic appointment and after the surgery. It should be a place where the temperature is mild (anesthesia renders them with less ability to regulate their body temperature), protects them from other animals. Make sure it is also quiet and free of disturbance.


A spare bedroom or any dark area of your house would be appropriate. Closets or finished basements would also do nicely.

, To make sure the cat will be enthusiastic for the food you put out in the trap, as well as not overfed before undergoing surgery, skip a feeding. It might be hard, but resist the urge to put food out before you're ready to trap the cat.While you can withhold food, don't withhold water! Be sure to continue to give the feral cat water even the night before the attempted trapping.

, At the appropriate feeding-time (ideally 12-24 hours before the appointment), fold a lightweight cloth lengthwise and insert it to cover the wire bottom of the trap and the trip plate. Put about 2 tablespoons of canned cat food (or tuna, mackerel, or some other strong-smelling enticing food) at the very back of the trap. Set the trap and put it on a flat surface where it won't shift or tip prematurely.


You can drizzle some juice or oil from the food in a zigzag pattern from the back of the trap towards the front if you want some extra attraction. Alternately, sprinkle a few grains of dry food leading into the back of the trap, but not too much.
Consider putting an empty lid or cup in the cage to fill later with water after the cat's been trapped. Make sure the container doesn't have any sharp edges that the cat could get cut on. You can use a turkey baster to fill the lit from a comfortable distance.

, Don't leave the trap unattended but you don't have to spring into action immediately after the cat is trapped.It can, however, calm the cat down considerably to cover the trap immediately with a blanket or tarp after you see the trap has sprung effectively.


Either way, bring the trap inside to your holding area as soon as you notice the cat's been trapped inside. It might thrash considerably, so be careful to keep your fingers out of the openings.
The cat may whine and make otherwise terrible sounds that can be heartbreaking. Remember: You're doing the right thing.

, Let the cat relax and calm down in your holding area until the appointment. Let it have some water and try to keep the environment as calm and quiet as possible., You might put a tarp or blanket down on your backseat, just in case the cat decides to urinate or spray in your car while being transported. Remember, this is an extraordinarily weird experience for the cat, so be prepared for it to act out.

, When it's time for the appointment, carry the cat very gently and slowly, making smooth movements and keeping your hands far from the openings and gaps in the cage. Drive the cat to the appointment and let the vets take control of the situation. Make sure the veterinary office knows the cat is feral.


Speak gently to the cat in a soothing voice and keep the situation calm. Don't play loud music or drive with the windows down.

, Your vet will advise you on the basic procedures, and you'll be able to keep the cat for a few hours overnight in your holding area before releasing it or taking it where you wish., If this is something that must be done, contact your local animal shelter for tips on other options, or research no-kill shelters in your area if it comes to that.

Determine if the mother cat is nearby.,
Estimate the age of the kitten.,
Talk to your neighbors.,
Learn about feral cats.,
Make a plan.",How to Catch a Stray Kitten1," When you see a kitten who appears to be alone, your first step is to figure out if the mother cat is still in the picture. It is possible that she has abandoned her kitten, but it could also be that she is simply out hunting for food. The only way to know whether the kitten is motherless is to wait. You will need to observe the situation for more than just a few minutes. Try watching from a spot where the kitten won't notice you and be frightened away.


Be patient--remember, you want to help the kitten, not unnecessarily remove it from its mother. Mother cats usually search for food in the mid-afternoon, while her kittens are sleeping. If you are seeing the kitten alone in the morning, it's an added sign it has been abandoned.;
, While you won't be able to get an exact number, it is very important that you attempt to figure out how old the kitten is. Mother cats usually begin to wean their litters at about 6 weeks. You'll need to know if the kitten is younger than that so that you will be prepared to care for it.


There are a few ways that you should be able to get a rough estimate on the kitten's age. Kittens open their eyes at about 10 days; if their eyes are not open yet, you know you're dealing with an infant.Another good way to tell is to gauge the kitten's activity level. Typically, kittens begin to walk at about 3 weeks. If you see a kitten who seems to be able to walk and play without too much wobbling, you can be pretty sure that your kitten is at least 4 weeks old., You definitely want to make sure that the kitten in question is actually a stray. Even though it is young, it could still be somebody's missing pet. Take some time to try to investigate. Chat with the people who live near you to see if they have noticed the kitten and if they have any information about where it belongs. You could also post flyers around your area, in addition to chatting face to face with your neighbors., A stray kitten may also be called a feral (wild) cat.When you are dealing with any non-domesticated animal, you will want to be cautious. It's good to be aware that stray cats are very different from the kitties you see in a pet store or at your friend's house. They are skittish, and not used to humans.


Also, you can't be sure what the medical history of a stray cat is, so it's good to be a little wary (no matter how cute it is). Try calling a local vet or animal shelter to ask if they have any good information on cats living in your area. , Obviously, you want to do the right thing to ensure the kitten's safety. But that is going to take some consideration and planning on your part. There are several questions to ask yourself. For example, do you have the amount of time you need to do this right? Catching a stray cat can take a few days, and you will also need to schedule some time to care for the kitten after you catch it. Make sure you have all of the materials you need, and that you have contacted a vet so that you know where to take the kitten for medical care.


Whether you plan to keep the kitten or find it another home, you'll want to make sure it is healthy.Make sure you've giving some thoughts to the steps you'll take to catch the kitten and to handle it after you succeed."
"
Handle with maximum caution.,
Set up a safe place for the cat to stay.,
Release the cat carefully.,
Isolate the cat from other animals in the home.,
Allow the cat to calm down for a few hours.,
Try to locate the owner.,
Respond to potential owners.,
Feed and care for the cat on a regular schedule.,
Try to touch the cat.,
Adopt the cat yourself.",How to Handle a Stray Cat2," Even a friendly cat often panics in a trap. Wear heavy gloves when near the cat, and have a thick towel or blanket ready to throw over the cat if it tries to attack you. Avoid picking it up whenever possible; even if you avoid bites and scratches, the cat may resent the person who handles it.

If absolutely necessary, transfer the cat to a carrier as follows:
1. Set the carrier on its end, with the door at the top.
2. Get behind the cat and scruff it firmly at the neck with your dominant hand.
3. Push down on the cat's back immediately with your other hand, until you can get hold of both back legs.
4. Stretch your arms apart as far as you can, lift the cat, and put it rear-end-first into a carrier.
5. Quickly close the door on top of the cat. Hold the door down with one hand and brace the carrier between your legs until you have latched the door securely.
, Ideally, the room should be escape-proof, quiet, unused, easily cleaned, and almost completely empty. Spare bathrooms and fully-enclosed porches work well.Keep the following in this room:


A comfortable seat for you to sit in quietly while the cat becomes used to you.
A comfortable hiding place where the cat has a good view of the room. A cat carrier on a high shelf works well.
Water
Litter
You can include a scratching post, toys, and a (closed) window, but the cat may be too stressed to use them.

, Wear gloves and position the trap or carrier away from you when you let the cat out. Most cats will scurry right into the hiding spot, but some will attempt escape.


Keep the door closed. Cats can move very quick and may jump over you to reach the exit.

, Your safe room should have zero access to the other animals in your household, including being able to smell each other under doors, as disease can pass this way. Change your shoes and clothing and wash your hands and other exposed skin whenever you leave the safe room, to prevent transferring disease to other animals.


Cats can transmit diseases to humans as well. If the cat bites you, wash the wound with soap and water and ask your doctor immediately about the risk of rabies, which is fatal without a prompt vaccine. If the cat scratches you, wash with soap and water and visit the doctor if the area becomes red or swollen, or if you get swollen lymph nodes, a headache, fever, or exhaustion., Once it has calmed down a bit, enter the room quietly, bringing food and a camera. Try to get a good look at the cat, and ideally a good photo, so you can immediately begin to search for an owner.


Aggression is not likely, but leave immediately if you notice these warning signs: flat ears; visible eye whites or extra-wide pupils; a crouched, tensed appearance; or slow movement toward you with the head down.
Hissing and low growling with no other warning signs means the cat is afraid.Don't approach, but don't be scared of an attack either.

, Start searching for the cat's owners as soon as possible. If the cat doesn't have tags, try these methods:


Tell your neighbors.
Have a vet scan for a microchip ID.
Call local shelters and ask if anyone has called in a lost cat matching this one's description.
Put up flyers with the word FOUND in large font over a photo of the cat's face.
Check the Lost section of local newspapers. You may be able to place a Found ad for free.
Avoid sharing identifying details beyond the cat's color or pictures of the face.

, If someone calls you in response to your efforts, quiz them on the cat's sex or markings to confirm the owner's identity. If the cat has no telltale identifying markers, ask for a vaccination or medical record that includes a description of the cat, or for the contact details of the veterinarian. Although unlikely, there is a chance that an unethical caller will pretend to be the owner so they can sell the cat or adopt it for free.


If the cat has not been vaccinated or neutered/spayed (and escaped at an age when it should have been), consider notifying a shelter about the situation. The shelter may be willing to accept the cat and require the owners to have these medical procedures done before returning the animal.

, Always bring the food in personally and, if the cat will allow, sit in the room while the cat eats. Food is your best tool to earn trust. Allow it to eat alone if it will not eat in your presence, but be sure it sees that you provide the food.


A predictable routine will allow the cat to anticipate your visits, making your entry much less frightening and helping associate you with food.
Sit in your chair and read quietly for a few minutes, at least a few times a day. Try to be as non-threatening as possible: move slowly, stay as 'small' as you can by hunching over, do not make eye contact, close your eyes and pretend to sleep, and speak quietly or not at all.

, It may take two or three weeks of several brief, daily interactions before the cat acts calm and eats well around you. Once you're at this point, slowly extend your hand to place an extra-tasty treat near the cat. Get the treat as close to the cat as you can before it cringes, growls, or otherwise acts threatened. Do not throw the treat or extend your fingers. Repeat, bringing your hand closer as the cat allows. Eventually, you may be able to bring your hand near enough that the cat will smell it. Allow this, then retract your hand. If the cat approaches, try slowly petting the shoulder blades, or whichever area the cat rubs against you. Go slowly, as the cat may have a sensitive injury.



Pay attention to the cat's body language. Most strays will allow you to touch them once they've calmed down, and virtually all will give a warning signal if they are uncomfortable. (You may be able to ignore a brief hiss as long as it doesn't continue or escalate into a growl.)
There is a significant risk of injury if the cat is actually feral. If the cat has no collar and it has not meowed or approached you, check for signs of a feral.

, If you have made a reasonable effort to find the owner (required by law in some areas), and no one has responded after a month, you could adopt the cat or give it to a shelter. If you decide to let the cat join your household permanently, follow these steps:


Have a veterinarian perform a physical check up, test for feline leukemia, FIV, feline distemper, rabies, and worms, and vaccinate or treat as needed. Do not allow the cat to contact other pets in your house until this is done, not even by touching the same clothing.If the cat is not fixed, have it spayed or neutered to improve its health and behavior. Look for low-cost spay/neuter clinics if the cost is a burden.
Gradually introduce the cat to the rest of the house and its members, one room or animal at a time.

Confirm the cat is feral.,
Have the cat fixed.,
Keep the cat overnight.,
Release the cat.,
Assist the feral cat.,
Tame the feral cat.",How to Handle a Stray Cat3," Feral cats were never pets, and have not learned to meow or make eye contact with humans. Their coats are usually clean and well-kept compared to strays', since feral cats are used to taking care of themselves. Also look for these tell-tale signs:


Feral cats found alone are often unneutered males (tomcats). These have a more muscular, stockier build and fuller cheeks than neutered pets.Some tomcats have a spiky coat and a greasy or hairless area at the base of the tail (""stud tail"").One clipped ear tip is the international sign of a spayed or neutered feral.Female ferals often live in small colonies around dumpsters or other food sources. When found alone, they can be difficult to tell apart from strays. A pregnant or lactating cat (with enlarged nipples and breasts) is usually feral., If the cat does not have a clipped ear, take it to the vet to be spayed or neutered. Always fix the cat before release so it displays fewer obnoxious behaviors (such as spraying or howling) and does not increase the feral cat population. If the shelter or vet clinic is part of a trap-neuter-release (TNR) program, it might perform the surgery for free. Bring the cat to the clinic promptly so the cat is not confined to the trap for more than 12 hours.If you decide to become more involved in a TNR program, invest in a transfer cage. This is a trap and cage with doorways that hook together, so the cat can walk into the larger space without escaping.You can also learn to tell whether the cat is fixed directly: follow these guides for female and male cats. Since this often requires handling the cat, it is not recommended until you have experience under trained supervision.

, Cats usually need 24 hours to recover from the surgery, but some females take 48. Keep the trap or cage covered and move it to a temperature-controlled room, since cats recovering from anesthesia cannot regulate body temperature. Keep the room as quiet as possible and do not allow any other people or pets to enter. Monitor the cat closely:Feed kittens shortly after they wake up, and adult cats eight hours after they wake up. To do this, open a small gap in the trap door and slide in a little food and water on a plastic lid, without putting your hand inside. If you cannot do this safely, don't do it; the cat will manage. The cat might not eat right away.Call the clinic's emergency number (or the number they asked you to call) if the cat is bleeding, has trouble breathing, vomits, or does not wake up.If the cat vomits while asleep, gently tip the trap at a slight angle so the vomit runs away from the cat's throat., An adult feral cat can almost never be socialized enough to become an indoor pet. Bring the trap back to the same location you trapped it, open it, and wait until the cat walks out on its own.Disinfect and rinse the trap thoroughly before using it for another animal.
If you do not want the cat living in your neighborhood, take it to a shelter. Cats rarely do well when released in a new location, but shelter staff should know how to increase the chance of success., If you would like to help the cat, you can leave out food and water near the location where you trapped it. Feral cats are especially vulnerable in cold climates, and may benefit from a shelter and a source of liquid water (a heated water bowl) in winter.

, If the cat shows some friendliness toward humans, or is no more than four months old, it may be possible to adopt it as a semi-tamed pet.The first step is to take it to a veterinarian for deworming and vaccinations. After that, a slow introduction to your household, one room at a time, may succeed in socializing the animal. Keep in mind that this is very difficult for fully feral, adult cats, and you may need to release the cat if it doesn't work out.

Use a trap.,
Be compassionate.,
Take a break.,
Lure the kitten into a confined space.,
Earn the kitten's trust.",How to Catch a Stray Kitten2," Whether you are making a homemade trap or purchasing one, make sure that you are using one that is humane. You don't want to risk injuring the kitten that you are working so hard to rescue. (You also want to make sure not to injure yourself--no one wants to get their finger caught in a trap). One of the best ways to safely trap a kitten is to use food to bait the kitten into the trap.Canned fish is an effective and inexpensive food item that you could try.A humane trap is one that will not injure or kill the kitten. If you are going to purchase a trap, ask a local vet for suggestions on which brand to buy. Try shopping at your local pet store or hardware store.
If you plan to make a trap, make sure you research ones that will neither harm nor kill the kitten. Use a trap door that will close gently but quickly and firmly after the kitten enters the trap. Ask for tips about materials at your neighborhood hardware store.
Don't try to trap the kitten the first time you stop him. Instead, prepare your trap, and spend a few days placing food in there--while leaving the door of the cage open. That way, the kitten will begin to head into the trap willingly after he begins to associate it with food.

, Above all, you want to be as kind as possible to the kitten. Remember, he doesn't have much experience with humans. Being caught is going to be a pretty traumatic experience. Be as quiet, calm, and gentle when you are near the kitten., Catching a kitten can be a frustrating experience. You will need to be patient, not only with the kitten but with yourself. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to carry out your plan. Remember, it's best to learn some information about the kitten (age, status of the mom) so that alone is going to take some time. After doing that, try taking a break before you start the actual trapping process. The more relaxed and confident you are, the more smoothly the whole process will go., If you are nervous about using a trap, don't worry, you have some other options. You can try gently ""herding"" a kitten into a confined space. Use the same method you would use if you were trying to tempt the kitten into a trap--food. Once you have the kitten corralled in a confined space (think a corner where he doesn't have an easy escape route), you can gently guide the kitten into a small pet carrier.


Make sure to have a carrier (or even a box with a lid) handy before you try this method. , It is possible that you won't have to lure or trap the kitten. If you can invest enough time and patience in the process, you might be able to befriend the animal enough that you can easily transport him home with you. In order to gain the kitten's trust, be a reliable force in his life. Feed him regularly, and at the same time for several days. Be calm and gentle in his presence. After enough time has passed (this could be days or weeks), the kitten might gradually come to accept your presence without fear."

Handle the kitten carefully.,
Try containment.,
Seek medical care.,
Find an adoptive home.,
Keep the kitten.",How to Catch a Stray Kitten3," Catching the kitten is not the end of your project. Once you have him, make sure you are prepared to handle him carefully.When dealing with the kitten, you'll want to keep a pair of gloves handy. Do not handle the kitten directly until you have had him checked out by the vet.


Kittens are cute and can become cuddly, but this one is still a wild animal. If one escapes from his carrier (or box,etc) you can try gently scooping him up with a towel., The containment process is crucial when introducing a kitten to a new environment. To keep him from becoming even more traumatized, you want to introduce new things (and people, sounds, and other animals) very slowly. When you first rescue the kitten, make sure you have a safe small place to bring him. This could be a small room, such as your bathroom, or even a comfortable box where he won't be disturbed.


Make sure your kitten is comfortable in confinement. Provide him with the basics--a towel to sleep on, food, water, and somewhere to go to the bathroom (this can be newspaper or a small litter box).

, You will definitely want to take the stray kitten to a vet in your area. Ask the vet to perform all necessary tests and vaccinations. This could get expensive, so make sure you are prepared for that. Also, remember this is very scary for the kitten, so be ready to transport him to and from the vet as carefully (and quietly) as possible.


You'll want to specifically make sure the vet to check for basic ailments such as worms, distemper, rabies, and respiratory problems. Also, it's a great idea to talk to the vet about having the kitten spayed or neutered., The kitten is probably adorable, but you may either not want to keep him, or not be able to properly care for him. The next best thing is to find him an adoptive home. If you have some time to devote to this (and want visitation rights), try checking with your friends and friends of friends. Post pictures on social media--kittens can be hard to resist!If you can't find a home on your own, contact your local animal shelter. They will be able to help you figure out a safe place for the kitten., Maybe you just can't resist that sweet little face, and you've decided that the best home for the kitten is your home. That's great! Just make sure that you are prepared to be the best pet parent possible. In addition to getting all of the necessities (litter box, food, toys, any medications), you want to also be emotionally prepared.


Remember that this is a big adjustment for a stray kitten, and it will take some time to adjust. Seek advice from the vet and the local shelter on how to properly bond with the kitten. Hopefully, in time, you'll have a new best friend! "

Provide food dishes.,
Get rid of hazardous materials.,
Purchase cat toys.,
Get a collar and identification tag.,
Choose a healthy food.,
Provide water.,
Cuddle your cat.,
Get your cat vaccinated.,
Spay or neuter your Ragamuffin.,
Schedule annual vet visits.",How to Take Care of a Ragamuffin Cat," Your Ragamuffin cat will need access to food and water. You should purchase two ceramic or metal food dishes – one for food and one for water. For the food, you can purchase a regular bowl, or a more complex food dispenser that allows your cat to self-feed. However, keep in mind that Ragamuffin cats are a bit prone to fat bellies, so you may need to quit allowing your cat to self-feed if the cat becomes too overweight.Make sure you clean the food and water dishes regularly so that you Ragamuffin cat has a healthy place to eat and drink.;
, Due to the Ragamuffin’s inquisitive nature, you’ll want to make sure there is nothing harmful lying around your house that could hurt your cat. This means that you should keep all cleaning supplies and pesticides in a place that is locked away or totally inaccessible to the cat.Try keeping these materials in the garage or in a separate closet that has a door you can keep closed at all times.

, Ragamuffin cats are playful, but have a fairly calm temperament. This means that they are happy to play and be played with, while also being fairly easily trainable. Try purchasing some cat toys that you can teach your Ragamuffin to play fetch with. This will help your cat get exercise while they are also spending time with you.You can also try purchasing some balls to play with, some feather toys, or anything with catnip in it.
Chasing a laser pointer can be another great way for your cat to get exercise.
Avoid toys made of potentially harmful or ingestible materials like rubber bands, ribbons, or pieces of plastic (like plastic eyes on a toy).
Ragamuffin cats are also great with kids and other pets. If you have young children, they will probably end up carrying your Ragamuffin around and enjoying hours of fun playtime together.

, To ensure that your beloved Ragamuffin cat doesn’t get lost, you should purchase a collar and an ID tag for your cat. You can even get a leash to add an extra level of safety if you ever need to take your cat outside.Only purchase cat-safe, breakaway collars. Cats can become caught and strangled while wearing a regular collar.
On the ID tag, you should include your cat’s name and your phone number. You can also list your home address if you wish.
Because a collar can become lost or removed, consider having your cat microchipped.
You should also try to keep your Ragamuffin as an indoor-only cat to prevent your cat from getting lost or stolen while it’s outside your home.

, Ragamuffin cats are often naturally prone to weight problems, so it is usually better to choose a healthy wet food that you can easily regulate for your cat rather than allowing it to self-feed. Choose a wet food that contains natural ingredients and lists a meat item as the first main ingredient. Anything with a “byproduct” or “meal” first ingredient won’t give your Ragamuffin cat the healthy nutrients it needs.A wet cat food will also provide another source of hydration for your cat.
If you prefer to feed your cat dry food, you should look up the calorie content and measure meals so that you only feed the amount that your cat needs. If you are unsure how much to feed your cat, consult your veterinarian.

, Your Ragamuffin cat needs to stay hydrated, so make sure you provide it with constant access to fresh drinking water. Try to leave the water near your Ragamuffin’s food so that it is easy for your cat to locate.Consider making several sources of water available in case your cat spills one of them. This is especially important when you are going to be away from the house for several hours at a time.

, Ragamuffin cats are especially cuddly. They will often turn into limp dolls on your lap, hence the name. Be sure to spend lots of quality time cuddling with your Ragamuffin cat so that it feels loved and cared for.Let your cat sit on your lap and take naps next to you. This will help strengthen the bond between the two of you.

, Ragamuffin cats, as with all other cat breeds, need to be vaccinated as kittens to protect them from getting potentially harmful diseases. Your veterinarian will vaccinate your Ragamuffin kitten for you starting at around six weeks and then every three to four weeks until your kitten is 16 to 20 weeks old.If your Ragamuffin is an adult cat, you will need to get it vaccinated annually at the cat’s yearly vet checkup.

, Ragamuffin cats actually don’t reach sexual maturity until around four years of age, but they should still be spayed or neutered in the first year of their life. Consult with your veterinarian about when the right time will be to spay or neuter your Ragamuffin cat.De-sexing cats helps control cat populations, prevents unwanted kittens that may be hard to take care of or place in appropriate homes, and helps you take better care of your existing cat.

, Just like any other cat, your Ragamuffin kitty will need to get regular veterinarian checkups every year. These visits help make sure your cat is healthy and happy. It will also help ensure that your cat lives a long life by giving the vet an opportunity to catch any problems that may be developing over time.


You should also consider asking your vet to clean your cat’s teeth during their annual vet visit since Ragamuffin cats can sometimes be prone to periodontal disease.Ask your vet if your Ragamuffin cat is at an appropriate and healthy weight. Ask your vet if your cat seems to be getting enough exercise. Ask if your Ragamuffin seems to need additional dental care to prevent periodontal disease.

Instruct your cat to stay off of you.,
Reward your cat.,
Use negative reinforcement.",How to Stop Your Cat from Walking on You1," When you notice your cat starting to approach you or try to climb on you, say “no” and make eye contact with your cat. This will signal to your cat that it needs to stop what it is doing.You can also try stomping your foot on the floor or tapping your hand in front of your cat as a warning.;
, Once your cat hesitates or stops moving towards you, say “Good” and toss your cat a treat. This will show your cat that it will get a reward for not walking on you. Keep the treats in your pocket and toss your cat one only when it hesitates and listens to your instruction to stay off of you.Try to throw the treat away from you, towards your cat. This will encourage your cat to stay further away from you.

, If your cat does not listen to you when you say “no” or stomp your foot, you can use negative reinforcement. Try holding a feather wand and waving it at your cat to keep it away from you. If your cat stays away from you, reward it with a treat.Another way you can do negative reinforcement is to use a squirt gun to keep your cat from walking on you. Squirt your cat with water using the squirt gun when it approaches you or starts to try to walk on you. This will often deter your cat from repeating the action.

Leave out a bowl of dry cat food.,
Move toward the cat slowly and quietly.,
Allow the cat to come to you.,
Lure the cat into your car or into a container.,
Try to find the cat’s owner.",How to Approach a Stray Cat1," You will need to start by gaining the cat’s trust, as this will make approaching the cat much easier. You can gain the stray cat’s trust by leaving out a bowl of dry cat food where they can see it. The stray cat is likely hungry and will be more inclined to approach your area if you present it with food.Place the dry cat food in a bowl close to the cat or in the area where the cat is hanging out. You may also leave out a bowl of fresh water for the cat to drink. Then, step away and wait quietly for the cat to approach and eat from the bowl. Let the cat continue eating and drinking without approaching it.
If you are not worried about approaching the stray cat right away, you may continue to leave food and water out for the cat every day until the cat seems comfortable staying in the same area.;
, Do this while the cat is eating from the food bowl. Talk quietly to the cat as you move towards it slowly. You may say, “Good kitty” under your breath or simply, “Hi there, kitty.” Talking to the cat in low tones will show it you are non-threatening and friendly.If the cat appears spooked by your presence, take a few steps back and wait. Once the cat appears less freaked out by you, you should take a few steps forward and continue talking quietly. Over time, the cat should realize you are not a threat and be more comfortable with your presence.

, Do not try to force the cat to come to you or attempt to grab the cat as this will just scare it more. Instead, allow the cat to approach you. Squat down a few feet away from it and continue to speak softly to it. The cat should come to you and rub your leg or sit near you but just out of reach. These are signs it does not view you as a threat.Avoid trying to reach out and pet the cat or stroke the cat. This may spook it and cause it to run away. Be patient and allow the cat to approach you.

, If you have confirmed the cat is a stray and it appears okay with you approaching it or it approaches you, you may be able to lure it to a safe place. You should try to lure the animal into your car by placing food on the seat and leaving the door open. If the cat does go into your car, you should close the door and go get help.You can also try luring the cat into a container, such as a cardboard box or a plastic bin. You can leave food in the box or bin and see if the cat will enter it willingly. Once the cat is in the box or bin, you can then call for help.

, If you are able to transport the cat in your car, you should take it to the nearest animal shelter. The shelter may then be able to help you find the cat’s owner, if it has one. You should also check the cat for any identification, such as a collar or a tag. You may be able to find the owner through the information on the cat’s collar.You should make sure the shelter scans the cat for a microchip. If the cat has a microchip, scanning it will make it easier to identify the cat’s owner.
You can help the shelter find the cat’s owner by posting a “found” ad in your local newspaper or online. You can also put up “found cat” posters in your neighborhood with an image of the cat.
You may decide to keep the cat if the owner is not found through the shelter. If so, you should notify animal control that you have the cat and then take the cat to the vet for a check up. The vet will confirm the cat does not have any diseases or illnesses.

Keep your cat out of your area.,
Allow your cat to walk in other areas of your home.,
Create an area for your cat next to your work area.",How to Stop Your Cat from Walking on You2," To discourage your cat from walking on you, keep your cat out of your area. Do this by shutting the door to your bedroom when you are lying down or by keeping the door closed when you are sitting in a room. Though your cat may whine or scratch the door at first, over time it should relent and learn to leave you alone when the door is closed.When you shut the door on your cat, make sure your cat has access to other areas of your home. This will ensure it still have the space it needs to walk and lounge around comfortably.

, Encourage your cat to walk around and roam in other areas of your home so it does not walk on you. Create high resting places for your cat in your home. Set up a play area for your cat with a scratching and climbing post. Give your cat enough space in your home to run, walk, and explore.You may also designate certain areas in your home as “cat friendly,” such as your living room or a spare room. Other areas in your home may be off limits to your cat, such as your bedroom or your office. Maintaining this separation can help keep your cat from walking on you.

, If your cat tends to walk on you when you are in your work area, set up a special area for your cat nearby. Put its bed on the floor by your desk or in the corner of the room. Have your cat’s toys in an area by your workspace so it can hang out close to you.You can then use obedience training to keep your cat out of your workspace and limit it to staying in a designated area close by.

"
"
Have a play session with your cat.,
Groom your cat.,
Feed your cat.",How to Stop Your Cat from Walking on You3," Some cats will walk on you because they are feeling bored and understimulated. If your cat tends to walk on you at night in bed, schedule a play session with your cat for right before bed. Play with your cat using its toys. This way, your cat will be tired out by the time you lie down and curl up in its bed, leaving you alone.You should have regular play sessions with your cat at least once a day to ensure it gets the stimulation and attention it needs. Doing this can wear out your cat and discourage it from walking on you to get attention.

, Another way you can distract your cat is to have a good grooming session with it. Brush your cat with a soft bristle brush. Massage your cat with your fingers. Pet your cat at the end of the grooming session so it gets the love and attention it needs. Often, your cat will feel satisfied enough after a grooming session to leave you alone.You may schedule grooming sessions with your cat right before you go to bed. This way, your cat will get the attention and stimulation it needs, leaving you to sleep in peace without getting walked on during the night.

, Sometimes cats walk on their owners at night because they are hungry. If your cat walks on you at night when you are lying in bed, try feeding your cat later in the evening. Allow your cat to eat the last of its food later in the evening from an automatic feeder or feed your cat right before you go to bed. This will ensure it does not get hungry at night and wake you up by walking on you.You may notice that your cat walks on you during the day if it is hungry or if it’s time for its meal. You can avoid this by feeding your cat at set mealtimes so it is not hungry or antsy between meals.

Watch for signs of aggression.,
Wear gloves and long sleeves.,
Let the cat approach you.,
Call animal control if the cat is too aggressive.",How to Approach a Stray Cat2," The stray cat may appear frightened and scared by you, especially if is it not used to other people or to being outside. A frightened cat may hiss, growl, or spit at you. These are normal signs of fear and the cat may just be reacting to being lost, away from its owner, or outdoors. An aggressive cat may howl at you and its eyes may be dilated, with its fur on end and its head cocked back.If the cat starts to act aggressive, it may be feral. Feral cats are cats that have always lived outdoors and have not been socialized to people. They usually cannot be adopted and may end up in a kill shelter if they are caught. You may try to approach the feral cat anyway to ensure it is not sick or in danger, but do so with caution.If the cat allows you to approach it or if it approaches you, it is likely not feral. A stray cat will be okay with rubbing your leg or being close to you. A feral cat will likely not approach you at all and may hide or run away at the sight of you.
Stray cats also tend to walk like house cats, with their tail up. Feral cats may stay low to the ground, crouching or crawling, and protect their body with their tail. Feral cats also will not make eye contact with you and will not purr, beg, or blink at you.

, You should approach a frightened or feral cat with caution and protect yourself against getting scratched or injured by the cat. Wear rubber gloves and a long sleeved shirt so your skin is not exposed.You should also have a towel or blanket ready to throw over the cat. Putting a towel or blanket over the cat can make it easier to put up the cat and transport it without getting scratched or attacked.

, Though the cat may appear frightened or scared, it may eventually approach you if you place a bowl of dry food and water in its area. You should leave the food and water out so the cat can eat and drink. Stay a few feet away from the cat so it does not feel threatened by you. You may then be able to move closer to the cat or get it to approach you by talking quietly to it.


You may say, “Here, kitty” or “Hello there.” With enough coaxing, the cat may come to you.
If the cat is feral or acting aggressive, it may not approach you. You can try throwing the blanket or towel over the cat. Then, lift it by the nape of its neck and try to put it in a box or in a container.

, If the cat appears too aggressive, you may want to contact animal control so they can remove it safely and efficiently. Give animal control your contact number and ask them how long it will take for someone to get to the scene. Try to stay in the area until animal control arrives to make sure the cat is picked up safely.If you are not able to stay on the scene, you should describe where the cat is located by giving animal control a description of any road names, landmarks, or mile markers in the area. This will make it easier for animal control to locate the stray cat when they arrive.

Purchase the right size aquarium.,
Include aquatic mosses in your shrimp’s aquarium.,
Provide plenty of hiding places in the aquarium.,
Limit the strength of the water current in the aquarium.,
Get the right filter for your crystal red shrimp.,
Cycle the aquarium to get the best water quality.",How to Keep Crystal Red Shrimp1," A small aquarium, between 3-10 gallons, is suitable for raising crystal red shrimp. It’s better to get a smaller tank, so you can handle them better and keep track of their whereabouts more easily.A smaller aquarium is better for smaller numbers of shrimp. In case your crystal red shrimp get sick or go missing, a smaller aquarium makes it easier to care for them individually or to count the shrimp from outside the aquarium.
You should get a larger tank if you plan to have a shrimp colony. This will make it harder to manage the shrimp individually, but will give them enough room to spread out.;
, Moss is great to include in your crystal red shrimp’s aquarium since it contains microorganism that they eat. Additionally, these shrimp do better in a planted aquarium where there is plenty of vegetation for them.For the most part, crystal red shrimp won’t eat healthy plants. They snack on mosses, but usually only eat debris, since plants are sometimes too firmly rooted for them to eat.Planted vegetation gives them places to hide as well. However, if your shrimp are hiding often and not swimming in the open water, this may be a sign that they are unhealthy and need to be cared for.

, Crystal red shrimp don’t like being exposed in the open water, since it may make them feel unsafe. You can provide a number of hiding spots, including driftwood, stones, and other shrimp products.Rocks and stones can create a natural environment for your shrimp. They can also grow algae to help feed your shrimp. Some stones you can include are the Ohko, ryuoh, seiryu, yamaya, and manten stone.
Driftwood is another especially good hiding place for shrimp, since it can also grow fungus for your shrimp to eat. Additionally, driftwood lowers the PH level of your water, which is necessary for your sensitive crystal red shrimp.
Cholla wood and ceramic shrimp tubes can also be useful hiding places for shrimp. When they become anxious due to outside predators, these environments give them a safe place to hide.

, Crystal red shrimp can easily become swept up in the current of your aquarium. This can be especially dangerous, since they can become sucked up into the filter.The water current in your tank should provide circulation, but not sweep up your crystal red shrimp. If you notice them floating along on the current, it’s likely your water current is too strong for them.
Avoiding things like flow accelerators is probably a good idea when keeping crystal red shrimp. For the most part, the natural flow of the water should be enough for your shrimp., Filters can be potentially dangerous for these shrimp due to their small size. Choose a filter that will not suck your shrimp into the intakes and potentially kill them.Sponge filters are the best filters for most shrimp, especially crystal red shrimp. It will not suck them into the intakes and is relatively inexpensive.
If you choose a more conventional filter make sure to cover the filter intake with a sponge or stocking. This will help to prevent the baby shrimp from being sucked up and killed.

, This is essential for keeping crystal red shrimp because any amount of ammonia or nitrite will kill them. They need to have nearly perfect water to stay healthy in your aquarium.


Before you begin cycling, check your tap water parameters. Crystal Red Shrimp prefer a pH between 6.2 and 7.2 and a tank temperature of around 70-78 degrees Fahrenheit.Ammonium and nitrate levels should be as close to 0 as possible before putting in your crystal red shrimp. Additionally, you should only change less than 1/3 of your total water each week, since they are very sensitive to changes in the water.

Bites and scratches may hurt even if they don’t break the skin.;
, Start by closing the doors to empty rooms so that your cat has fewer options for escape. It’s best to be as calm as possible as you close the doors so that the cat doesn’t pick up on what you are doing.Try to corral your cat into a room with less furniture or items that are easy to move.
If your cat is currently calm but will become upset as you try to administer its medicine, see if the cat will let you pick it up and carry it into a small room with few places to hide. You can shut the door and use that room as a secured location.
This method should only be used with cats that know you and are uninjured., Put smaller items like chairs and side tables out in the hall or in a closet. Close the closet door, and block off the space leading under larger furniture to the best of your ability.You may not be able to block off a bed, but you should be able to prevent your cat from getting under dressers, nightstands, or entertainment centers.

, Your towel should be long enough to fully encase the cat but not so long that you may fumble with it as you try to wrap it around the cat. A large bath towel is a great option. Using a heavier towel will help you control the cat better because it weighs the cat down when you put the towel over it, plus the towel’s thickness will prevent scratching.

, Before you try to catch it, sit near your cat and speak in a calm voice to show your cat that you aren’t a threat. Try to minimize the stress in the situation, which should help calm your kitty., Once your cat calms down or walks into an open position, cover it with the blanket and scoop it into your arms. Move quickly because cats have fast reflexes and can easily out-maneuver a slow human., Make a cat burrito by sliding one end of your towel or blanket under the cat and then securing with the other end. Your cat will likely squirm and cry, but don’t let it go. This is a normal reaction, and letting go will only make it harder for you to capture your cat a second time., The cat will calm down more quickly if it’s pressed against the warmth of your body, plus you will be able to maintain a better grasp as it tries to wiggle free.

, Your cat needs to be able to breathe, and keeping it’s head free will also lower its anxiety.


If you need to give it medicine, you will need access to its mouth and throat. Put the medicine in the cat’s mouth, hold the mouth shut, and rub the cat’s throat to help the medicine go down.

, If you get your hands on the cat, it’s better to hold on even if the cat has the upper hand. If it gets away, catching it again will be nearly impossible because it knows what you’re trying to do.Release the cat from the blanket as soon as possible.

, If you are trying to catch the cat so that you can give it an oral medication, you might try hiding the pill in food, such as a cat of tuna. If this does not work, contact your vet. Let them know how difficult it is to give the medicine to your cat. Depending on your cat's prescription, they may be able to inject the medication at their office or give you a topical gel.

Tell the cat your intentions.,
Use good form when picking up the cat.,
Spread your hand under the cat's chest.,
Press the cat against your chest.,
Rotate the cat.,
Carry the cat.,
Put the cat down.,
Know what not to do.",How to Carry a Cat1," Never surprise the cat or make a grab for him.The cat is far more likely to be relaxed in your arms if you speak to him nicely beforehand and tell him your intentions in a soothing, soft voice. The American Humane Society recommends approaching cats from their left or right sides since they are less likely to feel threatened then if you approached them directly head-on.Cats are astute judges of character and once he realizes you don't mean to harm him, he will be much more likely to co-operate.;
, Even though the friendly cat is very affable and will likely just be happy that he's being picked up, you should still try to use good form when picking up this type of cat to ensure his safety.


One of the best ways to hold a cat is head up, legs down and with his body parallel to your chest and pressed against it. In this position the cat feels well-supported and is not in danger of falling, which means he's less likely to struggle.

, Carefully lift the cat so that he is standing on his hind legs. Wrap one arm around your cat, supporting his front legs, and continue to carefully lift him.As soon as the cat's hind legs leave the ground, slide your free arm underneath the cat so that his hind legs and body weight are supported. This will make the cat feel safer.
Make sure the cat's hind legs are supported at all times and lift your cat evenly on both ends to ensure safety.

, This will make him feel supported and vulnerable. It also ensures less risk of the cat falling out of your arms. Your grip should be loose but still able to feel any tension from the cat., Use your bottom arm to rotate the cat so that he is facing you with his front paws on your shoulder. This makes it easier to hold the cat securely without hurting him. You could also rotate the cat and then place him into the cradle of your arms with his feet up in the air like a baby.However you elect to hold the compliant, cuddly cat, make sure to always support all of the cat's weight and never her hold her just by the legs. Again, the combination of his body weight and a sudden movement is a recipe for a broken leg.

, You should really only carry a cat around if you are in a safe environment, such as at home, in a carpeted room. If you are in a vet's office or anywhere else where there may be obstacles or obstructions in the way, you should avoid walking around with your cat in your arms. The difference in environment might heighten his defences and he may be more likely to accidentally scratch you or jump out of your arms if he is scared, thus potentially hurting both you and himself.Ideally, if you want some one-on-one time with the cat, grab hold of him and then sit down. Let him cuddle across your chest or in your lap.In this way, he will be closer to the ground, which reduces the risk of falling or other injury if he suddenly decides cuddle time is over and he leaps off of you. If you're sitting, there's also less chance of you tripping or falling and thus dropping the cat. Everyone wins.
Note that some cats are sensitive not only in how they carried but also where they are carried. A cat is more likely to panic, for example, if he is carried on stairs, where his escape route is a very long (and dangerous) way down. Since it's not safe to carry cats on stairs anyway, due to the potential of falling, it's best that you stick a cozy and comfortable space that the cat enjoys., Put your cat him down safely by putting his front paws on the ground and supporting his hind end as he steps out of your arms. If the cat ever struggles in your arms, don't fight to keep him there. Instead, try to get low to the ground and let him hop out safely., In general, the friendly cat is no problem; he will purr not matter what you do or how you pick him up, and he will just be happy to have the attention. However, you must remember to hold and carry the cat gently, even if he is squishy and friendly. Cats have fragile bones and they can easily be injured if you are rough with them. If the cat shows signs of pain, stop carrying him immediately.


Never let the cat's hind legs dangle. Cats find this uncomfortable and may start to squirm if their bottom end is left unsupported.
Don't pick a cat up by his legs or tail.

10 gallon tank
Sponge filter (that comes with a tube, a sponge, and a hookup for the air pump)
Air pump
Tank heater and thermometer
A package of brine shrimp cysts (eggs)
Aquarium salt mix (setting up a brand new aquarium means you will need about 13 pounds of salt per 50 gallons)
1 gallon container with a lid
10 gallons reverse osmosis water
Refractometer or hydrometer for measuring salinity
Gravel vacuum
Flashlight;
, The tank should also be set up near electrical outlets because you will need to plug in the heater and air pump.


Leave room between the tank and the wall so the air pump will easily fit.
The surface should also be level.

, Dry the outside of the tank once you are done, and then place the tank where it belongs in your home.

, Make a saltwater mixture with aquarium salt and reverse osmosis filtered water.Fill the 10 gallon tank with 9 gallons of water so there is room for the salt. Then, add the salt per manufacturer’s instructions.The salt container will have specific instructions for calculating the amount of salt necessary for your tank.
Don’t worry if you add too much or too little salt; you can adjust the levels before adding the brine shrimp cysts.

, The salinity of the tank should always be 30-35 ppt (parts per thousand).Use the instructions for your refractometer or hydrometer to measure the salinity of the tank, and add more salt or more reverse osmosis water accordingly.


Operating the refractometer or hydrometer involves placing some of the water inside via a dropper or other apparatus.
Test the water until you reach the correct salinity.
If you’ve mixed the saltwater correctly according to the manufacturer’s instructions, you will not have to tinker with the mixture.

, This is the best filter to use in the tank because it will provide aeration, filter the tank water, and won’t suck up the tiny brine shrimp.The filter should include a tube, a sponge, and a hookup for the air pump; if it does not include the hookup for the pump, buy this separately.


You can place the sponge filter on the bottom of the tank or mount it to the side of the tank, depending on the model you purchased.
There are many cheap filters on the market nowadays, but do not scrimp on filtering equipment.
Faulty filters may cause the brine shrimp to die., Using airline tubing, attach the end of the sponge filter to the end of the air pump.Plug the pump in, and the filter will begin working. Keep the filter on a sturdy surface behind or below the tank.

, Set up the heater according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once you plug it in, you can begin to control the temperature of the tank.

, Place the thermometer on the opposite end of the heater so it is easily visible.Once both the heater and thermometer are installed, you can adjust the heater so the tank is always at the correct temperature: 68°F (20°C)-79°F (25°C). Turn it up or down accordingly.

, Once the tank has maintained this temperature for 24 hours, it is stable enough to hold the brine shrimp. Check the temperature at least twice a day—if the heater is accidentally unplugged or the temperature drastically changes for any reason, your brine shrimp could die.

, Packets of dehydrated brine shrimp cysts are sold at aquarium and pet stores.Beginning with one packet is fine, since the brine shrimp will multiply rapidly.

, 12 hours after that, you will have young shrimp swimming around in the tank.

, Brine shrimp will multiply quickly. They will begin as tiny cysts and end up as small shrimp. You do not need to aid them in hatching or growing, since they will do so naturally in a well-maintained tank.


If your brine shrimp are not growing or hatching, check the salinity and temperature of the tank for problems.
It is natural for some of the brine shrimp to die.

, Always having a gallon of saltwater ready will make changing the water much easier.


Fill a gallon container with reverse osmosis water.
Add the salt per manufacturer’s instructions.Cap the container, and store the saltwater in a cool, dry area until you need it.

, Let the air in the tank settle so it is not moving. Shine a bright light at the surface of the tank so the brine shrimp all flock to it.



Siphon the dirty water off the bottom of the tank with the gravel vaccum.
Then, replace the siphoned water with some of the marine salt mixture you made earlier.
Check the salinity and temperature of the tank to make sure the levels are good.

, To rinse or replace the filter, turn off the air pump, remove the sponge, and rinse it. When it is clean again, replace it, and turn the air pump back on. About once every year, you will need to get a brand new sponge.


Use a flashlight to herd the brine shrimp away from the sponge filter when doing this.
You may need someone to help you grab the filter or shine the light.

, All of these factors are important to keep in mind when you are maintaining a saltwater habitat. Get into the habit of checking these factors weekly.

, Selcon is a popular brand, and there are many others available at most aquarium stores. Ask an employee for help if you have trouble finding the formulas, or use an online store to buy the food in bulk.

, Brine shrimp are not picky, and they will eat these human foods. Spirulina is another option to feed the brine shrimp.

, Do not overfeed the brine shrimp! If the tank water begins to look excessively murky and dirty with food, clean the tank and feed the brine shrimp smaller amounts.

, Of course, if you are raising brine shrimp purely for pleasure, you do not have to harvest them, but after 8 days, the adults are large enough to catch with a net and feed to other fish.

, After about 10 minutes, the empty cysts shells will float to the surface, and unhatched cysts will sink to the bottom.Now, you can more easily catch the live brine shrimp.

, All of the brine shrimp will flock to the light, so they will be easy to catch with the fish net.

, Catch the amount you wish to feed to your other fish.

, Place them in the tank of the fish you want to feed. Your other fish will get to enjoy the nutritious brine shrimp.

Choose your shrimp grade.,
Choose tank inhabitants for your crystal red shrimp.,
Introduce the crystal red shrimp to your aquarium.,
Feed your crystal red shrimp shrimp food and algae wafers.,
Give your shrimp vegetables.",How to Keep Crystal Red Shrimp2," Crystal red shrimp come in 7 grades from the cheapest to most expensive: C, B, A ,S, S+, SS, and SSS. As the shrimp move up the grades, they become more delicate because of inbreeding.SSS grade is the highest grade of shrimp. For the most part, the higher grade shrimp has the most white coloration and the least red.
A grade C crystal red shrimp is probably the best shrimp for beginners, since it’s relatively inexpensive. It is characterized by transparent white and blotchy red coloration.

, For optimal breeding, crystal red shrimp should be kept in a species specific aquarium. However, they can be kept with tetras, live bearers, other peaceful community fish, and other dwarf shrimp.Since crystal red shrimp have such specific water quality demands, it may be best to keep them alone in their tank. Mixing them with other fish can risk potential future generations of shrimp.
Keep in mind that placing them in tanks with other bee shrimp will cause offspring to revert to their wild form. This is undesirable and should be avoided if you plan on keeping the tank for more than a few shrimp breeding cycles.

, Your shrimp can become shocked if introduced to the water too quickly. Transfer them from the pet store bag to a bowl before putting them in the aquarium.When you bring your crystal red shrimp home, take them from the pet store bag into a large bowl. You should use the same water from the pet store bag to maintain their aquatic environment.
Slowly introduce the aquarium water into the large bowl using a siphon. After about 30 minutes, begin to introduce your crystal red shrimp into the aquarium with a soft mesh net.
If your shrimp don't move when placed into the aquarium or only float at the surface, there is a problem with the water quality. Remove the shrimp immediately and retest your water for appropriate temperature, nitrate, and ammonia levels.

, These shrimp are not very particular about their food source. Premade shrimp food works best, since it gives them the nutrients they need. Algae wafers provide them with the algae necessary for their diet.It's important to not overfeed your shrimp. Only give them enough food to last a few hours and feed them only a few times a week. Follow the directions on the shrimp food container for the appropriate quantity of food.Sometimes, it may be a good idea to not feed your shrimp for a few days. This will allow them to cleanse their system and for you to make sure the water quality stays high., Vegetables are also a good food for red crystal shrimp, but only blanched vegetables, which are boiled vegetables doused with cold water. This will make the vegetables soft enough for the shrimp to eat.Spinach and zucchini are great vegetables for red crystal shrimp. They keep their diet healthy and will help develop their red and white stripes.
Seaweed is also a good vegetable for crystal red shrimp. It's very rich in nutrients and is easy for them to eat.

Beware of CO2 poisoning in your shrimp's aquarium.,
Check the water quality regularly.,
Breed your shrimp carefully.",How to Keep Crystal Red Shrimp3," In planted aquariums, the plants can give off CO2, which can be dangerous to your shrimp. Additionally, CO2 injection, which is necessary for planted aquariums, can sometimes harm your shrimp.During the evening, when CO2 is not absorbed by plants due to the lack of light, the PH level of the aquarium can change dramatically. Since crystal red shrimp are sensitive to the PH level, this can cause injury or even death.
A valve to inject CO2 into the aquarium only during daylight hours can useful. However, it's important to monitor this and not accidentally leave it on during the evening hours.
Monitor the CO2 level of your aquarium on a regular basis. You need to make sure the level does not become too high. Less than 30 mg/l is the safest., Nitrate and ammonia levels need to be very small in an aquarium due to the crystal red shrimp's sensitivity. Though your initial water quality may be good, keep up the quality and continually monitor your aquarium's water.Ammonia and nitrates can easily increase in an aquarium. These levels can be decreased with bacteria that will grow naturally in the aquarium and regular water changes.
Water should never be changed out all at once. Your crystal red shrimp is sensitive to changes in the water and could be easily stressed by a total change in water.

, If kept under good conditions, your shrimp will breed with an egg gestation period of around one month. Female shrimp keep the eggs in their swimmerets until they hatch.


It's important to keep the water temperature at close to 78 degrees when baby shrimp are born. They also need places to hide so they keep warm when young.
Baby shrimp will be eaten by other fish in the aquarium, especially bottom dwelling fish. Remove any larger fish when you have baby shrimp in the aquarium.

Get the cat used to the pet carrier.,
Use cat pheromones.,
Use a laser pointer.,
Make a cat burrito.,
Carry your pet carrier against your chest.",How to Capture an Angry or Upset Cat2," If you know that you will need to load your cat into a pet carrier in the near future, put the carrier out where the cat can see and explore it. Not only will the cat get used to the carrier, but it might go in on its own to check it out. Give your cat treats for going in the carrier, or leave food and treats inside for your cat to find.Once your cat starts to go inside the pet carrier, close the door for a few minutes. When you open it again, give your cat treats and pets to reward it for getting into the carrier.
When your cat starts entering the carrier on its own, carry your pet around for a few minutes to get them used to it.If you don’t have time to get your cat used to the pet carrier, set the carrier in one of your cat’s favorite spots and put fragrant food like tuna fish inside the pet carrier to make it interesting to the cat.

, You can buy pheromones that have a calming effect on cats. Spray the pheromones on your pet carrier to help lower your cat’s anxiety. You could use the pheromones while you’re getting the cat used to the carrier and on the day you need to travel with the cat., Get your cat to chase the red dot into its pet carrier. Spend a few moments playing with the cat first, allowing it to get focused on catching the dot. The cat will forget about the carrier and run right into it.This works best if your cat enjoys playing with a laser pointer.
You will have more success with a larger crate or a crate with a top opening, as it could be difficult for you to land the dot inside a small case.

, If your cat is still reluctant, then you will need to first wrap it up in a towel. Prepare your carrier by opening the door and placing it on a stable surface near your cat. Follow the instructions for using a towel or a blanket in the method above. Once your cat is wrapped like a burrito, slide the cat into the pet carrier tail first.Try to loosen the towel once the cat is in the carrier, but don’t let it escape because it will be much harder to catch a second time.
If your cat is really upset, close the door of the carrier and allow it to calm down for a moment before loosening the towel.
The cat may be able to get out of the towel without any assistance.

, You cat’s experience inside the carrier will be better if you hold the carrier against your chest than if you swing it at your side. Keeping your kitty happy while it’s in the carrier will make it easier to catch it next time.When you’re carrying the pet carrier, cover it so that your cat can’t see the world flashing by. Remove the cover while the carrier is stationary.

Never pick up a stray or feral cat.,
Approach the cat.,
Slide one hand behind each of the cat's elbows.,
Gently raise up the cat.,
Slide your non-dominant hand further under the cat's chest.,
Hug the cat to your chest.,
Carry the cat.,
Put the cat down.",How to Carry a Cat2," An unfamiliar cat means one that doesn't know you very well, just as a friend or neighbor's cat. Avoid picking up a stray street cat unless it is absolutely necessary (i.e., to get the cat out of danger or transport a sick or injured cat to the vet).


If you must pick up a stray or feral cat, be especially careful not to agitate or hurt the cat, and wear gloves if possible.

, Make sure the cat knows you are there by waking him with a gentle stroke and speaking in a soft voice. Once he's had a little stretch and is comfortable with your presence, then it's okay to pick him up.


This short introduction also allows you to assess if the cat is friendly or not. If he starts to hiss and spit, then it is best to use the scruffing method described in Method 3. But if the cat blinks lazily or even starts to purr, then follow the steps below on picking him up.

, Then, slide your hands further around the cat's chest so that you are gently gripping the cat., Raise the cat until his front legs leave the ground and the cat is standing on his back legs in semi-crouched or half-rearing position.

, Support the cat's sternum (the breastbone) with this hand, which will help provide enough support to life the cat's body weight as you lift him higher.With the newly freed dominant hand, scoop the cat's bottom up. Now the cat has all four legs off the ground.

, This will make him feel secure.You do this by folding your arms across your chest, as if you were crossing your arms, but in fact are holding a cat. Keep the cat's bottom (in the dominant hand) against your chest and slide your hand to the opposite side. Make a shallow arc with the non-dominant hand, rotating the cat in a semi-circle with the head moving from the non-dominant side to the dominant side in an arc away from your chest and arriving back near your armpit.


If you've done this correctly, the cat's head is to your dominant side and the bottom to the non-dominant side. In addition, the cat's body should be cradled between your forearms, and he is pressed against your chest. This makes the cat feel very secure, and most good-natured cats are happy to be carried like this.

, As state above, it's really only ideal to carry a cat if you are at home or in another safe environment where the risk of the cat falling and breaking a bone or, alternatively, getting frustrated and scratching you is reduced. If you must carry a cat and move around at the same time, make sure there are no obstructions in your path and maintain a firm but gentle grip on the cat. Be sure as well to move slowly and deliberately. Running with a cat may cause the cat to become fearful, which makes him more likely to struggle.


Avoid carrying the cat in your arms in spaces that make him anxious, such as in the vet's office, on the street, or on stairs or ledges.Remember that cats have delicate bones and there is a greater risk of cat injury if you move around while holding your cat, rather than staying in one spot.

, As in Method 1, place the cat back safely onto the ground by putting him down the opposite way you picked him up; ground his front paws and support his hind legs. He should step out or lightly jump out of your arms without any trouble.Remember to never fight to hold onto a cat that doesn't want to be held. You risk hurting the cat and yourself. Over time, as the cat learns to trust you, chances are that he will become more open to being held.

Use the scruffing technique.,
Use your strongest hand to scruff a cat.,
Lift the cat by the scruff.,
Support his bottom.,
Carry the cat.,
Put the cat down on the ground.",How to Carry a Cat3," An aggressive cat is likely to try to escape your arms by scratching so the above methods are not ideal for him. A safer way to carry this cat is to scruff him. Scruffing mimics how the mother cat moved her kittens around by holding them by the loose skin over their shoulders called the scruff. When held by the scruff, many cats are subdued and don't fight back. Some veterinary experts confirm that scruffing is an acceptable way to maintain control of a cat for a very short amount of time because, if done properly, it will not harm the cat. Note that scruffing is a controversial technique, so consider asking your vet to show you how to do this properly.In addition, by using the scruffing technique, we can also make sure that the cat has his teeth and claws facing away from you he is less likely to hurt you.
Note that an adult cat is too heavy to be carried by the scruff alone and that you should take some of her weight by sitting her rear end on your other hand. This will ensure that the cat doesn't feel pain when he is scruffed and that there is no strain on his spine and muscles..

, This would be your dominant hand, or the one that you use for basic activities like carrying groceries or writing. Place this hand over the cat's shoulders and grasp a handful of the loose skin in your fist.Hold the skin firmly, but not with excessive force. Apply only as much grip as you need to lift the cat up and not more or less than that.

, Hold the cat away from your body. This has the effect of pointing his legs away from you. If he tries to scratch, he is left just clawing the air.

, Use the other hand to form a scoop ""seat"" and slide it under the lowest part of his body. Some cats curl up when scruffed, so this could mean his bottom or his lower back (if he curls up).Never lift the cat by the scruff alone. Always make sure to support his lower legs and never suspend his body weight as this can be very dangerous and cause pain for the cat, particularly if he is older.

, Do not carry a cat while scruffing him; most experts suggest that this can harm the cat and put strain on his spine and muscles. While it's okay to scruff a cat to momentarily lift him or to administer medication to an unwilling cat, scruffing is always a last resort and should not be done for more than a few seconds. Thus, scruffing should not be used to casually carry a cat around., Do not scruff a cat and then let him go. Instead, place his front feet on the ground and let him gently hop out of your arms.

Maintain the water quality.",How to Make a Shrimp Aquarium," There are lots of species of shrimp to choose from when making a shrimp tank. All shrimp are more susceptible to issues with water quality than fish, but some are hardy enough for even a beginner to raise.Ghost shrimp, also called Glass Shrimp, are one of the easiest breeds of shrimp to raise. They are translucent (see through) and highly active. Ghost shrimp are also very affordable.
Cherry Shrimp are usually green and brown, but there are red varieties available for purchase. They are slightly more expensive than ghost shrimp, but require similar care.;
, There are many options to choose from for shrimp tanks. Choosing a tank that is at least ten gallons will ensure you have enough space for your shrimp to flourish.Make sure to note the size of your tank. You will need to use that figure to calculate flow rate in your choice of water filter.
A ten-gallon tank is often sufficient for even a large population of shrimp.

, You will need to determine the required flow rate for your tank. Pet stores can often help you choose the right filter for your tank. You can also use one of the many free volume calculators available online to help you choose. You will need to know the volume and dimensions of your tank to use volume calculators.
Try using the free volume calculator at http://aquariuminfo.org/volumecalculator.html to determine your filter needs.
In-tank filters like Lee's 10 Premium Undergravel Filter and the Emperor Pro Series Bio-Wheel are good options. The Fluval 406 canister filter is also good and mounts externally.

, You can also find online calculators to help you determine which water heater to purchase. It is important to choose a water heater that is rated appropriately to heat a tank the size of yours.


Pet stores can help you identify the right heater for your tank.
Generally, it's better to round up on the required wattage of your water heater.
Purchasing two equal wattage water heaters to place on either side of the tank can increase efficiency and ensure the tank remains warm if one heater fails.

, Most plant substrates come ready to be placed in your aquarium upon purchase. Gravel substrates may require multiple cleanings before they are free of dust and debris. You can buy shrimp-ready substrate at most pet stores.
Use enough substrate to fill the bottom of the aquarium to about an inch.
Try to leave the area at the front of the tank clear so shrimp will congregate in a visible area, but feel free to vary the depth of the substrate otherwise.

, If you buy water from the pet store that is made for shrimp, you may not need to treat it. Tap water will require treatment to ensure it is safe for shrimp.Test your water chlorine using a test you get from a pet store. If chlorine is present, use a commercial dechlorinator to remove all traces of it.
Nitrate and ammonia levels should be zero, or very close to it. Pet stores sell water treatment kits to help reduce nitrate and ammonia.
The pH range of your water should stay within 6.0 and 7.5.

, Before you begin filling the tank and installing fixtures, check your tank for leaks. Fill the tank a few inches and wait to see if the seals hold. You can do this with untreated water if you intend to empty it again.


New fist tanks should always be checked for leaks before placing animals in them.
Filling the tank completely before you check for leaks could lead to a much larger mess if the seal on the tank fails.

, A planted food set up requires the inclusion of living plants inside your shrimp tank. A non-planted tank will need more attention, as you will need to feed the shrimp yourself.Low-light planted tanks can grow moss and ferns to provide their shrimp with a food source.
Higher-light planted setups can use living substrates and grow Rotala on the walls of the tank to provide shrimp with food.
Non-planted setups will need less water quality maintenance, but will require you to feed the shrimp yourself more often.

, You will need to choose the correct form of lighting for you tank based on the plants you have chosen. Be aware that some light options may increase the temperature of your tank's water.Non-planted tanks will only need a common LED tank light available at most pet stores.
Planted setups will need lighting appropriate for your choices in plants. Metal Halides, fluorescents or LED lights are all good options.
Look for light sources that are around 6500 kelvins to approximate the sun's rays for plant growth.

, Before adding any shrimp, you will need to cycle your tank for some time. Cycling is simply allowing your tank to operate as it will once your shrimp are introduced. This is important to establish a bacteria base in your water and filters. Tanks that are not cycled properly may kill shrimp entering the environment.Ensure the aquarium light is set to be on for only eight hours per day to avoid overgrowth of algae.
Test the water bi-weekly for pH, ammonia, nitrate and chlorine. Re-treat the water if necessary.

, Although you should have been testing the water bi-weekly throughout cycling, test it again before adding any shrimp to it. Poor water quality or extreme temperature can quickly kill young shrimp.


Make sure the is no chlorine, ammonia or nitrates present in the water.
Ensure the pH of the water is between 6.0 and 7.5.
Check the water temperature. Shrimp need water that is between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit to survive.

, When you buy your shrimp, they will come in a bag or container with water they are already accustomed to. Pour that water with the shrimp into a large bowl and use a siphon to drip water from the tank into the bowl. Mixing the water will help them adjust to a new environment. Use air-line tubing like that used on tank filters to siphon water from the tank to the bowl. Place the bowl at a lower level than the tank, then put one end of the hose in the tank's water.
Suck gently on the other end of the tube until water starts to flow from the tank to the bowl.
Fold the hose over and use a rubber band to kink it so only a few drops come from the tube at a time.
Allow the tank to drip into the bowl for thirty minutes.

, After you've given the shrimp enough time to adjust to the water of the tank, use a small tank net to scoop the shrimp out of the bowl and place them into the tank.Be careful not to crush any shrimp as you attempt to get them all from the bowl.
Place your hand over the open side of the net as you transfer the shrimp to prevent them from jumping out.
If a shrimp jumps out of the net, scoop it up gently and place it in the tank as quickly as you can.

, If you have a planted aquarium setup, you will still need to provide food for your shrimp from time to time to make sure they receive all the nutrients they need. Non-planted tanks will require daily feeding for your shrimp.Boiled vegetables like zucchini and spinach are great for a shrimp's health.
Processed shrimp foods that come in flakes or pellets are designed to provide shrimp with the nutrition they need. You can find these foods at most pet stores.

, Now that your shrimp are safely in their new home, it's up to you to keep up with tank maintenance. Make sure the water quality doesn't diminish now that the shrimp have been added.Make sure the nitrate, ammonia and chlorine levels all stay at zero.
Adjust your filtration method if you find the water quality diminishing by replacing your filters if necessary.

Feed the cat.,
Train the cat to enter a trap using food.,
Set the trap.,
Stop feeding the cat so that it’s hungry.",How to Capture an Angry or Upset Cat3," Feral cats are usually hungry, so putting out food can make even the wildest cats lower their defenses. Before you can trap the cat, you’ll need to get it used to coming to your trapping spot. Put out food in the same place and at the same time each day so that the cat visits regularly.If there are more than one cat, make sure that there is enough food so that they don’t fight.
You will also want to provide water so that the cat won’t be dehydrated.

, Place your trap in the feeding location. Start by placing the food outside of the trap and slowly move the food into the trap. Continue until the food is in the back of the cage with the cat willingly getting in to eat it. Give the cat a week or two of feedings to get used to the trap so that it won’t be afraid of it.Prop the door of the trap open so that the cat can move in and out freely.
One trap option is a trip-plate trap. In a trip-plate trap, the open door is triggered shut by a mechanism connected to the food plate. These traps eliminate the need for the trapper to have good timing because the trigger shuts the door.
Drop traps are commonly used to trap cats. These traditional traps include a box held up by a stick that the trapper will pull out from a distance. Drop traps are a good option if the cat has learned how to avoid triggering a trip-plate trap.
Stick to the same time and place schedule as before.
Watch the trap while it’s out to make sure that cats don’t get accidentally trapped or harmed., Once the cat is used to entering the trap to eat, set the trigger plate so that the door will shut once the cat is inside. , If you’re still having trouble catching the cat, you can wait a day or two between feedings so that the cat is more likely to be hungry. After the two day withdrawal period, place a trap with food inside in the normal feeding spot. Most cats will go into the trap to get the food.Continue to give the cat water while you’re withdrawing food so that the cat won’t dehydrate and will keep coming to the feeding spot.
If the cat still doesn’t go in the trap, try a more enticing entrée, such as real chicken or tuna fish.
You can also try disguising the trap in a bush.

Provide your cat with food and water.,
Give your cat a litter box.,
Get your cat plenty of toys.,
Spend lots of time with your Cornish Rex.",How to Care for a Cornish Rex1," Feed your Cornish Rex as you would any other cat by providing cat food marked appropriate for its age. Make sure it can access clean, cool water at all times.If you have a kitten, feed it food marked for kittens. Provide your adult or senior cat with appropriately labelled food.
Choosing between wet and dry food is a matter of personal preference. Try out different flavors and take note of your cat’s favorite varieties.
If your cat is overweight, avoid leaving food out at all times. Instead, feed it at regular times twice a day. Consult your cat’s vet to come up with a specific meal plan.;
, Provide your cat with a litter box and, if your home has multiple floors, keep one on every floor. Spot clean it daily and deep clean and change the litter at least weekly.If your Cornish Rex is older or has any mobility issues, provide it with a litter box with lower sides.

, Most cats of this breed are active and playful, and some are even known to play fetch. Keep your cat stimulated with a variety of toys, like feather fishing poles and plush mice.A cat perch is a great choice for a Cornish Rex, since it loves to jump and seek high places.
Give your Cornish Rex a scratching post so it can wear down its claws.

, A Cornish Rex is not only active, but social. In general, the breed loves spending time with people, and doesn’t like being alone for long periods of time. Set aside plenty of time every day to play and simply hang out with your cat.If you have to spend lots of time away from home, consider getting another cat so your Cornish Rex has a playmate.

Buy a professional trap.,
Use a small plastic cup.,
Try a net.",How to Catch a Crayfish1," If you're new to catching crayfish, a professional trap is your best option. There are a variety of options when it comes to crayfish traps. Choose a trap based on your specific needs.


Regardless of the type of trap you're purchasing, make sure the entrance is less than 9.5 centimeters. This is a safety precaution to prevent mammalian animals, like otters, from entering the trap and drowning.Some traps are designed with a crawl-in entrance. These traps are usually meant to be set up and left overnight. If you're planning on catching crayfish while on an extended camping trip, you might want a trap like this. You can leave it in the water overnight and check in the morning to see if you caught anything.If you're going for a one-day trip, get a trap designed for lifting. These traps work somewhat like fishing poles. You lower them into the water, wait until you feel pressure, and then pull the trap upward to check for crayfish.;
, As crayfish are not particularly big, you may be able to get by with a simple plastic cup. If you're unaccustomed to handling live crayfish, this is not recommended. Crayfish are fast and do bite and claw. It may be hard to secure them in a cup if you lack experience. However, if you've caught crayfish before you may want to save your money and use a cup.


You use a cup as a trap manually. You would wait until you see a crayfish and then submerge your cup in the water.
Then, you would slowly move the cup forward until the crayfish was behind it. Use a stick to scare the crayfish so it backs into the cup. Then, pull the cup out of the water., A net is a slightly less expensive option than a professional trap. It requires less manual effort than a simple cup, so it's a good in-between option. You can try a simple fishnet, which you can buy at most sporting goods stores. Keep in mind a fish net may not be ideal. You can hurt a crayfish if its limbs get caught in a fishing net. Even if you intend to kill the animal for food, you want to minimize its suffering."

Keep your Cornish Rex warm.,
Apply cat-safe sunscreen if your cat goes outside.,
Take your Cornish Rex to the vet at least one per year.,
Get your cat vaccinated.,
Look out for breed-specific health issues.",How to Care for a Cornish Rex2," Since its coat is so thin, it’s harder for a Cornish Rex to maintain its body temperature. Purchase a well-fitting sweater or two from your local pet supply store to keep it warm, especially during colder months.As a rule of thumb, if you’re cold, your Cornish Rex will definitely be cold.

, Also due to their thin coats, cats of this breed are susceptible to sunburns. If your cat goes outside, apply sunscreen to its ears and thinner patches of its coat.You can find a cat-safe sunscreen at your local pet store.
While it’s natural for your cat to seek out warm, sunny spots, try not to let it sunbathe for long periods of time.

, All cats should see their vet at least once per year for a physical examination, booster shots, and routine blood work. In addition to regular visits, take your cat to the vet if you notice any unusual behavior, like trouble moving around or loss of appetite.Taking your cat to the vet regularly will also help you prevent breed-specific disorders, like heart conditions, that can be difficult to identify on your own.

, Required core vaccinations will vary based on your location. In general all cats need vaccinations against rabies, distemper, calicivirus, and herpesvirus. Ask your cat’s vet about their specific recommendations based on your location and your cat’s lifestyle.Vaccinations against herpesvirus and calicivirus will help prevent a range of potential secondary health issues.

, A Cornish Rex is prone to developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a common form of heart disease. An annual echocardiogram will help identify any potential heart issues. The breed is also susceptible to patellar luxation, or kneecap displacement, so keep an eye on its mobility and bring it to the vet if you notice any problems.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and other vision problems are also common in the breed, so check its eyes regularly for cloudiness, redness, or deformities. Bring it to the vet if you notice it bumping into things or if it otherwise seems to have trouble seeing."

Brush your Cornish Rex with your hand.,
Clean your cat’s ears.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.,
Trim your cat's nails.",How to Care for a Cornish Rex3," Your cat’s short, wavy coat won’t require too much grooming. Brushing too much or too hard can in fact damage the coat. The motion of your hand when you pet your Cornish Rex is all the grooming its coat needs., A Cornish Rex has large ears, so you’ll need to check them regularly. Look inside its ears every week for mites, discharge, or irritation, and smell for any foul odors that might indicate infection. If you notice too much waxy build-up in the ear, use a cotton ball to clean the external part of the cat's ear. Do not put anything in its ear canal. If the ear appears red, smells bad, or if the cat keeps scratching its ear, take your cat to the vet., While they might not like having their teeth cleaned, oral hygiene is an important part of maintaining your cat’s health. Get your cat used to having its teeth touched by gently massaging around its mouth while you hold or pet it. Daily brushing is best, but a weekly cleaning is better than nothing.Use a cat toothbrush, which is smaller and has softer bristles than a toothbrush for humans. You can also use a cat toothbrush that fits over your finger.
Apply a small amount of cat toothpaste to the brush and gently massage your cat’s teeth and gums.
Bring your cat to the vet if you smell a foul odor coming from its mouth or see any sores or ulcers.

, Gently pet and massage its paws to prepare it for a nail trimming. Hold the paw and locate the quick, which looks like a small pink triangle inside the nail. Use a sharp pair of cat nail clippers to the trim the nail, and take care to avoid the quick and cut only the nail's tip.


Check your cat's nails for splits or breaks and to get a feel for how fast they grow. Trim them every two weeks to one month so they don't get too long or break.
You might only be able to trim one or two nails at a time, so have patience. Avoid trimming your cat's nails after playtime or when it's hungry.

Don't feed a new tank until 5 days after hatching.,
Feed the sea monkeys a tiny amount of Growth Food.,
Repeat the feeding once every five to seven days.,
Skip feedings if the water gets cloudy.,
Watch for a dark streak on the sea monkeys as a sign of health.,
Increase feedings cautiously.",How to Feed Sea Monkeys1," Sea monkeys begin life by feeding off the nutrients in their egg sac. Check on the eggs daily to see if they've begun to hatch. Once they have, wait five days before you start to feed them.Newly hatched sea monkeys can be extremely small. Move your tank to a well-lit area and examine the water closely for tiny, pale, moving dots. Use a magnifying glass if necessary.
If the sea monkey eggs do not hatch within 48 hours, move the tank to an area with stronger light. Keep the tank away from direct sunlight, however, as this can cause it to overheat;
, Use the smaller end of the feeding spoon to pick up the food, and move one of these small spoonfuls into the tank.If you do not have a feeding spoon, try using a clean plastic straw as a scoop. It's better to give them too little food than too much.

, Different handbooks vary in their instructions, but most sea monkey tanks will thrive when fed at intervals of five to seven days.Only increase the feeding rate or amount if your sea monkey population grows much larger than the initial packet's population, and if there is no sediment on the base of the tank.

, If the water becomes cloudy or dirty-looking, stop feeding the shrimp. Wait until the water becomes clear again before adding food.This cloudy appearance is usually the result of too much algae, bacteria, or other organisms that can suffocate the sea monkeys if they continue to grow., Adult brine shrimp digestive tracks become dark when full. If you see this dark line running across a sea monkey's body, it is probably eating well.If you do not, consider feeding them more often, but only as described below.

, If you acquire more sea monkeys, or if the population grows, you may need to increase the amount of food or the frequency of feeding. Adjust slowly to avoid killing the tank's population through overfeeding. Reduce the interval between feeding sessions by one day at a time, returning to the old feeding schedule if the water becomes cloudy or the sea monkeys start acting sluggish or uninterested in food. Alternatively, keep the same feeding schedule but switch to the large end of the feeding spoon.

Get your crayfish.,
Get the right tank for your crayfish.,
Make the tank comfortable for your crayfish.,
Feed your crayfish.,
Keep your crayfish safe from other fish.,
Take care of your crayfish when it sheds its skin.,
Keep your crayfish from escaping their tank.",How to Take Care of Crayfish," You can easily find a crayfish at a tropical fish store or another pet store. You can get a red crayfish for 1-3 dollars, while more high-end crayfish, like the blue crayfish, can cost 20 dollars or more. You can always go on reputable websites to find even more rare and exotic crayfish, but they could end up costing you as much as 100 dollars. You can start by getting just one of these critters and getting him used to his new home.


If you live in certain parts of the United States, you can have a great time going crayfishing, looking for fish in streams or shallow bodies of water. Just get a small net, turn up some rocks, and try to make it so that the crayfish end up rapidly swimming right into your net.;
, Crayfish need a tank with a pH of 7.0 (neutral) that has a temperature between 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). Do not use a heated aquarium for these critters. Additionally, the aquarium should have proper aeration and filtration. One crayfish needs at least 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L) of water all to himself.


It's not recommended that you put more than one crayfish in a tank, but if you do, you should make sure they have enough space to themselves, and enough places to hide. Also, if you do have multiple crayfish in one tank, make sure they are of the same species, or they are likely to kill each other.
In addition to filter oxygenation, you'll need air bubblers or long bubble walls on your tank.
Make sure to partially change the water each week to keep it fresh.
You can also put your crayfish in a tank with fish, if you take the right precautions -- more on that later!
Don't put seashells in the tank, or this can affect the pH level of the water.
Perform regular water changes. Because crayfish have large bio-loads, do at least two water changes each week. Always use a dechlorinator when replacing water.
Don't use an undergravel filter. Crayfish like to dig, which can jam the filter.

, Crayfish love to burrow, hide, and to generally be in darkness, so you have to create an environment that is conducive to this. You can add elements like a tipped-over castle, PVC pipe, rocks, or plants. They like to climb in plants, but try to get fake ones, or they may eat the real plants very quickly. They need hollowed-out rocks, gerbil pipes, or any 3-sided containers to truly feel safe, especially when they are extra vulnerable after shedding their shells.


Try to minimize the light exposure the tank gets, because crayfish are much more comfortable with the lights out.

, Crayfish need to have a sinking pellet food as a staple. Sinking shrimp pellets are perfect. They also like to eat vegetables as well as any decaying matter. Since fish eat shrimp pellets too, make sure you drop enough of the pellets around the crayfish's hiding place that he can get to them. He may also eat some regular fish food flakes if they make it his way, but this is not enough for him.


When it comes to veggies, they can eat cabbage leafs, zucchini medallions, or shelled peas.
They can also eat some frozen foods, such as daphnia, blood worms, frozen fish, and brine shrimp.
Cooked chicken can also make for a great occasional treat.

, Your crayfish can live in a tank with other fish, as long as you don't have any bottom dwellers, because crayfish like to clean the bottom of your tank, too. And if you have any pricey or just special fish in your tank, then you may think twice about adding a crayfish to the mix. They are not just bottom dwellers, but are also scavengers and hunters, which means that they will swipe at passing fish. Though this is mostly just amusing to watch and they rarely are able to attack fish, this can happen.Mostly, the crayfish attack fish that are getting sick and sinking toward the bottom of the tank. They'll stay away from strong, healthy fish.
If you have large or aggressive fish, then there's a chance they can go after your crayfish, too.
Cichlids are known for eating crayfish. Crayfish are known for eating cloud mountain minnows, rosy red minnows, and rainbow darters.
Goldfish and crayfish tend not to get along.

, Crayfish will molt their protective shell from time to time, which will make them feel more vulnerable to other crayfish or fish, so you have to take extra care with them. When they shed their shell, do not remove it, because they will actually need to eat it, or some of it, to help strengthen the new shell they are going to grow. Do not feed your crayfish when it molts, because it will only be eating its shell.


Some people even place their crayfish in a separate tank to protect it while it is molting.

, Crayfish love to explore new territory and are great at escaping, so make sure you have protected any openings in the filter and have kept the lid firmly placed on the tank. You can use aluminum foil and rubber bands and tape to seal off the filter opening from the outside, as long as you don't let the aluminum touch the tank water. If a crayfish escapes, it can dehydrate and die in just a few hours, so it's very important to be vigilant about this.


If you have caught an escaping crayfish, do not place it directly back in its tank. His little gills need time to get used to the water again, and you don't want to drown him by mistake. Place the crayfish in a tall bucket with just enough water to fully cover it. Add a rock to the bucket to make the crayfish feel less vulnerable. After one full day, pick up your crayfish and hold it upside down on the surface of the water. If it does well here, let it return to its normal environment."

Find a suitable location.,
Install troughs.,
Provide good filtration.,
Purchase larvae.,
Feed the lobsters.",How to Create Lobster Farms," Successful lobster farming will require enough space to set up several troughs, which are underwater pens. Clean water, free from pollutants and waste, and flat land to accommodate the troughs are essential elements of a lobster farm. Also important is having enough space for the lobsters. Lobsters will eat each other before they develop their shells if they feel crowded. Make sure the space will allow for enough troughs to house the lobsters in an non-crowded environment.;
, Provide a good environment on the lobster farm by installing several solid troughs. These will not only keep the lobsters on the farm, they will also keep them safe from outside predators and each other. Place the troughs side by side, in even rows so that each one is easily accessible.

, Keeping water clean and filtered is necessary to protect lobsters from disease, which can spread very quickly through a farm. The best way to prevent disease is to manage the waste produced by the lobsters. Mechanical filtration will regularly remove waste from the water supply. Bio-filtration systems will leave the waste in the water, but convert it to a less toxic nitrate that is safe for the lobsters.

, Suppliers of lobster larvae can be found primarily in hatcheries or fisheries in Canada and on the northern Atlantic coast. Once a lobster hatches from its shell, it is tiny, transparent, has large eyes and a spiny body. This is larvae, and it will move through 4 stages of larvae before becoming a recognizable lobster.

, Keep the lobsters healthy and growing by feeding them. In the wild, they eat small crustaceans, mollusks and fish. Appropriate feed can be purchased from the supplier of the larvae. Lobster food blends are also being developed in Norway. Cod feed can be used to feed lobsters in a farmed environment.

Fill your tank with about 1 liter (1/4 of gallon) distilled or bottled spring water (preferably bottled spring water) .,
Stir in your packet of triop eggs and wait for at least 18 hours.,
Wait another 3 days after the majority of triops have hatched.,
Continue to feed once a day till they are 5 days old,then they eat 2-3 times a day.",How to Care for Triops," Make sure the water is between 23 and 29 degrees Celsius or between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and there is a light before adding the eggs. Put a piece of black paper behind the tank. If you bought a kit and it came with detritus (eggs), follow the instructions and add this.;
, After this time, look closely at the tank. You should be able to see little white specks swimming over the black background. Some of these are your triops! The other creatures (Fairy Shrimp, Cyclops, Water Fleas etc.) will probably be eaten by the triops, so don't worry.

, After that waiting period, you can raise the water temperature to 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit)and have them on a day/night schedule. Feed them the food the kit gave you or use tropical fish pellets, not goldfish pellets. Crush them between two spoons, then add half of this to the tank.

, At 7 days and over, feed them a full pellet to each triops 2-3 times a day. Keep feeding till they don't eat anymore, then take out the excess food they don't eat.

Find the right bait.,
Place your chosen trap in the right area.,
Kill crayfish shortly after trapping them.",How to Catch a Crayfish2," Once you've chosen a trap, you'll need bait. If you're using a cup or net, this may not be necessary. Meat is what is most often used to catch a crayfish. It's best to use real meat instead of artificial bait. Fish heads, bacon, and chicken carcasses work well.If you do not want to spend money on real meat, you can use a can of cat food with holes punched into the top. Crayfish are primarily attracted to smell. They may follow the smell of the cat food.How you bait a trap depends heavily on the trap you're using. You would usually place it inside the trap, close to the back. Some crayfish traps may have special sections where you can place the bait.

, You need to place your trap in an area where you're likely to find crayfish. Crayfish generally prefer clear, still water. They also prefer a rocky habitat.Look for shallow, still waters. You can also look for eddies with fast streams, as crayfish may flow into your traps.Rivers and brooks are where crayfish are most often found. They tend to congregate in warmer bodies of freshwater. If you live in a colder area, it may be harder to find and catch crayfish., In many states, it's illegal to transport live crayfish. You also do not want to cause the animals excessive stress. You should kill the crayfish shortly after they enter your traps.


If you're going for a daylong fishing trip, you should keep crayfish alive until the end of the day. This minimizes decay. You can keep crayfish in a sealable container. Keep crayfish between layers of moist fabric. You might want to put ice between the layers of fabric, but be sure not to let ice directly touch the crayfish.When you're finished fishing, you can kill the crayfish by stabbing them with a kitchen knife. Stab around the top of the body, where their head joins the abdomen."

Wear protective gloves.,
Find crayfish.,
Move slowly.,
Aim for the midsection.",How to Catch a Crayfish3," Some people prefer to simply catch crayfish by hand. You should not do this unless you have experience handling live crustaceans. Always wear protective gloves when catching crayfish by hand. They may nip or claw when frightened.

, Crayfish are often found in shallow water. You may find crayfish congregated under a rock. Wade in a flowing, rocky creek and lift up stones and rocks. Look for gatherings of crayfish.Once again, crayfish prefer shallow waters. They're usually found in brooks and rivers. They may, however, show up in fast-moving eddies on occasion.
Keep in mind crayfish do most of their moving during the night. It can be very hard to find crayfish during daylight hours. It might be a good idea to bring a flashlight and seek out crayfish during the night. You can find them by shining a flashlight into the water., When you find your crayfish, move slowly. Crayfish easily pick up on vibrations in the water. As you close in on your crayfish, move your hand slowly. Many people feel inclined to grab at the crayfish quickly, but this actually makes you less likely to catch them., When picking up a crayfish by hand, aim for the midsection. Use two fingers. When two fingers are grasping around the hard shell of a crayfish's midsection, it's very difficult for it to fight back. Once you've secured a crayfish, place it in a sealable container. When you're done catching crayfish, kill them as you would when using a trap."

Release breeding crayfish.,
Make sure you have the proper license.,
Seek medical attention in the event of an injury.",How to Catch a Crayfish4," It's unethical to catch and kill a crayfish that is breeding. This can diminish the population. Make sure you throwback any breeding females you catch.


Crayfish hold larvae under their tails. A crayfish with a large tail may be a breeding female and should be thrown back into the water.If you're uncertain if you have a male or female, look at the crayfish's front claws. Larger front claws are indicative of a male crayfish., Some states may require a license to catch crayfish. You should double check your state's regulations before catching crayfish. You should be able to find this information on your state's Department of Natural Resources website. If you're having trouble finding the answer, try calling a DNR office during office hours to ask for clarification.

, Crayfish do claw and bite when frightened. You can minimize your risk of injury by wearing gloves.In the event you are nipped by a crayfish, wash the wound in water and soap. Then, seek medical care to make sure you do not need further treatment. While many crayfish bites can be treated at home, it's a good idea to be safe and have it looked at by a doctor.

, Gro-Kwickly is meant to be added with the small scoop no more than once per week, in addition to the ordinary food.This may result in more rapid growth, although the company that makes these products does not explain the difference between this and Super Food.

, This packet claims to contain vitamins that make your sea monkeys healthier or more energetic. The most noticeable effect, however, may be the pink or red color that the sea monkeys develop. You may need to feed them Red Magic for several feeding sessions before this becomes visible.

, The back of the Banana Treat packet claims that this food has extra nutrients, so it may not be as unhealthy as some human ""treats.""However, it appears that this product is only intended as an occasional treat to excite your sea monkeys, instead of regular food. If your sea monkeys are not excited by this food, there is probably no point in using it.

If your kit did not come with a small plastic tank, you can use a clean plastic container that can hold at least two liters of water. Look for a container that has a deep base, as sea monkeys often enjoy swimming around at the base area of their tanks., You can use bottled water, distilled water, or any form of unchlorinated water. Avoid using carbonated water or tap water, as it often contains fluoride and other minerals that may not be good for your sea monkeys.Once you fill the tank with the water, you should place the tank indoors so it can warm up to room temperature. This will ensure the water will be warm enough for the sea monkey eggs.
You should also aerate the tank water at least once to twice a day with an air pump or a turkey baster.

, The water purifier or salt packet should come in your sea monkey kit when you buy it in stores or online. The water purifier will contain salt, which is important for your sea monkeys as it will allow them to hatch in the water and thrive.Once you put the salt packet in the water, give it a stir and let the water sit in room temperature for another day or up to 36 hours before you add the sea monkeys to the tank.

, Once you pour the sea monkeys into the tank, stir the tank water with a clean plastic spoon. The sea monkeys will appear as small dots in the water. But don’t worry, they will hatch in around five days and begin swimming around in the tank.Aerate the water while you wait for the sea monkeys to hatch, at least once to twice a day. This will ensure there is enough oxygen in the water for your sea monkeys as they develop and hatch.

, Rather than feed your sea monkeys as soon as they start hatching, you should wait five days. On the fifth day from when your sea monkeys hatch, you can give them sea monkey food. The sea monkey food should come with your sea monkeys as part of a kit.Use the small end of the feeding spoon to sprinkle one small spoonful of food in their tank. You should give them a small spoonful of food every 2 days. Do not give your sea monkeys fish food or foods other than sea monkey food.

, You should feed your sea monkeys every five days to keep them healthy and happy. Do not overfeed your sea monkeys as this will often kill them.Sea monkeys are transparent, which means you will be able to see their digestive tract if you look at them closely. When their digestive tract is full of food, they will have a black stripe down the middle of their body. Once they poop out the food, their digestive tract will be clear again.

, Over time, green algae will start to appear in the tank. The tank may also smell grassy, like a freshly mowed lawn. These are all good signs, as the green algae actually acts as food for for sea monkeys and helps them stay healthy. You can switch to feeding your sea monkeys once a week once green algae begins to form and build up in the tank.You should also not worry about cleaning the tank once the algae starts to develop. The tank may look green and full of algae, but it is actually very healthy and good for your sea monkeys that way.

, Your sea monkeys need oxygen to live happily in their tank. If they become oxygen deprived, they may turn a pinkish color and appear slow moving or tired. To ensure the water has enough oxygen, you should aerate the tank twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can use an air pump to aerate the water, such as an air pump used in small aquariums. Stick the air pump in the water and let it aerate the tank for at least one minute, twice a day.Another option is to use a small turkey baster to aerate the tank. You can squeeze the turkey baster in the air and then put it in the water and release the air to put more oxygen in the water. Pull the turkey baster in and out of the water, placing air in the water, for at least one minute, twice a day.
To make your own air bubbler: Take a pipette that you aren't planning on using for anything else. Poke a hole in the very top, then poke many tiny holes in the squirting-out end. Either use a pin or staple it several times from different angles with a stapler, then remove the staples.
If you do not want to remember to aerate the tank twice a day, you can place a small live plant in the sea monkeys’ tank to provide oxygen in the water. Use an underwater aquarium plant that is known to provide good oxygen underwater.

, Sea monkeys do not like being in a very cold environment or a very hot environment. You should put their tank in a spot of your house that gets indirect sunlight and is at least 22 degrees Celsius, or 72 Fahrenheit. This will ensure the tank gets enough heat and is not too cold for your sea monkeys.A tank that is too cold will lead to them becoming immobile sea monkeys and sea monkeys that do not grow. If you notice the sea monkeys are not moving in their tank or growing, it could be because the tank is too cold and needs to be moved to a warmer spot in your home. Place it in a spot with indirect sunlight so it gets enough heat but does not get too hot.

, Green algae in the tank is a good thing, as the algae acts as food and provides oxygen for your sea monkeys. But if you notice the tank smells really bad and the water appears dark and cloudy, you may need to clean the tank and the water.You will need a coffee filter and a clean glass filled with unchlorinated salt water. Use a net to take the sea monkeys out of the tank and place them in the clean glass with water.
Place the coffee filter over a clean tank and run the tank water through the coffee filter several times. Try to filter out as much of the gunk in the water as possible.
You can use a paper towel to clean out the bottom and sides of the tank. You can also use a Q-tip to clean out any gunk in the crevices of the tank.
Smell the tank water to check that it no longer smells foul. Then, put the water back in the tank, followed by the sea monkeys. Top up the tank water with purified, room temperature water. Feed your sea monkeys and aerate the tank several times throughout the day. Then, feed them again five days later, per their usual feeding schedule.

, If you notice white spots, almost like cotton balls, in the tank water, you should try to remove them as soon as possible. They are a type of bacteria that can kill your sea monkeys. Use a small spoon to get them out of the tank and dispose of them.You may want to also put Sea Medic into the tank, which will help to kill any remaining bacteria. If they still appear after one to two days, you should give the tank a thorough cleaning and replace the water. You may lose baby sea monkeys and sea monkey eggs when you dispose of the water, but this may be the only way to kill the bacteria.

, You can play with your sea monkeys using a small flashlight or a pen light. Move the light against the tank and note how the sea monkeys will chase and follow the light as you move it around. They will also gather by the light if you keep it still against the tank.You can have fun playing with your sea monkeys by drawing shapes and patterns with the light, which they will then swim around and trace in the tank.

, Male sea monkeys have whiskers under their chins and female sea monkeys often appear to be carrying eggs when they swim around. Sea monkeys will mate often so do not be surprised if you see sea monkeys latching onto each other as they swim. This is an indication your sea monkeys are mating and more sea monkeys will soon be on their way.Most sea monkeys live for an average of two years but due to their high mating rates, you will likely have a continuous supply of sea monkeys in the tank as long as you care for the tank and the sea monkeys properly.

,,, On day three add 1 crushed pellet to the tank. Do the same for day four. On day five, feed your triops one crushed pellet in the morning and one before you go to bed. Do this until day 7 seven, then you should add 1 non-crushed pellet for each triop in the tank. If all the food gets eaten add another pellet for each triop. You may have to feed your triops up to four times a day.

Set up your tank.,
Buy a master test kit.,
Purchase 5-10 red cherry shrimp.,
Fill your tank with water that you have added dechlorinator to.,
Get the shrimp used to the water using these steps.,
Dump the shrimp in the tank.,
Set your heater to about 80F or 27C.,
Feed the shrimp flake food, sinking pellets, or blanched squash or zucchini.,
If water temperature is warm enough and there is enough food, they will simply breed.,
Maintain the tank.",How to Breed Red Cherry Shrimp," You will need a 5 to 10 gallon or 20 to 40 litre tank, a heater (to keep temperature at 75F-80F or 24-27C during cool nights), gravel (dark will stress the shrimps less), and a bubble filter that is cycled.


To cycle a bubble filter in a new tank, put the new bubble filter in an old tank, turn it on, and wait for 4 weeks. RCS will not survive the cycling process and will die from high levels of ammonia or nitrites.
Do not use a power filter unless the whole intake is covered with pantyhose (or something with similar very small holes) and secured with a zip tie (otherwise shrimp may get sucked into the filter and pureed).
;
, This is absolutely required for keeping shrimp. It is impossible to determine the problem with a tank without a master test kit. You will need the following tests: ammonia, nitrite, nitrate. Get drop tests, not test strips. Test strips are expensive, and expire after about 6 months of being open. Drop kits are much cheaper per test and last longer.

, RCS cost $1.50 - $3 (US) each at a pet store. They cost much less per shrimp via online on websites and forums, many people also offer free shipping like $20 or so for 20 or so shrimp, it is easy to get a good deal these days. Try to get a mix of clear (males can have some red as well) males and red females. If you get 10 shrimp, your chance of getting both males and females is pretty much guaranteed.


If someone wants to ship with a method that takes longer than 3 days, ask for pictures about how the shrimp are packaged, Cherry shrimp are VERY hard to kill and will most likely have no problem with a week in transit. Take into consideration the weather over the distance it will be shipped, ask for heat packs or ice packs in the shipping container to help counter ambient temperatures if that is a potential problem. Also request breather bags.
Do not buy RCS (or any fish or shrimp) that the pet store received in the last 3 or 4 days. Any deaths from the stress of shipping tend to occur during the 3-4 days after putting them in the store tanks, so buy after this period. Buy only shrimp that have been in the store tanks at least 4 days.

It is normal and desirable for the shipping bag containing shrimp to be filled with 1/3 to 1/2 water. This maximizes the trapped oxygen in the bag during shipping. This only applies loosely to the bags that are just normal plastic. If shipping with these bags, see if seller can use pure oxygen opposed to just air.

, Chlorine and chloramines will kill shrimp so make sure you get a dechlorinator that neutralizes both.

, Put the bag into the water and clip it to the tank side using a binder clip. Add 1/4 cup tank water to the bag (perhaps use 1 turkey baster full of water). Wait 15 minutes. Repeat 2 more times. (An alternative to this is to test the bag's water parameters and your tank's if it is similar, just acclimate them to the temperature and dump them into the tank, cherries are very hardy and hard to kill relative to other shrimp.)

, The temperature and water parameters (like pH) should have equalized enough not to shock the shrimp.

, Use another thermometer (like a digital if you can afford it) to verify your heater is working accurately. Check it daily when you feed them.

, Shrimp eat anything a fish would. You do not even need small pieces of food as they will rip off a piece of flake and feed it to themselves. Some shrimp do not like algae tablets, some do. (Foods with copper compounds are not ok for RCS.)


If there is still food in the tank when you feed them, skip that feeding and check again later.
Feed very small amounts once per day, especially if you just start with 10 shrimp. A flake the size of your pinky fingernail should last 10 RCS about 2, perhaps 3 days. Do not overfeed as it will result in harmless worms like detritus or planaria. If this happens do a water change and if you have no fry (RCS babies) then do a gravel vac and start to feed less food or not as often.
To blanch zucchini, put one slice in a microwave safe bowl. Cover with about an inch or so or 3cm of water. Cook on high for 1 minute. Let cool for 20 minutes, then drop into tank. If the zucchini floats, weight it down with a zip tie, a piece of plastic, or a marble, but not metal.

, Female shrimp should get greenish or yellowish eggs under their tail within 30 days of you receiving them, if they don't already have eggs. Female shrimp get a yellowish ""saddle-shaped"" patch behind their head. These are eggs in their ovaries. The eggs should move to their tails in 7-10 days. Once the eggs are under their tails, the eggs will hatch in 3-4 weeks. You will notice how the mom fans the eggs occasionally to prevent fungus from growing on them. The eggs will hatch faster if the water is warmer. You may wake up one day to find tiny clear shrimp on the plants, or on the bottom. Baby RCS look just like the adults, but they are very small, about 2mm long, and clear. But their shape is the same as an adult RCS. Shrimp will not eat their babies unless they are starving. Besides, the babies are quick to get away.

, A 10 gallon or 40 litre tank can safely hold 100-150 adult RCS if you change 25% of the water each week without exception. Do not vacuum the bottom of the tank, baby shrimp get a lot of their daily food out of the ""waste"". However too much waste will cause a buildup of nitrates. High nitrates can kill shrimp.

"
Suck up any detritus.,
Do a partial water change.,
Clean decorations and food bowls (if any).",How to Clean a Fiddler Crab Tank1," Using a gravel siphon or turkey baster, remove bits of food and poop. Fiddler crab poop looks like tiny brown dots about the size of their eyes, and because of their small size they are easy to take out. Try not to suck up too much sand, or you'll just be dumping it away.


Move the sand around a little to uncover some waste that may have been buried.;
, Change 15-25% of water volume, and remember to add a water conditioner and 1/2 teaspoon of marine salt per 1.5-2 liters of water.


If there's floating waste in the water, quickly scoop it out with a fish net before it settles.

, Use a 5-10% bleach solutionto soak non-absorbent decorations for no more than 10 minutes. Rinse and dry them thoroughly. If you want to scrub them, then you can when rinsing. For live plants or absorbent materials like wood, soak in slightly salty water (made with a few teaspoons of salt in 1.5-2 liters of water) for 10 minutes and scrub with a clean tool.


Always let the objects dry fully before placing them back in the tank. If you used bleach, make sure there is no bleach smell left.

"
"
Unplug everything and move the crabs to a holding container.,
Clean the appliances.,
Clean the decorations and sand.,
Wash the entire tank.,
Replace all of the decorations and appliances.",How to Clean a Fiddler Crab Tank2," A bucket with a shallow level of warm, dechlorinated brackish water works. When removing the heater, always pull the electrical plug first and then wait 15 minutes before removing it from the water.


If the electrical plug to an appliance is wet, do not pull it out, until you dry it.

, Take out the filter cartridge and set it aside in a container of tank water. This will keep some beneficial bacteria. Rinse the heater, filter, and air tube/stone (if using) in running water. Rub with a cleaning pad or your hands to clean out filth. Pat dry or let air dry.


Make sure that water doesn't drip from the appliances to their plugs. If you do get water on the electrical plugs, let them air dry to dry out fully. Do not plug in and use when wet.
Only wash the main body of the appliance.

, Cleaning the decorations is the same as described in step three of ""Doing a Partial Clean"". The sand, however, can't just be soaked and rinsed. Suck up waste using the siphon/turkey baster to get rid of the easy waste first. Drain off as much water as you can. Place the sand in a bucket and fill the bucket with tap water. Swish the sand around inside the bucket to clean it, then drain off the water. Repeat until the water does not have any floating bits of waste.


You can replace some of the old sand if you want, and it is recommended that every few months that you do so.

, First rinse out any sand. If you feel that the tank needs a thorough disinfection, let a 10% bleach solution sit inside for 10 minutes. If there is a hard water stain/salt stain but you don't want to use bleach, spray the walls of the tank with vinegar and let it sit for five to ten minutes. Scrub every corner of the tank if necessary, and rinse out. Let the tank dry outside until the bleach/vinegar smell is gone and it is completely free of water. If you can't do outside, you can place it in a well-ventilated room.

, Add the sand first. If you have a big decoration, you can add that in next, so when you place the water in, you can pour it on the decoration (as not to disturb the sand). If you have delicate decorations, add them after adding water. Add the water, and then the filter, heater, etc. For the heater, place the body in the water for 15 minutes before plugging it in. Wait for the heater to warm the water if you used colder water, then add in anything else (decorations, plants). Finally, add the crabs in.


Make sure your water is treated and brackish.

Provide your crabs a good home.,
Get at least two fiddler crabs, they live in large colonies in the wild and will be lonely.,
Provide a nice large bowl of water for them.,
Put food in a small bowl.,
Give them a branch or two to climb on.,
Only hold them if absolutely necessary.,
Every so often your crabs will molt.",How to Care for Pet Fiddler Crabs," Fiddler crabs should not be kept with fish. People have kept them underwater successfully, but these crabs don't live in water, they live on beaches. Their entire tank should be damp sand.;
, The rule is five gallons a crab, so a ten gallon is good for two. Three can be done but is slightly crowded. Males have a large claw that is used to attract females. Females have two small claws. They need heat in between 75F and 85F. This can be accomplished with a basking bulb or reptile heat pad.Get a wire mesh screen meant for reptiles.

, It should be embedded in the sand so they can crawl in. A Tupperware sand which container works well. Their water should be dechlorinated, meaning no chlorine should be in it. Tap water isn't suitable alone and needs a dechlorinated meant for fish to be added to it. Bottled water is fine. The water also needs marine salt added to it; this can be found at pet stores.

, Fiddler crabs are scavengers and will eat almost anything. They especially love fish, as that is their main food source in the wild.

, These guys live around trees such as mangrove and often climb.

, This is more for your benefit than the crabs because they LOVE to pinch you!

, They will flip upside down and shed their exoskeleton. It is important that you do not touch them. It will kill them. Once they finish molting don't remove their old skin, as gross as it is they need to eat it so their new exoskeleton can harden.

Find a beach where ghost crabs live.,
Visit the beach at night.,
Scan the beach.,
Aim your flashlight.,
Scoop him up in your net.,
Release your crabs at the end of the night.",How to Catch a Ghost Crab1," Ghost crabs are common shore crabs in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They inhabit deep burrows in the inter-tidal zone. They are particularly popular on the Outer Banks beaches of North Carolina (and ghost crab hunting is a popular activity there), but they can be found on coastal beaches around the world., Ghost crabs are nocturnal, so in order to see them (let alone catch them), you must visit the beach at night. Go to your beach location after the sun has set., Using your flashlight, scan up and down the beach looking for movement. Ghost crabs are small, quick, and the color of sand, so it may be hard to spot them at first. But with your flashlight, you’ll soon begin to see them scurry., Once you have spotted a ghost crab, aim your flashlight right at him. Maybe you’ve heard the expression a “deer stuck in headlights”? Well, how about a crab stuck in a flashlight? When the light is shined on him, he will freeze.

, Keep your flashlight steady and approach him very slowly. Try not to spook him. As soon as you become close enough, scoop him up in your net. Then drop him from your net into your bucket. Congrats! You’ve just caught your first ghost crab.

, Although this activity is often called ghost crab “hunting,” it is really more like ghost crab chasing. Be sure to release your little critters back into the wild after your fun evening of catching them."
"
Collect the appropriate crabbing equipment.,
Get the right bait.,
Be aware of restrictions in your area.,
Pick the right place.,
Leave the pot out overnight.,
Remove the crabs from the pot.",How to Catch a Crab1," Crabbers who use a crab pot tend to have a dip net (or scrap net) for scooping errant crabs, thick crabbing gloves, a crab pot, a culling stick (to help remove the crabs from the net), and a container for storing the caught crabs.The crab pot is a large square trap that is made out of wire (typically some sort of chicken wire). There are entrances (called ""throats"") where the crabs enter the trap to get the bait, which is constructed so they can't access it. The crabs then get trapped in the pot and you draw the pot back up to the surface with your new bounty.
Depending on the area you're in you 'll have to figure whether you need a lightweight pot or a heavier one. For example: in the Puget Sound area, most areas support lightweight crab pots just fine, but a few areas, because of tidal currents and strong wave action, require heavier pots. If you're sport fishing, you typically don't want to use the commercial crab pots which are typically 75-150 lbs. (the pots sportsmen use tend to be 10 to 20 lbs.
The culling stick helps to remove the crabs from the net or pot. You can make one yourself by cutting a 5 inch (12.7 cm) notch in a piece of wood.
For the storage container, it is good to use a wooden bushel basket, but you can also use a cooler to store them. Mostly you just want to make sure that you keep the crabs alive until it is time to eat them and storing them in the appropriate container with ice. Leave the ice in the bag in the container and put the crabs on top of it. This will make them easier to handle when the time comes to cook them.;
, There are tons of different kinds of bait that professional and sport crabbers use. You'll have to experiment to see what works best for you, but chicken necks are a popular one, because they are scrap meat and crabs do seem to love them.


You can use frozen fish, because it typically decomposes faster than fresh fish, which better attracts crabs.
While crabs will eat basically any uncooked meat, you could also try some of the types commercial crabbers swear by: eel (this is one of the best ones according to commercial crabbers, but the price as risen because it is a delicacy in Europe and Asia); bull lip (durable, inexpensive, and crabs seem to love it); Menhaden, a type of forage fish, is great frozen, but decomposes very quickly, so if you're leaving the pots out for a while, you would want to use fresh Menhaden.

, Every area has different restrictions for how many crabs you can have, what kind of a license you need, the size limit for crabs, where you can crab and when you can crab. Go to your local marina and talk to the harbormaster, or your local department for Fish and Game.


There are certain types of crabs that you'll be looking to catch and certain ones you'll need to throw back if you get them in your crab pot. Again, this will be entirely dependent on your area. For example: if you're crabbing on the East coast of the United States, you'll probably be crabbing for Blue Claw Crabs. If you catch a green crab or a spider crab, you'll need to release it, as those types of crabs aren't edible.
There also tend to be laws in place protecting crabs with egg sacs, since these need to keep repopulating the crab population. If you catch a crab with an egg sac, make sure you release it.
Get rid of any dead crabs that you catch. You don't know how long they've been dead, so you don't want to eat them. Stick to keeping your crabs alive until it's time to put them in the pot.

, You aren't going to want to head out to any old body of water and dump and crab pot in there. There are specific places where crabs are more plentiful. Crabs are found in salt water, not fresh water, especially in tidal water. This type of water can include bays, inlets, the ocean, and saltwater marshes.Again, the problem comes in with different crabbing areas and different kinds of crabs. Depending on what you're trying to catch, you'll put your pot at a different place or depth. For example: a lot of people crab off piers, because crabs often pop up around underwater structures.
A good rule of thumb to remember is that crab pots generally need to be set between 20 to 150 feet (6.1 to 45.7 m) in the water, below the lowest tide line (this way the pot doesn't come out of the water when the tide goes out).

, The reason most pots are left overnight is that crabs are nocturnal and that's the time when they're wandering around and looking for food. You have to make sure that you've properly marked your pot so that you can find it again and so that no boats run into the line.You will probably want to anchor your buoy somehow, so that it stays more or less in the same place. Attach the anchor about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) beneath the buoy, which keeps the line submerged, making it less likely that it will be cut off by a boat propeller. People usually use a brick or a metal bar as an anchor.
Many of the rules dictate that the marker buoy has to be red and white in color and have your name and address and a telephone number. Only one person's name should appear on the buoy.

, Once you've left the trap out overnight, it's time to check the pot for crabs. Usually you want to pull up a trap evenly, but that is more important with crab rings, so that the crabs don't slide out.


Remove the crab from the trap. Hold the crab properly once you've gotten the trap to the water's surface. Grab the crab by the back legs so that it won't pinch you.
Place the live crabs in the container on the ice. They'll keep until you make it back to shore. It's best to eat the crabs within 24 hours.

Protect the hermit crab while it is sensitive following a molt.,
Save your crab’s old exoskeleton.,
Provide the appropriate food and water.,
Return your hermit crab to the main tank.,
Offer a variety of shells.",How to Care for Molting Hermit Crabs," Pre-molt hermit crabs consume more food and water in order to prepare for the time they will spend resting before and after their molt. In most cases, these crabs are below the substrate where they will not have access to their food and water.


The excess food and water is stored in a molting sac where it can be accessed throughout the molt.
Your crab will start consuming higher protein foods in preparation for molting as these foods offer higher energy.
Regular and salt water are both essential to the molting process. The hermit crab uses water to create a barrier between the old and new exoskeleton, so they are able to safely break free.
In addition to drinking more water, your crab may also soak in water or spill water onto the sand.;
, They may be digging to find a safe place to molt, but excessive digging can also be a sign that the temperature or humidity are off. Check these levels. If they are at the right levels, your crab is more than likely digging to find a molting place., Lethargy and lengthy periods of inactivity are normal leading up to a molt. The molting process is exhausting for your hermit crab, so he will likely rest before and after the process., Crabs undergo a number of physical changes leading up to the molt, and recognizing these can be a helpful way to predict your hermit crab’s impending molt.Your crab may switch shells before a molt. Some switch to larger shells in preparation for a growth spurt. Others will switch into a smaller shell, which will make digging to safe level of the substrate easier.
Exoskeletons may appear dull, ashy, chalky, or otherwise discolored.
Toenails and hair, called setae, may appear stubby or worn down.
Hermit crabs’ eyes may appear glassy or as if there is a film over them.
Antennae begin to move more slowly, or in a confused pattern.
If your crab has lost a limb, he may begin to regenerate limbs inside a gel-like chitin sack.
Your crab may excrete a medicinal or ammonia-like scent., As you learn the signs your crab is going to molt, it may be better to intervene early than to wait too long which could put your hermit crab in danger. If you notice your crab exhibiting one or more signs of molting, place it in an isolation tank for a few days or a week. If it doesn’t show continued signs of molting, it is safe to return it to the main tank. Otherwise, leave it safely isolated until after its molt., You can predict how often your hermit crab will molt based on the size of the crab. A chart of average molting times will help you determine when to expect a molt.


Micro or teeny hermit crabs, under .5 inches to 1 inch, can take 1 to 4 weeks to molt with only a month between.
Small hermit crabs, 1 to 1.5 inches, will take 2 to 3 weeks every 1 to 3 months to complete their molt.
Medium hermit crabs, 1.5 to 2 inches, need 3 to 6 weeks every 2 to 5 months to complete their molt.
Large hermit crabs, 2 to 2.5 inches need 4 to 8 weeks every 4 to 10 months to complete their molt.
Extra large hermit crabs, 2.5 to 3 inches, need 6 to 8 weeks every 10 to 12 months to complete their molt.
Jumbo hermit crabs, 3 inches or more, need 8 to 16 weeks every 12 to 24 months to complete their molt., Adult hermit crabs usually molt once a year between May and September, but every crab is different. Keeping a journal of each of your crabs is a great way to begin predicting when their next molt will be., Use coconut fiber, play sand, or baked beach sand to create a substrate for your crabs. Your substrate should be six inches deep or at least three times deeper than the height of your largest crab. Keep the substrate at the optimal level of moisture by adding water one cup at a time and stirring it through the sand, until you’re able to create a hole in the sand without the sides caving in., Place a heater or heating lamp on one side of the tank. This allows your hermit crabs to move to a cooler temperature if they need to. Extended period of times above or below this temperature range can be detrimental to your crab’s health, causing them to freeze to death or dry out and suffocate., This ensures the crab is moist and comfortable. Without enough humidity, your crab can suffocate, but with too much tank humidity, the crab can drown. It’s better to aim for lower humidity and provide your crab with a number of soaking pools that will allow them to add moisture whenever necessary., Before its molt, your crab needs these added nutrients. Protein gives the energy your hermit crab needs to undergo a molt. Calcium is a fundamental nutrient for growing a new exoskeleton.


Feed your crab plenty of meat and nuts for protein prior to a molt.
Shells, spinach, and shrimp all provide increased levels of calcium.
Calcium supplements can be powdered and sprinkled over food., If you have a variety of sizes of crab, you may want to provide a bigger, deeper soaking pool with rocks, nets or other objects the smaller crabs can use to climb in and out., Set up another small tank with the proper temperature and humidity, as well as food and water. This tank does not need to be very large as the crab will not stay here for long. It should contain food, water, salt water, and enough substrate for your crab to dig down to protect itself., If you do not isolate your hermit crab, it can get into fights with other crabs, the results of which may be injury or death. However, crabs molt safely in the wild with other hermit crabs nearby. If you’re unable to safely remove the crab before it begins to molt, there are a number of ways you can protect your hermit crab.


Use a 2L plastic bottle to separate your crab. The bottle can be used to create a dome over the molting crab. Remove the lid to allow airflow for your crab. Push the bottle into the substrate over your crab all the way to the bottom of the tank, if possible.
Place a divider in the tank that goes from the top all the way to the bottom, so your crabs cannot climb over or under the divider.
If you’re unable to isolate the molting crab within the shared habitat, move non-molting crabs into a separate tank to limit stress for your molting crab., This provides the level of moisture necessary to complete a safe and healthy molt. One or two sprays a day will be plenty. Don’t oversaturate the substrate, but ensure your crab stays moisturized for optimal comfort., Don’t dig up your crab, even if they’ve been underground for several weeks or a month. Make sure they’re isolated from other crabs, but don’t disturb them., Most crabs will dig into the substrate before they molt, but if a molt occurs suddenly, they may not be able to protect themselves in time. When this occurs, it’s especially important to keep them safe and separated from other crabs. Try the bottle or divider method, but it may be best to simply remove the other crabs., Crabs can take up to three months to molt. Molting times vary from crab to crab, so if your hermit crab is still molting after the expected time, leave it be. It may seem disturbing, but even if your crab has died during the molt, it’s safer to leave the deceased hermit crab for several months, than to attempt to move a crab during its molt., Your crab will be sticky and soft following a molt. Never touch or mist a newly molted hermit crab as this can cause unintentional harm., Once your crab has broken free from its exoskeleton and has become mobile again, it will eat all or part of its shed exoskeleton in order to absorb the nutrients necessary to harden the new exoskeleton., Your crab will also need a large quantity of foods high in protein and calcium supplements during this post-molt time, and you should have adequate amounts of unsalted and salt water available for your hermit crab to drink and soak in., Once your hermit crab regains its full range of movement, and appears energetic, you can move it back to the main tank. You will need to closely observe the crab for several hours after returning it to the main tank looking for signs of concern.If the other hermit crabs exhibit aggressive behavior like crawling on top of the newly molted crab, you can place all the crabs in water to remove the molting scent.Your hermit crab may rebury itself in the main tank, and emerge at night to eat and drink. This is normal. Only re-isolate your crab if the other hermit crabs are bothering the spot where it’s buried., Do not offer shells that are broken or damaged. Your crab should have lots of options to ensure its comfort and reduce the risk for aggressive behavior between crabs.


Boil shells to destroy any bacteria, prevent infection, and protect your crab.Try to provide natural shells.
Avoid painted shells as your crab may accidentally ingest the paint.
Your crab may simply go back into his old shell, and that’s okay too.
Offering choices will improve your crab’s health and wellbeing as it guarantees they will be able to find a shell that fits comfortably."

Provide space.,
Provide lots of climbing and hiding spots.

,
Provide the right environment for your fiddler crabs.,
Feeding and diet: Brackish water fiddler crabs are scavengers, eating what ever they can find.,
Adjust the temperature.,
Sexing: Male fiddlers have one large claw, females have two small equal sized claws, if you look at the pictures above, you will see that the first picture is a male fiddler and that the second picture is a female fiddler crab.

,
Breeding: In captivity, it is next to impossible to try breeding fiddler crabs in a normal setup.",How to Care for Brackish Water Fiddler Crabs (Uca Minax)," Fiddlers need room, only two can fit in a 5 gallon (18.9 L) aquarium and only four can fit in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium. So make sure you get the proper size aquarium.;
,, Brackish water fiddlers thrive in brackish water. Brackish water fiddlers will die in freshwater and saltwater in under two weeks. About 90% land is best. Avoid buying crabs that have been kept underwater. In the 10% water make sure it is just deep enough for them to soak in. Also, it is important to keep them in brackish water; you can marine salt at your local pet store, freshwater aquarium salt will not work.

, Fiddlers will eat freeze dried foods, as well as dead fish, veggies such as cucumber and green bean, and algae and meaty foods. It is recommended to feed your fiddlers a variety of foods.

, Fiddler crabs thrive in temperatures around 75-85, so heaters are recommended. You will need a filter as fiddlers can get some what messy, and an air system will be needed.

,, The zoea (zoea is the larvae stage of fiddler crabs) have a complex life. The zoea needs natural foods, natural occurring things like tidal waves and such. But if you provide the following things, you can breed them. You will need a large tank, like a 60–70 gallon (227.1–265.0 L) tank, natural foods like decayed plant matter, and plankton, and if you provide tidal waves and other natural things, and you need to mimic their natural environment, you could breed them. Fiddlers will mate in a normal setup, as long as the temperature and the environment is right. But the zoea won't survive in a normal setup.

Get the hermit crabs!",How to Care for Land Hermit Crabs," The best enclosure to use is a glass aquarium. Size is a very important factor when deciding how many hermit crabs you will keep. A good rule of thumb is: one inch per gallon. to determine how many inches your crabs are, measure across the shell opening. Remember, the habitat (or as many people call ""crabitat"" or simply ""the tat"") needs to be able to hold three dishes, climbing toys, shelters, shells and space for the crabs to walk around. You don't want the tank to be crowded, but you don't want it to be too open, either.


A ten gallon tank usually does nicely for a maximum of six small hermit crabs. You may want to consider starting off with at least a twenty gallon tank. This will ensure all the necessary space needed is fulfilled. A larger tank will allow more climbing toys and more space. You will eventually need to upgrade the tank if you start off with a ten gallon.
On the other hand, hermit crabs do not grow quickly. You can use a tank that leaks, as it will not be holding any water.;
, Hermit crabs are escape artists. If there is any possible way for the crabs to escape, they will almost always find it. Use a glass lid or screen lid with glass rested on the screen if using heat lights. This will ensure no crabs escape and that all the humidity stays in the tank.


Select a lid with air holes installed on the lid.

, Substrate, or bedding is probably one of the least provided needs a hermit crab can get. Hermit crabs require deep substrate that has to completely cover twice the height of your largest crab, preferably a few inches deeper. Medium crabs (golf ball size) need at least six inches of substrate for molting. Small crabs (quarter size) need 5 inches (12.7 cm), and tiny crabs (often called ""micros"", the size of a dime) need 4 inches (10.2 cm) of substrate. These substrate amounts are traditional molting depths.


Sand is usually the best choice, however, you can also used compressed coconut fiber commonly referred to an sold as ""Eco Earth"", ""Bed-A-Beast"" or ""Forest Bedding"".
You can also use a mixture of the two. The sand or coco fiber needs to be kept at a good moisture level. It shouldn't be dry, but it shouldn't be dripping wet. Keep the substrate at sandcastle consistency. You should be able to make a hole in it easily, but not get your fingers wet. Substrate with these characteristics will allow your crab to grow (by molting, or shedding its exoskeleton) successfully. Do not use wood chips, gravel or newspaper etc.

, Place dishes, toys, and shelters into the tank. Make sure that your shelter has a large enough opening for the crab to easily enter and exit. It's a good idea to place more than one shelter in the tank in case one crab would like to be alone. You can use coconut huts, ceramic flower pots, large shells, reptile caves, fish decor and many other things as shelters, as an option. Hermit crabs like to be hidden during the day so they will spend a great deal of time in these shelters.


Hermit crabs also love to climb! Provide climbing toys to keep the crabs and you entertained. You can use cholla wood, grapevine, fig wood, driftwood, mopani wood, bog wood, Lego structures, cork bark, fake or live plants, rocks, water stone, large coral, barnacle clusters, fish décor and much more. Providing this step is very easy and your crabs will love you for it!
When landscaping your dishes, keep one thing in mind: Leave the water dishes away from the heat source. If water is placed near the heating unit bacteria will grow and that is not good. Keep the water on the cool side of the tank. Make sure that the dishes are deep enough to submerge the crab 3/4 of its body size. The dish should be large enough so that the crabs can walk around in the dish so they can fill their shells with water. If housing small and larger crabs crabs, place rocks, sea shells, small pieces of aquatic wood, or fake plants to allow the small crabs to easily exit the dish.
Although they are social creatures, they sometimes like to be true hermits.

, Hermit crabs need two types of water. Fresh and saltwater. Hermit crabs also cannot drink tap water. This water is treated with chlorine which can cause permanent blisters on the crabs gills (yes they have gills) which will be very painful for the hermit crabs. For this reason all water (including drinking and misting water) must be unchlorinated.


Buy a small bottle of tap water conditioner in the fish section of your pet store. Follow the instructions for making a gallon of water. It's a lot easier to have a batch of water ready to use for the next few weeks or so rather than having to make a small amount every day. When choosing a conditioner, do not purchase ""Stress Coat"" as this is used strictly for bathing your crabs and keeping fish only. Look for a conditioner that removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes heavy metals. Do not get a conditioner that stimulates a slime coat, other than for baths. After that, you have a batch of freshwater.
Now simply make another batch of water and add some aquarium salt into the mix. Usually about 8-10 tablespoons of salt is enough. You may hear that only exotic species of hermit crabs need salt water, but this isn't true. All hermit crabs including the purple pincer (Coenobita clypeatus) need this. Many crabs drink saline water for hours prior to molting. And their shell water supply has a specific balance of iron. Providing salt water allows the hermit crab to choose what kind of water it would like to drink. Let the water sit overnight, so it comes to room temperature and the salt dissolves.

, Place the hermit crab food in the dish. Hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers that take advantage of any available food both in the wild and captivity. Feed your hermit crab basically anything you would eat yourself that isn't sugary, spicy, salty or preservative packed. They love grapes and blueberries, as well as most unsalted nuts. Apples are also a favorite. They enjoy many vegetables, and seafood is an absolute must in their diet. The best way to ensure they get proper nutrients is to feed a varied diet as possible.


Feed meats when given the opportunity, and you can also feed them plain cereals, rice, pasta and rolled oats. Many hermies love T-Rex brand Fruit and Flower Food. The fun thing about feeding these critters is that you can record and experiment with what they like and what they don't like.
Hermit crabs eat very little and in small amounts. To put it in perspective, most hermit crabs take a few hours to eat half a cheerio. So don't think that your hermit crabs are starving, because they aren't! Make sure to remove foods after 24 hours to prevent rapid fouling of the tank.

, Hermit crabs are tropical creatures that come from places like the Caribbean and the Florida Keys. They require temperatures between 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) and 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). Your home is most likely not warm enough to provide the heat these creatures need without an external heat source.


When using a ten gallon tank, the best way to heat the tank is with an under the tank heater (usually referred to as a UTH). These are small pads that stick to the outside glass of the enclosure and usually raise the temperature up between 4 and 6 degrees, which is perfect. Try placing the unit on the bottom of the tank. Even with the thick layer of substrate the UTH will be effective. Placing it on the side of the tank simply heats the air around the tank, and not the air in it.
You can also use heat lights, which work great on larger enclosures and can usually heat the tank to any wanted temperature. Heat lights have one major drawback: They dry out the tank very quickly. When using lights be sure to select the right wattage of light, a 40 watt will do nicely on a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank. Make sure that the heat source is placed on one side of the tank, and not in the middle. This is so the tank has a warm and cool side so they can be around whatever temperature they want as needed. Whatever heat source you use, be sure to purchase a thermometer/hydrometer to determine the ambient air temperature in the tank.

, Hermit crabs do not grow their own shell. They take them from dead gastropods like snails. In captivity, you need to ensure that there is a wide variety of shells to choose from. You can tell if a hermit crab's shell fits if it can seal the opening of the shell with its large claw and armor leg (back left).


If its legs stick out a bit and you can still see its eyes, the hermit crab will be on the market for a new shell. Simply drop the shells in the tank and the hermit crab will change when ready. Purple pincers like shells with a round opening, while Ecuadorian hermit crabs like shells with a wider opening. You can dip the shells in salt water periodically to draw the crabs attention to them if you wish.

, Take a small misting bottle and spray the substrate and the walls of the tank with conditioned water. Turn on the heat source and wait at least forty five minutes. The moist parts of the tank will evaporate with the heat source on, raising the humidity. Hermit crabs breathe through hardened gills that only function properly if the air is moist. Hermit crabs seem to enjoy a humidity range of 77% - 88%, but absolutely under no circumstances should it be below 70%.


With the sand moist and dishes full, the humidity should stay at a tolerable range. If not, you can lightly mist the tank some more. Once the temperature and humidity reach a desirable range, proceed to the final step.

, Hermit crabs are not actual hermits. They are very social creatures that like another hermit crabs to keep it company. Its best off to get around five hermit crabs so that you can witness its social behaviors. Hermit crabs of all sizes, species and gender can happily be housed together. Try to get an active crab. Any crab that has antennae that flutters at varying speeds is generally healthy. Crabs that hang loosely when held are usually near death.


A healthy hermit crab withdraws quickly when picked up. Sometimes, hermit crabs do emerge when held, with antennae fluttering. This means the hermit crab is social and healthy. Try to pick these crabs. All you have to do now is add the crabs to the tank and you're all set!

Get a large tank.,
Add some sand.,
Provide a varied environment.,
Keep it humid.,
Provide your crabs with water.,
Feed your crabs.,
Clean the tank.,
Reshape the environment.",How to Care for Ghost Crabs," The first step of providing a good environment for your ghost crabs is getting a nice and large tank for them to live in. Aim for a tank around 20 gallons (75.7 L). If you are going to get more than four ghost crabs, you should get a bigger tank.A glass aquarium is the best option for your container, but you can use a cheaper plastic container if necessary.
Whatever container you sue make sure that it is strong enough to hold wet sand, which can get heavy.It should also have a lid that fits tightly to stop the crabs getting out. It should let in air, while keeping in the moisture.;
, Once you have your container you need to get it ready for your ghost crabs. Ghost crabs live on beaches and you need to try to replicate this environment in your home “crabitat.” Start by pouring in some safe sand to use as substrate. The sand should be at least a few inches deep, and ideally you should half-fill the tank. Ghost crabs like to dig into the sand so you need to give the space to do this.You can buy “crab sand” at your local pet store, but it will generally be quite expensive.
A cheaper option is to buy clean play sand from a hardware store. As long as the sand has not been contaminated it should be fine for your crab. Check for any tears in the bag, discolouration, smells or leaks before you buy.
You can also use coconut fibre substrate, or use a combination of this with some clean play sand., After you have added the sand substrate, you need to add some extra elements to create a more stimulating and varied environment for your crabs. Place a few clean sea shells around the tank, and add in some plastic plants and bits of drift wood. Make places where they can hide, and clamber around.Provide a sloped area of sand to help with burrowing.Avoid putting in any resinous (evergreen) wood into the tank. Cedar and pine can irritate crabs., Crabs need a humid environment to live in. Buy a humidity gauge for your tank so you always know what the level of humidity is. For crabs like ghost crabs, you should generally aim for around 70% humidity. If you regularly check the gauge you can just spray in some clean untreated water to raise the humidity level.


A humid environment will help them keep their gills moist and help them breathe.Dehydration can have a serious effect on the health and vitality of your crabs., Although ghosts crab live on land, and cannot actually swim, they do need a constant supply of water. Ghost crabs have to return to water periodically to moisten their gills in order to breathe. In the wild a ghost crab would walk up to the shore line and wait till a wave ran over him, before scuttling back up the beach.You must ensure your crabs have access to water in their container at all times.You should ensure you have a dish of salt water in the tank that you change at least every two weeks.
Create salt water by mixing two and a half teaspoons of sea or aquarium salt with a gallon of water to reach a gravity reading of around 1.01-1.08.
Be sure you leave the water to sit overnight so that the chlorine and chloramines dissipate before you place it in the tank.Make sure the dish is easy for your crabs to get in and out of.
You crab can also get moisture from wet sand., Ghost crabs can be considered both scavengers and predators. They have a broad and varied diet, which includes decomposing plant and animal matter as well as mole crabs, clams and turtle hatchlings they catch on the beach.Provide a variety of vegetables, fruit, fish and meat to your crabs and see which foods they like.
Crabs really enjoy a variety of food, so try different natural foods and have not been treated with any pesticides or chemicals.Avoid too much repetition in your crab’s diet and pay attention to what food he likes the most.You can also buy prepared crab food from your pet store as a reliable and easy option.

, Ghost crabs aren’t especially messy or high-maintenance, but you will have to spend some time helping them maintain their environment. You should regularly spot clean the tank, to remove dirty sand and bits of food detritus. Use a sand sifter, fish net or kitchen strainer to scoop up some sand and sift out the dirty bits. Add in some new sand every few weeks to keep the tank clean and refreshed.Sift the sand more often the more crabs you have.
With one crab, every three weeks is fine. With four, every week. With six or more, it's good to sift every other day., It’s a good idea to spend a little bit of time reshaping the environment every few weeks to help keep your crabs stimulated. Move the toys and other objects around, alter the lay of the sand, or add a new slop or sand-hill."

Wear dark clothing.,
Choose the best time of year.,
Find the best beaches.,
Don’t poke or prod.,
Use a five-gallon bucket.",How to Catch a Ghost Crab2," Ghost crabs are constantly on the look out for predators. Make yourself invisible (like them) by wearing dark colored clothing. You’ll also want to walk softly, and stay quiet., You’ll have the most fun catching ghost crabs if you do so during their peak season. The best time of year for catching ghost crabs is during the summer, from May to early September., Ghost crabs can be found on coastal beaches around the world, for example in Costa Rica, Hawaii, and the Atlantic coast of the United States. But the best beaches within these regions to boast ghost crabs will be quiet, secluded places, without a lot people. Look for a beach that fits this bill to see the most ghost crabs., Although a pinch from a ghost crab won’t hurt you too badly, it can hurt a little bit. You can minimize your chances of being pinched by a ghost crab, if you treat him with a little respect. Never poke or prod the crab unnecessarily., Although any bucket or small container will work, using one large bucket (that you can share as a family) ensures that your crabs will not escape as you're gathering them. Of course you will release them all at the end of the night anyway, but it is fun to get a sense of how many your captured during your hunt.

Know when and where to use the trotline.,
Collect your equipment.,
Prepare the line.,
Drop the line.,
Pull up the line.,
Drop the line again and repeat the process.,
Store the equipment properly.",How to Catch a Crab2," Using a trotline can take some effort and time, but it can yield a good bounty of crabs. A trotline is basically just a line that is anchored between two buoys and set with bait. The crabs get a hold of the bait and then you draw up the line.A good time to set a trotline is a still morning after a hot, muggy night, because the crabs tend to be running. Mornings are good to remove the trotline, because the crabs are more sluggish and less likely to release the line when you draw it up.
The best places to set a trotline is parallel to the shore, where the bottom drops away. Typically this happens between 5 and 12 feet deep. Some people maintain that you should run your trotline over a shell bottom.

, Trotlining, which can yield a lot of crabs if done correctly, does require a boat. You can't set a trotline off a dock, for instance. So before you collect the rest of the equipment make sure that you have access to boat, first. You can get the different equipment online or at the marina where you'll be crabbing.You'll need to get at two buoys and 5 lines (between 20 and 100 feet): a main line, 2 lines to attach to the buoys and 2 to attach to the anchors. For the line, there are different kinds. Decide between a yellow ¼ inch poly line or a leaded line, although some people consider the 5⁄32 inch (0.4 cm) nylon to be the best material for the main line. The poly line is less expensive, thinner, and it floats. However, it can be uncomfortable to pull up and has to be weighted so that it rests beneath the surface and doesn't get tangled up with your line. The leaded line is more expensive, but are easy to pull, coil easily, and sink on their own. Make sure that the buoys are marked with your name and address. The buoys make it so that boats are less likely to cut through your line.
You'll want a main anchor (about 15 lbs) and an anchor for the down current end (about 5 lbs). This will keep the line from moving out of position and will allow you to find your line again. You'll also need 2 lengths of chain to weight down your line, unless you're using a leaded line.
The dip net helps you to collect the crabs as you draw the line out of the water. It can take a bit of practice to scoop them up and deposit them in the cooler, but the more you do it the easier it will become.
The prop stick is attached to your boat. You attach the line to the prop stick when you're running the line (pulling it out of the water). This will make the line come up more smoothly and not knock off the crabs. Along with this you'll need a gaff or hook to pull up the line from the bottom.
You'll also need snoods and clips for hooking the bait to the main line. Snoods (also called trots) are 6 inch (15.2 cm) dropper lines with attached bait that you attach to the main line with the 3 inch (7.6 cm) stainless steel mini-clips.

, Tie the bait onto the line using the snoods and the mini-clips. You'll do this every 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) on the main line. The line needs to be weighted at the bottom on both ends with chain. You can use 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) of galvanized chain. The weights will be connected to the buoys by a line, so you can draw up the line when it's time to check it.Take the 4 smaller lengths of rope (they should be about 20 feet). Attach 1 of these ropes to an anchor, attach the rope to the buoy. Take the second 20 foot (6.1 m) rope and attach it to the same buoy and attach a length of chain to the other end of it. Attach your main line to the chain. Do the same for the other side.
Salted eel is considered to be the best bait. Cut it into 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces, 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in diameter. Chicken necks or bull lips (also cut 1/2 by 3 inches) work pretty well too.

, This may sound simple, but it's difficult to focus on dropping the line and working the boat. You may need a buddy along with you to help handle the boat. You also want to make sure that you aren't dropping your line around other crabbers dropping their lines, since there is a good chance they'll get tangled up together.


Drop the first weight and buoy. As the tide and the wind carry you, unspool the line, adding snoods and bait as you go. When you get to the end of your line, place the second buoy and drop the second anchor.
Work your line with the wind and the tide, because it is difficult to run the line even without the boat being pushed all over the place. You'll want to let the boat drift as you're dropping the line, because that way it will follow the currents and you can focus on the line itself.

, Once you've finished dropping the line, take your boat back to the start and use your hook to catch and slowly bring the main line to the surface of the water. Slip the line over your roller (that is mounted to the boat). Let line rise from the water at about a 30 to 40 degree angle and keep it taut.


You'll net the crabs in the water as they come up to the surface. Be as quick as you can, because crabs tend to release the bait when they break the surface. It's often best to have 2 people, 1 to work the line and the other to net the crabs.
Try to avoid casting your shadow onto the line, as that can cause the crabs to spook and drop off the line.

, You can repeat this process several times in a morning, if you're quick about it. Once you've done the first go around, drop the line once more and make sure that you've got all the bait that you need on the line. Wait a bit once the line is set and then go through pulling it up again.

, Once you're finished trolling for crab you want to make sure that you're storing your equipment properly, otherwise you won't get as many uses out of it. Different people swear by different storage methods, including putting the trotline in the freezer, but you should ask the manufacturer of your trotline, how best to store it.


One of the main ways to store a trotline and any still-attached bait in a ""pickle,"" a strong brine solution, that will help preserve it. Make this solution with 4 lbs of salt for every 5 gallons (18.9 L). A 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket stores about 750-feet of 5/32-inch trotline. The consistency will be right when a raw potato or egg floats on the surface.
Chicken necks need to be stored in a refrigerator (preferably an old one and not the main one).

Collect your equipment.,
Tie the line down.,
Draw the line up slowly.,
Put the crab in a cooler.",How to Catch a Crab3," Handling for crab is a lot easier than the other methods in this article and there are fewer things you need. Basically, all you need is a dip net, a line or string long enough to reach the bottom of the water, and bait.You can handline from a boat or off a dock, so you'll need to consider that when you get your line.
Sometimes you have to weight the end of your line so that it sinks to the bottom.
For bait, chicken necks, eel, or fish work well. Just attach a piece to your line before you sink it.

, You'll want to tie the line down and wait a bit so that the crabs have a chance to find the bait and get attached. You'll feel when the crab has crabbed onto the bait., You don't want to spook the crab so that it lets go. The bigger the crab the more likely it will be to spook and drop off, so go carefully. When it gets near the surface, scoop it up in your net.


Pay attention to whether there is a current or tide, make sure that you place the net so that if the crab lets go it'll end up in your net and not swept away.

, Make sure that you have ice in there so that the crab gets sluggish and easier to manage. Avoid picking them up with your bare hands. Kitchen tongs or specialized crab tongs work find here.

Go to a beach.,
Find a large rock.,
Check out any tide pools.,
Pick up the crab and put it in your bucket.,
Put the crab back.",How to Catch a Crab4," Most beaches around the world have a type of beach crab that you can find along the shore. They vary in color, from the typically dark green common shore crab in England to the invasive Asian shore crab that has spread from its natural (and non-invasive) habitat in Asia to the east coast of the United States.While you can find these crabs on most beaches, the rockier ones tend to be better for finding them, as the crabs like to hide under the rocks.
Make sure you bring along a pail and small trowel or gloves. You don't really want to pick up the crabs with your bare hands, because they can pinch you, even the little crabs.

, The really small shore crabs can hide under little rocks, or burrow into the sand, but the best places to find them are under larger rocks. They like to hide under these rocks and when you turn the rock over, they tend to go scurrying into the protection of the sand.For example, the shore crabs of the Pacific Northwest, in the United States, (called Hemigrapsus nudus and H. oregonensis) can be easily found beneath rocks. They range from smaller than a fingertip to the size of a half-dollar.
You can also often find Hermit crabs on rocky shorelines. Look in tide pools and beneath rocks.

, This is where the crabs tend to collect to feed and move around. Tide pools are great places to find all kinds of marine life, including shore crabs. If you find a tide pool and you don't see anything at first, keep watching. There's always something going on a tide pool., Put a little bit of wet sand in your bucket so that the crab doesn't dry out. You can watch it burrowing around in the sand and scuttling side to side, in the manner that crabs move. This is an especially fun activity to do with children at the beach.


Handle the crabs gently, especially the small crabs. They do have hard shells, but they are still delicate to human handling.

, Don't take crabs home as pets. Most places have laws and rules against removing the wildlife, which are so important to maintaining a thriving ecosystem. The little crabs that you find on the shoreline aren't worth eating.


You should especially leave a crab alone if you see that it has eggs attached. These are the females who are waiting for their eggs to hatch and shouldn't be disturbed.

Avoid buying starter kits at pet stores, because they don't hold humidity in.;
, You can get a hiding hut. You will need at least three natural shells for each crab. Don't forget to get a food shell and water dish and a sea sponge for the dish and a water mister. You will need some type of bedding such as coconut fiber or forest bedding. Of course you could just go with plain sand.

,,

step 5 Make sure that there is always salt water in the tank,,, Hermits love to check out new shells, just for fun. And it may even accept the shell as its new one. Clean the shell well first; wash in hot water, then add to the tank. Choose one of a medium to large size.


If your crab won't accept the new shell, place the crab in an isolated container with the shell. It will accept it eventually.

You’ll also need an x-acto knife, or a wood-burning tool, and you may want to use a hot glue gun., Cut a hole in the bottom of the plastic gallon jug the same size as the cylindrical bottle. This can be accomplished by using a sharp x-acto knife or a wood-burning tool., Cut the top off the bottle using the x-acto knife or wood-burning tool. Then, using the x-acto knife or wood-burning tool, cut a circular hole in the bottom of the bottle, leaving just an 1/8” lip around the edge., Roll up your piece of sandpaper (with the smooth side out) and place into the cylinder you have created. It should stick out the bottom about 1-2 inches. You can use hot glue to secure the sandpaper, if you like., Slide the cylinder (with the sandpaper) into the plastic jug, leaving only about 3 inches sticking out. Again, you can use a bit of hot glue to seal the opening, if you’d like. Remove the cap from the jug if you haven’t already. This is your finished trap., During the day, go to a beach where ghost crabs are known to hang out and look for a hole. Look for a hole with damp, dark sand around it, as this will indicate that there is a crab inside., Slide the 3-inch cylindrical end of your trap into the crab hole and surround it with sand to secure it. Leave it overnight. In the morning, you can see if you’ve caught a crab!"

In addition to the tank where you currently keep your hermit crabs, you can set up a separate tank that is devoted to mating.The minimum tank size is ten gallons., You’ll need to recreate the natural conditions for mating, which includes a beach and sea in your ten-gallon tank. At the bottom of your tank, add two inches of sand., Since the Mother crab will need to deposit her eggs in the sea, you’ll need to recreate a little ocean in the tank. Add a saltwater container in a low area of the tank. It should contain a mix of de-chlorinated water and an aquarium salt mix.Don’t use regular table salt for the saltwater container.

, Add a heat rock to maintain a temperature of between 24 and 28 Celsius (75-82 Fahrenheit). You should also locate the tank away from direct sunlight and drafts, since you want to maintain a consistent temperature during the mating process.The water in the tank should be between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (22-26 Celsius).

, Because hermit crabs are very sensitive to humidity levels, you’ll want to maintain adequate levels of humidity throughout the breeding process. You can use a garden sprayer to mist the tank. You should also keep the sand substrate moist.Use a hygrometer to measure humidity levels.

, You’ll need to create a relaxing atmosphere to get your hermit crabs into the mating mood! For instance, you could add some nice scenery to your mating tank. Adding some branches and vines to the tank will give your crabs a place to hide and something to climb around. This touch of nature will help create the right atmosphere., You can make it easy for the hermit crabs to move back and forth between the two tanks by making a ramp. In this way, the hermit crabs can crawl between their home and mating tanks.

, In captivity, hermit crabs breed between February and August. They typically breed in June and July, so try breeding your hermit crabs in the spring or summer., Look in your main hermit crab tank or “crabitat” for a mature female, which should be medium sized. Wait until the hermit crab comes most of the way out of her shell before checking to see if you have the right sex. Inspect her body for genitalia called gonophores, which are located close to the abdomen on the back of her legs. You should see two tiny holes.If you can’t see the two tiny holes, it is a male.

, Pick a mature male crab from your main tank. You’ll need to wait for one of them to crawl out of its shell. At this time, you can inspect its body for genitalia called gonophores. If you can’t see two tiny holes at the back of the body, you have a male., Put the two crabs in your newly created enclosure. If they don't mate, try a different combination of crabs.Be aware that it is very uncommon for breeding in captivity to actually happen, so don't be discouraged if nothing happens.

, It takes one month for the hermit crab eggs to hatch. Let the mother put the eggs in the saltwater container. The eggs should hatch when they touch the water., Place the larvae in aerated cups. Put some small shells in the cups, which the larvae can use. Put the cups into a sand substrate. Feed the larvae brine shrimp and spirulina.You can feed them three drops of live plankton per day.

, Your transition tank should be half beach and half marine water. Put in a couple of containers with salt and fresh water. Put a coconut in the tank, as well as some nice shells. Make sure the young hermit crabs have a ramp going from the sand to the water containers.Young hermit crabs like to eat their siblings.
Use regular marine salt water for the transition tank. You can purchase it at most pet stores.

, You can give them marine copepods, which are available at the pet store. You could also give them frozen krill, marine crayfish or shrimp granules and a couple drops of live plankton.For fourteen days, try feeding them a mixture of brine shrimp, marine infusoria, and powdered spirulina.

Provide your hermit crabs with a hiding place.,

Provide your hermies with water.,
Make sure the water is dechlorinated.",How to Care for Hermit Crabs1," A ten or twenty gallon tank is good for two to four small hermits. A twenty to forty gallon tank is good for a dozen small or three to four large hermits. Hermit crabs are social animals and should have at least two other crabs with them. The proper home for your crabs should be one that holds in humidity, but still lets in fresh air. A fish tank or reptile aquarium usually does nicely. You can even rinse out that old leaking tank from the attic and use it! Acrylic terrariums tend to work better, as they hold the humidity and heat more efficiently.;
, You should buy a hygrometer (humidity gauge). These will help you to monitor and maintain a 75-85% relative humidity. Hermit crabs breathe through (hardened) gills, and can't breathe properly unless the air is humid enough. The ideal range is at least 75% relative humidity. Humidity lower than 70% will cause suffocation, which kills slowly over several weeks or months and is extremely painful.


A great way to increase your tank’s humidity naturally is to add natural moss to your tank. It increases the humidity, and hermit crabs eat it. Look for moss like Fluker’s Reptile Moss at your local pet store. Sponges also work well, and can also be found at a pet store. But sponges get dirty easily and need to be changed out every two to three weeks.

, Hermit crabs are tropical animals and do best in warm temperatures. 75-85°F is the proper temperature range. Heat damage is irreversible, and temperatures that are too low slow down a crab's metabolism. An under-tank heater designed for hermit crabs, mounted on the back of the tank is a good way to keep your tank humid. An improper environment can cause your crab to become lethargic and inactive, lose limbs and could potentially cause death. Buy a thermometer to keep an eye on the tank's temperature.

, Substrate is the layer of material you place on the floor of the tank. Sugar-sized arrogate sand is the only sand you should use because other grades could cut the crab, and play sand may have harmful fills. Use dechlorinated salt water to wet the sand to a ""sand-castle"" consistency. You also can use compressed coconut fiber (Sold as Eco-Earth or Jungle Bedding). Expand the coco-fiber in the same salt water you would give your crabs to prevent mold/mildew. Substrates that crabs can not dig in, such as aquarium gravel (can not hold caves) or calcium sand (clumps and can have a foul odor) are not acceptable as a substrate. Your substrate should be at least 3-5 times the height of your largest crab, and should be a material the crabs can easily dig and build caves in to relieve stress, hide, and molt.


Many crabs also like to bury and even molt in damp moss such as Fluker's Reptile Moss (not decorative or Spanish moss!)

, Dirty substrate can lead to mold which can be harmful to your hermit crabs. Change it every 6 months. However, every month you should do a brief check to see if there is any mold growing, or an ant or mite infestation. If you see either of these things, change the substrate immediately. It's a good idea to ""spot clean"" any dung and food the crabs have dragged from the food bowl or buried. You should only clean the substrate when your hermit crab is not molting (a crab who has burrowed underground and is going through a process to shed and regrow it's exoskeleton). Never move a molting crab.


If you want to go the extra mile, you can sterilize your sand substrate. Sand can be sterilized in the oven. Put the sand in a large roasting pan (one used only for this purpose!) and place it in the oven. Set the temperature to 250 degrees (F), (120 degrees Celsius) and let it be for about 2 hours.
Once every two to three weeks, boil all the shells and dishes in your tank in a pan of dechlorinated salt water. Doing this will insure that that mold and bacteria will not grow and harm your crab. Allow the bowls and shells to cool before placing them back in the ""crabitat"".

, Hermit crabs love to climb! In fact, in the wild, they will climb large rocks exposed by low tide to search for food. choya logs or stumps are great for this. Choya is not toxic, and has holes in it for them to grab on to. You can lean it in a corner of your tank, just don't place it too high or your crabs will climb out. Lego's and hemp nets work well too. Hermit crabs are sometimes called ""tree crabs"" because they will climb trees to eat insects and vegetation. Do not, however, buy painted toys, as paint could be harmful to crabs if it is ingested.


Natural toys: Natural rocks and seashells that you pick up at the beach are great things to scatter around the ""crabitat."" Clam shells even make great food dishes. Just make sure to boil them in boiling water so that they become sterilized before you place them in the tank.
Plastic toys: Plastic plants made for reptiles are great for crabs to climb and hide in, just remember to use the lid of your tank so the crabs can't climb out. Make sure they aren't eating the plastic, and remove it right away if they are!
Never use reptile ""half pine logs"", as pine is an irritant to the crabs and can be toxic.

, Hermit crabs, like most animals, want a place to feel secure and hide when they feel threatened. You can use a half coconut shell that they sell at pet stores for small crabs, or use broken pots, large shells, etc. Just make sure that the crab won't get stuck and, preferably, is able to dig out if it does.

, Live plants can be a great addition to any tank. In particular, plants like bamboo (make sure it's real bamboo and not Dracaena Sanderiana, which is sold as ""lucky bamboo""), Venus fly traps bromeliads (air plants) and spider plants are among the safe plants. Be forewarned--your hermit crabs may snack on them, so there's no guarantee the plants will have time to grow

, All species of hermit crab need to have access to both freshwater and saltwater. You will need to provide two water dishes for the crabs. Hermit crabs need to balance the salinity of the water in their shells; the dishes should be at least deep enough that your crab can get water in its shell (C. Perlatus, A.K.A. Strawberry hermit crabs, need to be able to submerge themselves), but make sure they are able to get out. A good way to do this is to provide them with a sloping water area, where one part is shallow and easy to climb out of, while the other is deep and they can submerge themselves in the water. Line the area with rocks or something they can grip on. Plastic is too slippery and they will have trouble climbing the slope.


If you have large and small crabs together, you can put small rocks or a small natural sponge in the water dishes so that it is deep enough so large crabs can let water in its shell, but small crabs will not become trapped in the water dish and drown.
You can buy aquarium salt for marine fish (not freshwater fish) from most pet stores and a little goes a long way. Never use salt intended for human consumption because the anti-caking agents can be harmful. Most hermit crab brand salts are also table salts. Pre-mixed ""hermit crab water"" does not have the correct salinity. Use a brand like Instant Ocean, Oceanic, etc.

, The chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals in most tap water can kill hermit crabs by causing the gills to blister (causing eventual suffocation). Aging the water will remove the chlorine, but not the chloramines, so dechlorinator is a must if you use tap water. Zoomed water conditioner is a good brand to use.


If you don't want to dechlorinate tap water, you can use spring water instead. However, make sure nothing has been added to the water. For example, Dasani water contains magnesium sulfate ""for taste"", and that is bad for the crabs.

Obtain an aquarium tank.,
Make the tank a crabitat.,
Divide your tank in half between land and water.The easiest way is to dump substrate into one end of the tank and water into the other end, mimicking the natural blending of bodies of water into the littoral (shoreline).,
Place some plastic plants, nooks and toys in the tank.,
Feed and water your crabs.,
Keep the tank warm.,
Don’t worry about fiddler fights.,
Maintain the environment properly.",How to Care for a Crab1," Six crabs can live comfortably in a 3-5 gallon tank.Ensure the tank has a screen at the top to allow the passage of fresh air. If buying your tank secondhand, give it a good rinse and scrubbing with soap, and let it dry before placing your crabs in it.;
, Install substrate. Fiddler crabs do well in 4-5 centimeters of sand (though you could add up to 6-8 inches).Add slightly brackish water to the crabitat either in a small bowl pushed down deep into the substrate, or poured directly into one end of the crabitat so that the substrate slopes down into the water at that end.


Slightly brackish water should be made using special aquarium salt, rock salt, or another noniodized salt.Do not use regular table salt, as it contains iodine, which the crabs don’t like. Mix the brackish water to a salinity of about 30 parts per thousand. Follow the salt’s directions to obtain the desired concentration.

, Some owners prefer to divide the tank differently, favoring 2/3 land and 1/3 water., Use driftwood and a few rocks to create a natural look and feel. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to 1.5 liters of conditioned, dechlorinated water and fill a bowl halfway up with the mixture. Place the bowl with this brackish water in the substrate so that its rim is on the same level as the surface layer of substrate which the crabs walk on.Never use live plants; the crabs will damage them and they might act as vectors for various bugs and mites.

, Fiddler crabs like dried plankton or brine shrimp. Place some into the tank and close the lid. Fiddlers might also enjoy small bits of fruit or veggies if chopped finely.Other foods they enjoy include blanched zucchini, blanched peas, raw or boiled fish, algae wafers, sinking pellets, dried bloodworms, commercial crab food, and krill. Most of these are available at your local pet store.Feed fiddlers sparingly so as not to pollute their water.If you see food has been eaten, add more to the crabitat; if you see food uneaten in the tank after several hours have elapsed, wait before feeding again.

, Fiddler crabs prefer a temperature of 68 to 77 °F (20 to 25 °C).Don’t place your tank near open windows, doors, or air ducts which might disrupt the tank’s microclimate. Conversely, don’t place the tank in direct sunlight or too close to a radiator which might fry your crab right in its shell.

, Males fight to attract females, achieve social dominance, and establish boundaries. If you see crabs pushing or wrestling each other, don’t fret. While these conflicts might be aggressive, they are generally not serious.The only thing that will be hurt is the losing crab’s ego.


The only time for real worry is when a crab is being harassed right after it has molted. At this time, the crab will be fragile for several days. Remove the aggressor if you notice repeated violence against the freshly-molted crab.Crabs have amazing healing properties. Missing claws and legs will eventually regenerate after several successive moltings., Water should be changed partially (or entirely) one to two times each month. Make sure that the water you add maintains the salinity at the proper level. Crabs exposed to pure fresh water without salt will, over a long period, die. If the water is cold to the touch, consider adding a basking bulb (in a small tank) or a submersible heater (in a larger tank)."

Be aware that hermit crabs may pinch.",How to Care for Hermit Crabs2," There are six types of hermit crabs available for sale in the United States. All of them are in the genus Coenobita.


The most common type out there is the Caribbean (Coenobita clypeatus,) which is also called ""PP"" for purple pincher due to, you guessed it, its large purple pincher. Wild Purple Pinchers are found in the Caribbean Islands. Most likely, when you see a hermit crab in a store, you will be seeing one of these guys. The Purple Pincher is the best one to start with because the others are more delicate and require much more detailed and intense care. The other types are Rugosus ""Rug"" or ""Ruggy"" (rugosus), Strawberry (perlatus), Ecuadorian or ""E"" (compressus), Cavipe or ""Cav"" (cavipes), Komurasaki ""Viola"" (violascens), Indonesian or ""Indo"" (brevimanus).

, Be patient with them when you first get your hermies--they will take a little time to adjust to their new home. When you get your hermit crabs, leave them in the cage for a few days. When you see that they don't hunch into their shell when you pass by then wait another day and try to hold your hermit crab. Let your hermit crab explore your hand and get used to you.


Once you get them home, they go through a ""De-stressing"" period that can take as little as a few days and as long as two months. During this time, change out their food and water regularly and do not disturb them. Sometimes, even with the best efforts of even the most experienced crabber, hermit crabs can succumb to Post Purchase Stress (P.P.S.), and die.

, If your crab digs under the substrate for a couple of weeks, don't worry. As long as it doesn't stink like dead fish, he's OK. Please do not disturb your crab during this time. He will need to be alone and if he is bothered, the stress could kill him. Once in a while, a crab's exoskeleton gets a little tight, and like a snake shedding its skin, a crab will shed its exoskeleton and grow a little bit. Don't take the exoskeleton away from the crab! He will need to eat it in order to harden his new exoskeleton.


If you have a sick crab, don't panic. Keep an isolation tank in a closet with enough substrate to dig under completely and ample food and water. If a crab is acting sick, he may be about to molt. This tank should also be kept with proper humidity and temperature as was mentioned previously.

, When hermit crabs grow, they need bigger shells. It is important to keep plenty of extra hermit crab shells similar to your crabs' sizes in the tank at all times. Once a month or so, rotate a few undisturbed shells out with different styles of shells.


Purple Pincher Hermit Crabs prefer the shells with round, circular openings. They will choose circular openings over the oval openings. Ecuadorian Hermit Crabs will prefer an oval opening, because they have flatter abdomens.
Never buy painted shells! Although companies may claim the paint is safe, the paint can chip off, and if the crabs eat it, it can be toxic. Most hermit crabs, when presented with a choice, will pick a ""natural"" shell over a painted one, even if it's not the right size. See the Warnings for information on what kinds of shells to avoid.

, Hermit crabs are scavengers by nature and will eat almost anything. Beware of commercial food, as it has many preservatives, such as copper sulfate, that may harm your little hermit. Don't feed them anything spicy, hot, or with preservatives in it.


Hermit crabs love silver sides and shrimp that are fresh, freeze-dried krill, blood worms, etc., and other seafood. You can normally buy these fishy foods at your local grocery store.
If you cook, set aside a piece of steak or chicken, non-marinated to grill lightly for the crabs. They also eat raw meat.
If you have more than twenty crabs or so, try getting a fish head from a local fish market. They are usually happy to give them away. You can put all of your crabs in a large tank or a large clean Rubbermaid storage container, (clear, no lid, or lid with VERY large holes cut in it) drop in the fish head, and a water-bowl, and leave them in there to eat for a few hours. You will mostly likely not want to do this very often, since the stench is pretty bad, but your crabs will love you for it!

, Aside from eating meat, hermit crabs also love different fruits and vegetables, among other scraps (they are scavengers after all.) Remember to change their food almost every day or night. Hermit crabs love to bury their uneaten food, and this can cause molding and is messy.


Hermit crabs love fresh fruit like pineapple, apple, pears, grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon, mango, papaya, strawberries, bananas, etc. Wash your fruit thoroughly before you cut it, to avoid pesticides.
Crabs will go crazy for coconut shavings.
Hermit crabs will also eat natural peanut butter on whole wheat toast, hard boiled eggs, egg shells (boiled), popcorn (plain, unsalted and unbuttered).
Avoid anything from the Allium species of plants (onion, garlic, etc.).

, Some Hermit crabs love attention. When they are awake, carefully take them out of their crabitat. What do they like to do? Climb! Let them climb all over your shirt while you are watching TV or exercise them as they walk across both your hands (like a crab treadmill). It is important that they never fall, and are not out too long because they need humidity. Falling from a height of 3 feet (0.9 m). can be fatal for them, and fear of falling is the number one reason crabs pinch. Keep them in a position where they aren't going to fall and they likely won't pinch.


Remember that they need humidity. Typical house humidity is only 40% and even less with AC and heat. When a crab's gills are exposed to low humidity it feels similar to how we feel when we hold our breath for too long.

, While they generally pinch only when they are afraid or feel cornered, they may pinch for no reason, so be prepared. Misting or running tap water on crabs to get them to release their grasp can hurt them and will likely result in them holding on longer and tighter. Please be very careful when handling them. You can avoid being pinched by holding your hand flat and tight so that the hermit crab will not have (as much) skin to pinch.

Provide an adequate substrate.,
Heat your tank adequately.,
Make your hermies feel at home.,
Give your hermit crab some friends.,
Make shell options available.,
Provide food.,
Provide water.,
Minimize pests.",How to Care for a Crab2," A terrarium or aquarium with a strong lid is the ideal container for your pet hermit crab. Allocate 2.5 gallons of space per crab. So if you have three hermit crabs, you’ll want a tank which is at least 7.5 gallons in size, and will probably want to spring for a ten-gallon tank.


Decorate your “crabitat” with plastic plants, driftwood, and climbing accessories which the crabs can clamber over and hide beneath.

, Substrates which are easy to clean like sand, crushed coral, or coconut fiber are good choices.Hermit crabs also thrive in a sand/earth mix.The depth of the substrate should be about 2-3 inches deep so that the crabs can dig just as they would in the wild.

, “Hermies” need to be at about 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). Install a nocturnal heat lamp or an under-tank heater to ensure your crabbies don’t freeze. If using the heater, provide at least one inch of substrate so they don’t get too toasty. Mist the terrarium occasionally with a fine spray of dechlorinated, distilled water, or install a terrarium humidifier set to 50-80% humidity.You can use a hygrometer to monitor humidity levels.


Check the temperature and humidity levels each day.
Substrate should be at least two to three inches deep and may be of gravel or fine reptile bark bedding, which better maintains the appropriate humidity levels.

, Obtain an aquarium salt mix and combine it with dechlorinated water. Get a small bowl with a lip which angles out and fill it with the water mixture. Place it in the substrate so that the lip is even with the top of the substrate upon which the crabs walk. This will mimic the shoreline around which crabs live in the wild., Hermies are social creatures and like living with others of their own kind. When your hermie is with another, you might observe them crawling about together and interacting. Hermit crabs cannot mate in captivity so don’t worry about trying to separate the sexes.Hermies may croak or chirp when squabbling with another crab. The sound is natural, so don’t worry.

, In the wild, hermit crabs use snail shells for protection. In captivity, though, hermit crabs will need a shell provided. Crabs do not have a regular biological schedule with which you can determine how often they’ll change their shells.Some might change shells several times a week, others might change a few times a month. No matter what, though, ensure you have shells of different sizes available for the crab to choose from.


A shell’s opening should be about 1/8 inch larger around than the width of the crab’s large claw.
Boil all shells before introducing them to the crabitat. This will wash off any lingering odor which the crab finds unpleasant.

, Hermit crabs are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of things. They like fruits, veggies, leaves, and insects. Their diet should chiefly consist of commercially available pet crab food. Crab food offers a nutritious blend of vitamin enriched bits to keep your crabs healthy.You can, occasionally, give treats to your crab like raisins, honey, and peanut butter.


In order to prevent the crabs from burying their food in the substrate, offer fresh food in a separate container outside of tank. When you want to give the crabs something fresh, remove them to a separate space -- another tank, or a small cardboard box with a towel on the bottom -- and let them eat. This will ensure their tank remains clean.Crabs can go many days without eating. While molting, crabs may not eat for a month.If you see your molting crab not eating, don’t worry.

, Give your crabs fresh, chlorine-free, distilled water each day in a small bowl with an outwardly-angled lip. Place the bowl deep down in the substrate so that the top edge of the bowl and the top layer of the substrate (upon which the crabs walk) are even.

, If you see small bugs crawling on your crab’s back, or gnats flying about within the tank, your crab has developed an infestation of pests. To solve this, remove all your crabs to another temporary tank or safe location like a soft towel in your tub or in a cardboard box, then dump all your old substrate out. Rinse and scrub the tank vigorously with water, paying attention to the corners where mites and gnats like to hide. After it dries, use the vacuum cleaner hose to suck any dirt and gunk out of the tank which might remain.Next, sterilize all the tank decor and extra shells by boiling them for about five minutes in water. If you have wood or rocks, sterilize them by putting them in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Be sure to watch the wood carefully to ensure it doesn’t catch fire. Install new substrate, replace the crab toys, and put the crabs back in the tank.
Instead of throwing out and buying new substrate, you could remove all substrate and bake it in a baking sheet at 300 °F (149 °C) for 30 minutes.
Prevent future mite outbreaks by removing uneaten food scraps and don’t introduce live plants into the crabitat, since they may act as a vector for mites and bugs to enter.
Don’t buy crabs from beachside stands or mall kiosks. Crabs at these places are likely not being cared for properly, and are often left exposed to direct sunlight, heat, and cold, and live in crowded conditions where mites and bugs thrive."

Provide a comfortable environment.,
Provide water for your crabs.,
Feed your crabs.,
Give your crab some friends.",How to Care for a Crab3," The Halloween or rainbow land crab’s ideal temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. An aquarium tank between 15 and 20 gallons in size is adequate for either species.Use heating pads beneath the tank to maintain the temperature, and ensure the substrate provides adequate insulation against direct heat.The substrate should be of aquarium or reptile sand three to four inches deep.

, Rainbow land and Halloween crabs are freshwater crabs, and don’t require saltwater. Ensure the water is dechlorinated; spring water is an ideal choice. After covering 2/3 of the tank with substrate, pour water into the remaining 1/3 of the tank. Form a dam where the water meets the land with a long piece or pieces of driftwood. This will help the substrate retain its shape and not collapse on crabs’ burrows.Besides driftwood, give your crabs plastic plants, castles, and other climbable aquarium objects to explore.

, Rainbow land and Halloween crabs have diets almost identical to those of the hermit crab. You can feed them fish food, raw fish, and miscellaneous fruits and veggies like apples and potatoes.Ensure your crabs get enough calcium. Cuttlefish bone can be nibbled on for extra calcium, and commercially available calcium supplements can be sprinkled on fresh foods before you serve them to your crabs., Land crabs are best in pairs rather than large colonies like some other species of crab.Too many crabs can lead to fighting. The more crabs you have in the crabitat, the larger it needs to be. For instance, if your tank was five gallons and housed two crabs, you'll need to upgrade to a ten-gallon tank if you want to bring the total number of crabs in your family up to four.

Address possible causes of your dog's unhappiness.",How to Check if Your Dog Is Healthy and Happy1," Make yourself familiar with how far the dog likes to walk, how it reacts when you come in from work, how sweet-tempered or grumpy it is, how much water it drinks, what its stool looks like, how often it moves its bowel a day, what the inside of its ears look like, and what its breath smells like.


For example some dogs are greedy eaters whilst others are finicky. If your dog is usually a greedy eater, it's significant if the dog refuses its food. However, if you own a lapdog that turns its nose up at anything but best steak, then refusing a bowl of food it less of a worry.
If you know all of these things like the back of your hand, you are ideally placed to spot changes that could indicate the dog is unwell.;
, The trick as an owner is to recognize these emotions. Most commonly, the first sign to be aware of is a change in behavior or body language.


For example, be suspicious when the outgoing dog who is always at the door to greet you becomes withdrawn and does not get out of its bed when you return home.
Pay attention to your dog's usual body language. Is it holding its ears or tail lower than normal or is it shying away or taking a dominant stance when approached? These are body language signs that there could be something wrong.A hint that your dog is bored or frustrated includes destructive behavior, digging, whining, barking, and crying. In this case the dog is adopting a displacement activity, such as chewing the furniture, as an outlet for his frustration.

, Many dogs are capable of expressing emotions, such as depression, on their faces. If your dog doesn't usually have doleful looking eyes or sad expressions, but suddenly does, then it is probably an expression of the dog's current emotions., Physical changes could be symptomatic of mental stress or depression. For instance, pay attention if your dog stops grooming itself. Depressed or sick animals often stop taking care of themselves and their coat condition drops, becoming harsh, stray, and unkempt.

, If your dog is sad or misbehaving, you should try to find the cause of the distress and then attempt to change the situation, if you can. Not all problems can be fixed, obviously, but some can!


If your dog is stressed out about a new routine or home, for instance, that cannot always be changed but you can comfort your dog and try to make transitions as easy as possible.

Consider a fluff dryer.,
Consider a force dryer.,
Consider a cage or cabinet dryer.,
Look for a strong CFM rating.,
Comparison shop for brands.,
Think about buying a warranty.",How to Blow Dry a Dog1," This type of dryer sits on a stand and can be used for hands-free drying. You can hook up attachments to the base and these will allow you to target the airflow to certain areas of your dog. They also use adjustable heat, which you can change via a knob on the dryer base. This is a good choice if you want to move quickly through the drying process while being cautious of your dog’s face and other sensitive areas., This is a dryer that uses sheer force to remove water from your dog’s coat. Placing the nozzle close to your dog’s skin will allow the air to push the water off and away. These dryers sound like a lot to handle but they do not use a heating element, which takes some of the challenge away. This is a good choice if you want the quickest option without the risk of burning.You can dry your dog in only a few minutes with this model as compared to hour plus with a human-hair dryer. However, be prepared to get wet as the water removed tends to go everywhere.
This is an ideal dryer to use if you plan to cut your dog’s hair afterwards. The force of the air removes kinks from a coat, leaving it straight and ready to cut. Excess shedding hair is also blown away.

, This type of dryer pushes a low airflow stream into an animal’s cage. It has variable heat and speed settings, although the highest airflow setting is still quite a bit less than a force dyer. This is a good idea if your dog is a bit skittish or nervous during the grooming process. It is also a less stressful way to dry off dogs with a medical condition.As the airflow is rather minimal this approach works best with dogs that have short or medium length coats. Make sure to check on the drying process every few minutes to make sure that your dog is comfortable.
Very old and very young dogs also respond well to this drying approach. You can also try a mixed method by using a force dryer for your dog’s body and then finishing the process (drying off the facial area) with a cage dryer., The CFM rating tells you the number of cubic feet of air that the dryer will push out per minute. The CFM can be found on the outside of the dryer box or in the online listing materials. You’ll want a high CFW especially if you plan on grooming a dog with a thicker or longer coat., There are many dryer options available for both professional and home users. Go online to grooming websites and read reviews and examine rankings. Look for those models that test high in both usability and durability. In many cases you can find a solid dryer for less than $100. You can always use a ‘human’ hair dryer on your dog. However, be aware that the process will take longer and you run a higher risk of exposing your dog to heat and causing burns. Just be very careful if you decide to go that route and keep the nozzle of the dryer at least a few inches from the dog’s skin.

, Drying a dog can sometimes be a bit chaotic, especially early on. Getting a warranty can protect you in the event that you accidently drop the main dryer or if your dog chews on the dryer hose. Balance out risk versus reward when making your decision."

Feed your dog a high quality diet.,
Add olive oil or flaxseed oil to your dog's food.,
Give your dog occasional ""human food"" snacks.,
Give your dog access to clean, fresh water.",How to Reduce Excessive Shedding in Dogs1," One of the best ways to reduce excessive shedding in dogs is to start with a healthy diet. Cheap dog food is made mostly of fillers that dogs have difficulty digesting, such as corn and grains. Look instead for a dog food that lists meat as the main ingredient.Better quality foods cost a bit more upfront, but they're better for your dog for a variety of reasons. The nutrients in meat-rich dog foods are more easily digested and absorbed, so they promote better pup health overall and help control shedding and dry skin.Keep in mind that better nutrition can help reduce shedding, but it won't eliminate shedding completely.


Dogs with food allergies or sensitivities are particularly prone to diet-related shedding. You may need to experiment with a few different foods before you find one that's right for your dog; consult your veterinarian for advice and recommendations.Do not feed your dog additional vitamin supplements unless recommended by your vet. ""Hypervitaminosis,"" or vitamin poisoning due to excess consumption, can result in serious health issues for your dog.;
, One teaspoon (5 mL) per 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of body weight is a good place to start.These oils contain omega-3 fatty acids that help calm inflamed skin, decrease dandruff, and improve overall coat texture.


Many pet stores also sell omega-3 dietary supplements in capsule or powder form. Check with your vet to find the best choice for your dog.
You can also increase your dog's omega-3 fatty acid intake by feeding it salmon, tuna, or other fish rich in these fatty acids.Fish skins are also good, but never give your dog fish bones, as these can splinter and form a choking hazard., Sliced apples (without seeds, which contain traces of cyanide that can build up in your dog's system), bananas, and cucumbers, as well as cooked lean meats (no bones) are all moisture-rich foods that help your dog stay hydrated. They also contain healthy nutrients that help your dog's coat stay smooth and shiny and help reduce shedding. Remember, though, that only 5-10% of your dog's daily food intake should be treats of any kind -- the rest should be a high-quality dog food.Many human foods are acceptable, even healthy, for dogs. Nevertheless, there are some foods you should never give your dog. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a complete list, which includes such foods as avocado, chocolate, grapes, milk products, onions, and -- surprisingly, perhaps -- raw meat., Dehydration can lead to dry skin, which can cause excessive shedding and even illness. Make sure your dog always has access to as much clean, fresh water as it wants to drink.You can also up the water intake for your dog by incorporating moist foods into its diet. Wet dog food contains up to 78% moisture, compared to 10% for dry food, and can be a good way to make sure your dog stays hydrated."

Gain experience.,
Enroll in a dog grooming school.,
Practice with different breeds.,
Get licensed.,
Decide where you want to practice.",How to Become a Pet Groomer1," If you have never groomed a dog before, you will need to learn the basics and practice.


Consider an apprenticeship. The best way to get hands-on-training, if you are not enrolled in a school program, is to apprentice with an established groomer.
If you are in the United States, consider taking the National Dog Groomer’s Association of America exam. This certification program will allow you to be recognized as a “National Certified Master Groomer”. This is very attractive to see when employers look at your experience.;
, A variety of grooming schools exist that offer certification and hands-on training.


There are dedicated dog grooming programs that are offered through larger organizations, like through the Animal Behavior College.You can also enroll in pet grooming programs that are offered through organizations that are dedicated to pet cosmetology, like the International Society of Canine Cosmetologists.Your local community college may offer pet grooming courses.
Some salons and groomers will offer on the job training for entry-level groomers and new hires.

, Different dog breeds have very different coat types and grooming needs. Getting experience with a large variety of breeds is an important learning experience as you become a dog groomer.Some breeds, especially those with longer hair, like Maltese, Spaniels, and Malamutes, require more intensive grooming.The majority of pets that will come in to be groomed will be dogs, but you may have to groom cats and small pets like chinchillas or guinea pigs.

, You may or may not need to receive specific pet grooming certification or licensing to operate in your area. This is going to be unique to your location.


Some states require you to receive a license to administer flea and tick medications. Check with your state to see if this is the case.
Your area may require you to receive official dog grooming licensing through a certification program. If your area does not require you to this, it may still be a good idea to go through this program as a way to build your credibility with clients.There is no standard education requirement or formal certification requirement to be a dog groomer. Most groomers have a high school degree and have completed some sort of training, whether that is through an apprenticeship, an online program, or an in-person program.

, After you’ve trained to become a pet groomer, you now have options as to where you want your career to begin.


Decide whether you will operate the business as the sole groomer or if you want to run a salon with other groomers.You could also work for a large pet store that offers grooming.
You can work at a vet clinic or a doggie day care as a grooming specialist.
You could offer mobile pet grooming.

"
Begin with gentle petting.,
Massage the dog's neck.,
Move down to the shoulders.,
Next do the legs and the chest.,
Massage your dog's back.,
Finish with the back legs.,
Massage at a peaceful time of day.,
Work your way up to a five or ten minute massage.,
Stop if your dog doesn't like it.,
Consider grooming your dog as part of your massage session.,
Help ease your dog's arthritis pain.,
Feel for lumps and areas that are inflamed.,
Leave deep tissue massage to a professional.",How to Massage a Dog," Pet your dog in the spots you know he likes best. This will help him settle down and get relaxed enough to enjoy the massage. Pet him on the head, tummy, back, and other spots using gentle strokes.


Let your dog sit, lie or stand in a comfortable position.
Have a calm, relaxed demeanor and speak to your dog in soft tones to help him destress.;
, Use the tips of your fingers to make a circular motion just below the head. Apply gentle pressure, but not so much you make your dog uncomfortable.


If you have a small dog, use smaller motions. For a larger dog, use larger motions.
Don't press your dog's body so hard that he flinches. Remember, you're not trying to do a deep tissue massage. You just want to rub his body to help him feel calm and bond with him.

, Slowly work your way down the neck and to in between his shoulders. This is usually the dog's favorite spot, because it is one of the only places he can't reach himself, so spend extra time there.

, Some dogs don't like being touched on the legs; if your dog flinches, remove your hands and move to the next part of the body. If he likes it, see if he wants a paw massage, too.

, Work your way back up to between the shoulders and slowly travel down the back. Use small circular motions with your fingers on either side of the spine.

, Continue massaging until you end up at the base of the tail. Gently massage down the dog's back legs. Continue to the paws if your dog enjoys having his feet picked up.

, Do it during a time when you and your dog are already in a relaxed state of mind, like at the end of the day after dinner. This will make it easier for your dog to relax under your touch.


Don't massage your dog when he's worked up for some reason or another; it's better to wait until he's already pretty calm.
Don't massage right after an exercise session; give him a half hour or so to rest first.
Don't massage your dog if he's not feeling well; simple petting will do, but he might not be up for getting massaged.

, Your dog may not like the massage at first, and it could just be that he's not used to it. See if your dog likes being massaged for about a minute, then work your way up to longer massages. As long as your dog enjoys it, there's no limit to how long you can massage him, but five or ten will give you enough time to massage his whole body thoroughly.

, The point of a massage is to help your dog feel happy and relaxed, so don't do it if he doesn't like it. If he's happy being massaged, he'll stretch out and breathe easily. If he's not, he may exhibit the following behavior:Stiffening when you move from simple petting to massage
Flinching
Growling
Biting at your hand
Running away

, Since your dog is already calm and relaxed, it might be a good time to groom him as well. Only do this if your dog actually enjoys the process of being groomed. Otherwise, he'll come to associate massage time with discomfort and anxiety.Brush your dog's fur from head to tail
Trim his nails if they're getting long
Trim hair that's getting long around the dog's face, legs or tail

, If your dog is on the older side and suffers from arthritis, massage can help. Very gently massage around the area that's affected, using a kneading motion to help relieve the pain. Do not press too hard, and do not massage directly over the affected area.


You can also gently bend and stretch your dog's legs to help ease the pain.
Some dogs enjoy this, while others do not. If your dog flinches, don't continue massaging. Forcing it could cause your dog to feel worse instead of better.

, Massaging your dog regularly is a great way to examine his body for sore spots that might need attention from a vet. Take note of lumps or bruised areas that you haven't noticed before. Pay special attention if your dog yelps when you touch him in a certain spot. If you notice something alarming, take your dog to the vet to have it checked out.


The best way to feel for lumps is to run your hands over your dog's body in a smooth, long stroke. Feel the stomach, legs, chest, and back. Make sure you don't miss any spots.

, If you think your dog could benefit from a good deep tissue massage, make an appointment with the vet. Deep tissue massage can be beneficial for animals, but if you're not intimately familiar with dog anatomy you could actually end up injuring your pet.

Build a career.",How to Become a Dog Groomer," Dog groomers don't just blissfully brush the fur of contented dogs and add pretty little bows; it is a physical, dirty, challenging, but often rewarding job. For a typical canine client, the job is likely to approximate the following steps:Determine the styling plan with the owner.
Place the dog on a table and examine it generally for skin problems or other health issues (see more on this in a later step, below).
Brush the dog's fur, clean its ears and perhaps eyes, and trim its nails.
Bathe the dog, and be prepared to deal with animals that may not enjoy the process.
Dry the dog's fur and brush it again.
Give the dog its haircut and style, with special care around the face, paws, and tail area.
Repeat with the next dog, and so on, all day. Expect to work evenings and weekends in order to meet clients' needs.;
, Yes, it seems unlikely that someone who has never bathed and groomed a dog before would choose to enter this field, but getting your hands dirty (literally) is a vital step in deciding whether this is the job for you.


As a prospective dog groomer, you probably own a dog or at least know someone who does. Try your hand at grooming. Visit How to Groom a Dog for more step-by-step instructions.
Don’t give up just because you end up soaking wet and your dog has an unintended half-mohawk, but do consider whether you have the patience and passion to do this task over and again with new dogs every day.

, If you want experience dealing with a wide variety of dogs, an animal shelter is an ideal choice. And most if not all shelters are in need of volunteers.


You may have the opportunity to bathe and groom dogs, which of course will be a good experience that can help you determine if you want to pursue this line of work.
Even without bathing and grooming, however, dealing with a diversity of dog breeds, from a wide variety of backgrounds, will give you a better sense of the day-to-day challenges and rewards of being a dog groomer.
Soak up advice and techniques on how to deal with aggressive, large, or sick dogs, or dogs with other unique challenges.

, This is when you can start getting some hands-on experience with the daily work life of a professional groomer.


Larger pet supply chains usually offer grooming services and regularly hire grooming assistants / bathers. In this job, you would do the general bathing work, while the trained groomer does the fine cleaning, trimming, and cutting.
Being a grooming assistant is far from glamorous and not particularly lucrative, but chain stores often choose promising assistants for training programs to become groomers.
Another alternative is to find a local groomer to serve as a mentor.You might start by volunteering or just observing in his/her shop, and perhaps move into a paid position. This may be the way to go if your ultimate goal is to open your own grooming business.

, Generally speaking, there are no schooling or licensing requirements to become a dog groomer, but having some formal training can only help when it is time to look for a job or open your own shop.


There are plenty of online programs available if there are no grooming schools in your area, but you may want to consider whether ones that advertise themselves as two-month programs with no hands-on requirements are worth your time and money.
You may want to seek a program with somewhere in the range of 400-650 program hours, including “hands-on” time; at least one teacher certified by a nationally-recognized body; and good hands-on / hands-off, student / instructor, and student / dog (practice groomings per day) ratios.Look for schools that provide clear breakdowns of their training programs, which include areas such as tool selection and usage, health and safety procedures, clipping techniques, and styling profiles for different breeds, among others., This should be part of your training program.


In the U.S., the American Kennel Clubis the primary organization that establishes standards for dog breeds and normal grooming profiles for each. Grooming profiles can change, so take it upon yourself to keep up-to-date.
Recently, hybrid or “designer dogs” (a cross of two purebred dogs, such as a Labradoodle), have become more popular.Owners of such dogs may have more interest in creative styling, but study accepted grooming profiles for common hybrids as well.

, No, dog groomers aren't veterinarians, but regular grooming is beneficial to canine health, so a good groomer should show concern for overall well-being. Practice checking for problems such as:Signs of injury or illness like swelling, cuts, thrush (a yeast infection of the mouth or other orifice), and parasites such as ticks.
Changes in temperament or activity level among regular canine customers, which can be a sign of injury or illness.
Indications of mistreatment or abuse. The owner may be paying the bill, but don't use that as an excuse to ignore the dog's well-being.

, While certification, like licensing or specialized training, is not generally required to become a dog groomer, you may want to look into your options and the possible advantages of completing a certification program.


For example, one the major certification groups, the National Dog Groomers Association of America, offers a variety of workshops and certification tests throughout the U.S.Certification from this organization permits you to call yourself a National Certified Master Groomer (NCMG), which may be beneficial in building a client base and making connections with others in the industry.
Whether you decide to become certified or not, going to grooming workshops is a good way to network with other groomers and keep up with new trends in the business.

, Dog groomers work in locations as small as a van and as large as a pet mega-store. They can be their own bosses and only employees or be one small cog in a large corporation.


Working in a pet superstore will reduce your business costs but likely offer less flexibility in setting your schedule and choosing your clients.
Working in a smaller pet grooming business, as proprietor, partner, or employee, may offer more flexibility but also the challenges of operating a business location.
Operating out of your home can reduce overhead costs, but might also limit your clientele. You’ll need to consider local local business regulations and permitting as well.
A mobile dog grooming service, run out of a van or trailer, offers mobility, flexibility, and lower operation costs, but has its own disadvantages (and possibly local business regulations) to deal with as well.
Income potential varies widely by hours worked, business type, and client base, but a general range is roughly $15,000 to $50,000 per year., Especially if you are opening your own dog grooming business, but even if you are working in a large pet center, building a loyal clientele will be essential to your success.


If interested in opening your own business, you may want to visit How to Start a Small Business and How to Open a Small Business for guidance and advice.
Get your name out there to potential clients any way you can, perhaps by handing out business cards at the dog park, putting up flyers (with permission) at local pet stores and vet offices, or decorating your grooming van with an eye-catching design.

, You already know how much most owners love their dogs, so do right by the canine and you’ll have the best chance of securing the loyalty of its human companion.


A good dog groomer needs to be firm but gentle in dealing with frightened or uncooperative animals; calming in demeanor to keep nervous dogs happy and compliant; patient and detail-oriented to do the job right every time; and have good communication skills with both canines and people.Be careful never to harm an animal, no matter how squirmy or uncooperative they are being. This is the quickest way to lose a client and perhaps your job.
Check generally for signs of injury or illness in a dog and recommend a vet visit if you suspect something is amiss. Most owners will appreciate your efforts and concern.
You also have to be strong enough to tell people that their dog is too matted to save the coat and you will have to shave it down, or that it's unsafe to groom their dog and they need to take it to a vet or be sedated to be groomed. Some people just won't want to accept it, will get angry with you, and sometimes won't do future business with you, but that is the nature of the business.
Have the courage to report suspected animal abuse as well. Put your compassion for the animal first.

, Quality work and care for human and dog client alike is the best avenue for lasting success as a dog groomer. Establish customer loyalty and good word-of-mouth as a groomer in the big pet center, and perhaps you can open your own shop someday.


Consider creative ways to build your business as well, for instance by offering specials and discounts (new customer, loyalty, 2-for-1, etc.); offering extras like spa treatments, accessorizing (bows, etc.), nail painting, or even teeth-cleaning; or selling canine health and beauty products.It's the same as with most businesses: make the customer feel very special, and you give yourself the best chance for building your business.

Check for lumps and bumps.",How to Check if Your Dog Is Healthy and Happy2," One of your duties as an owner is to groom your dog regularly. As well as keeping its coat in good condition and tangle free, grooming your dog is an ideal time to run a mini-physical exam at home. This will help you become more familiar with your healthy dog's body. If something changes in the state of your dog's body, then the chances are that you picked up on a problem early on.


When performing a physical it is best to follow a set inspection pattern so that you don't accidentally skip anything. Most vets have the routine where they start at the head and work backwards.

, Watch how the dog is standing or sitting. Does it look comfortable and relaxed, or does it have difficulty getting up or down? Watch the dog's breathing and count the number of breaths it takes a minute at rest. Normal is 20 - 30 a minute.At a regular room temperature, not in excessive heat when the dog is panting to cool off, its breathing should be unhurried and difficult to see. Exaggerated breathing movements, especially when the dog uses its stomach muscles to haul air in and out of its lungs is a sign of breathing difficulty and should be checked out.What about the dog's weight? Is it gaining or losing weight, and does this coincide with an increase or decrease in appetite. It is worth getting weight change checked out by your vet since it can be an important clue to ill health.
Is the dog alert, bright-eyed, and wagging its tail, or is it hanging its head and sluggish with its tail tucked between its legs?

, With your index finger and thumb, gently ease the eyelids apart. If its eyes are nice and clear and you can see your reflection in them, then its eyes are normal. Indications of ill health include yellowing (jaundice) of the whites of the eye, inflammation of the whites (could indicate an allergy or infection), and fogginess on the surface (an ulcer or possibly increased pressure within the eye).Check for discharges from the eye. A thick yellow or green discharge is an indication of infection.
Eyes are delicate structures and if you suspect a problem then seek veterinary attention. To ignore a serious problem could mean the dog losing his sight.

, Lift the dog's lip to see its teeth. Clean healthy teeth look much like our own (except a different shape) with pink gums and white enamel. Look for browny-yellow tartar deposits on the surface of the teeth, inflamed or bleeding gums (gingivitis), or a bad odor from the mouth. All these signs indicate dental attention is required., It is an old wives tale that a cold wet nose is a sign of good health. Many perfectly healthy dogs have warm dry noses, so don't panic if this is the case. Get to know what's normal for your dog's nose. Certain autoimmune skin problems can affect the nose so if the leather button of the nose is inflamed, crusty, or bleeding, then seek veterinary attention., Look inside its ears and compare one with the other. They should both look the same. You should see the entrance to the ear canal as a dark hole. The lining of the ear flap should look like regular skin and not be thickened, inflamed, reddened, or crusty. If you notice the latter, or if there is a discharge in the ear (ranging from thick black wax to smelly pus), then seek veterinary attention.Don't forget to smell your dog's ears! It should smell of nothing other than ""dog."" If there is an unpleasant smell, which makes you recoil, seek veterinary help.

, Check for flake-free fur that is glossy and smooth (in breeds that don't have wiry coats.) Part the fur to check the skin. There should be no greasy feel to the coat and no dandruff, black specks within the coat, inflamed skin, scabs, or skin discoloration. The latter all indicate skin disease and warrant fur investigation by a vet., It's easy to turn a blind eye to this area, but it is important to check since problems with infected anal glands or cancerous lumps around the anus, are best spotted early on. Be vigilant for a loss of symmetry to the anal ring (if one side is more swollen than the other), sinuses (channels) that are discharging or weeping fluid, or lumps standing proud of the skin., Make a point of checking that your male dog has testicles of an equal size. Enlargement on one side can be a sign of testicular cancer. Likewise, for female dogs, run your hand along both sides of the mammary area to check for any lumps. Any abnormalities need to be checked by a vet., Run your hand over your dog's body to check for lumps and bumps. It is advisable to get any lump checked out by your vet, for even some seemingly innocuous looking lumps have the potential to be something sinister.


If you are unsure if it's worth seeing the vet, then measure the size of the lump and write it down. Check the lump again a couple of weeks later and remeasure it. If the lump is changing rapidly, is inflamed, or bothering the dog then a vet check up is essential."

Towel dry first.,
Turn your dryer to the proper setting.,
Start by blow drying the hind area.,
Stay in motion.,
Use the “cool” button sparingly.,
Skim your hands through the fur.,
You will also want to use your free hand to guide long hair in the direction of the air flow.,
Leave their coat slightly damp.,
Comb and style.",How to Blow Dry a Dog2," After your dog is finished bathing, get a large dry towel and gently soak up the water. It is best to place the towel over your dog’s fur and then press and squeeze different sections of the fur to remove water from the surface and undercoat. Think of it almost like applying a fluffy squeegee to your dog.Avoid aggressively rubbing your dog with the towel as that will only create additional tangles in the fur.

, If the heat is adjustable, start at a warm setting and monitor your dog’s reaction. If needed, you can always turn it down to cool. For the speed, it is best to begin at a slow speed building up after a few seconds time. Again, this is dependent on how your dog reacts., Bursts of air to the face can startle even the calmest dog. Instead, aim your blow dryer toward the rear of your dog. This feeling is less scary and can almost resemble a relaxing massage, if done carefully and calmly., Make progress drying your dog from the hind quarters and moving up toward the neck and face area. Keep your dyer nozzle in constant motion so that you avoid concentrating hot or cool air in any one spot. Staying moving will also allow you to fluff up the fur, speeding up the drying process as well., If you use the cool setting, make sure that the room is reasonably warm. Otherwise you run the risk of giving your dog a cold as they sit in a chilly room getting cold air blown on them. The cool button is best used as quick measure against overheating., Start by moving your hands against the grain of the fur as this will help to expose the undercoat for drying. Keep one hand free to comb through the hair as the other one guides the nozzle. When you are almost finished drying do a quick once over with your hands combing with the grain to smooth down the fur.This is also a good time to keep a look out for any skin rashes or other problems that are visible with the undercoat pushed aside. Consult your veterinarian if you see anything concerning., This will prevent the hair from spinning around and creating heavy “whip knots.”, You are finished with the drying process when you can run your hand over your dog’s coat and only get slightly wet. If you continue to dry your dog then you will risk damaging the hair and making it brittle.Make sure to keep your dog indoors until they are fully dry. If they go outside, dirt will stick to their damp coat., After your dog is good and dry you can run through their coat with a thicker brush or a fine tooth comb. If you want a long, parted look it is best if you start right behind their nose and then comb your way backwards and along their spine. A quick spritz with conditioner will hold many styles in place, at least temporarily."

Get your dog used to the dryer.,
Monitor the temperature.,
Blow in short increments, if necessary.,
Provide ample treats and encouragement.,
Avoid the sensitive areas.",How to Blow Dry a Dog3," As with any potentially scary object, it is best if you introduce the dryer slowly. Lay the dryer on the ground (turned off) and let your dog approach it. Give him treats and praise after each inspection. After a while, turn the dryer on and face the nozzle away from your dog. Let him approach and inspect it once more, again following with treats., Any time that the dryer is on, make sure to keep an eye on the temperature. You want to be particularly concerned about the heat and any possible burns although the cold can prove uncomfortable as well. Too high of a temp can even cause overheating or a skin rash., With a skittish or anxious dog it may be best to draw out the drying process. Try to cover about 25% of the coat at a time before taking a quick break. Use these breaks as an opportunity to praise your dog. Keep going until the process is done. Over time, hopefully, you can cut out these short breaks entirely., From start to finish make sure to give out healthy treats to your dog to encourage their continued good behavior. Recognize that it may be difficult for them to stand still to be dried. Also, provide verbal and physical praise as well.You might say, “Good job!” Or, you could occasionally pat your dog’s head too.

, It is important to place your dog’s safety and comfort over your desire to dry them perfectly. Always hand or air dry the areas directly around your dog’s eyes, nose, and mouth. Shooting a stream of air into these area may be quite painful otherwise. It is best to also let the genitals air dry as well."

Brush your dog's coat regularly.,
Use de-shedding tools for heavy shedders.,
Give your dog regular baths.,
Control fleas.",How to Reduce Excessive Shedding in Dogs2," Grooming removes excess and loose fur and redistributes your dog's skin oils into its fur, helping it stay in place.Depending on your dog's fur type, you can use a bristle or slicker brush, or a rake.Bristle brushes are best for short-haired, smooth-coated dog breeds such as many terriers, Pugs, and Greyhounds. These brushes look similar to bristle brushes for human hair.
Slicker brushes are good for many dog breeds with medium or curly hair, including retrievers, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards. These brushes have tiny, tightly-packed short wire pins.
Rakes are best for dog breeds with long hair and thick undercoats, such as Collies, German Shepherds, and Chow Chows. When buying a rake, make sure its pins are roughly as long as your dog's fur to ensure that it adequately thins dead undercoats.

, Use de-shedding tools just prior to spring when dogs' winter coats begin to fall off, and again in the fall when winter coats begin growing in. Dogs who live indoors most or all of the time may shed year-round.For dogs with short coats, you can likely use a rubber curry comb to de-shed. Dogs with long or thick coats will probably require tools like an undercoat de-matting rake or shedding blade., Regular baths encourage loose hair to fall out in the tub (or outside) instead of on your furniture. However, over-bathing can cause dry skin, which causes fur to fall out. Research your dog's breed to learn about the suggested bathing schedule, or ask your veterinarian.


Blow-drying after a bath can be helpful if your dog has a long coat. Use only the lowest heat setting (or a cool setting, if there is one). Towel-dry your dog first, then use the blow dryer to help remove loose fur., Dogs with flea problems scratch incessantly, which causes hair to fall out. Keeping your dog free of fleas will prevent irritated skin, dandruff and excessive fur shedding."

Network with other groomers.,
Apply to work with other groomers.,
Join a salon or pet grooming business.,
Grow your client base and make relationships with your customers.",How to Become a Pet Groomer2," Networking with other groomers is a great way to build a professional and social network of people who share your vocational interests.


Connect with other dog groomers through social media groups or professional groups on the Internet.
Dog groomer groups can share helpful grooming tricks and share work stories, building a community in the process.
A professional network can provide you with references, refer you to salons that are looking for help, and share their clients., If there is a reputable and standout grooming service in your area, you could apply to work there.


Research different pet grooming services in your area and identify any businesses that you think you’d like to work at.
Make a list of places you’d like to apply and reach out to see if they have any openings for a dog groomer.
During the job application process, the employer will probably want to see your skills in action and ask you to groom a pet.

, Once you’ve successfully applied for a position with a pet grooming business, you are now ready to continue your career as a groomer.


Consider taking additional certification courses to continue your education.
If the salon offers special services for pets like massages, manicures, or hair dying, you can ask to be trained to complete these new services.

, Groomers typically make money off of commission if they’re working for a salon.


Growing your relationships with clients encourages them to continue returning to your salon and to you for their grooming needs.If your salon offers incentives for clients to make referrals, encourage your clients to refer their friends to you if they are happy with your services.

Determine your business structure.,
Advertise your business.,
Get sponsorships.",How to Become a Pet Groomer3," If you have decided to begin your own pet grooming business, you will need to determine what can you do to make your salon or mobile grooming center stand out from the other pet groomers in your area.


Brainstorm with creative friends and those who have started their own businesses. Having the insight of someone who has gone through the process of starting their own business can be a really helpful way to plan.
You could purchase or rent a retail space that you can begin your small business in.
You could groom from your home or you could offer a home visit service for your clients.
You could also start a mobile pet grooming service that would drive to different clients or clinics to perform grooming.

, Starting a business can be an expensive endeavor. You need to be able to cover your overhead costs and your startup costs when you open your business.


You should expect that you will not start making a profit for several months. Because of this, if you do not have enough money or investors in your business, you may not be able to open your business right now.
If you find investors that are willing to loan you money to begin your business, you will need to establish a repayment plan with them., A name should be memorable, simple, and easy for people to pronounce.


Check to see if anyone else is using the same name as yours in your area. You can either search the Internet or check a phone directory to see a list of businesses.

, If you decide that you’d prefer to rent a space to begin a pet grooming salon rather than operating out of a mobile vehicle or your home, you will need to secure a space.


Enlist the help of a real estate agent to help you identify good retail spaces for your type of business.
You will need to budget for rent and for any upfront payments, like a down payment or security deposit., Now that you have the basics for your business laid out, you will need to determine what sort of services you will do.


Research your competitors and look at their pricing. You want your pricing to be competitive, but you also want to be able to turn a profit.

, Owning and operating a business involves careful attention to your area's regulations, laws, and rules. As you launch your business, you will need to make sure that you have your legal and financial bases covered.Consider hiring an attorney or legal advisor to help you navigate the intricacies of business tax law and the legality of operating a business in your area.
If you are not well versed in tax law, you should consider hiring an accountant or tax professional to help you manage your finances.
You will most likely need to register your business with your local business board. If you are operating an at-home business, you may or may not have to register your business. This depends on your area.
If you do need to register your business, you have several structures to choose from. A sole proprietorship is the most basic business type, and creates a business where you are the sole owner and operator. If you have a business partner, there are several different types of partnerships that you can choose from., In order to have a successful business, you will need to advertise yourself and your services.Offer incentives for referrals or use coupons to attract new customers.
Make a social media profile and share photos of your work. Make sure to get the client’s permission to publish a photo of their dog.
Make a website that has a list of your services and pricing and your contact information. If you are working through a salon, they will probably already have a website established.
Put up fliers in areas where people bring their pets, like dog parks.

, Sponsorships can help you to grow your business as you become associated with other brands and organizations.


Ask veterinarians, pet clinics and hospitals, dog walkers, pet shops, essentially anyone else in the pet industry, if they would recommend your business to their clients. Offer to do the same for them.
The manufacturers of products like dog shampoo may offer you a contract to exclusively sell and use their products.

Look for a healthy crab.Crabs that do not come out of their shells when misted might be ill, and should not be purchased.,
Ensure the crab is housed properly.,
Think about alternatives to buying a hermit crab.,
Be sure you are ready for the commitment before buying.Hermit crabs are not toys, decorations, or temporary distractions.,
Do not buy a hermit crab from a pet store.Pet stores and beach souvenir shops care little about the health and happiness of their crabs, and cram them tightly together for shipment in conditions where the crabs cannot access food or water.,
Do not buy a crab with a painted shell.Crabs in painted shells have been forcibly removed from their natural shell and crammed into new shells that might not accommodate them properly.",How to Buy a Pet Hermit Crab1," Likewise, if you see tiny crab limbs scattered about a crab’s tank, do not purchase it. This is a sign that the crab is stressed and vulnerable to other illnesses.


Do not obtain crabs that have a musty smell. This indicates they are overheating.Crabs that are active and moving about, and do not exhibit any of the above negative qualities, are probably in good health.;
, Crabs should be housed in an environment where they can dig in the sand, move around, and hide. Do not buy crabs that are crammed in tiny individual cages where they cannot move.Ask what kind of water the crabs have access to. Crabs need both fresh water and salt water, and should have one bowl with each. Crabs that are in tanks with tap water, however, will be slowly poisoned over time.
Do not obtain crabs that are housed in tanks with flies and other bugs buzzing about.

, Buying a hermit crab only fuels the cruel hermit crab trade that profits from their capture and sale. Instead of buying a hermie, try adoption. The Hermit Crab Association (HCA) connects sanctuaries and crab rescue agencies with people who want to care for a hermit crab.You need not be an HCA member to adopt a crab, but you may need to pay a small fee for the adoption service.


Send an email to adoptions@hermitcrabassociation.com expressing your interest in adopting a hermit crab for more information.
In your email, include your location and how far you would be willing to travel to obtain your crab.

, They are living creatures with particular preferences and needs. Over the long term, they can also be expensive. You’ll need $300-$500 in setup costs alone, including a tank filter, companion crabs, and so on.


Hermies can live up to 40 years. Ask yourself if you’re willing to care for your crab that long.
Think carefully before purchasing a hermie for a child. Children tend to lose interest quickly in hermit crabs since they have a tendency to hide under their tank’s substrate for weeks at a time.

, Pet shops care only about getting the crabs to the store, no matter what condition they are in, since consumers are often not equipped to evaluate the health of a crab based on how it looks.

, This can cause the crab tremendous stress. Crabs in painted shells are also at risk for being poisoned if they eat paint chips from their painted shells. If the paint inside the shell didn’t dry properly before the crab was jammed into it, the crab might be trapped when the paint dries against it.

Be careful when removing hair around the anus.,
Reward your dog.,
Be patient.",How to Groom a Dog," You don't want to be looking for your tools once you begin grooming your dog. Make sure to have everything you need in one place before you begin the task at hand. Consult the ""Things You'll Need"" section below to find out what you'll need to groom your dog.;
, Simply brushing, as most literature instructs, is not enough for dogs that can mat up: the brush will easily pass over at angles that a comb will get stuck on. A thorough combing should always be the first step of the grooming process because any mats will become tighter and less manageable once they dry. Begin on the head and move down the body. Be careful under the belly, as it is a sensitive area, and don't forget to comb the tail.


While you are combing, if you find a tangle, use a brush and try to work out the tangle. Be mindful not to brush burn your dog from brushing for too long in the same spot.
You can brush short-haired dogs with simple tools like curry brushes or gloves.
Comb and brush medium- to long-coated dogs with more specialized tools like a steel comb, slicker, a pin brush, or an undercoat rake.
Whatever you use, it must remove loose hair and distribute oils from the skin throughout the coat.

, Reward calm, quiet behavior to encourage more of it. You may want to include a treat to reward the dog for good behavior.

, You don't want the dog to get overwhelmed; any negative associations can make grooming harder in the future. Make the experience fun by giving your pet breaks from time to time, giving praise, treats, pets, and even a little bit of play. This will also keep your dog distracted.


This is especially important with a puppy, which can be trained from a young age to tolerate this much handling well.

, Severe matting can pull the skin every time the dog moves, making daily life painful for your pet. If you can't brush a mat out, you need to either cut or shave it off, depending on how close it is to the skin. Be extremely careful if you use scissors to avoid injuring yourself or your pet. Try to cut parallel to the growth of the hair to avoid a choppy look.


If you don't think you can safely remove the mat without hurting your dog, take him to a professional groomer.
On occasion, mats can get so tight and close to the skin that bacterial infections occur underneath the mat. If you suspect an infection, take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible.
The visual symptoms of bacterial infection are redness and moisture, with pus secretion in advanced cases. You dog might chew or scratch at the area because it itches.

, White-haired breeds or those with large eyes that water a lot (Pekingese, Pugs, Pomeranians, etc.) may need more maintenance in this area than others. Depending on your particular dog, this step may be a simple matter of wiping or pulling eye debris away from the corners of the eyes. Long-haired or white-haired dogs may need special attention to make sure that all gunk is out of the coat, as they may get tear stains. You can buy products made for removing ""tear stains"" from a white coat at a pet supply store.


A healthy eye should be clear and should not show any signs of irritation or unusual discharge.
Don't try to trim hair away from the eyes yourself, as you might injure your pet. Ask your vet or groomer to do it for you.

, It's normal for a clean ear to have some wax in it, but there shouldn't be any particular smell to it. To clean your dog's ears, apply some ear cleaning solution (bought at a pet supply store) to a cotton round. Wipe dirt and wax away from the inner ear, but don't rub vigorously, as this might cause sores. Don't push too far into the ear, either. The groomers rule of thumb is to clean only what you can see.


Bring ear cleaning solution up to body temperature before putting it in the dog's ears. Place it in a body-temperature water bath, just as you would with a baby bottle.
When you're done wiping out the ear with a damp cotton ball or cloth, gently dry it out with a dry one.
Praise your dog! The ears are a sensitive part of the body, and he may need some comfort.

, Your dog needs medical attention if his ears look swollen, red, irritated, dark or blackened. Any discharge or sores, or a bad or yeast like smell should also prompt a call to the vet.


Excessive discharge, inflammation, one ear is much dirtier than the other, and odor are signs of an ear infection that need medication.

, Use dog toothpaste instead of human products, so you don't poison your dog with fluoride. If there is any chance that you may get bitten by your dog, do NOT attempt to brush your pet’s teeth. At any point, if the dog gets overwhelmed, give him a break to calm down.


Start by placing a small amount of dog toothpaste on your finger and spreading it across the teeth for a few seconds. Reward the dog for cooperating.
Once the dog lets you work your finger in his mouth for 20-30 seconds, you can graduate to gauze or finger toothbrushes from the pet store. Work your way up to a dog toothbrush.
No matter what, ease your dog into the process so that it can be a pleasant experience rather than a stressful one.

, If your dog already has a considerable buildup of tartar and plaque, a simple tooth-brushing won't be enough. Just like a human would, your dog needs a professional cleaning at the veterinarians. Another option is anesthesia-free teeth cleaning, which is available but typically not offered by veterinarians.


Look for red gums or brown material attached to the teeth — these are signs that a home tooth-brushing will be painful for your dog. Don't try to brush his teeth until he's seen a vet.

, To keep your dog's nails short, clip them regularly, depending on how fast his nails grow. If you can hear his nails on the ground when he walks, that means his nails are touching the ground, and are too long. Trim a very small amount of nail (1/16 inch) away with a pair of dog nail clippers. Human clippers are okay for a very young puppy or small dog. Guillotine style clippers are less effective than the scissor type. Also, use the appropriate size clippers for your dog.
If your dog has clear nails, you can see the pink part (The quick) where the blood vessel's located. Avoid cutting the pink part, trimming only the clear hard nail.
Take extra care with dark-nailed dogs not to clip to the quick (blood vessel). Go slowly, and only take a little bit off at a time. Dremeling is much safer and easier to avoid hitting the quick, as it shaves only a little bit at a time. Use a cordless pet-safe Dremel tool, as the corded ones will not stop turning if they catch hair.
If you cut too far and hit a blood vessel, apply styptic powder, cornstarch, or flour with a bit of pressure to stop any bleeding.

, You don't want to be running around looking for cleaning products with a wet dog in the tub, so have everything in one place before you start. You should also make sure that you're properly dressed in clothes you don't mind getting messy because you will get wet.At the very least, you will need: Dog shampoo
Treats
Several towels
Place one towel on the edge of the tub to keep water from splashing over the tub. The rest are for drying.

, You know from experience that the tub can get slippery once it gets soapy. To prevent your dog from slipping, place a towel or non-slip bath mat in the tub.

, Hot water can harm your dog's skin, especially if your dog is short haired. Avoid running water into the tub while the dog is in it, as it may cause unnecessary stress. You may have to spend some time desensitizing your dog to the sound of running water with the help of his favourite treats. Always go slowly to avoid overwhelming your pet and making things worse for both of you.


You can also fill a 5-gallon bucket with lukewarm water and mix a decent amount of shampoo in with it. Doing this will save you a step.

, Some dogs like to make a run for it during bath-time. If this describes your dog, buy a dog bath lead from the pet supply store. It's a leash that attaches to the shower's wall with a suction cup and keeps your dog in place during the bath.


Replace the dog's regular collar with one that will not stain the coat or suffer water damage.

, Make sure your dog's coat is completely wet before you start applying shampoo to it. If your dog isn't afraid, you can buy and use a hose and water pressurizer attachment for the faucet. This is especially helpful if you have a large dog or one with a double-coat. But, if your dog is afraid of the running water, use a glass or bucket to pour water from the tub over the dog instead. AVOID getting water in your dog's ears. Water in the ears can cause an infection. Please be sure to only spray water/rinse water up to the dog's neck. The head can be cleaned separately (see below for instructions).

, Begin at the neck and move downward toward the rear and legs, using your fingers to spread the shampoo and work it in down to the skin. Save the head for last, and don't use soap around the ears and eyes(unless you have tearless shampoo meant for dogs). Instead, use a wet towel or washcloth to clean the head.


Once the shampoo is applied, running a rake through a double-coated dog's coat will help to loosen it and better distribute the shampoo - just be careful not to rake one spot for too long.
Shampoos may be easier to apply and rinse off if diluted.

, As long as you see dirt or soap bubbles in the water coming off of an area, keep rinsing. You can use the same method you used to soak the dog's coat before shampooing. Remember not to use running water if your dog's afraid of the sound. Simply pour water over him with a cup to rinse the shampoo from his coat.

, Use a squeegee or use your hand as a squeegee to force water off of the coat and body. Towel dry him as best as you can while he's still in the tub, so you don't make a mess. Place the towel over your dog’s back, or hold it next to him and give permission to shake the water off their body. Many dogs will learn the “bath rules” and wait to shake until you have placed the towel over them to contain the water droplets. If your dog is short haired or you prefer to let your dog's coat dry naturally, you're done.


If you have a double coated or long-haired dog, you may need to blow the coat dry.

, If towel drying won't cut it, blow-drying can dry the coat without overheating or over-drying your dog. If you have a dog with especially long hair, you may need to dry the coat while brushing it.


Make sure that the blow dryer is on the cool setting! It may take longer than usual, but it's worth the time because there will be less of a chance your dog's hair and skin will dry out.
If your dog is afraid of the sound or sensation of the blow dryer, don't push him. Towel-dry him as best as possible and let him air dry somewhere he can't make a mess, like a laundry room.

, Many breeds have short hair and don't require regular clipping. However, if you have a shaggier breed of dog, he may require regular clipping as part of his health routine. Breeds that need regular coat trims include cocker spaniel, sheepdog, poodle, collie, Shih Tzu, Pekingese, and chow chow, among others., If you plan to clip your dog's hair, make sure to read the directions that came with the clippers. Get an information book or video, or consult with a groomer about the proper use of your clippers. Make sure that the clipper blades are sharp and the clippers well lubricated. If the blades are not sharp, they can pull on the hair.


Before clipping your dog, you should have an idea of the look you are trying to create. Read, ask questions and watch videos to get an idea of how to achieve the desired result.Then you may start.

, You don't want him moving around, so tie him up with a leash. During the clipping process, you can place your free hand under the dog's belly to encourage him to stay in place instead of fidgeting. If the dog is nervous, keep praising him in a calm voice or sing. Healthy treats are also good to have.

, A small investment up front will save you money down the road, since you won't have to pay professionals to groom your pet.


Make sure to use dog grooming blades that will give you the coat length you desire.
Scissors will likely not give you a nice, even coat, and you may hurt the dog with them if he moves suddenly. Grooming clippers are recommended over scissors.

, Brush against the direction of hair growth(back-brush) before running the clippers the other direction; with the direction or hair growth. Using the clippers against the growth of hair will have the same effect as back-brushing, but will leave a shorter length than the clipper blade that you are using. If you want to shave against the growth of hair, try a spot on the stomach and see if you like the length first. Move the clippers surely, but slowly across the dog's body to remove the hair — moving too fast might leave uneven lines. Always move the blade with the direction of the hairs' growth unless you want a shorter length than your blade claims to leave. Begin at the neck, then move down to the shoulders, under the ears, and toward the chin, throat, and chest areas. DO NOT use a size seven or any skip blades around the throat area or any spot on the body that can fit between the teeth, such as the Achilles' tendons, arm pits, genital area, tip of tail, or anus. Then, clip the dog's back and sides. Finally, clip the hair on the dog's legs.

, The anus can pop out, like a button, unexpectedly and be accidentally cut as a result- anticipate this action.


Be careful when clipping around the legs, tail and face. These areas can be sensitive.
Check the clippers frequently to make sure they don't get hot enough to hurt your dog’s skin. If you have a small dog with long hair, like a Maltese, consider spreading out the grooming throughout the week. Maybe trim the legs one day, the face the next, etc.
If the clipper blades do get hot, stop and let them cool and/or use a product like “Clipper Lube” spray on them. This product also strips the oils from the blades which will cause them to heat up faster, so it is better to have spare blades or just to wait.

, Standing still can be hard work! If he seems like he's getting overwhelmed by all this handling, give your dog a break every few minutes. Praise him throughout the process, and give treats during the break. Do not play with the dog where there is a chance for him to get dirty.

, You may have to go over your dog's coat a few times before you have a smooth, even cut. Don't rush it! Give your dog as many breaks as necessary, and make sure to move your clippers slowly.

Quarantine your hermit crab, if possible.If you’re introducing a new crab to another crab, or a whole population of other crabs, you should place it in a separate tank for a few weeks.,
Choose the right tank.When it comes to tanks, the bigger the better.,
Install a substrate.Crabs need a natural substrate to dig and hide in.,
Maintain your tank’s climate.",How to Buy a Pet Hermit Crab2," That way, if your crab has parasites or other illnesses, they won’t spread to your other crabs.


However, many hermie owners simply rinse their hermies in a quick freshwater bath and add them straight into the main crab population, since isolating a hermit crab in a quarantine tank can have negative effects on your crab’s health.
Weigh your options carefully before deciding to quarantine your crab.

, Since hermit crabs are very social creatures, you should have at least two or three small crabs together in a single tank. A population of this size will not be comfortable in anything less than a 10 gallon (37.9 L) glass aquarium.


If your crabs are immature, be sure to invest in a tank larger than 10 gallons (37.9 L), since the crabs will grow.
Hermit crabs are excellent climbers. Keep a mesh lid on your tank to prevent your hermies from climbing out. This will also prevent gnats, mites, and other bugs from getting in and hurting your crabs.

, Use all-purpose sand (the type you’d fill a child’s sandbox with) or coconut fiber. Fill the tank with substrate to a level two to four times higher than your largest crab.


For instance, if your tallest crab is three inches tall, your substrate should be six to twelve inches deep.
All-purpose sand is available at your local hardware store.
Coconut fiber might be available at some pet stores, but you can order it easily online.
If you wish, you can mix the sand and coconut fiber substrate together. Some hermie owners find that their crabs like this mixture best.
Always wet your substrate until it feels like the sand that has just had the tide wash over it. Use a plastic spray bottle to keep the substrate damp. Do not use dry substrate, as this won’t allow your crab to dig, and can dehydrate your crab.
Do not use wood chips, gravel, reptile sand, or special hermit crab sand. Additionally, do not use any kind of artificially dyed or chemically treated substrate.

, The tank should be at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).Install a thermometer in the tank so you can always quickly check what the tank’s temperature is. If you have a hard time keeping the tank hot enough, place it near a window or invest in an under-tank heater to keep your tank warm.


Additionally, the humidity should be at least 70%. Invest in a hygrometer to measure the tank’s humidity levels.
If you need to increase your tank’s humidity, just spray the substrate a few times with a water bottle. Check it after 30 minutes or so to see how the humidity level has adjusted. Spray again if necessary.
Many hygrometers also have built-in thermometers.
Under-tank heaters are available at most pet stores.

Feed your crab.,
Provide water.,
Provide a variety of shells for your hermit crab.As hermit crabs grow, they need to change shells.",How to Buy a Pet Hermit Crab3," Hermies eat almost anything. Dried shrimp, sardines, and seaweed are common hermit crab foods. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are also favored. Some human foods like cereal, oatmeal, or popcorn are acceptable, as well.Feed your hermies a variety of foods and see what they like best.


Do not feed your crab anything labeled “hermit crab food.” These pet store mixes do not have the adequate nutritional profile a healthy hermie needs.Other foods to avoid include garlic, onions, citrus fruits and peels, and anything with added sugars, chemicals, iodized salt, and preservatives.
Fresh food should be removed every day. Dry food should be removed as needed, but don’t leave it in the tank longer than four days. Food that is still in the tank after four days is probably just not palatable for your crabs.

, Hermit crabs need both freshwater and saltwater.Both types of water must be free of chlorine and chloramines. The temperature of the water should be approximately the same temperature as the temperature of the tank. When mixing saltwater, do not use salt mixes labeled for hermit crabs. Instead, use a non-iodized fish salt, and mix it according to the instructions on the package. Place the saltwater and freshwater in two separate bowls with the rims parallel to the topmost layer of substrate.


Distilled or bottled water are the best options for providing your crab with freshwater.
If necessary, invest in a dechlorinator. These are usually available at pet stores or home and garden stores.
The amount of water you need depends on how many crabs you have. A five to six cup bowl of each type of water should be adequate for two to three small crabs in a 10 gallon tank.

, Hermit crabs are always looking to trade up their current shell for one that is smoother on the inside, or one that is of a lighter weight. There are a wide variety of both natural and synthetic shells available. You can buy shells online and at pet stores.


If you obtain a synthetic shell, be sure it is not painted or treated with any chemicals.

, It's never going to work. Many girls like sweet boys that tell them they're pretty and comments like that. If you want to keep her, make her feel good about herself.

, You need to be willing to stop if she says ""no"" to going any further. Remember, it is within her rights to say ""no"" to anything from kissing to intercourse. You may feel really attracted to her and like it's no big deal but that's normal and caused by your pesky hormones. It is no excuse for forcing her into something she doesn't want to do.


It is equally true that boys do not have to go further than they wish, no matter what your partner or friends say. An intimate relationship is very special if it's with the right person but doing things before you're physically and emotionally ready or that go against your beliefs can be damaging. Don't forget that you only get one chance to do something for the first time! Once you've done something, the experience you have the first time will in your head every other time you do it - so try your best to make first experiences, good experiences.
Remember, certain sexual behavior, drinking alcohol or taking drugs may be illegal in your area under a certain age or for everyone. Don't get a criminal record that will hang around for your whole life for the sake of impressing a girl! Think about the future consequences for yourself and others. Your ability to get a job or buy something like a house or a car could be affected. These things may seem a long way off when you're tempted to take a risk doing something, make sure you'll never regret your actions.

, Some girls act like they love bad boys or feel pressured by popular culture that they should prefer bad Boys, but often, that girl you like, just wants someone who can listen to them, who understands them and who likes them for who they are, not for what they look like.

, Just because they talk or hangout doesn't mean she's into him. The likelihood of them just being friends is very high. She knows she's with you. If you do the same thing to her to get revenge, she'll keep going but she'll go further to wind you up. Keep calm and remember that you're the guy she has chosen to go out with. Trust her to respect that choice.

, She is now attracted to you, so don't be afraid to let loose and have fun.

You may also want stickers and different colored pens.





;
, Choose a good spot in your room (or anywhere you'll see it often) and hang it up. Use highlighters and pens to mark special dates, such as sporting events or when your English essay is due.


You may also want to highlight when your class periods start and end. This way you're never caught off guard.







, Depending on what type of planner you get, fill in your information accordingly. Make notes to yourself about homework, pep rallies, and other events you participate in.

, Stick them up on your bathroom mirror with homework reminders, TV show times, and anything else you need to remember! Don't limit yourself to just your bathroom mirror, stick them anywhere you'll see them. (Make sure this doesn't bother your parents and/or siblings.)

, Make sure that all your homework is finished within three hours before bedtime, if you can. The faster you finish your academics the faster the social aspects of your life can begin.

, If you have an after-school job, life is even more hectic for you. Make a few copies of your weekly schedule and keep one with you at all times.

Plan for your future.",How to Impress People if You Are Just a Kid," Depending on your relationship with a person, there are many ways you can show respect. In some cases, this might be by listening patiently when someone is speaking, even if you have something important you want to say. Some other ways you can show respect include:Taking care of borrowed possessions. When you borrow something and take good care of it, the person you borrowed it from will surely be appreciative.

Being polite. Always remember to say please and thank you, follow the rules, and practice good manners.
Cleaning up after yourself. If you don't clean up after yourself when you make a mess, someone else will have to. This can make people frustrated instead of impressed.;
, It's easy to forget a promise, like doing chores or finishing your homework. When you break a promise, it's like saying you don't value the person you made the promise with. To prevent yourself from forgetting, you may want to write down a list of things you've promised to do. When you've completed a promise, you can cross it off the list.In some situations, it may be inconvenient to write down your promises. In this case, you might want to pause what you're doing and take care of it while you remember. You can always continue what you were doing later, when your promise is complete.

, Everyone has strong feelings at some point, and these can lead you to do or say things that hurt others. When you notice you're feeling a strong emotion, like anger, sadness, or embarrassment, you'll need to be extra careful. The more you practice controlling your emotions, the better your control will become.When you feel emotional, ask yourself, ""Would I say or do this normally? If I say or do this, will I hurt someone?"" If the answer is yes, you may want to wait until you calm down before you do anything.

Taking deep, regular breaths can help you calm down.Breathe in slowly for five seconds, hold the breath for five seconds, and exhale the breath for five seconds. You may need to repeat this a few times, but after you should feel somewhat calmer.

, When you're a kid, you might feel awkward looking older people in the eye. It's only natural to be shy, but in many cultures, adults are expected to signal they are paying attention to each other with eye contact. Eye contact is a great way of forming a strong connection to others, which will only make you look more impressive.Try practicing maintaining eye contact by looking at yourself in the mirror. You can do this while you're brushing your teeth, or you can set a timer and practice eye contact by itself.
It may be difficult for you to make eye contact with strangers at first. You may want to start practicing with people you are comfortable with, like with teachers, family members, and close acquaintances.

, People often judge others on first impressions. By keeping your appearance clean and neat, you may impress others with how well you take care of yourself. You should remember to brush your teeth, comb or style your hair, wear clean cloths, and wash regularly.



Eating healthy is another way to take care of your appearance. Eating well will help you grow healthy and strong.

Regular exercise will build muscle and keep your body in good shape. This way you can impress people with your strength and endurance., When you do this, it shows others that you're thinking about them. If you see someone struggling with something, you might want to ask, ""Can I help you with that?"" Some people are embarrassed to ask for help and by offering you can save them from feeling self-conscious.


Helping others can also make you feel better about yourself. It might seem like a drag at the time, but offering a helping hand can lead you to feeling happier and more connected to people., Accurately using and understanding words will give people the impression that you are intelligent and thoughtful.You can improve your vocabulary through reading, playing word games like Scrabble and Boggle, and by looking up words you don't know in the dictionary.


You might want to carry a pen and pad of paper with you so you can write down words you hear that you don't know to look up later. If you have a cellphone, you can write yourself a note or send yourself a text so you don't forget to investigate words later.
It's easy to feel self-conscious when someone uses a word you don't know, but you shouldn't be afraid to ask questions. Asking someone you're speaking with what a word means is a quick, direct way of learning new words.

, Sometimes, people just want to be heard. Even if you don't agree with someone or don't completely understand what is being said, saying, ""I hear you,"" can be an impressive mark of maturity.You might want to explain yourself further when recognizing others' opinions. For example, you might say, ""I hear what you're saying, and I think you have a good point, but I disagree with you for these reasons...""

, This can be difficult for both kids and adults, but if you are able to take a step back and admit when you are wrong, other people will think you are mature. Finding out you're wrong about something also gives you a chance to change for the better, and telling people you were wrong may win you their admiration.If you find that you're having a difficult time admitting you're wrong, try positively coaching yourself through those feelings. You might tell yourself, ""It's OK to be wrong. People are wrong all the time. I made a mistake, it's no big deal.""

, When you're having a conversation, it's not uncommon to say something you don't mean.This can cause misunderstandings and arguments. When speaking, don't be afraid to take a second to collect your thoughts and choose the right words to express yourself.When the right word is on the tip of your tongue, you can ask others for help. You might say, ""I'm drawing a blank. The word I'm looking for starts with a 't.' Can you help me think of it?""
In some situations, there might not be a word that perfectly captures how you feel. When this happens, you might describe the feeling and follow up by asking, ""Have you ever felt that way?""

, Rushing a thought can make you look hasty in your thinking. When you think that you have a good idea, take a moment and consider your thoughts carefully. Ask yourself, ""Is this a good idea, or am I just excited about it?"" Ideas can be fun and exciting, but getting carried away can leave people unimpressed.


A good way for you to encourage yourself to take your time is by interrupting yourself. If you feel your thoughts racing, pause and slowly count to five. After that, you can reconsider what you were thinking about with a level head., Logic is like a chain of reasoning that leads to a conclusion. When your reasons support your idea or argument in a strong way, you're using logic. These reasons should naturally support your idea or argument without relying on special situations or evidence you can't back up.When judging the logic of your thoughts, ask yourself, ""Do my reasons lead directly to my conclusion?"" If yes, it's likely your logic is strong. If not, you may need to re-think things.
Try not to rely on other people's opinions to support the logic of your thoughts. Just because someone you respect said something doesn't mean it is correct., Careful, well-reasoned thinking should take shortcomings into account as well. If you think of flaws first, you'll have a chance to come up with counterexamples. A good counterexample explaining why a certain flaw is invalid can impress others with your thorough approach.

Sometimes you can spend too much time thinking about all the things that are wrong with your idea. Instead, you may want to come up with only two or three major flaws or arguments against. Try to resolve these with your idea.

, What you want to do for work and/or where you want to go to school are important questions that are difficult to answer. Having a plan and setting goals are good ways to amaze people with your preparation for the future. You don't need to think of everything, but a general outline may earn you respect from others. An example plan for your future might sound something like:""I really want to be an engineer, so I'm going to work hard in school and take plenty of math and science classes. I'm also thinking about joining the robotics club because that will look good on college applications. For school, I'm thinking about going to MIT, but it might be too expensive, so my backup is Georgia Tech.""

Notice unintended weight loss.One of the cardinal signs of chronic pancreatitis is unintended weight loss.,
Examine your stools.In chronic pancreatitis, stools tend to be abnormal, presenting either as diarrhea or as oily, fatty stools that may be pale or clay-colored.,
Watch for upper abdominal pain.One of the hallmarks of many cases of chronic pancreatitis is epigastric pain, which occurs in the upper abdomen.,
Tell your doctor about the sum total of your symptoms.,
Take note if you have a history of alcohol consumption.The number one risk factor for developing chronic pancreatitis is consuming large amounts of alcohol.,
Have a stool test.Because one of the cardinal signs of chronic pancreatitis is abnormal stools (in particular, stools that may be loose, oily, fatty, unusually odorous, and pale in color), a stool test can be very helpful in establishing and confirming the diagnosis.,
Opt for blood tests.Blood tests can be used to assess for elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are suggestive of damage to the pancreas.,
Receive medical imaging.A transabdominal ultrasound can aid in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis by allowing your doctor to get a visual image of the organs inside your abdomen, including your pancreas.,
Control your pain.,
Modify your diet.,
Take supplementary digestive enzymes.,
Treat concurrent diabetes.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Receive surgery to treat the underlying cause.Depending upon the underlying cause of your pancreatitis, you may be advised to receive surgery to improve your condition.",How to Differentiate Chronic Pancreatitis from Similar Conditions," This is because, in chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas is damaged and is thus unable to release the usual quantities of digestive enzymes. This makes it challenging to successfully digest and absorb food and leads to malnutrition and weight loss. Here are some ways to differentiate the weight loss of chronic pancreatitis from weight loss associated with other medical conditions:


Unintended weight loss is also one of the hallmark signs of cancer. The difference with cancer, however, is that it may be associated with other symptoms such as night sweats, shortness of breath, and/or pain in the affected area of the body. The weight loss of chronic pancreatitis is associated with abnormal stools, but rarely any other symptoms.
Unintended weight loss may also be experienced as a result of bowel disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease or Celiac disease. Both of these conditions lead to troubles with absorption through the gut, resulting in the weight loss. Celiac disease can be tested for by measuring tTG-IgA in the blood, and following up with a biopsy if the first test is positive.Inflammatory bowel disease can be tested for with blood tests for anemia (low red blood cells) and stool tests for blood in the stool, as well as a colonoscopy (a scope inserted in your colon) to examine the state of your bowel wall.People with cystic fibrosis may also have unintended weight loss, because cystic fibrosis leads to challenges with the pancreas that resemble those of chronic pancreatitis.Cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed with a sweat test.Cystic fibrosis may actually lead to the development of subsequent pancreatitis, as the two conditions are linked.;
, The stools are also sometimes foul smelling and difficult to flush. The stool abnormalities are again due to digestive problems, resulting from insufficient amounts of digestive enzymes released from a damaged pancreas. Other medical conditions that may present with abnormal stools include:


Other bowel diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, etc. These can be tested for with a combination of your medical history, blood tests, stool tests, and a possible colonoscopy.
Abnormal stools may also result from problems with the liver and/or gallbladder.These can be screened for with blood tests.

, This may radiate through to your back, and it may worsen in relationship to eating (particularly fatty foods) or drinking (particularly alcohol); however, although abdominal pain is present in the vast majority of cases of chronic pancreatitis, there are some people who present with no pain, which can make the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis a challenge. Other medical conditions that may present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain include:


Liver and/or biliary tract diseases, which can be screened for with blood tests.A muscular or soft tissue injury.
Other gastrointestinal or bowel diseases, which can be assess for with blood tests, stool tests, and possibly a colonoscopy.

, Note that, if you are experiencing all of the above symptoms that are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis (unintended weight loss, abnormal fatty stools, and upper abdominal pain, in addition to possible nausea and/or vomiting), chances are that you do in fact have pancreatitis (as opposed to another medical condition). This is because, while each symptom on its own is relatively non-specific (and may be caused by a number of medical problems), the constellation of all of them together paints the picture of likely pancreatitis.


Note, however, that you will need to proceed with a series of diagnostic tests and evaluations to confirm (or rule out) the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
It is not a diagnosis that can be made on the basis of symptoms alone; rather, symptoms are used to guide your doctor when they have reason to suspect that you may indeed have pancreatitis.

, If you have been a heavy drinker in your life (consuming multiple drinks daily for several years), this greatly increases the chance that the symptoms you are experiencing are the result of chronic pancreatitis (as opposed to another condition).

, Specifically, the stool test looks for elevated fat levels in the stool, which points doctors in the direction of a pancreatitis diagnosis.

, An IgG4 blood test can also aid in the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis; however, in general, blood tests are not especially useful in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis., A CT scan or MRI may also be useful, and/or an MRCP or ERCP where they insert a tube through your throat down to your pancreas to assess for potential blockages and/or signs of pancreatitis.


The specific imaging test that is best for you will vary on a case-by-case basis, and your physician will be able to guide you in terms of what specific tests to receive.

, Many people with chronic pancreatitis suffer from ongoing abdominal pain. The pain may be worse with eating and drinking, and it may be exacerbated by certain foods in the diet (such as fats). If you are struggling to get your abdominal pain under control, it may help to receive pain medications.You can opt for over-the-counter pain medications such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol). Adults can take 500 mg every four to six hours as needed. Another option is Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), adults can take 400 – 600 mg every four to six hours as needed.
Alternatively, if over-the-counter pain medications are insufficient, your doctor may offer you stronger prescription pain medications, such as narcotics (for example, Codeine or Morphine, depending on the strength of pain relief needed).
For episodes of extreme pain relating to pancreatitis, some people need to be temporarily hospitalized and given pain medications and fluids via an IV until their symptoms stabilize. If this occurs, people are generally advised not to eat food orally until they are feeling better; instead, calories can also be administered via the IV.

, If you have been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, it is wise to consult a nutritionist to help you create a meal plan that is high in nutrients and low in fat (as pancreatitis can lead to troubles digesting fats). Adhering to a specially designed meal plan can help your body to absorb the nutrients it needs so as to avoid (or minimize) malnutrition and unintentional weight loss that often accompany chronic pancreatitis.Try having five or six small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals. Space these meals out as evenly as possible.

, In chronic pancreatitis, the damage sustained to the pancreas over time results in a significantly decreased production of digestive enzymes. This is what leads to malabsorption and subsequent malnutrition, as your body is unable to absorb the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy weight gain and the summation of nutrients that your body needs to function optimally.Digestive enzymes need to be taken prior to every meal, in order to aid with the digestion of each specific meal.
They may also be helpful in treating the pain caused by pancreatitis.

, In addition to producing and releasing digestive enzymes, another job of the pancreas is to secrete insulin, which serves to regular your blood sugars. In chronic pancreatitis, damage to the pancreas may lead to insufficient insulin production, and resulting diabetes. If you have been diagnosed with concurrent diabetes (at the same time as your pancreatitis, which happens for many people), it is key that you receive insulin supplementation to keep your blood sugars in a normal range and to avoid the potential long-term complications of diabetes., Because alcohol consumption is one of the major risk factors (and potential causes) of chronic pancreatitis, it is key to limit (or ideally avoid) alcohol consumption if you have indeed been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Refraining from smoking can also help to manage your symptoms of pancreatitis, and to prevent them from getting worse., Indications to proceed with surgery include the following:


Gallstones — if a gallstone is causing a blockage leading to pancreatitis, this can be removed surgically.
A bile duct blockage — if a duct is blocked and this is the cause of your pancreatitis, the duct can be opened up and even expanded surgically to relieve the obstruction and alleviate your symptoms.
Significant fluid or inflammation in or around your pancreas — this can be cut out surgically to improve your condition.
More extensive surgery can be done in severe cases of pancreatitis, but the risks involved are higher.
Surgery is also used to to treat chronic pancreatitis that has been resistant to conservative medical treatment.
